            "content": "When Roman Holiday was in the planning stages William Wyler envisioned either Elizabeth Taylor or Jean Simmons in the role of the princess. When neither proved available, he and Paramount studios decided to do a Scarlett O'Hara type search for an unknown for the part. The film then would only have Gregory Peck as the star to draw the people in.But when Peck saw the screen test and also realized the film would rise and fall on the performance of the princess part, he insisted on top billing for Audrey Hepburn. Audrey had only done a few small bit parts in some English films up till then, however Peck insisted on the billing of her right after him with 'introducing Audrey Hepburn' as her title credit. In the same way that William Holden credited Barbara Stanwyck with helping him get through Golden Boy, Audrey Hepburn credited Gregory Peck with her performance in Roman Holiday. As well as William Wyler who still has a record of more people getting to the Oscar sweepstakes for his films than any other director.Roman Holiday is simple and delightful film about a young princess of some unnamed European country who gets tired of her programmed routine and wants a break from it. In Rome while on a European tour, princess Audrey fakes an illness and runs off for a day of fun.An American wire service reporter Gregory Peck finds her and realizes he's got an exclusive. So he chaperones her around without letting her know she's on to him. He even gets photographer Eddie Albert to help him out.Eddie Albert got the first of two nominations for Best Supporting Actor for Roman Holiday, the second one being The Goodbye Girl. He lost to Frank Sinatra for From Here to Eternity. Though Albert is funny in this film, for dramatic work I never understood why he was not nominated for Attack or for Captain Newman, MD.If you're thinking that the film is starting to bear a resemblance to a continental It Happened One Night you would be right. And if that's your thinking it will come as no surprise to learn that Frank Capra originally had the idea to film this. The property reverted to Paramount as part of his settlement to leave that studio after doing two Bing Crosby films.I wish Paramount had done Roman Holiday in color though. Darryl F. Zanuck over at 20th Century did Three Coins in the Fountain in gorgeous color and later on MGM did The Seven Hills of Rome also in color. Still the Roman locations really add a lot to Audrey's adventure.When Oscar time Audrey Hepburn in her first starring role and really first role of any consequence won an Oscar for Best Actress. Until the day she died Audrey Hepburn had charm enough for ten, you can't help but love her in anything she ever did. Even if the film she did was not that great, Audrey sparkles through.Even in black and white, the Eternal City with Audrey and Greg make anyone young at heart.",

            "content": "Audrey Hepburn burst onto the movie scene with this film, her first role. She plays an English Princess traveling in Rome who is bored with her official duties and the tight schedule she's on. One night after getting a tranquilizer to calm her from the stress of it all, she sneaks away into the streets of Rome. She's found by a newspaperman played by Gregory Peck, who takes her to his place to sleep it off. When he finds out who she really is, he realizes he's on top of a gold mine of a story, and enlists his photographer friend (Eddie Albert) to get candid shots of the two while they sightsee. Hepburn and Peck are such an attractive couple, and director William Wyler gets lots of beautiful shots of Rome, including the Trevi Fountain, Spanish Steps, Castel Sant'Angelo, and of course the classic scene they have at the Bocca della Verit\u00e0. It all makes for a very romantic film. Hepburn played her part perfectly, expressing frustration and joy with such economy, as well as the restraint that comes from being a royal. Among several others, the scene with her getting her hair cut short is captivating, and it's no wonder that she won an Oscar for her performance. Peck's performance is also excellent, and Eddie Albert pulls off the part of a young rogue quite well despite being 47 at the time. I won't spoil the ending, except to say it's touching and poignant, and so perfectly shot in the Palazzo Colonna. At the end of the day this is 'just a romantic comedy', with its share of silliness, but it's so mature and magical, and with these stars in this setting, it stands head and shoulders above so many others.",

Also it is one of Audrey's(who I've been a fan of since Charade) best roles too.STORY Roman Holiday has a very charming story. A charming and romantic love story between the beautiful Princess Anne and a reporter during an unofficial visit to the Eternal City. It is well paced and never loses momentum, and also has endearing action.SETTING One of my favourite assets of Roman Holiday. The settings are absolutely exquisite, with Rome the epitome of postwar chic(same with Hepburn and the motor scooters). Equally the cinematography and costumes are just as lavish.MUSIC A beautiful, gentle score. No wonder, as it is in courtesy of Georges Auric, the composer who penned the beautiful score for the stunning La Belle et La Bete.DIRECTION I only have one word for William Wyler's direction, immaculate.SCRIPT Roman Holiday has a perfect balance of humour and grace with dialogue that sparkles like bubbles on top of a champagne glass, while thanks to screenwriter Dalton Trumbo deals with issues of personal freedom close to the heart.ACTING Nothing to complain about here! Audrey Hepburn epitomises beauty, style and grace as Princess Anne, her final moments are so moving, while Gregory Peck is also marvellous as the dashing reporter Anne falls in love with. The supporting performances also go without fault.Overall, sublime and a film to really treasure. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

Princess Ann (Hepburn) escapes the confines of her rarefied royal existence for a day, to be rescued by a reporter, Joe Bradley (Gregory Peck).Bradley senses a scoop and seeks to inveigle the Princess into a story. However, this is a fairy tale, of the Princess and the commoner. Love blossoms, the beautiful Princess experiencing everyday things we might take for granted with a delight we cannot know. Sitting at a roadside caf\u00e9, getting a haircut, enjoying an ice cream, dancing on a riverboat. She soaks in these experiences in the company of her handsome saviour, not realising his intentions.It's beautifully done. Hepburn is radiant, refined, beautiful, enchanting - things she went on to display in many movies. However, she was at her most perfect here, as the beautiful Princess needing love and wanting happiness. Peck is an ideal foil. Tall, dark, and handsome, his only thought being the scoop placed before him, his ambition wilting in the face of his developing love for a Princess he can't hope to attain. Both are ably supported by Eddie Albert as Irving Radovich, Bradley's photographer colleague. Indeed, Albert is involved in many of the funniest scenes.It's a fairy tale, beautifully told. William Wyler makes the most of his location, showing us Rome in all it's splendour. The perfect backdrop to the perfect fairy tale.However, this film belongs to Audrey Hepburn. She shines and dazzles, brightening nearly two hours of every viewers life. How could you hope for more than that.",

            "content": "I recently caught this little gem of a film on a retro program and it was a trip well worth it. William Wyler was a genius directing throughout his film career. Here he's in top form.The only way this film could have been conceived was with the charming presence of Audrey Hepburn in her first appearance on a Hollywood film. She is without a doubt, an angel who was sent to this earth to delight the movie audiences in whatever movie she happened to dignify with her appearance in.Some people have compared Audrey Tatou with the incomparable Audrey Hepburn. Seeing Ms Hepburn in Roman Holiday will certainly change the minds of those comparing fans. Audrey Hepburn was a star's star! She exudes charm, intelligence, elegance, and beauty. Just one look from her could disarm Gregory Peck forever.The only wrong note of this production was the way the writer, Dalton Trumbo, was treated since he had been blacklisted by the anti-communist faction lead by Sen. McCarthy and company. In the end, Mr. Trumbo was vindicated in having his name recognized as the writer of Roman Holiday.This film is a feast to the eyes in that glorious cinematography and Rome as a background. This was Hollywood at its best. Gregory Peck and Audrey Hepburn will be forever young any time we take a look at this classic that I'm sure will live and charm its viewers whenever they take a chance to see it for the first time, or like some of us, for another loving look.",

            "content": "With a very nice blend of fantasy and reality, and two very likable stars, \"Roman Holiday\" is both entertaining and thoughtful.  Sometimes it is very funny, and at other times it makes you feel a great sympathy and warmth towards the characters.  Audrey Hepburn and Gregory Peck are ideal in the leading roles, and the story is very clever in getting a lot of mileage out of a simple idea without pushing things too far, which makes it quite effective.The idea of Princess Ann (Audrey) slipping away unnoticed and unrecognized for a day of fun and freedom from responsibility is of course fanciful, but it works for a lot of reasons, not the least of which is Peck's role as a pragmatic newsman.  He is a good balance for Hepburn's charm and energy, remaining calm and logical without ever becoming cold or distant.  You feel as if you could spend a lot more than a couple of hours in their company. And how could you improve on Eddie Albert's performance as Peck's photographer friend?  The movie also adds in the atmosphere of Rome itself, with some creative scenes that make good use of the setting.There are many fine moments in a story that at times seems almost like a daydream, and then it brings the characters back to reality in a moving way. It's not an easy combination to pull off, but here it all fits together very well, to make the kind of classic worth remembering, and one which you can watch and enjoy more than once.",

            "content": "After Trumbo we decided to watch one of the films of which Dalton Trumbo wrote the screenplay for. Roman Holiday is a 1953 American romantic comedy directed and produced by William Wyler. It stars Gregory Peck as a reporter and Audrey Hepburn as a royal princess out to see Rome on her own. Hepburn won an Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance; the screenplay and costume design also won. It was written by John Dighton and Dalton Trumbo, though with Trumbo on the Hollywood blacklist, he did not receive a credit; instead, Ian McLellan Hunter fronted for him. Trumbo's credit was reinstated when the film was released on DVD in 2003. On December 19, 2011, full credit for Trumbo's work was restored.The DVD sat on my shelf for the longest time and I am so glad I took it out to watch. The screenplay is subtle, filled with nuances that Hepburn and Peck teased them out beautifully. I can hardly detect an air of pretension and emotional manipulation. This is as romantic as it gets between a princess and an everyday man. The ending in the big hall really hits the spot. So much is left unsaid but yet what is said speaks volumes. It never betrays the tone of what the film sets out to be but yet my heart was beating with the full desire of wanting to see the relationship go a certain more familiar way.

            "content": "Enchanting is the word that comes to mind to describe \"Roman Holiday\". It's got that escape from reality wonder about it that might be envied even by royalty. Audrey Hepburn is luminous in her first American film appearance, allowing the viewer to believe that she really could pull off the disappearing act for twenty fours hours for the purpose of living life on a 'fun schedule'.I was impressed by how much mileage Princess Ann got out of that five thousand lira note; could one really buy sandals, a haircut and a cone of gelato all for less than a dollar and a half in 1953? That would have made Joe Bradley's (Gregory Peck) five thousand dollar payday close to a king's ransom, or at least a princess's. Bradley's put into a predicament when Ann comments on his sacrifice to spend the day showing her around Rome; she describes it as 'completely unselfish'. By that time, one gets the idea that just maybe he'll wind up doing the right thing.Slow to pick up on Bradley's non verbals, photographer Irving Radovich (Eddie Albert) bears the brunt of Joe's spilled drinks and takes a pratfall or two. Sadly, one of his remarks to Joe brought to mind the unending scrutiny suffered in real life by Princess Diana - \"She's fair game Joe, it's always open season on princesses.\" Odd how art imitating life, in this case predicting it, could end in such tragedy.It was heartwarming then to see how Joe and Irving turned their back on a story, and instead opted to reaffirm humanity. The finale is both uplifting and bittersweet, echoing one of Gregory Peck's lines to Hepburn earlier in the story - \"Life isn't always what one likes, is it?\"",

Miss Thompson said about Audrey Hepburn \"she has no bite\" Implying that Miss Hepburn wasn't much of an actress. Well, I don't know what she was talking about or perhaps she doesn't either. To see \"Roman Holiday\" again in 2017 was a moving and wonderful experience. Audrey Hepburn's performance is as fresh and enchanting as I remembered. Perhaps even more. So I arrived to the conclusion that Miss Thompson is talking about a different kind of acting. When a performance travels in time with the same power, decade after decade, for me that's great film acting. In \"Roman Holiday\" she took me with her and convinced me, heart and mind, that she was that princess and I loved her. William Wyler, the wonderful director, knew what he was doing - he always did. By introducing us to Audrey Hepburn he reinforced and reinvigorated his own prodigious legacy. I love Emma Thompson as an actress but she's totally wrong about Audrey Hepburn.",

            "content": "What can be said about William Wyler's evergreen comedy that has not been said before? Suffice to state that it never loses its luster, even though it is over sixty years since its original release.Every element of the film seems perfectly shaped, from the memorable Hollywood debut of Audrey Hepburn, to the nuanced support offered by Gregory Peck; a witty script by John Dighton and Ian McLellan Hunter, based on a story by the then-blacklisted Dalton Trumbo; beautiful black-and-white photography of a Rome that no longer exists by Henri Alakan and Frank F. Planer; and taut direction by Wyler that gives plenty of opportunities for the actors to flourish while retaining the mystique of the Eternal City as a place where romance can occur, however briefly.The film has memorable nuanced moments, from the opening sequence where the Princess (Hepburn) undergoes an apparently endless series of presentations, while trying to stretch her feet under her voluminous dress; the sequence where she wears pajamas for the first time and falls asleep in Peck's bed during a chaste night away from the palace; the sequence taking place in the sidewalk caf\u00e9 where Peck keeps telling his witless sidekick Nathan (Eddie Albert) to shut up about the Princess's true identity; and the memorable moment at the Bocca della Verita (aka the Mouth of Truth), where Peck puts his hand in and brings it out abruptly, scaring the living daylights out of the Princess as he does so.Nothing actually happens during the Princess's night away from her royal duties; her virtue remains intact, and she has a merry time dodging the Carabinieri and her Secret Service officers, in a comic fight sequence taking place near the Castel Saint'Angelo, which culminates in Peck and herself diving into the river and swimming to safety. ROMAN HOLIDAY conjures up a world that simply does not exist today of comic Italians waving their arms about expressively, of obliging cab-drivers and locals selling everything on the street from water- melons, flowers, and other junk. In these days of mass tourism commercial interests have taken over, and Rome's innocence - as well as a lot of its allure - has been lost in the process. Nonetheless we can enjoy a nostalgic wallow in the past through this film.",

He recognises her as the missing Princess and plans to scoop a major interview for his syndicate, with the help of pal Eddie Albert and his hidden camera.Hepburn is an absolute joy, particularly when her hair is shorn down to the classic urchin cut and she takes a motorcycle ride.  Peck, too, is served well by this kind of role, and the romance of the city of Rome helps their relationship to develop during their 24 hours of freedom.  Roman Holiday is one of those rarities which are truly perfect and memorable, a real girly flick with beautiful photography and a sparkling script.

Hepburn was always beguiling, but in some of her later roles she tended to overplay the winsomeness. Here every note she hits is just about perfect.And speaking of notes, pay special attention to the score by the great Georges Auric. If the film had been produced in the manner of modern romantic comedies, the sound track would have been larded with pop hits by Perry Como, Dinah Shore, and Frankie Laine, which would have done an awful lot to destroy the magic. Instead Auric's complex, vibrant, evocative music complements the story's inherent lyricism without upstaging it. In an era of bombastic film scoring, this seems a miracle.Someone once said that Audrey Hepburn's was the beauty of possibility and transformation -- she was always in motion, always becoming something else. \"Roman Holiday\" is very much of a piece with that notion. On the surface, the film is about a princess who disguises herself as a \"commoner\". But in truth she's actually pretending to be a princess, at least at first. She finally becomes authentic -- is transformed and prepared to deal with her destiny -- only through the ennobling power of love and sacrifice. That's one heck of a mythic subtext and does a lot to explain \"Roman Holiday's\" enduring power.",

Too be very frank I was not really looking forward to watching this movie. Like most people of this generation I dislike black and white movies.Man was I wrong. I have never seen a movie, which had so much romance, comedy and emotional drama. It would be fair to say that magic was created in this movie. The plot I guess everyone knows, a young princes tired of her regulated life runs away and hooks up with a reporter (Gregory Peck) for a day of fun in Rome. The reporter lies to her that he is a businessman and she lies to him about her true identity. They both have fun visiting Rome's historic places. But the reporter has a hidden agenda. He wants to write a story on the princess's escapades in Rome and enlists the help of his photographer friend (Albert). Things work according to plan for the reporter until he finds that he is really starting to fall in love with the princess.The story line may appear to be simple but take my word for it that Gregory Peck and Audrey Hepburn create magic and the movie will take a hold over you like nothing else you have ever seen. This is Audrey's best movie and the only movie she got an Oscar for and she was never so charming, innocent and beautiful as she is in this movie.One of the reviewers has suggested that Cary Grant would have been ideal for the role that Gregory Peck plays. I only have to say this to the devotees of Cary Grant that he would never have worked as a romantic lead in this movie. He was 50 years old at the time this movie was made and the sight of him cavorting around with a girl half his age would have removed from the movie it's romantic element. It would have become perhaps a slightly funnier movie but without the heart wrenching almost magical hold it now has. Also it is my humble opinion after seeing Charade that Cary Grant is too suave to play the role of a struggling reporter convincingly.History has already spoken; this movie is regarded as one of the all time greats, why would we want to change something, which is already perfect. Gregory Peck is ideal for the role of the reporter, he is incredibly handsome in the movie, a kind of man a young girl could fall in love with even after being with him only for a few hours. In this movie, Gregory Peck acts his heart out, especially at the end and he has a wonderfully chemistry with Audrey, which is the reason this movie still seems so fresh and charming even after 50 years.This is one of those rare movies that works across cultural and national borders. I was surprised to learn that according to a poll in Japan even after so many years Roman Holiday still is the number one foreign movie of all time.This movie is simply the best.",

            "content": "William Wyler's 'Roman Holiday' is a sparkling gem. Even though it's a black and white movie, it's a splendid treat to the eyes. The cinematography gives Rome a wonderfully spacious feel (in spite of its crowdedness). Then there's the pleasant score which is used minimally but still manages to bring out the liveliness. Rome is presented romantically but it's not overdone and the film cleverly avoids clich\u00e9s. Thankfully, Dalton Trumbo (who had been blacklisted) is finally credited as a writer.Gregory Peck and Audrey Hepburn sizzle together in this romantic adventure. Hepburn in her first Hollywood studio movie is a complete delight to watch as she displays her natural charm and innocence with grace. Peck makes a surprising turn in his first romantic comedy and delivers a great performance while sharing a warm chemistry with Hepburn. In a supporting role, Eddie Albert is hilarious as Joe's friend.'Roman Holiday' is an example of romantic comedy at its best. I loved how the ending was unconventional and quiet (not your typical ending of a rom-com) where the actors' silence speak volumes. This gem has got more than all the ingredients that make a film of this genre successful because not only was it a hit, it's a classic.",

Hepburn and Peck are fantastic in this movie. Call it old time charm or just sheer charisma, but they're a joy together and the whole day spent in Rome flies by on wings. Gregory Peck famously campaigned to give Hepburn an equal billing, which played at least a small part in getting her an Academy Award for this role. And I can see why. She is grace, naivety and poise incarnate in this film. What a fantastic character.And then there's the ending, the like of which you simply couldn't pull off in modern cinema. It's almost melancholic and sad, but also thoughtful and world-wise. It's not a happy perfect ending, but it's the perfect ending for this film.This is the best romantic comedy I've ever seen. Countless movies like it are made even today. Usual with pink posters and glittery titles, if you allow me to exaggerate a little bit.

Peck, not recognizing her, takes her to his shabby apartment and dumps her unceremoniously onto his couch. Next morning, realizing that he's got a seriously major story on his hands, he enlists the help of his friend, photographer Eddie Albert, and together they take Princess Audrey on a one-day tour of the delights of Rome, ranging from a modern haircut to a comic fist fight on the barges at San Angelo. Inevitably, Hepburn and Peck fall for each other, and at midnight she returns to her embassy and her duties. Peck and Albert agree not to publish the story and meet her for the last time at a public appearance, during which they reveal all to her. Hepburn returns to royalty and Peck and Albert go back to being broke, roustabout newsmen.It's an extremely amusing story and, in the end, a sweetly romantic one too. The heart has its reasons which the wallet will never know.One of the things that makes it so successful is the presence of the elegant and stunningly beautiful young Audrey Hepburn. Not just the delicately feline features of her face but her slender and sinewy, ballet-trained figure. Paul Desmond, Dave Brubeck's wildly popular alto saxophonist at the time of this release, claimed that during his more melodic solo passages he used as inspiration the image of Audrey Hepburn entering the room and walking towards him. And, who knows? He could have been telling the truth. No one has ever been more princessly than Audrey Hepburn in this film. She seemed to age rather quickly, from late adolescence here to middle age ten years later, but remained fragile and good natured. Her later years, before an early death, were devoted to helping children in third-world countries though the auspices of the UN. Taken, all in all, not a bad life.Peck was never a notable comedian, however funny the vehicle, but he's at his best here. The script gives him a chance to register his growing guilt as Hepburn places more of her trust in him and finally comes to love him. His conversion at the end is believable, although he never bothers to explain it to his partner Eddie Albert. He doesn't have to. Men don't talk that way.It could never happen in real life, however, which is what keeps the story in fairy tale territory. Most ambitious, penniless young men, confronted with Hepburn, her love and her wealth, would immediately sling her over their shoulders and run off to Pago Pago.If you miss this, you're missing a well-constructed film, a big commercial hit at the time that garnered a couple of deserved Academy Awards.",

There are probably only one or two other films that achieve anything near the same effect: one of them is Shadowlands, the other the Remains of the Day: Hopkins is lead in both, but they also share an era, the 40s and the 50s, a time when one buried emotion and placed duty above personal desire.

            "content": "Roman Holiday (1953): Starring Audrey Hepburn, Gregory Peck, Eddie Albert, Hartley Power, Hancourt Williams, Margaret Rawlings, Paolo Carlini, Tullio Carminati, Claudio Ermelli, Paola Borboni, John Horne, Henz Hindrich, Alfredo Rizzo, Laura Solari...Director William Wyler, Screenplay Ian McLellan Hunter.Director William Wyler's 1953 \"Roman Holiday\" was yet another triumph for him as director, it was the film that launched the career of Audrey Hepburn, and a thoroughly well-made and touching romance straight out of the early 50's so beloved by the public it won the Oscar for Best Picture. William Wyler had previously directed great stars before this film. In 1938, he directed \"Jezebel\" which starred Bette Davis in a role that she credited as her first great performance and gained her notoriety as a star, earning her an Oscar. In 1949, Wyler directed Olivia De Havilland in \"The Heiress\" for which she also won an Oscar. For a star to work with William Wyler meant success one way or another. Audrey Hepburn walked away with the Oscar for Best Actress (quite an accomplishment when you consider she had'nt made any American films) and William Wyler for Director. In Roman Holiday, Audrey Hepburn plays the beautiful and sensitive European princess Anne, who, tired of living a repressive public life and seeking to escape from its dull and stifling facade, runs away during a European tour, becoming familiar with the city of Rome on her own. The public press is totally unaware she has decided to quit the last leg of the tour and instead the press deceive the public by stating she's suffered a mysterious illness. She meets Joe Bradley, a photographer for a paper that specializes in celebrity news (like the Hollywood Reporter or People Magazine today). Together, they roam the city of Rome and fall in love with the city and with themselves. Ann looks at the world with new eyes and finds herself doing things she had never been allowed to do before - getting a bold new short haircut, eating ice cream and she is genuinely enthralled by the Eternal City. Joe has an ulterior motive. He is photographing her adventure in Rome and hopes to make good money off it but as they spend time together, they fall in love and he has a change of heart, opting not to expose the Princess. In its own way, this film, much like Sunset Boulevard criticized the movie industry, this film criticized the paparazzi and Hollywood press industry. It's not long before her royal connections catch up with Ann and she is forced to return to the public life. Joe returns the photos to her during a Farewell Speech at an Embassy, the last time they see each other. That long, final overhead shot of Gregory Peck leaving the Baroque interior of the building is priceless and one of the few great endings that year. It was also the first of its kind for a romantic comedy, which usually ended in happiness for the lovers. Gregory Peck was by this time an established star but the film was never about him, because this is the first great film Audrey Hepburn made in the US and she would only move on to bigger and better things. The cinematography is absolutely exquisite, expressing the new innovations in camera work as the decade of the 50's began. 1953 would see other great and modern films, including director Zinnerman's \"From Here To Eternity\". \"Roman Holiday\" also packed a powerful punch because that year ('53) was the year that Princess Margaret, sister to England's Queen Elizabeth II, went public about her relationship with the \"commoner\" Peter Townsend. Many people believed Princess Anne is either consciously or unconsciously based on the real life Princess Margaret. And the ending, which does not result in the lovers' happiness, mirrored Margaret's real life tragic romance. Filmed on location in Rome, we get nothing but gorgeous shots of the Trevi Fountain, the Spanish Steps, the Castel San Angelo and other monuments, but never in a such a hurried or showy way. Instead each scene flows to the next as Ann and Joe journey from one tourist spot to the other. Audrey Hepburn and Gregory Peck have strong chemistry and carry the film themselves. For me, this is Hepburn's best work with a leading actor, despite all the critical acclaim she received for later films with Humphrey Bogart/William Holden (Sabrina) and with Cary Grant (Charade). There is something truly moving about the unhappy princess who finds one fleeting slice of happiness in her life, a moment in her life when she learned to live freely and to experience the world on her own without owing anything to the future. Being the early 50's, we don't see Peck and Hepburn making love and we see them only kiss once but their feelings for each other are quite evident in subtle ways. This is an American movie classic and should be in every good classic film lover's collection.",

            "content": "Spoilers herein.We all have different solvents with which we are able to assimilate the world into our beings. With film, most people take it as intended, as the engineers desire. Its in my own makeup to experience the wonder of the creative process in the project. Sometimes the content of the film acknowledges that creative juice in something I call folding. Rarely do I come across a project where the attraction of the engineered effect is as strong as the wonder about what happens behind the curtain. This film does that.Here's the amazing thing: the script was written, the project turned on, the director, lead actor and location selected. The STYLE of the film was designed, after the fashion of `The Bicycle Thief,' which exploits the innocent face in a then shockingly natural urban context. All of this was engineered for someone who could exploit the material with a childlike attitude in a graceful adult body. All this was done to prepare for Audrey Hepburn before they even knew she existed! So there are several types of magic here.One type of magic is that she was able to inhabit the role. This can only be done naturally. There isn't much acting involved if you consider acting to be the craft of Streep, Moore, Blanchett. The DVD has some footage from the original screen test, where the camera surreptitiously filmed her after the test. She's precisely the same. The best part of this picture, the soul of it, is her natural reaction to the `eaten hand' trick.\nBut the other type of magic is even more impressive: that the film industry - including technicians on both sides of the Atlantic - would all know exactly what type of film personality needed to be invented.My interest is `folding:' that's often where the contents of the movie say something about the way it is made. This business of truth or `acting' is a matter of folding; compared to Peck Hepburn isn't acting. Compared to Joe, Anna's lies are trivial. The business about leaving a `stage' and `going urban' is folded as well, and that depends on the most common notion in this kind of folding: that the guy is writing a `story' about what you see (usually of course a girl).Audrey would of course become a princess of sorts, at least the diplomatic sort we see here. After her holiday with movies, she became (for a longer period) an important icon of UNICEF.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 4: Worth watching.",

During her stay in Rome, she becomes sick of her routine and sneaks out of her hotel - unfortunately while under the influence of a sedative. Ne'er-do-well American journalist Joe Bradley (Gregory Peck) accidentally comes across Ann and after realizing who she is, enlists photographer buddy Irving Radovich (Eddie Albert) to give her a tour of Rome while covertly creating a big news story around her. Exploring Rome and avoiding detection from the police, Ann and Joe fall for each other - but both are forced to face up to their respective duties in the end.The charms of \"Roman Holiday\" have been described a million times over, and undoubtedly better than I possibly could. The leads are utterly charming and lovable, the Roman scenery is gorgeous, the story is a wonderfully enjoyable fantasy, the humor is slight and unsophisticated yet remains charming and funny. For sheer enjoyment, it's hard to find a better film, which proves arguably the greatest romantic comedy of all time.The film largely succeeds on the petite shoulders of Audrey Hepburn, only 23 when this film came out. Having appeared in bit roles in a number of British films (check out her walk-on in \"The Lavender Hill Mob\" with Alec Guinness and Stanley Holloway) and as the star of the Broadway show \"Gigi\", Hepburn was on the verge of stardom already. But this film catapulted her over the top, and Hepburn immediately became one of Hollywood's most recognizable and popular icons - a superstar of the type rarely seen today.Audrey Hepburn is simply adorable as Princess Ann, the spoiled, sheltered European princess who wants to enjoy the simple pleasures of life - having a gellato, attending a dance, getting a haircut, riding a Vespa through the streets of Rome. Audrey has a perfect combination of innocence, beauty and insouciance in this role; she seems like a petulant child, but is so lovable and sweet it's impossible to hold it against her. And certainly, by the end of the film, Ann comes to realize the importance of her role as a Princess. The scene where Ann stands up to her scolding minders shows a much stronger and deeper character than we could have guessed from her early scenes.Audrey Hepburn's status as an icon, of fashion, class, grace, beauty, and humanitarianism cannot be overstated. Audrey is a timeless symbol of femininity who is much more relate-able to the average girl than, say, Marilyn Monroe or Sophia Loren. Millions of girls worldwide aspire to be Audrey Hepburn, because she made being a slim, small, shy girl - qualities usually frowned upon in Hollywood and the media - something desirable. Marilyn might be more overtly sexual, but Audrey's screen persona is a believable \"real woman\" with relate-able personality and desires. She may not be the most versatile actress in Hollywood history, but she was one of the most honest and lovable. And here, in her first major film role, Audrey showcases why.Gregory Peck is also charming. I'm not inordinately fond of Peck, who even is best roles comes across as a bit stiff, but he is perfect for this role. Joe Bradley is convincing in all of his guises: a lovable, self-serving rogue, Anna's learned protector, and the honest, love-stricken man unwilling to betray the girl he loves. It's one of Peck's best roles, and he pulls it off beautifully.Eddie Albert as Peck's photographer buddy, Hartley Power as his flustered boss, and Margaret Rawlngs as Anna's stern minder turn in effective supporting performances which add to the film as well.\"Roman Holiday\" is just a classic film. Its status as an icon of cinema is well-deserved, and only the most bitter, mean-spirited cynic could possibly dislike it.9/10",

Rome is about as stunning as any place on earth, and as the pair moves through the city, love blossoms. We get to see all those places we've heard about and they are put in the most romantic of contexts. Peck is such a gentleman. He doesn't have that sarcastic wolfishness of Cary Grant (his contemporary whom I also think is great). His is a softer edge and it makes it more heartbreaking. Who knows? Maybe? One of those classics for a rainy day.",

Not only that, but would you believe I have seen 1300 movies, and I have never seen an Audrey Hepburn movie? Crazy, I know. But I figured if I'm going to start, why not with her Oscar winning role? Roman Holiday is a simple, yet nevertheless, entertaining romantic comedy that I'm sure you'll get a smile out of. It's just beautifully done and makes you feel very good.Anya is a princess, so used to her busy and hectic scheduled life, she's actually now getting very sick of it. She wants to have one day where she could just be a normal person, while touring Italy, she breaks down one night about her hectic life, her doctor gives her some sleep medication, but she sneaks out before it kicks in to go for a night on the town. But Mr. Bradley, a journalist, finds her asleep on a bench, and offers her a night in his little cheap apartment, but when he finds out who she is, he takes this opportunity to get a real story for a lot of money, not revealing his true identity to her and vise versa with her, but he shows her the day of her life time and they fall for each other. Only one problem, Anya knows that she must soon return to her life of scheduled hectic life.Roman Holiday is a beautifully made film that I'm sure anyone could enjoy. It's one of those films that is just impossible to not like, Audrey and Greg had great chemistry and I just miss these old romantic films, they have such a magical charm to them. I would highly recommend Roman Holiday, it's a film that truly captures a day of making wishes come true with someone that you care about.8/10",

            "content": "I originally watched this maybe about 25 years ago when I was living with a couple of aunts and a young adult piano prodigy in Jacksonville, FL. We all enjoyed it very much but didn't talk too much about it. So now I just watched it again on Amazon Prime Video with Mom here in Baton Rouge, LA, and we laughed at the right places and made some complimentary comments during certain scenes. In her American film debut, Audrey Hepburn is quite luminous, natural, funny, and quite dramatic when the story and her character calls for it. She's a princess wanting to take a brake from her formally scheduled life so she sneaks out from her Rome vacation palace to find what's outside of her bubble. During her medically-induced existence, she accidentally meets a stranger played by Gregory Peck who is later revealed to be a reporter stuck in Italy. Eddie Albert also appears as a photographer friend of Peck. I'll just now say this was very entertaining from start to finish. Ms. Hepburn deserved her Oscar as did Edith Head for her costume design as well as the original story which at the time was credited to Ian McLellan Hunter who fronted for the blacklisted Dalton Trumbo. He was eventually properly credited a few decades later and his widow excepted the award in 1993. Oh, and Eddie Albert also deserved his Best Supporting Actor nomination. Anyway, that's a high recommendation from Mom and me for Roman Holiday.",

            "content": "In a beautifully restored print, this fairy tale movie provides a most enchanting introduction to the then-24 year old actress thanks mainly to director William Wyler's expert direction and Dalton Trumbo's sweetly observant script. In hindsight, it is a modest performance compared to Hepburn's later work, but Wyler knew enough to let her natural breeding serve its purpose in conveying the carriage of a princess. The approach works wonderfully, as she is perfectly believable as a royal who experiences her first glimpse into the world outside her hermetically sealed world. One can see her star rising most precipitously throughout this film, even in scenes as seemingly minor as the one where she sits on the Spanish Steps breathlessly describing her perfect day. Nonetheless, the revelation here is really Gregory Peck, handsome and stalwart as always but in this movie, quite relaxed with a surprising light comedy touch. It is actually his Joe Bradley that goes through the dramatic character arc from opportunistic reporter to smitten commoner that makes the ending so bittersweet.Even though this film is hardly mentioned in the same breath as his other classics like \"Wuthering Heights\" or \"The Best Years of Our Lives\", Wyler's humanistic touch is everywhere - from the comic haircutting scene with the smitten barber to the famous Mouth of Truth scene where Peck pretends to lose his hand to the concluding press conference, which turns into a dance of acting nuance and unspoken feelings. This DVD has some nice extras, including an excellent documentary on the production itself (watch for Hepburn's first Hollywood screen test) and other short films on the film's restoration process and Edith Head's contribution to movie costuming. A lovely reminder of what great stars Hepburn and Peck were during Hollywood's golden age.",

            "content": "Roman Holiday (1953)Gregory Peck's calm, dignified way of having fun and Audrey Hepburn's girl-like joy for simple things in life made a perfect combination in this William Wyler film, now famous for introducing Hepburn to the world. The location shooting sometimes leans toward travelog stuff, but rarely, and always with these two very likable stars holding it up. And when it's pure romance, both hinted at and then blossoming, a little, it's great. And Rome looks and feels great, of course. Even when the scenes turn to slapstick, as during the night dance on the boats beneath all those nice Bernini statues (on the bridge), you are reminded how beautiful and romantic the city is. If you go to Rome now, many of these scenes (most of them, even) are rather the same. The streets are more crowded with newer cars, but the monuments, and the light, and the feel of the place isn't so different, not in the large view. The one more serious thread here is whether a girl in Hepburn's position should feel free to feel free. That is, can a member of the royalty really do what she or he wants sometimes, or all the time? I've heard some people really think she has to be true to her role, that she isn't free at all, but has an obligation to fulfill her station in life. And others say that everyone should have the right to choose their own destiny, even if it means disrespecting the powers that be. This all relates to how you might take the end of the movie, because all the lighthearted joy and giddy tip of a romance get very serious.",

            "content": "What a delightful captivating classic, this movie is! Without spoiling the movie directed by William Wyler, too much, based on what's seen; it really did seem like screenwriter, Dalton Trumbo really did hate the tradition fairy tale. Why? It's because, he felt that stories like that, were preventing women from experiencing & understanding the real world. So, he wrote real-world, Cinderella-like story in reverse with powerful people wanting the more simple-common life. Shot entirely on location in Rome, Italy, the film follows the story of a loyal duty regimented, sheltered, princess, Ann (Audrey Hepburn), abandoning her duties for 24/7 for a chance to check out the city, with a not-so-mild-mannered reporter Joe Bradley (Gregory Peck), while hiding under a student-like alias from those, looking for her. While, on the surface level, it seems that this concept is unique & ground-breaking; but if you peel back, the nostalgia goggles & see the movie's script as it is. The story from Trumbo isn't anything new. Theater productions have been using the concept of royal incognito as a source of comedy, since the days of Mark Twain, William Shakespeare, and even Ancient Greek. Don't get me wrong, Trumbo is a fine screenwriter; and seeing him, deny work, due to the Hollywood blacklist of the 1950s, was a shame, but I don't find, this story to be one of his greatest work. Even the original script set in America with the English princess didn't stand out. It was mediocre enough to sit on the shelf for years, until Paramount Pictures greenlight the project, in order to capitalize on recent real-life event where, Princess Margaret of United Kingdom had a belief relationship with commoner, Peter Townsend. The preproduction was horrible for Trumbo, as it came with lot of rewrites, as the original director, Frank Capra back out, with Wyler coming in, with a demand to set the film, overseas, with Paramount choosing Italy, as the location, due to assets being frozen, there. Added to that pressure, is the fact that the British Government didn't want any mention of their government in the film. Because of the rewrites, Trumbo had to use his friend, Ian McLellan Hunter, as a straw man, in order to meet the demand, while also keeping himself out of the radar from the House Un-American Activities Committee. Due to the pressures, the new script seem delivered in a rushed, yet messy matter. It had a lot of setbacks: mostly when it comes to Ann's true motives for her want for individual freedom. It doesn't make sense for her character to want to trade in, her demanding job as a royal ambassador for a life as a domestic wife. It comes across as very jarring & awkward. Look, I know, it's the standards of 1950s, to pressure young women to get marry, ASAP; but wouldn't the movie work, better, if she wanted to live life without any sense of limitative and boundaries!? You know, to be single, for a while! This movie could had really spark women's interest, more, if it took a more liberation approach. Another thing, wrong about this movie is the climax. Don't get me wrong, I like the bittersweet subliminal nature of it, but I never got how class difference would have prevented either from carrying their relationship further. It's not like she was the highest position in her country's government, nor did it seem, like her country was in the middle of a crisis. Even so, she could had abdicated, if she wanted to. It's not uncommon. So why the unhappy ending!? It seem a little forced. Films like 1927's silent film 'Student Prince of Heidelberg' & 1996's 'The Lion King' did the coming to age-royal concept return, better. In short, it should had, the 1934's screwball comedy, \"It Happen One Night' style of an ending. Regardless of that, the film does beautifully hints at the power of memory (symbolized by the photographs Irving gives to the princess), of past experiences to continually affect one's life. I just wish, the movie could had been in color; rather than black & white to make that message, even more powerful. Nevertheless, the film made great use of the locations, even with budget cuts. Sites like the Mouth of Truth & Trevi Fountain are little more iconic now, because of this film. Even, products like the Vespa scooter got a surge in popularity after the film was released. It's all thanks to the skillful, distinguished, professional and eminent work from Wyler & his location crew. Not only that, but studio works, like the music by composers, Georges Auric & Victor Young were also great. Very memorable; but what takes the cake, is the acting performances. While, Peck sounds an overbearing depress father with thundering voice at times; due to his recent separation from his first wife. He was fine for the film, but a part of me, really wanted, Wyler's original choice, Cary Grant in the role. He was a bit questionable as the romantic lead. Nevertheless, it's Aubrey Hepburn who really shines. Thank goodness, Wyler pick her over Elizabeth Taylor for this role. I would hate to see the Princess portray as a spoiled heiress. The fact that Hepburn was basically an unknown actress, whom done small films, before this, heightened the story's plot. Her child-like naivet\u00e9 and unvarnished innocent-like appearance, really match well with Peck, despite the huge age different. Peck was so satisfy with Hepburn's performance that he suggested Wyler that she get equal billing; which was almost unheard-of gesture for women in Hollywood, at the time. As for Hepburn's Oscar win for Best Actress. It's up in the air, as personally I found the other performances from the other ladies, a little more captivating. Nevertheless, I was really surprise, how many Academy Award nominations, this film got. 3 wins out of ten nominations is pretty damn good. Overall: 'Roman Holiday' remains an unabashed classic for good reasons. It's a must watch. So check it out!",

            "content": "One of the qualities I most admire in a movie is its ability to positively challenge my expectations, and expectations I had many regarding William Wyler's \"Roman Holiday\". So, when the curtain was closed, I thought it was a beautiful experience and another viewing elevated it so high above my preconceived notions of romantic comedies that it could be one of the best movies to embrace that genre. Indeed, \"Roman Holiday\" should be worthy of any movie lover's admiration for its impeccable combination of acting, writing, directing and also costume designing. Seriously, when you have William Wyler, Gregory Peck, Audrey Hepburn, Eddie Albert, Dalton Trumbo and Edith Head\u0085 and let's not forget Roma, the millennial city as the backdrop, you can't fail even if you were asked to.But let's give credit to the real, and regal, pillar of the film: Miss Audrey Hepburn. This is the movie that made her an instant star in Hollywood's map, and you can see the novelty in the context of 1953. At a time where Monroe, Kelly or Russell defined beauty canons, came the tall, slender, long-necked and delicate gamin-like Audrey Hepburn. But she was more than a look, she was a smile, an attitude, a voice, a sensitivity, she was so many things wrapped up in one person that there was no doubt, regardless of the film's reception, that she would become a star and win the Oscar. Peck who got the top billing suggested her name to be put above the title, less by altruism than realism. And as the opening credits mention, the film is introducing Audrey Hepburn, and how fitting that the first frames where she graced the silver screen show her smiling and waving at cheerful crowds. It's Princess Ann saluting her European hosts and she does exude this royal composure and classiness, with a little hint of ennui in her eyes, getting more and more perceptible as the fatigue increases. Hepburn keeps on smiling and saluting as if it befitted her glorious entrance in Hollywood by both suggesting her beauty and her vulnerability. Later, the film finds the right balance between drama and comedy, to emphasize the very distance Ann fantasizes about over her royal duties.During the official night, while Ann is saluting all the dignitaries and ambassadors, there's a delicate close-up on her foot she delicately take off the shoe and scratch her ankle with it, then comes the infamous moment where she can't put it back. The symbolism is as strong as the small foot-fetish it induces; it is is a kind of reverse Cinderella-like story about a melancholic princess who wants to have a shot at anonymity. And when she's listening to her chambermaid mechanically reciting the day's schedule, her sudden hysteria startled me, physically. It was impossible not to share her pain, this is not just the Disney princess who wants to discover the world, this is a real existential malaise, she's given sleeping pills but we know this is no remedy.Princess Ann, moved by her remaining forces (and some childishly adventurous spirit), leaves the hotel. She crosses the path of Joe Bradley, a tall and handsome journalist played by Gregory Peck, gentleman enough not to leave the drugged princess lying on Roma's streets. He takes her to his apartment, gives her his pajama and they sleep without anything happening. It's all in the day after when he realizes he's got the Princess in his hands and one hell of a scoop, the opportunity to have an exclusive interview. What theb happens is a staple of romantic comedy: both lie about their identities, and the funny paparazzi sidekick, played by Eddie Albert, follows them during the trip, taking pictures of Ann with a lighter hiding a miniature camera. The premise sounds mean-spirited and we wait for the quarrel over the lies, but \"Roman Holiday\" doesn't try to be a rip-off of \"It Happened One Night\", the story finds its own rhythm and pace. Wyler insists in its opening credits that the film was shot in location but that's a useless disclaimer, we can tell this is not some matte paint or Hollywood studio locations, we have the local colors and Roman streets' flavor and Hepburn's reactions are as authentic as the locations. Ann wanders through Roma, cuts her hair, visits the streets with Joe, have some 'gelati' and an unforgettable motorcycle trip. The enthusiasm of Hepburn is always catching and Peck is so genuinely charming that the chemistry is believable, especially when he does the hand prank.\"Roman Holiday\" has pioneered the 'geographical' romance but it's for its conclusion that the film got me. After the climactic kiss, the film takes a turn no one can see coming, it's like something changing in Ann's attitude, for the first time she decides it's time to get back where she belongs, and for the first time, Joe lets her go. When she comes back, she looks naturally authoritarian, she politely dismisses everyone and she's ready to be a Princess again. The day after, she and Joe meet during the press conference and exchange a few tender looks. When asked if Roma is the greatest town she visited, she starts with a conventional answer but then opens her heart, one last time, and through her tribute to the city, indirectly gives a poignant farewell to Joe. It's all in the unspoken.I was surprised by how mature and adult the script was, kudos for Wyler for having given the job to then-blacklisted scriptwriter Trumbo who wrote a terrific story\u0085 that ending showed that the film was more than a benign romance or a trip across Roma, it was a wonderful coming-of-age story\u0085 in a way, she became a Princess again, but it took the Roman Holiday. In a way, it's still a Cinderella story, like her next film \"Sabrina\" would be... in a way, Audrey Hepburn is THE real life Cinderella.",

This fifty (50) years collector's edition on DVD was released in Brazil a couple of months ago. I have never watched this movie before and I am amazed: what a splendid story! This movie is the debut of Audrey Hepburn on the screen. What an outstanding actress she was! She could be fragile in a moment and great and noble (without arrogance) in the other. \"Sabrina\" is a good example of how easy she could perform any role. The great direction of the fantastic Wylliam Wyler is marvelous as usual. This director, as well as Frank Capra and Billy Wilder, knew how to explore and present on the screen the elegant and almost naive behavior of the society in the 50's. Imagine in the present days the malice and malevolence that the viewers would say about, for example, Joe brings home a beautiful girl like Ann. In 1953, this sympathetic action would be acceptable. Irving is the authentic paparazzo. However, this expression was created only after Fellini's \"La Dolce Vita\" (1960), with the character of Walter Santesso. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): \"A Princesa e o Plebeu\" (\"The Princess and the Plebeian\")",

And personally, I prefer to remember the recently deceased Eddie Albert for his role in this movie (he plays Joe's friend) and not for that awful \"Green Acres\"; and I of course will remember him for his environmental activism.But let's not get sidetracked. \"Roman Holiday\" is a beautiful movie, just like Audrey Hepburn was a beautiful woman. This is what classics are all about.",

            "content": "William Wyler's \"Roman Holiday\" is one of the very best, most charming fantasy/romantic comedies ever made. It is sweet, funny, simple, beautiful, and tender. It takes place in the eternal city of Rome during 24 hours that its heroine as well as every movie lover in the world will cherish for as long as they live. The heroine is a young princess, the sole heiress to the throne of an unnamed European country. One evening while visiting Rome, she decides to take a holiday from her royal duties and stiffing life style and explore Rome as one of commoners on her own. She is accompanied by an American newsman, Joe Bradley (Gregory Peck) and his cameraman and sidekick, Irving Radovich (Eddie Albert).Everything and everyone is perfect and highly enjoyable in \"Roman Holiday\". Wyler's idea to direct the film entirely in Rome proved to be extremely successful. The script by Dalton Trumbo is terrific. Peck as a handsome journalist who seems to hit a jack pot with the story about a runaway princess that can make him both famous and rich but whose plans collapsed when he fell in love with her was perfect for a role. So was Eddie Albert in his Oscar nominated performance.The film belongs to Audrey Hepburn. With her blend of innocence, vulnerability, inner strength, and real class, she was perfectly cast in her first Hollywood role that brought her the Oscar. Hepburn was the daughter of a Dutch Aristocrat mother and a British father. She spent the WWII years starving and hiding from Nazis in occupied Holland. The article from the time of \"Roman Holiday\"s release describes Audrey as an original, \"A thin child-woman with irregular teeth, wide jawbone, flaring nostrils and upswept brows, yet she carries herself with ethereal grace and entrances with a smile both wistful and radiant, and has remarkably large and expressive eyes.\" Gregory Peck predicted from the very first day of shooting that Hepburn would win Academy Award for her performance and she'd become a huge star. She went to many screen successes including \"Sabrina\", \"Breakfast at Tiffany\", Charade, and \"My Fair Lady\" among others. Her death from cancer in 1992 at the age of 63 left a gap that will never be filled. There will never be another Audrey Hepburn but the final scene of her first film with the close-up of her marvelous face and that \"wistful and radiant smile\" will live forever as one of the cinema's most precious images.",

She then meets an American reporter,Joe,who realizes he has the story of a lifetime before him and the two set out on a sort of holiday in Rome. However, somewhere along the line love gets in the way and complicates the situation for the two.But reporters and princesses dont mingle and both must return to their respective lives with this ending their Roman Holiday.The picture is a distat remake of the 1934 Best Picture winner directed by Frank Capra It Happened One Night starring Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert.\nBut unlike It Happened One Night, Roman Holiday decides to have more 'negative' ending as Peck's character poignantly walk out of the palace. It was an excellent decision for the endingRoman Holiday is a film I refer to as a genre breaker. A movie that audiences might watch 50 movies of its type and dislike and yet they strangely enjoy this one. I suppose that's the mark of a well made film but either way, Roman Holiday is such a movie.\nIt might come as no surprise considering that it was written by Dalton Trumbo and directed by William Wyler. A true proffesional,who might not be the sort of director taught in film school but he's one of the finest of 'Hollywood's Golden Age'.So whether or not you are a fan of romantic comedies watch Roman Holiday.",

The cinematography that shows the definite sight of Rome not only adds the athetic point to the movie, but also helps enjoy the story more, such as Gregory Peck and Audrey Hepburn's scooter tour scene. Also, a bit emotional ending proves that it's not one of the cheezy happy Hollywood romantic comedies. I also liked music, which is brisk but not shallow.  However, the most enjoyable fact about this movie is Audrey Hepburn.  One moment, she is a ultra sophiscated princess and the next moment, she is a cute, adorable girl next door.  Hepburn acts each roles so naturally and superbly that she shines over Gregory Peck.  I can't imagine this movie without other actresses beside her.  With Jennifer Love Hewitt?  Yuk!!  Today, there are many other actresses who act innocent and cute, such as Sandra Block and Mag Ryan, but noone does it better than Audrey Hepburn.  Audience has to love Audrey Hepburn after the movie is over but they wouldn't have a sexual desire towards her.  Rather, they would want to hold her hand and walk on the street listen to her chat.  Other actors were realistic and great as well. I would've loved this movie even more if it was shot in color because I'm dying to know what color of dress Hepburn is wearing.",

After seeing this, I thought I would have to qualify that statement, but the fact is Garland would still have a slight edge even if Audrey Hepburn had been a few years younger.Hepburn does such a fine job here of being the sophisticated princess, but it is as the 'normal' teen that she really shines, at least for me. She is so adorable when she says she would love to be like other girls, and when she is found by Joe Bradley, who thinks she has been drinking.And Hepburn is so funny and so adorable in her scenes with Gregory Peck. Peck also delivers a very good performance as the less than confident reporter Bradley. There are plenty of other good performances here, including Eddie Albert as Bradley's photographer friend Irving. I have to say, though, I didn't see Albert's performance as Oscar caliber. I liked him a lot better as the high-powered lawyer trying to make it as a farmer.I saw 'To Kill a Mockingbird' a few years ago and thought Peck was great in that. I would like to see more of his work.I've seen only a few Audrey Hepburn movies. 'My Fair Lady' was great. I wasn't that impressed with 'Breakfast at Tiffany's', though Hepburn was adorable in that one. I want to see more.",

            "content": "Trivia Question: How many times was the Best Actress Oscar awarded to an actress whose last name was \"Hepburn\"?Answer: Five times. Four times to Katherine Hepburn (MORNING GLORY, GUESS WHO'S COMING TO DINNER, THE LION IN WINTER, and ON GOLDEN POND), and one for Audrey Hepburn (ROMAN HOLIDAY). It's hard to think of the two Hepburns together (they never did appear together on film), but their is a similarity in their first Oscar films (in Audrey's case her only Oscar). Kate Hepburn had only made a few films before MORNING GLORY, where she played a naive actress determined to make it on Broadway. Audrey Hepburn made only a handful of films in bit parts (most notably as Alec Guiness's girlfriend in an early moment of THE LAVENDER HILL MOB) before she played Princess Anya, the runaway royal heiress who runs away from her diplomatic duties in a panic. Both are trying (in their Oscar roles) to come to terms between their careers and the real world. But the similarity goes only so far: Kate's character fully embraces the glitz of Broadway success without realizing that her career may not always be so successful (as C. Aubrey Smith tries to tell her). Audrey finds a degree of backbone when she runs away and falls for a reporter (Gregory Peck), and when she resumes her post from a sense of duty she does so on her own terms.ROMAN HOLIDAY was based on a story that was originally written by Dalton Trumbo, but was fronted by another writer who won the Oscar for the story (eventually Trumbo's widow got the Oscar in 1997). It has been suggested (I am not sure how truthful this is) that the real life story of the romance between Princess Margaret Rose of Great Britain and the war hero Group Captain Peter Townshend. It made big headlines in the early 1950s, as the Royal Family and Prime Minister Churchill scotched the romance (it was too reminiscent of the 1936 abdication crisis of Edward VIII and Wallis Simpson, although Margaret Rose was not the immediate heir to the throne). If there is any truth to the connection, then the film's story gives Princess Anya a degree of personal success that was somewhat denied real-life Princess Margaret).Anya has been making a good will trip through Europe, visiting one major country after another. The last city/capital to visit is Rome. But she has gotten sick and tired of the officious people on her staff, and has a really big explosion. She flees the embassy, not realizing she has been given a sleeping drought in her milk. While sleeping on an outside street she is found by Peck, a newsman working for an American press syndicate. Due to the sudden circumstances, Peck has to take her to his apartment to prevent her from being arrested by the police. The next morning he discovers who she is, and decides to do a news piece on her day of freedom from her regular duties, getting his pal Eddie Albert (a photographer) to take pictures of her with his secret camera (inside his lighter). At the same time the government of Anya's country sends a plane of secret agents to Rome to locate and return her to the embassy. Many lovely bits in the film, such as Hepburn's haircut by barber Paolo Carlini (who never stops improving on his work - he even combs her curls while dancing with her that night). There is the difficult relationship between Peck and his boss Hartley Powers (best remembered as \"Sylvester Kee\" the ventriloquist Maxwell Freer - Michael Redgrave - almost kills in DEAD OF NIGHT): Powers catches Peck in a lie about completing an interview that Peck could not have done, but is fast to accept an offer from Peck for that article about the Princess. There is also the moment when Peck is dared to place his hand into the mouth of the God of Truth after Audrey has done so. And Albert keeps on getting knocked down or tripped before he spills the beans to the wrong person.With firm direction by William Wyler the movie is a bittersweet triumph, which ends with the only logical conclusion to Peck's relationship to Hepburn. But it is done with style, grace, and dignity, and is unforgettable.One final point: if Trumbo's story was based on the Princess Margaret Rose - Townshend Affair, present day viewing is affected by thinking of another popular royal Princess of a later generation. Thoughts of Princess Diane and her tragedy keeps popping up, especially when comparing the final actions of Peck and Albert towards Hepburn, as compared to the pursuit and death of Diane at the hands of paparazzi in Paris in 1997. Albert's final sacrifice of his work is a sweet moment at the conclusion of the film, and it certainly is light-years away from the harpies photographing the wreck of Dodi and Diane's limousine in the underpass. But then, in 1953 there may have been more respect for the rights of celebrities than there are today. We're the poorer for all that now.",

The city that gives the film its name snares as much screen time as either of its two stars, and it looks just as beautiful.Speaking of beauty, this film's strongest selling point is its position as a vehicle for Audrey Hepburn, who burst on to the movie scene with this film and became one of Hollywood's most beloved stars. Many of the roles she played subsequently to this one had the same flavor -- she excelled at playing winsome waifs who were always just a tad too pristine for the rough world of men surrounding them --- think of her in \"Sabrina\" or \"My Fair Lady.\" Here she gets to ride on the back of a motor scooter driven by Gregory Peck, and show off that dazzling smile. However, a happy ending for the charismatic couple is not to be, as this princess who gets to be a peasant for a day must accept her responsibility and go back to being a princess once more. It's slightly ironic that a star whose appeal rested on her uncanny glamour appeared in role after role that highlighted the limits which glamour can place on the world of those who suffer from it.Aside from its leading lady, the film itself is nothing special. Wyler provides solid if unfancy direction, and the story doesn't go anywhere you're not expecting it to. Eddie Albert provides some fine support as a randy photographer, but don't let anyone kid you into thinking that this movie belongs to anyone but Audrey Hepburn.Grade: B",

I love everything about this movie: the actors, the scenario (Rome's background), and the music score. Let me talk about the qualities of this movie: Audrey Hepburn (in her official movie debut) is wonderful, and sparkles all the way trough, and really deserved her Academy Award for Best Actress in 1954. Gregory Peck is fantastic as Joe Bradley, the American journalist that befriends and gives her hospitality in his flat and eventually, after some comic adventures, falls in love with her. And Eddie Albert is just great, as Irving Radovich, Bradley's colleague that tries to photograph the scoop of Princess Anna's visit in Rome. Eddie Albert should have won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor because this is one of his best roles, but he lost it thanks to Frank Sinatra for ''From Here to Eternity''.I must add that Albert was good not only in comedy, like in ''Green Acres'', but also in more darker roles, such as the frightened Army Captain in ''Attack!'' and the psychotic colonel in ''Captain Newman, M. D.'', and it's so sad that he wasn't nominated for these two roles!This is also the first comedy produced in America filmed entirely in Italy, and Rome's backgrounds, such as Trevi's Fountain, Piazza Di Spagna and the Colosseum are perfectly fit in the movie. The music is also nice, because it's not with the silly Perry Como songs, but the score is composed by Georges Auric, and fits like a glove the character's actions.My favorite parts are: when Audrey lets the Vespa go and goes smashing trough all of Rome's street-markets, and ends with Bradley and Radovich at the police station; and the ending, when Audrey salutes all the press correspondents and Bradley is the last to leave the room, after thinking of his experience in Rome with a princess.It's one of my top favorite movies, and I recommend this movie to everyone, just for a careless evening in ''Old Hollywood Style''!",

Princess Ann (Audrey Hepburn) is feeling overwrought by her royal obligations and tight schedule.  She longs to be free of the burden of privilege, so one night in Rome she slips out of the royal accommodations late at night to see the city.  The trouble is she has just been given a sedative, which has a similar effect to that which alcohol has on a lush on a bender.  She is discovered sleeping near a fountain by Joe Bradley (Gregory Peck), who takes her to his apartment to sleep it off despite his better judgment.  Joe is a reporter who is supposed to interview the princess the next day, though he doesn't recognize her (extremely implausible, but alright, it is a necessary plot device and this was before TV was ubiquitous).When he realizes who she is, he plots to conduct a surreptitious personal interview with her by showing her around the town and not telling her that he is a reporter.  What results is a charming jaunt about historic Rome that turns into instant love.  There are numerous zany scenes and lots of slapstick humor, but it all works because Hepburn and Peck are so fabulous together.This film was directed by legendary director William Wyler (Ben Hur, The Best Years of Our Lives, Wuthering Heights), who chose wonderful locations throughout Rome to give the romance a storybook flavor.  Audrey Hepburn won a best actress Oscar for her performance as the lovely and impetuous princess.  It was a rich and adorable performance, which that was both captivating and amusing.  The scenes where she was intoxicated were precious and her na\u00efve view of the world was endearing.  Gregory Peck was dashing as the knave, with his understated flair for ironic and physical comedy.  Eddie Albert (most famous for TV's Green Acres) adds to the fun as Joe's scheming photographer who spends much of the film getting drenched and falling down.This film was nominated for ten Academy Awards, including best picture, director, actress, costumes and story.  It won only three (actress, story and costumes) in a year dominated by `From Here to Eternity'(Eleven Nominations, Eight Oscars).  It is a delightfully entertaining story that is as enjoyable today as it was in 1953.  I rated it a 10/10.  If you enjoy romantic comedies, you can't go wrong with this film.",

The scene where Peck puts his hand in the mouth face of Truth, and pretends as if somebody has grasped him; the subsequent frenzied shouting and acting of Hepburn is said to be taken in one shot by Wyler, with Hepburn impulsively reacting without been foretold about the particular shot and naturally without a retake.... something very unusual for the direction of Wyler.It is very difficult to resist the temptation of viewing the movie to the last scene although it is pictured in black and white. Audry Hepburn won international acclaim and recognition for depicting the role of an unruly and vivacious young princess. The cool and calm demeanor of Gregory Peck is also worth watching. Had this movie been directed in color, it would definitely been more impressive and absorbing, given the historical and befitting filming location of Rome. The last scene of Roman Holiday where Gregory Peck meets for the last time with a regal and suave princess who hides her free spirit under the veil of worldly vanity and finally Gregory Peck leaving the premises of a deserted Roman pallazeo with anguish and perplexed vibes, stirs the soul of every viewer with sublime imagination which discerns the lifestyle of a commoner from the privileged.",

The timeless fairytale elements like a princess trying to disguise herself as a commoner and the classic routine of two people being dishonest with each other falling in love only gets better played against the live backdrop of Rome.One of the first films to truly shoot on location, \"Roman Holiday\" is that quintessential romance in a foreign country picture. In it, a young English Princess Ann (Audrey Hepburn), tired of her royal routine as an ambassador, sneaks away and into the path of American reporter Joe Bradley (Gregory Peck). After Bradley realizes who she is, he crafts a plan to turn the coincidence into an exclusive story and spends a day with her going about Rome. It's similar in premise to the 1934 Frank Capra classic \"It Happened One Night\" only less dramatic in terms of romance.Little can describe Audrey Hepburn, but she is outstanding in the role that shot her to fame and earned her an instant Oscar. She has an allure to her and a beauty that is not unparalleled, but incomparable to any other star of the era. She looks youthful and childish at times but is also emphatically elegant and classy -- she's a unique beauty.Opposite her is a perfectly cast Gregory Peck, whose experience and maturity really shows in a role that is ultimately a supporting one. This is a story about Princess Ann and her discovery and he recognizes that, never taking focus from her in their scenes together. William Wyler captures this excellent chemistry in a film that is really quite naturally entertaining. It doesn't necessitate serious conflict -- the premise alone and our anticipation of them both coming clean about their facades keep us going and even then, Dalton Trumbo (story) and Ian McLellan Hunter (screenplay) bring us that moment in a way that is implied rather than forced, avoiding clich\u00e9s that most romantic comedies of today can't seem to let go of.\"Roman Holiday\" is such a classy movie that despite moderate laughs and no deep conflict, manages to capture our attention and our lighter side. It's one of those films that just sweeps you up and gives you something to enjoy without redundant or overbearing tactics that the genre has been so used to seeing for a century.",

The film tells about a young princess who escapes during an official visit to Rome and make friends with a cynical American journalist, who only wants the exclusive story, but later realized that he was falling in love with her. Lonely young princess unknown European countries spend a magical day with an American journalist. The junction between the young ladies of high society and unpolished common man has already seen. I think the director was aware of that fact. For this reason his is paid more attention dialogues, comedy, romance and the main Italian city. I must say that the atmosphere in the film special. Scenery and the picture are at a high level. \u0084It Happened One Night.\"Although the director made sure that this movie looks as natural as possible, simply is too much in common. Princess' love affair in the Eternal City is what this film gave a special charm. Tenderness, love and playfulness in one being triumphs over cynicism and professionalism in another being. If so ask things, this movie is really one magical trip. Gregory Peck as Joe Bradley is strong and masculine character. The change in the character is visible. That is great. I think this is the best show last frames of the film. Chemistry has succeeded, so his performance is more than good. Audrey Hepburn as Princess Ann (Anya Smith) is slender and beautiful girl. Regardless of childish behavior, I think that in her character feels seriousness. She is aware of its obligations, satisfaction, loneliness and love. Romance in this film, I never would have called it an affair. This is truly a romantic vacation.They do not make more such films. A short break full of satisfaction.",

(Today, needless to say, Hollywood would have slapped an artificial \"happy ending\" on this movie.)As Princess Anne, who longs to escape from the duties of a life she never chose, the luminous Audrey Hepburn creates a completely believable and unforgettable character.  She is just such a pleasure to watch, not only because she is so lovely it takes your breath away (no offense to the memory of the late Princess Diana, but she didn't have one-tenth of Audrey's charm and grace), but also because her acting is so beautifully natural and so effortlessly conveys a wide range of emotions.  Gregory Peck can be a little stiff at times, but he gave an excellent performance here.  Still, this is definitely Audrey's picture.  Princess Anne is one of the most wonderful characters ever to appear on the silver screen, and Audrey Hepburn is a treasure.",

            "content": "Is there anybody on the planet who has not succumbed to both Audrey Hepburn and this, her first leading role. Sadly the answer must be yes because there are always those who fail to 'get' it or to 'see' the enchantment. The fact that Dalton Trumbo has now been accorded his rightful screenplay credit could well lead to speculation about the basic premise given that Trumbo was often accused of 'smuggling' left-wing 'messages' into his pre-Hollywood Ten screenplays: Everybody and his Uncle Max is familiar with the Marxist credo, 'Workers of the world unite, you have nothing to lose but your chains' but did, we wonder, Trumbo adapt this to read 'Royals of the world abscond, you have nothing to lose but your privileges' then have Audrey Hepburn's Princess Ann run away from the shackles of protocol. Alas, that's about as far as we can run with this because the true Marxist would then assassinate the whole Royal Family for an encore whilst Hepburn's princess, cognizant of her 'duty' returns to assume the role life has chosen for her. In that respect this answers the description of the bildungsroman in which a child comes of age via a rites of passage episode and if we feel sadness on Hepburn's behalf in the opening scenes when, as a grown woman she is treated as a child not least by her own lady-in-waiting we rejoice at the end when, for the first time, she asserts her authority and dismisses that same lady-in-waiting. In between lies some heavy-duty enchantment with Peck and Hepburn falling hopelessly into a hopeless love laced liberally with laughter and tears and great support from Eddie Albert. Along with Billy Wilder's Sabrina Fair this represents the best of Hepburn which is really saying something given the consistent high standards of her later work but just as you can only fall in love for the first time once so you can only play your first leading role once and she was so lucky to have Gregory Peck, one of the most underrated actors in Hollywood, to share it with her. Total joy. Fifteen out of Ten.",

            "content": "It's amazing that you can read through all these reviews of ROMAN HOLIDAY and get the idea that this is an original story. Actually, a lesser-known film from 1943 starring OLIVIA DE HAVILLAND, ROBERT CUMMINGS, JANE WYMAN and JACK Carson dealt with the same theme--a princess steals out for some time on her own and falls in love with an airline pilot in Washington, D.C. (not Rome). But that film had a happy ending in keeping with its Oscar-winning screenplay's designation as a romantic comedy. Furthermore, Norman Krasna's script was just as witty as Dalton Trumbo's for ROMAN HOLIDAY and won a well deserved Oscar.And yet here, among the many reviews, a few have compared the story to IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT instead of PRINCESS O'ROURKE.Anyway, I'm a fan of both stars (Peck and Hepburn), but I've seen both of them appear to better advantage than they do here. Hepburn is vivacious and attractive as Princess Ann and Peck makes a believable enough newspaper man, but I don't believe either one of them gets to do anything memorable enough to support all these glowing reviews. And certainly William Wyler has had more notable achievements in his long career than this fluffy romantic comedy with an unhappy ending. The only conclusion I can come to is that Hepburn's interesting personality on film is an endearing one--and magical enough so that can do no wrong as far as her fans are concerned.It must be the overwhelming star presence of AUDREY HEPBURN that makes this one such a popular treat because there's nothing especially novel about the predictable screenplay--and EDDIE ALBERT's nomination is somewhat puzzling as he's done even better work in all of his comedies during his years under contract to Warner Bros. He's a fine comedian and actor who always deserved better treatment than he received.To put it mildly, I find this film terribly overrated--unspectacular in its photography and after telling what is basically a slow moving and much-told fairytale about a princess and a commoner, it gives us an unhappy and terribly sentimental and sappy ending.Sorry, this one's not my cup of tea. Not a glass slipper in sight no matter how much Audrey sparkles.Summing up: Basically, just another variation on the princess and the commoner theme.",

            "content": "Roman Holiday (1953) was filmed on location in Rome, Italy and, per TCM's host, was shot in black-and-white vs. Technicolor for budgetary reasons. Accordingly, since Gregory Peck had already been hired to play an uncharacteristically light (for him) Cary Grant- like role as the male lead, his romantic counterpart would have to be played by a relative unknown (e.g. someone producer-director William Wyler could get cheaply).Enter Miss Audrey Hepburn, who had appeared in barely (or should that be \"barely appeared in\") a handful of movies since her debut in 1951. But despite her short resume, the actress so impressed her co- star during the course of filming this one that Peck convinced Wyler to put her name above the title with his. Subsequently, the Academy endorsed the actor's assessment when they awarded Hepburn the Best Actress Oscar for her performance.She would go on to earn four more Best Actress nominations, among them the title role opposite Humphrey Bogart and William Holden in Billy Wilder's Sabrina (1954) the following year and as the iconic Holly Golightly (opposite George Peppard) in Breakfast at Tiffany's (1961), though Hepburn failed to earn a nomination for perhaps her most famous part as Eliza Doolittle in the Warner Bros. musical (adaptation of George Bernard Shaw's play Pygmalion) My Fair Lady (1964). She was later voted the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award (e.g. for her work with UNICEF etc.).Hepburn's unique, regal beauty made her perfect for the role of Princess Ann in Roman Holiday (1953). The story opens with the young princess at the end of an exhausting, repetitious \"public relations\" tour of Europe. Having been sheltered all her life, she's quite naturally bored. She'd love to find excitement given her present routine, which is so mundane that a simple faux pas (such as her losing track of a high-heeled shoe before dancing with a head-of- state) causes a stir. Tired of it all, Princess Ann becomes tearfully hysterical at bedtime while going over the next day's agenda with her secretary.Borrowing a plot device from director Norman Krasna's Academy Award winning Original Screenplay for Princess O'Rourke (1943), blacklisted writer Dalton Trumbo and screenwriters Ian McLellan Hunter and John Dighton utilized a hypodermic administered sedative (in lieu of too many sleeping pills) to handicap their princess in this one. But that's not where the similarities end: as Krasna did with his title character (played by Olivia de Havilland), once she's out of her protective custody environment, the seemingly inebriated princess falls into the hands of the unawares male protagonist who, fortunately, is chivalrous instead of lecherous, and the romance part of the comedy begins. From there the plots of these two movies diverge - Robert Cummings is a pilot and the conflict is a familiar commoner-that-wants-to-marry-into-royalty routine whereas Peck plays newspaper reporter Joe Bradley who, after learning the identity of the sleeping beauty that just spent the night in his apartment is Princess Ann, fully intends to exploit the situation by selling her exclusive story to his publisher for $5,000 (he doesn't let on that he knows who she is; the princess says her name is Anya and cuts her hair to keep from being recognized in public) - but the end of Roman Holiday (1953) is remarkably similar to a famous romance drama classic.Princess Ann's whirlwind twenty-four hour vacation in Rome includes Hepburn's spontaneous reaction to Peck's appearing to lose his hand in the Mouth of Truth and several other slapstick sequences: Joe interrupting his photographer friend Irving Radovich (Eddie Albert's first Oscar nominated Supporting Actor role) to keep him from spilling the beans (e.g. that they know her identity) on several occasions, a harrowing ride on a motorbike through several street vendors such that the three of them end up appearing before a local police chief, and a comedic brawl at an open air nightclub where the princess's countrymen find her (and try to compel her to return with them). She and Joe escape via a canal (my daughter laughed out loud when the princess grabbed her nose and jumped into the water), swimming to the other side, which is (at the very least) a more original way to get the two leads wet for their first kiss than the more stereotypical rainstorm, right? But alas, even though they've fallen in love, it's an impossible situation, so it must end.In a twist on Casablanca (1942), it's her (the princess), not him, with a sense of duty that stops the romance in its tracks ... but they'll always have Rome. Upon her return to the embassy, it's clear that she's matured quite a bit (after just one day on the outside) as she alters the bedtime ritual. But he too is noble and later - when they meet again while back in their respective roles, and Princess Ann learns that Joe is a reporter - he conveys that her secrets are safe with him (e.g. he isn't going to write about their exploits together, despite his need for the money), and then Irving gives the princess the pictures he'd surreptitiously taken as mementos of her holiday.Like Grant before him, Peck's understated performance in this romantic comedy went unrecognized in a year in which actors in two different war movies, and two others featuring Romans, were instead. Edith Head won her fourth of eight Academy Awards (from 34 nominations) for her B&W Costume Design (love those striped pajamas!), and Trumbo's widow was eventually presented the Oscar for his Motion Picture Story, which was originally given to Hunter, who'd fronted for the blacklisted writer.The film was also nominated for Best Picture, as was director Wyler, the aforementioned screenplay writers, editor Robert Swink, its B&W Art Direction-Set Decoration & Cinematography. Plus, it was added to the National Film Registry in 1999. At least AFI voters did recognize it as the fourth best love story of all time.",

Of course, she should have won easily for \"The Nun's Story,\" in 1959 and gave another great performance as a blind woman victimized by thieves in 1967's \"Wait Until Dark,\" her final Oscar bid. How the Academy ignored Barbara Stanwyck's phenomenal performance in 1953's \"Titanic\" was beyond me. To add insult to injury, Stanwyck wasn't even nominated along with the equally great Clifton Webb.\"Roman Holiday\" had magnificent cinematography and that was about it. To me, Hepburn was often childish in the film and that scene in the cave was just a little too much for me.Eddie Albert received a best supporting Oscar bid here and I think only the Lord knows why.

            "review_title": "Delightful romantic fairy tale of runaway princess and journalist",
            "content": "This is an enchanting comedy romance, something of a fairy tale. Its memorable qualities lie primarily in its two leading stars, who are both perfect in their roles. Audrey Hepburn is radiantly beautiful and quietly spirited as the wispy young princess of a country unspecified, finally free in an exciting foreign city. Gregory Peck plays to perfection her steadfast and honorable journalist escort around Rome.The movie tells the story of lovely young Princess Ann who is on an official European tour. Having carried out state functions in London, Amsterdam, and Paris, she arrives in Rome...before her next stop, Athens. By this time she has grown weary of the grueling and rigid schedule of dedications, luncheons, balls, news conferences, and other ceremonies she must attend, dreaming of life as an ordinary carefree tourist. She manages to escape her temporary Embassy residence and encounters an out of luck American journalist named Joe Bradley, who recognizes her and plans to do a story. However, he ends up instead as a sort of tour guide to Rome, with the runaway princess blissfully unaware that Bradley knows her true identity and intends to use that knowledge for profit. Princess Ann has 24 hours of glorious freedom... long enough for feelings to develop between her and her guide.Hepburn depicts with equal brilliance both aspects of the princess's persona. Her Royal Highness is elegant and serene at the official press conference and ball, surreptitiously slipping off one uncomfortable slipper and later inconspicuously retrieving it to maintain her air of poised grace. Later, traveling incognito as Anya, she is adventurous, whimsical, and charming with her elfin like short hair as she enjoys an ice cream cone, zips through the streets of the Eternal City on a scooter, and dances with her handsome American escort at a barge on the Tiber River. The movie was filmed entirely in Rome and I love the background scenes of the Colosseum, Trevi Fountain, Spanish Steps, and so forth. Also, Bradley's charming little bachelor apartment makes the perfect spot for the princess's unexpected sleepover, wearing her reluctant host's pajamas! Bradley does not take advantage of the situation, either during her earlier drowsily drugged state or later when the sophisticated yet equally naive princess innocently asks him to help her undress.Too soon her fairy tale comes to an end, and the princess must choose between newly kindled love and royal duty. Her escort, Bradley, must in turn decide which comes first, his integrity and his heart or a news scoop. Duty prevails for Princess Ann, while Bradley's love triumphs over the news story and winning the wager he has also placed on obtaining it. Their parting scenes at both the Embassy gate and the following day's press conference are compelling. Surely no face but Gregory Peck's could capture such an expression of loss and regret.A tear can also be seen lurking in the princess's eye during her formal press meeting with Bradley, but there's a sense that both her brief taste of unscheduled freedom and her experience of first love have given her maturity and self assurance. It will be a dutiful but somewhat altered princess returning to her home country after this European tour. At her Embassy suite after leaving Bradley, she takes charge of her handlers, announcing very confidently that she does not wish her customary bedtime snack of milk & crackers. Also, when questioned about her city preference next day at the news conference, she begins with the standard reply that all had their unique charms. Later, however, she again confidently speaks the truth...that her favourite was definitely Rome. Likewise, although the formerly pragmatic and rather cynical journalist, Bradley, realizes the lovely princess is trapped forever in a world of obligation, his own life seems forever changed by their brief encounter. Bradley's photographer sidekick, Irving Radovich (competently played by Ed Albert), has originally intended to publish his sensational photos of the unrecognized princess touring about, but instead gives them to her as personal souvenirs of her wonderful Roman holiday. This is a lovely old fashioned tale and truly a classic that no romantic should miss.",

            "review_title": "Perhaps the most romantic movie ever made",
            "content": "This was Audrey Hepburn's debut in a starring role. She was 24-years-old and had appeared in two or three other movies but just in bit parts. Here she plays a reigning European princess visiting Rome who would like an escape from her daily regime of official duties, thus the title and theme of the movie, a Roman holiday.Gregory Peck plays an American newspaper reporter living in the Eternal City. We first see him playing poker with his cronies, and losing. His relative \"poverty\" and Princess Ann's fabulous wealth and station present a formidable barrier to their ever finding true love and marital happiness. Part of the fun of the script is in seeing how this will play out and how their differences are resolved in the end. I will give you a small hint: very carefully!The script comes from a story by Dalton Trumbo who is perhaps best known as the author of the anti-war novel, Johnny Got His Gun. Trumbo was one of the \"Hollywood Ten\" who were blacklisted from working in the industry during the excesses of the McCarthy era. He went to Mexico and continued working on film scripts but under assumed names or had his scripts presented by \"fronts.\" In this case Ian McLellan Hunter fronted for Trumbo and won an Academy Award for the story. Later the Academy awarded Trumbo a posthumous Oscar for his work.Long time Hollywood studio director William Wyler directed the film entirely on location in Rome. He has a formidable list of credits going well back into the silent film era including such outstanding films as Wuthering Heights (1939), The Letter (1940), The Little Foxes (1941), etc. His clear directorial style and his attention to detail work well here. The sets in Rome are charming, especially Peck's bachelor apartment. The bit players, especially Peck's landlord are excellent and the events are dreamy in just the way a romantic meeting in Rome ought to be. Wyler is especially effective in presenting Audrey Hepburn in the most flattering light and getting the audience to identify with her.Gregory Peck's character should be a bit of an adventurous rake who finds that love is more important than money or fame, but it is impossible for Peck to play a morally compromised character, and so even as he appears to be using Princess Ann for his own ends, his behavior is always correct. I was somewhat amused to notice that at all times Peck appears wearing a tie! Eddie Albert plays Peck's friend, a photographer/artist. It is interesting to note how Hollywood's perception of the paparazzi has changed over the years. Here blood-sucking, intrusive greed does not exist. Instead we have noble self-sacrifice!I have seen most of Miss Hepburn's movies and I can say that she was never more enchanting than she is here. She is gorgeous and cute at the same time, charming and impish, sweet, regal and very winning. In a sense she started at the top with this film, garnering her only Oscar as Best Actress in 1953; but as her fans know she never came down off that pedestal. Even playing poor Eliza Doolittle in My Fair Lady (1964), there was never any doubt about the quality of her style and character.This is the most romantic film I have ever seen, perhaps partly because Miss Hepburn is so wonderful, but also because the script in a sense turns the usual woman's romantic fantasy upside down. Instead of the woman finding that the man she is in love with has fabulous wealth and position, it is the other way around!The ending manages to be realistic yet romantic. There is a hint of something almost spiritual beyond what happens. So convincing are Hepburn and Peck that one can almost believe the story is true; and indeed I am sure that Trumbo lifted the essentials of the plot from some ancient tale.I have a weakness for movies about unrequited love, or love that goes on forever, or love that is caught at some perfect moment and lives eternally in that moment. Roman Holiday is one of those near perfect movies that plays beautifully upon one of these themes.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book \"Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!\" Get it at Amazon!)",

Basically Princess Anne (introducing Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe winning Audrey Hepburn) is touring Europe, everyone knows about it, but all of the sudden she feels overworked and is bored of the royal duties and lifestyle. The doctor may give her a sedative to calm her down and help relax for a bit, but she wants some adventure, and at night secretly sneaks out of her room and onto a delivery truck into the city of Rome, Italy. Not long after getting out the truck however, the sedative she took takes effect, and she dozes off on a park bench, to be found by American newspaper reporter Joe Bradley (BAFTA nominated Gregory Peck), who thinks she is drunk. He offers her help in any way he can, and when it looks like he has to take care of, he takes her to his apartment, he is unaware of her real identity, even with her rambling royal things while still really tired. Coincidently, Joe was due to see the Princess at a press conference, and he goes to see his editor Mr. Hennessy (Hartley Power), who informs him that she has been \"taken ill\", this is a lie by the royal staff, and then he recognises her from a photo. Knowing he has Princess Ann in his apartment, he makes a bet with his boss that he can get an exclusive interview with her before anyone else can, and so begins his giving her a tour of the city. Joe gives her the fake name \"Anya Smith\", and after meeting up with his photographer friend Irving Radovich (Oscar and BAFTA nominated Eddie Albert) he offers him the chance to help with an interview, by having him take some secret photos. Taking advantage of her newfound freedom, Ann gets a haircut, and obviously she knows that he knows her identity, so she tells him her wishes to be like any normal person. After a dance with Joe, a fight at the club, which produced some great exclusive shots for the camera, and getting very close to Joe, she realises any romance can't carry on. So she returns to the embassy, meaning Joe can't win his bet, and knowing he had feelings for her Irving agrees not to sell the photos. The final scene sees Joe attend a press conference, and Princess Ann answers the questions the other reporters have, and from Joe, before deciding to shake hands with them all, leaving the room, and Joe slowly leaving wondering what could have been. Also starring Margaret Rawlings as Countess Vereberg, Harcourt Williams as Ambassador, Tullio Carminati as General Provno, Paolo Carlini as Mario Delani and Claudio Ermelli as Giovanni. Hepburn deserved her Academy Award for her first film role (although she has a small role in The Lavender Hill Mob), she is charming and beautiful, Peck is a nice guy in the story, and Albert is funny when he is on screen, it is a simple story with a nice slow love story, and a lot of the time it is really funny, a good fun and very watchable romantic comedy. It won the Oscar for Best Costume Design and Best Writing, Motion Picture Story, and it was nominated for Best Picture, Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Cinematography, Best Film Editing and Best Writing, Screenplay, and it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Film from any Source. Audrey Hepburn was number 13 on The Greatest Movie Stars, and she was number 31 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons. Very good!",

There is bias here, but watch it just once and you will see how fun it is to see this modern-day princess run around the great ancient city of Rome trying to have a good time away from her royal duties. Gregory Peck is good here, although one can't help wonder what Cary Grant could have done with this role. Still, Peck is charming as is Eddie Albert as the goofy, bearded photographer at Peck's side. Stylishly directed by one of the Golden Age's greats, William Wyler, this is one of the better productions of the 1950s and stands tall as one of the best comedies ever produced by Hollywood. It is more than that though; it is also a star-making performance of one of the best actresses in the history of cinema. It is a pleasure to watch Audrey again and again.",

            "content": "William Wyler...that name, for many years, has made me think of one of the most famous Roman epic directions of all time, BEN HUR (1959). His ROMAN HOLIDAY (1953), however, is the film I had not had a chance to see for long but I heard about it from my friend who is a classic admirer and who had told me the whole story several times, including spoilers. Therefore, I knew generally what the movie is about. Recently, ROMAN HOLIDAY was broadcast on Polish TV and I decided to see it. The first impression I got was: there is something different about this movie than most of the classic films I have seen so far... And that impression I got is something I want to share with you.It is true that the classic pair of Audrey Hepburn as Princess Ann and Gregory Peck as Joe Bradley constitute a wonderful aspect of the movie. They will make your day when you see them in these various situations. Having ROMAN HOLIDAY without them is like having an apple tree without apples, they are just deeply attached to this timeless classic, like Liz Taylor and Richard Burton are attached to CLEOPATRA or THE TAMING OF THE SHREW. The whole story of ROMAN HOLIDAY is created in such a way that there is no focus on other performances. Indeed, in this film, there are two main cast, Hepburn and Peck and they are ... terrific.When considering the aspect of performances, it's important to mention lots of very funny and memorable moments where the famous pair do their best to entertain the viewer. Consider, for instance Joe Bradley's first meeting with Ann. Besides, it's just tremendous when she says: \"I've never been alone with a man before, even with my dress on. With my dress off, it's MOST unusual.\" Another wonderfully unforgettable moment is when they put their hands into the famous Mouth of Truth (Bocca Della Verita). The camera is so well crafted towards them and the great monument that the impression is like WOW! MAGICAL! The number of humorous moments also make for a great classic: who can forget Ann's visit at the hairdresser's or her talk with Joe Bradley on Scalinata Di Spagna (Spanish Steps).Besides, it is true that ROMAN HOLIDAY is a film set in the real Rome of the 1950s. This aspect has become even more powerful as the years passed by. Of course it is not the only film that shows the Rome of that period since we have many, for instance, Italian movies that do the same; yet, the presentation of the Eternal City is really charming in Wyler's film. Since I know Rome and this city means much to me, I was overwhelmed by the movie and involved in seeing what the world known places, including Scalinata Di Spagna, Fontanna Di Trevi, Piazza Venezia, looked like more than 50 years ago. What is more, you are supplied with the views of real streets.But all these aspects are not the most significant ones. Hepburn and Peck are no longer great stars, Rome has changed seriously and a Roman holiday would probably be entirely different nowadays. Yet, the movie by William Wyler is still watched and admired...I think that it is so thanks to the wonderful uniqueness of its classic, the CONTENT. When we see the classic films, these are usually dramas, overall sad films, like GONE WITH THE WIND. I don't say that these dramas lack popularity nowadays, but there are so many of them that you only select and see the ones that suit your taste. Meanwhile, ROMAN HOLIDAY is a comedy, moreover, a romantic comedy, a beautiful fairy tale about gentle love. There is nothing sad, depressing about it! It is a charming story of the princess who badly wants to be a normal human being for at least one day and...her dream is fulfilled. The love absorbs the pair and makes the Eternal City the most unforgettable for both. The picture is in black and white despite there were colorful movies in the early 1950s. It isn't there for no purpose. Black and white picture makes perfect sense in ROMAN HOLIDAY since it adds charm and gentleness to the whole story.I'd love to have this movie in my film gallery since ROMAN HOLIDAY is really a precious film. I don't find this a masterpiece but, undoubtedly, it is one of the most charming classic fairy tales with the terrific Audrey Hepburn, Gregory Peck, the Rome of the 1950s but, most importantly, with wonderful content!",

            "content": "Gregory Peck - usually when I see this actor in a movie, and in large part as I remember him from To Kill a Mockingbird and, of all things, The Paradine Case (why I don't more-so from his great turn in Moby Dick I don't know), he comes off as kind of upstanding and fine, but not a terribly charming presence on screen. Formidable may be the word most associated for Peck, and yet in Roman Holiday somehow William Wyler got a fantastic performance from him, full of warmth and great comic timing.It doesn't hurt, only helps, that Peck's playing opposite Audrey Hepburn, who is, of course, wholly beautiful and the ideal of a Movie Star (in caps) here. More than that - whether her hair is long or short, she's one of those beauties of the screen that the film camera loves to take in. It's mostly in the eyes, but it's really the whole package, her grace and own sense of comic timing that works so well. Take when she first gets out of her royal palace and goes about in Rome at night, increasingly getting tired until she's just mumbling a poem by Yeats (sorry, it's Shelly), and keeps nodding off with her new friend played by Peck.I sometimes don't like characters in romantic comedies, who may be more like figures of a plot wheeling forward than having any great personality. But between recently seeing The Philadelphia Story and then this, I have a better appreciation for this kind of ebullient filmmaking. Here especially the backdrop makes things lively, it's basically like you're there on vacation with them in the mid-section of the film, and Rome is of course the third star of the film, to use the clich\u00e9. I was worried at first the sort of colorful side characters might be over-exaggerated. And maybe a few are. But I think Wyler's casting of non-professionals helps a great deal, and even people with more than one line like the house-manager Peck's staying at or the cab driver get to have moments showing their character well for the sake of the story.It's a fairy tale set up - I could picture a Disney movie taking this very same path (actually, come to think of it, Aladdin had a few scenes that followed the Princess-Goes-out-in-Public sequence of events) - and it has that level of innocence. Even when figures who may bring doom to our characters come forward, such as the men in suits at the dance at night, they're just coming to take her back to the palace. The writing and directing has a lighter-than-air quality that is hard to resist, and in large part because the director gets Peck to open up a bit as a star, and makes Hepburn one in just under two hours.If you got a date, and they like classic movies, this is one to show them for its class, its real sense of fun, and the charm of the two stars. Not a great 'film' but certainly an excellent 'movie' in the old-time Hollywood sense of the word.",

            "content": "Roman Holiday is a movie of its time and place. In more ways than one. We can't go back to 1950s Rome. Or 1950s Hollywood. The alluring city of Rome is a wonderful setting for the film. It's Rome as we'd like to remember it, a Rome that in many ways doesn't exist anymore. Life was just different back then. Simpler, probably happier, definitely more charming. The movie is also the product of a Hollywood that no longer exists. This is a movie with a very definite 1950s style and feel. Unfortunately that 1950s style doesn't always translate for the modern viewer. It was a simpler time in movie-making as well as life but this film is perhaps a little too simple for modern tastes. The plot is threadbare. The movie doesn't have much energy to it. It's all very relaxed. Too relaxed. For whatever charms the movie has it just isn't entertaining enough. There's just not enough going on.Aside from the wonderful 1950s time capsule look at Rome the film has one other thing clearly working in its favor. Audrey Hepburn. In this, her first major role, Hepburn is relentlessly charming. It's so easy to see why she would go on to become one of the world's most beloved stars. But all her charms aren't quite enough to overcome the problems with the story. The central problem being that there isn't enough of a story at all. Hepburn plays Ann, princess of an unspecified European country. She's on a grand tour of Europe, appearing before teeming crowds of thousands everywhere she goes. She is obviously a quite notably famous person. Which makes the fact that she goes completely unrecognized by anyone when she slips away from her royal duties to wander the streets of Rome more than a little hard to believe. Even the supposedly astute reporter who will become her companion on her little getaway has no idea who she is until he sees her picture in the paper. Mind you, this guy was supposed to be interviewing the princess that very day. Is he really that much of a dunce? And then this story, hard to believe as it is, just kind of sits there. This is a movie which could really use some bursts of energy to drive it forward.The story of a princess who longs to be a regular woman, to get out there and live and love a little, has its possibilities. But this movie doesn't do enough with its story. And for a movie billed as a romantic comedy the laughs are very few and far between. Hepburn is terrific, no quibbles with anything she does. You just wish the movie gave her the chance to do more. Hepburn's co-star Gregory Peck comes across as a little wooden and unnatural. He's a Hollywood legend in his own right but there's no doubt that in this film it is Hepburn's star which shines much brighter. Peck's character of reporter Joe Bradley is so bland you wonder how the princess could possibly find herself falling for him. Maybe after leading such a sheltered life she's just so grateful to have the chance to fall for anybody. But the romance never really rings true. At least there's Joe's photographer friend Irving to inject some personality into the proceedings. Irving, as portrayed by Eddie Albert, has got a little life to him. But that's just a supporting part. If the main character of Joe doesn't work, which it really doesn't, the movie suffers. It's easy to understand why Roman Holiday was so acclaimed and generally loved upon its initial release. It has some things going for it, the wonderful Hepburn first and foremost. But it's a movie with a style which suits the era in which it was made, not playing nearly as well today. Not a bad movie but not notably better than average either. For as much as Hepburn may charm you the movie does not do enough to entertain you.",

            "content": "'Roman Holiday' was Audrey Hepburn's breakthrough film, and won her an Academy Award. As the Princess Anya, Hepburn is luminous and enchanting. Her performance is natural, refreshing, and free of the obvious acting technique which would turn the whimsical spontaneity of her earlier work (this and 'Sabrina) into a more practised charm in 'Breakfast At Tiffany's' and 'My Fair Lady'. The great Gregory Peck co-stars as the news reporter who falls in love with Hepburn. Directed by the masterful William Wyler, and beautifully photographed, this film is a true delight.It's a wonderful love story. Hepburn becomes tired of the constraints of royal life during a tour of Italy and escapes into the streets of Rome at night. Peck so happens to come across her, not knowing who she is, and takes her back to his apartment (she is groggy from sedatives, but Peck thinks her drunk!). He soon discovers who she really is, and realises that he has the scoop of a lifetime- a report on 'The Runaway Princess'. She wants to explore Rome as a commoner; he accompanies her in her journey, documenting her day in Rome every step of the way with his photographer pal Eddie Albert. But the pair start to fall in love, and Peck's perfect plan goes awry.Hepburn's character transformation is stunning. At the beginning of the film she looks so young as the childlike Princess, with long hair and modest nightgown. At the end, she is a mature young leader with an understanding of the limitations and duties her position entails (with a short hair style to match). So many amazing moments shared by Hepburn and Peck in this film- her Vespa ride, the 'Mouth Of Truth', Audrey's first cigarette (which she smokes like an expert!), Audrey and Greg's dance, their final meeting etc. The ending is bittersweet, but fits the film beautifully. This would not be the classic it is today if it ended any differently (see it and you'll know what I mean).There are some long sequences, and it takes a little while to set up the action, but 'Roman Holiday's' good points far outweigh the negatives. Hepburn is never anything but convincing in her role, and the the filming of Rome makes the viewer feel like they too are exploring the city for the first time.There has been some criticism of Peck's acting in this one. Gregory himself realised it was Hepburn's film, demanding she get equal billing as he was convinced she would win the Oscar for her performance. The insightful Peck was absolutely right. But he is very, very good in his role too. Peck's quiet, measured style certainly benefited any film he starred in, and he is quite believable as the reporter (aside from the fact that he is impossibly good-looking, perhaps too gorgeous for a lowly American ex-pat in Italy).Catch this on the newly restored DVD. It's a beautiful, pristine print that makes another viewing of the film feel like the first. This is a monument to film-making in the Golden Age of Hollywood- a great romance, an enchanting film that the whole family can enjoy.10/10.",

            "content": "I don't see how you could ever resist this movie. It's simply such a charming and delightful movie that you just can't help but liking.It's being somewhat of a screwball comedy but since this movie got made in 1953, it's not quite the same as the usual average screwball comedy, made at the peak of the genre, during the '30's and '40's. You could say that the movie is being less goofy and is more about the hearth and warmth of the movie, that makes this movie such a charming and delightful one to watch.Of course you could really say that the movie helped to made a charming one because of the great presence of Audrey Hepburn in it. You could say that this movie really was the breakthrough movie for Audrey Hepburn. Not only because she won the Oscar for it but also because it was the first time that she was playing the female lead within a movie. She had appeared in several movies before but mostly in some supporting roles. Sometimes she was in a movie for only a couple of seconds. What a waste of such talent and beauty, or at least of course it seems that way now. She is just the perfect woman to me, with her girl like charm and natural beauty and she spoke quite well Dutch as well, as she also demonstrates briefly toward the end of the movie. So if you look anything- or are like Audrey Hepburn, you can drop me a line anytime. The modern Audrey Hepburn of this time and age is really Keira Knightley, who can also always drop me a line at anytime by the way. Not only do they look similar from certain angles but both also seem to have something very natural over them and also act that way, though Knightley broke through at even an earlier age and seems to be more versatile as an actress.But of course we also really shouldn't forget about Gregory Peck in this movie. He was already being somewhat of a star at the time, though he probably has never shined more in a romantic role. He handles the comedy, drama and romance in this movie all very well and believable. I also liked Eddie Albert in this movie, who probably provided the movie with most of its comedy. He even got nominated for an Oscar for his role in this movie.The movie can be seen as a modern fairy tale, though modern probably doesn't apply very much anymore for an 1953 picture, but you get what I mean. It's about a princess who is on the verge of a mental breakdown and on a given night decided to go out and hang around in Rome with 'normal' people for a change, incognito. Reporter Gregory Peck soon finds out who she truly is and decided to take advantage of the situation for his own personal gain but of course soon starts to grow a soft spot for Audrey Hepburn. Who wouldn't really. The movie has simply a great story because it all feels quite smooth and natural and the movie doesn't luckily goes to over-the-top with its situations and comedy, though it very easily could had.It's also a good looking movie, not only due to its main leads, but also thanks to some wonderful looking sets and locations in Rome. Yes, this entire movie got actually really shot at location, which also made it a quite expensive one for its time and genre. The whole movie, directed by William Wyler, is just simply an irresistible one!9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

            "content": "\"Presenting Gregory Peck \u0085 and introducing Audrey Hepburn.\" So the introductory credits read as the story begins in \"Roman Holiday.\" Although she had been around pictures for four years, Hepburn was a virtually unknown actress at the time. That may have had something to do with her getting the lead role. Produce/director William Wyler insisted that the film be shot on location in Rome. So, its budget was cut, which meant it would be shot in black and white and they couldn't afford a big name actress. So, Hepburn got the role of Princess Ann and it turned out to be her breakout role to silver screen stardom. This was Hepburn's first lead role; and with it, she stormed Hollywood and took the top female honors at the Academy Awards for 1953. She was the third youngest female star at the time to win a best actress Oscar. From then on, she would never appear as less than the lead female in any of her movies until the very last one, late in her career. And, only two male stars would ever again be billed ahead of her \u2013 Humphrey Bogart in \"Sabrina\" of 1954 and Gary Cooper in \"Love in the Afternoon\" of 1957.The cinema world \u2013 movie fans and movie makers, fell in love with Audrey Hepburn in this film. It was a love affair that would last to the end of her career and early death in 1993 from cancer. She was just 63 years old. Hepburn's appeal, besides her talent, was a picture of innocence and wholesomeness that contrasted sharply with the frequent Hollywood fare and promotion of sexual temptresses. Hers was a love of respect, admiration and warmth. She didn't make many movies in her career \u2013 just 33. Many of the best actresses have small portfolios. They could pick and choose the good roles and films they would like to be in, rather than take anything that came along just to be working, to make a buck or to keep one's face in front of the public. Gregory Peck was at the height of his career at age 37. He plays American newspaper reporter Joe Bradley who is working in Rome. Hepburn is the Princess of some unknown country. This is her story, about a young previously sheltered princess who has her first experiences out from under the safety and control of a royal umbrella. Fortunately for her, when she sneaks out of her royal lodgings after being given a shot to help her sleep, she runs into Bradley. This is a warmly funny and entertaining film, with Eddie Albert as photographer Irving Radovich being the butt of many of the laughs. At the time, Rome was just becoming a popular setting for Hollywood films. The credits point out that the movie was entirely filmed and recorded in Rome. A nice plus of this film is the scenery around the eternal city. A newsreel used early in the film shows a military parade in Rome that includes the Bersaglieri regiment and one of its fanfara. The Bersaglieri fanfara is an all-brass band that performs on the run in military parades. This is the only movie I know of in which one of these bands is shown. \"Roman Holiday\" is a delightful comedy romance that the whole family should enjoy.",

Audrey Hepburn wins an Academy Award and audiences hearts in her first major performance in a Hollywood film as Princess Ann. Hepburn wasn't the first choice, Elizabeth Taylor or Jean Simmons, who were both busy and unavailable. Audrey Hepburn performed perfectly in this performance. Audiences believed her as Anne, the Princess playing hooky in Rome. Eddie Albert is unrecognizable as Jim Bradley's friend and photographer, Irving, who helps keep her identity a secret while she has an adventure of her own. The screenplay and writing isn't outlandish but realistic thanks to blacklisted genius, Dalton Trumbo, under another name. William Wyler directed the film and Edith Head was the costume designer. The film would earn 10 Oscar nominations and two awards for the film (one for Audrey as Best Actress) and another for Edith Head. This film reminds me of the golden age of movies in Hollywood where films were pieces of art put together by collaboration. Gregory Peck is stellar as Jim Bradley. Peck is always the gentleman who lets the Princess have her moment in her debut spotlight. Peck insisted her name be placed above the title and rightfully so.

            "review_title": "A more than usually thoughtful and serious rom-com",
            "content": "In 1952 the beautiful 25-year-old Princess Elizabeth became, quite literally overnight, the most famous woman in the world when she acceded to the British throne. The following year, also the year of Elizabeth's coronation, Hollywood made a film about a beautiful European princess in her mid-twenties. Coincidence? I think not. Scriptwriter Dalton Trumbo did not quite dare call his heroine \"Princess Elizabeth\", but naming her after the Queen's daughter was a pretty clear hint that he had the British monarchy in mind. The blacklisted Trumbo could not publicly take the credit for his story; his Academy Award officially went to his front-man Ian McLellan Hunter. (The Academy's records were later amended to show Trumbo as the rightful winner). I have, however, always thought it strange that an avowed Communist should have written a film which did so much to popularise the idea of monarchy. It just goes to show how misguided the blacklist was; Hollywood Communists (and Trumbo was far from being the only one) did not have much influence even on the films they worked on, and had very little opportunity to make propaganda for their cause. Princess Anne, heir to the throne of an unspecified European country, arrives in Rome during a \"goodwill tour\" of several European capitals. Although the tour consists of little more than carrying out official functions and giving bland, uncontroversial speeches, it has generated tremendous publicity and large numbers of international journalists have been assigned to cover it. Another inspiration for the film may have been the similar \"rainbow tour\" carried out by Queen Eva of Argentina in 1947. (OK, I know that Eva Peron was not officially royalty, but the press tended to treat her as though she were). Tired of her regimented schedule and of formal protocol, Anne escapes from her country's embassy and goes missing for twenty-four hours. During her absence she meets Joe Bradley, an American journalist, who at first does not recognise her, and the two enjoy a day of freedom together. Of course, they end up falling in love, seemingly setting us up for a classic romantic comedy ending. Most rom-coms show how a couple overcome some obstacle to their love, and in Hollywood's alternative reality the differences between Anne and Joe in nationality, social class and rank, would count as obstacles, but not insuperable ones. Any scriptwriter worth his salt could have contrived a plot involving Joe marrying into the Royal House of Ruritania (or wherever Anne is from) or Anne renouncing the throne to become Mrs Joseph Bradley of Boston (or wherever Joe is from).Trumbo, however, clearly realised that in the real world of the 1950s a marriage between Anne and Joe would have been most unlikely and wanted to produce something more realistic. So the film ends without a conventionally happy ending; the couple renounce their love for one another, and Joe also renounces something else. As one of only a handful of people who knows the truth about Anne's disappearance he could land a journalistic scoop which would bring him a lot of money and professional recognition. Out of loyalty to her, however, he passes up the opportunity, allowing the authorities to maintain the convenient fiction that Anne's absence was due to a sudden illness. Yet this double renunciation is not presented as a conventionally unhappy ending either. What matters for Anne is her duty to her family and her country, and the implication of the ending is that her glimpse of freedom and of real life, however brief, has given her greater strength to carry out that duty in future. Joe too will be able to take comfort from beautiful memories of his friendship with Anne and the knowledge that he too has done his duty in \"doing the right thing\". \"Roman Holiday\" was the film which made a star of Audrey Hepburn. She had already had starring roles in British films, but this was her first American film and the first to bring her to international attention. It also brought her first and only \"Best Actress\" Oscar (although in my view it should have been the first of several). Here Audrey shows the qualities which were to make her such an icon over the next fifteen years. Her secret lay not just in her luminous beauty, nor in the way she spoke her lines, nor in her gestures or facial expressions, although these were all important ingredients in her success. She seemed to act not just with her voice, her face or her body but with her whole being; she was not, in the technical sense, a Method actress, but few others had her skill in becoming, not merely representing, the character she was playing. In praising Audrey I should not neglect the others who contributed to the success of this movie. There is her co-star Gregory Peck showing that he could be as effective in comedy as in serious drama; there are some amusing exchanges between Joe and his boss Mr. Hennessy. There is Eddie Albert in an important supporting role as Joe's photographer friend Irving. And then there is the city of Rome itself; the film was shot on location and many of the city's most famous sites (the Coliseum, the Trevi Fountain, the Spanish Steps. etc.) are featured. Budgetary considerations apparently precluded the use of Technicolor, but director William Wyler shows that black-and-white photography could be just as effective in creating a sense of place. The scene in which Peck and Hepburn ride through the streets on a motor-scooter must have done wonders for sales of that particular form of transport. \"Roman Holiday\" is essentially a romantic comedy, but it stands out as a more than usually thoughtful and serious one. It also deserves to be remembered for launching the career of one of the greatest stars of all time. 8/10",

The high-jinx Peck, Hepburn and a bearded Eddie Albert get into are great, but the film also carries a message about high-born people wanting to have some of their privacy respected. The scenes where Peck pretends a great stone mouth has bitten off his arm and where Hepburn hits an Italian secret service man over the head with a violin are tops. Classic comedy with a message. You don't see much of that these days. Don't know how different it would be if it were made any later than the rather straight-laced 1950s, but it's suitable for families without being too straight-laced.",

Eddie Albert (before he reduced himself to TV roles) supporting Peck.

It's fun, lighthearted & wholesome effort, and it hasn't aged one bit.Adding extra depth & tasteful flavours to this Hollywood production is the crisp black-n-white photography, delicate editing & on-location shoots. Gregory Peck delivers a measured input as expected but Audrey Hepburn steals the show with her effortless rendition of a princess longing for a break from her sheltered life. And together they are an absolute delight to watch.Overall, Roman Holiday is by all means a very impressive entry in the careers of its cast n crew, and marks the arrival of the next Hollywood star whose innate charm, modest demeanour & extensive range would make her one of the greatest screen legends in Hollywood. Promising an enjoyable time to anyone n everyone, Roman Holiday is amusing, entertaining & above all timeless. Definitely recommended.",

Bushman (who co-starred in the \"Ben Hur\" Ramon Navarro silent spic in 1923).Both screenplays are interesting, well written, and present a story line totally unpredictable and compelling.The reason \"Roman Holiday\" (1953) is the best of the two wonderful movies is the difference between New York City and Rome.New York City isn't beautiful, and Rome is.At least the way these two great movies show the two cities (I was born in NYC and lived there.....I know NYC has its good points).The royalty shown in Rome know and love good art, dance, and varied good times, and take the time off from their burdens to taste those things.The \"royalty\" shown in New York City (the \"Larrabee\" family industrialist millionaire socialites....America's version of \"royalty\") are dull, efficiency expert, profit hungry machines who object to beauty and loveliness, and try to assassinate it (her) when it (she)....\"Sabrina\" played by the incredible Audrey Hepburn....gets in their way.Roman royalty (played by Hepburn) is better than USA royalty (played by Bogart and family).Hepburn comes out on the good side in both movies...classy princess in one and classy servant in the other, and was never better in her entire actor career.But her \"Roman Holiday\" (1953) movie was the best of all.She played \"good royalty\" (with good values) in \"Roman Holiday\" (1953) and a \"good servant chauffeur's daughter training to become a cook\" in \"Sabrina\" (1954).A role model lady for all to see and savor, the likes of whom have seldom ever been portrayed as well, or with as much class (in both movies) as in \"Roman Holiday\" (1953) and \"Sabrina\" (1954).----------- Written by Tex Allen, SAG Actor.Email Tex Allen at TexAllen@Rocketmail.Com Visit WWW.IMDb.Me/TexAllen for Tex Allen movie credits and biography information.",

If you ever want to just escape from life and enjoy a nice tale of a princess trying to live a normal life and meeting a reporter along the way this is the film for you. Audrey Hepburn in anything is a good watch. But its the chemistry that develops as the movie furthers with Gregory Peck that makes this one special. It can be slow for the first 30 minutes or so but really as the film progresses and they explore the streets of Rome it becomes an instant classic.I have to say, there aren't many characters that are as slick as Gregory Peck's in this movie. He instantly reminded me of all of Cary Grants movies, as he just has a way of demanding attention when hes on screen. As the camera man says, the day was full of memorable images and events that transpire. Audrey Hepburn has to be one of the most beautiful women of all time. No matter the length of her hair, she also has great presence on screen. And the fact that this was her first starring role and won an Oscar for it just goes to show you how much a Hollywood legend she is. This is just one of those movies I will one day show my kids as the type of feel good but also somewhat sad adventure of what life is really about. Its about living life to the fullest as much as you can whenever you can. I really liked that Anne realizes that running away with him is impossible and still goes on to lead her country. Most Hollywood movies don't consider how unrealistic their love stories turn out to be but this one is grounded with reality. The last scene is stuck in my head as it was beautifully written, directed, and acted.One of the only complaints I had was the slow start. It takes awhile for us to get involved with the characters and the first 30 minutes drag a bit. But in reality its a film I will be sure to re-watch multiple times. One of the most enjoyable classic love stories you can find.10/10",

            "content": "#RomanHoliday (1953) :\nBrief Review -\nYour Highness goes on an uncommon, wild trip with common man.. Roman Holiday is that one script which balances two opposite poles - fairy tale and realism. A bored and sheltered princess runs away to enjoy common life for few hours and meets a Journalist. They spend a whole day together and princess does all those wild, nasty things she wanted to do causing both of them falling in love. As a princess she should return to her duties forcing her to sacrifice her love and that's the bittersweet ending. Many people aren't much happy with the climax (it includes me as well) because a romantic comedy deserves a joyful ending. Just imagine if this was made by Frank Capra in 30s with Clarke Gable and Claudette Colbert with screwball, hilarious comedy and that happy ending with interesting conflicts in the climax. It Happened One Night was that one timeless film which has been an inspiration to many stories and Roman Holiday is quite close to it. A rich girl running away and falling in love with a common guy and he's news reporter, very much similiar plot it is. But Roman Holiday takes more time comparatively, comedy and iconic moments are less and it doesn't include right conflicts in the climax. I tried to think that what changes should have been made there in the climax and i really couldn't find nothing. A princess had to return and live with memories forever, that's the best outcome possible. Although, cinematically it isn't classy enough, we really didn't have any other option. William Wyler is a genius and i am not as wise as him to tell him anything but definitely if there's something less in Roman Holiday then it lies in the Climax. Audrey Hepburn won her only Oscar award for the deserving performance. Gregory Peck was decent when he could have been easily better upto his potential. Roman Holiday offers a sweet Romantic Comedy with bitter ending but that's something different you know. Watch it with fair expectations and you will watch repeat for sure.RATING - 7/10*By - #samthebestest",

She is found by an American journalist named Joe Bradley, who takes her home with him (remember, this is an old movie so don't expect any sex). He recognizes her as the princess, but goes along with her when she says that her name is Anya. \"Roman Holiday\" shows the one day that they spend together, and the memories that it will give them.When I saw \"Roman Holiday\" for the first time, I was blown away. It is made simply, and that is what makes it so perfectly beautiful. The story appears to be simple, but when you watch the movie you realize just how complex it is and you feel yourself being drawn into the world that these two characters live in. Since it is an old black-and-white film, you aren't distracted by all the colors and special affects. Instead, you just focus in on the emotions and on the two characters.Audrey Hepburn (in her debut role), truly earned her Oscar for Best Actress. She (her character) grows so much during the movie and you really feel like you know her. Gregory Peck is amazing. His facial expressions are perfect and well beyond anything that most modern day actors could achieve. He holds just the right amount of yearning, pain and total bliss in just one look so that you are immediately captivated. Togetehr, Hepburn and Peck have what I consider to be the best on screen chemistry of all time. I loved it.The ending is perfect (I won't tell you what it is though).

This was Hollywood at its best and it is one the most enjoyable films of all time.Favorite scenes include: the scene where Hepburn first realizes where she is...\" Good Morning,\" she says with a giant smile!

For me, much of Roman Holiday is one sustained perfect moment.In fact, it's hard to believe the entire film takes place over little more than 24 hours. During this short day, Princess Ann rebels from her old life, falls in love and grows up enough to accept her destiny. And she even has time to stop for a haircut and an ice cream en route. Audrey Hepburn's transformation from a VERY young looking girl (honest, she looks 14 when she gets ready to go to bed near the start of the film) to a desirable woman is truly remarkable. No wonder Gregory Peck's character (and, arguably, Gregory Peck himself) fell in love with her. He wasn't alone. The film is nearly 50 years old, and it still holds that same power.In her first major film outing, Hepburn displays fine comic timing, and a sense of bizarre humor. Check out the subtle scene where Ann accepts what she claims is her first cigarette ... and then smokes it like an expert! Considering the temperature averaged around 100 F during filming, she also seems to enjoy her ice cream cone a little TOO much.For me the perfect moment of perfect moments is when Audrey (NOT Princess Ann) reacts with sudden fright when Gregory Peck appears to get his hand bitten off in the Mouth of Truth -- only to break into laughter when Peck pops his hand out of his \"empty\" sleeve with a perfectly timed, \"Hello!\" Apparently, this was a practical joke Peck and Wyler played on Audrey. For a few seconds, the real Audrey Hepburn is on screen for the world to see. It's a moment to cherish.Peck is his usual solid self -- and as a reporter myself, I can identify with the pressure Joe puts himself under to protect his big scoop. I should be so lucky as to find myself on the receiving end of a princess's affections. It's hard to believe that the Eddie Albert who plays Peck's bearded (and skillful) photographer is the same guy who went on to do \"Green Acres.\" He's excellent here, and I'd give my eye teeth to have a cool lighter camera like his.It's sad the film was never made in color, but the black and white gives it such a classy feel, you don't miss it. And if you don't know the ending -- don't let anyone spoil it for you. Just have the hankies ready.This is one of the best films of the 1950s -- a relic of a carefree era long past and the precious debut of an actress who is still mourned years after her loss. .",

To see \"Roman Holiday\" again in 2017 was a moving and wonderful experience. Audrey Hepburn's performance is as fresh and enchanting as I remembered. Perhaps even more. So I arrived to the conclusion that Miss Thompson is talking about a different kind of acting. When a performance travels in time with the same power, decade after decade, for me that's great film acting. In \"Roman Holiday\" she took me with her and convinced me, heart and mind, that she was that princess and I loved her. William Wyler, the wonderful director, knew what he was doing - he always did. By introducing us to Audrey Hepburn he reinforced and reinvigorated his own prodigious legacy. I love Emma Thompson as an actress but she's totally wrong about Audrey Hepburn.",

After Gregory Peck plays his prank, we see Hepburn's (not her character's) genuine reaction. We see that Hepburn is as delicate, innocent and kind as the princess she is portraying. I can watch this scene a dozen times and not get tired of it.Roman Holiday really is the perfect romance film. Hepburn and Peck are not only very attractive leads, but also have a wonderful chemistry. Eddie Albert provides just the right dose of comedy as Peck's sidekick. And the location... I don't think Rome has ever looked more delightful on film. Sure there are a few Italian stereotypes, but hey, it was the 1950's and none of it's done with any mean-spiritedness.***Warning Spoilers***The ending of Roman Holiday, while utterly heartbreaking, is entirely fitting. This was a romance that was too good to last. And yet, when I see the final scene where Peck trudges out of the press conference all alone, I keep hoping that Hepburn will run after him and declare her love and renounce her throne or some such rubbish. If only they had DVD back in 1953, then they could have shot an alternate happy ending.",

She gets a shoes, gets a haircut, and buys a gelato. Today, you might easily spend $150 on those items. It's just so charming to watch that such times existed.Today, you can't make a movie like this. First of all, such innocence wouldn't be believable, and second you can't find an elegant and beautiful actors like young Gregory Peck, and Audrey Hepburn.

            "content": "Despite Gregory Peck's top billing, everyone knows ROMAN HOLIDAY belongs to Audrey Hepburn. Few have ever possessed such \"star quality,\" such command of the audience's attention, from her cat-like eyes to her otherworldly aura. And while so many choose only to remember her as a slender form in a little black dress, she was-- believe it or not-- a fine actress with much more versatility than her harshest critics would give her credit for possessing. Drama, thrillers, period pieces, comedy, musicals-- she could do it all. ROMAN HOLIDAY is a romantic comedy, often deemed a \"light comedy,\" though this suggests a frothiness belied by the movie's strong attention to character development and its bittersweet, quite adult finale.Princess Ann is no lightweight, nothing part. A lesser performer would coast on charisma and the inherent sympathy of the character, but Hepburn puts real thought into how Ann subtly and slowly changes over the course of the story, going from a harrowed, bitter young girl who feels life is passing her by to a mature young woman who has tasted life and love, and now can better appreciate her duties as a leader. The way she carries herself, the way she loosens up as she hangs out with Peck's Bradley, the way her voice even changes-- it's beautiful, a sign she had the makings of a cinema legend from the start.ROMAN HOLIDAY's strengths, however, do not belong to Hepburn alone. There is Gregory Peck as Bradley the cynical yet conscience-torn journalist who, along with the audience, slowly falls in love with Hepburn as they adventure through gorgeous and sunny postwar Rome. George Auric's score evokes a tourist's idea of Italy as well as a fairy tale quality that fits the movie well. Most importantly, there's William Wyler in the director's chair.Wyler was perhaps the ultimate Old Hollywood director: he had an unobtrusive style totally adverse to the self-conscious mise en scene and editing which would dominate film in the 1960s and 1970s. He worked in a variety of genres throughout his long career, with no discernible running themes between them all, separating from so-called auteurs like John Ford or Orson Welles. However, to say his is invisible style does not mean he lacked cinematic skill: he knew cinematic storytelling well, how to place actors in the frame, how to use symbolism or how to parallel scenes without taking a sledgehammer to the audience to make sure they \"get it.\"Hepburn's heyday as a movie star would last another fourteen years after ROMAN HOLIDAY'S premiere, but few of her other films reach the perfection of this charming, gentle comedy. Then again, few movies do in general.",

            "content": "It was about time that I was introduced to one of the silver screen's most graceful beauties. Though I had caught a brief glimpse of her in the Ealing comedy 'The Lavender Hill Mob (1951),' I had not yet seen a film featuring the lovely Audrey Hepburn. Indeed, prior to the release of William Wyler's 1953 romantic comedy, 'Roman Holiday,' neither had most American audiences. The role proved one of cinema's most astounding breakthroughs, and, not only did the film receive three Oscars from ten nominations, but among the wins was Audrey Hepburn for Best Actress in a Leading Role. Despite a considerable age difference between the two leading performances {13 years separated Hepburn and Gregory Peck, already considered an acting veteran} the romantic chemistry between the two stars works faultlessly, and the manner in which Joe Bradley's relationship with Princess Ann gradually transforms from frustration to exploitation to love is so incredibly natural that it must represent one of the finest romances of the 1950s - a lovely \"backwards\" Cinderella story.Princess Ann (Hepburn) is a royal princess from an unspecified European country. Her past weeks have been dedicated to a gruelling, highly-publicised tour of European capital cities, her every minute tightly scheduled. For the duration of her travels, Ann has been forced to maintain the pretense of an elegant, proper monarch, her time expended on tedious official duties. In an excruciating opening dance sequence, which is later contrasted with the jovial celebrations aboard the barge on the Tiber River, Ann is forced to waltz with a progressively older selection of male dignitaries, each more unattractive than the last. Though we're not explicitly told the princess' age {Hepburn was 24 years old at the time, though her character tries to pass herself off as a school student}, such a lifestyle is understandably ill-suited to such a beautiful young lady. One night, after being given a sedative to quell her restlessness, Ann secretly escapes from her country's embassy and decides to enjoy a stroll through colourful Rome. A gruff newspaper journalist, Joe Bradley (Peck), finds her sleeping on a street bench, and begrudgingly takes her back to his apartment.'Roman Holiday' really hits its stride in the second act, once Joe has discovered the Princess' true identity and decides to exploit her innocence for the purposes of an exclusive story. Photojournalist Irving Radovich (Oscar-nominated Eddie Albert, whose performance struck me as surprisingly modern) is dragged along to secretly take photographs, but his apparent inability to take a hint leads to the systematic destruction of his clean clothes. The final touching scene, in which the pair communicate their love and respect for one another through official allusion {\"By all means, Rome. I will cherish my visit here in memory as long as I live\"}, proves particularly powerful. The closing shot, a backward-moving tracking shot following Joe as he retreats from the girl he loves, has a noticeable sense of tragedy about it. Throughout the shot, we are almost waiting for Princess Ann to emerge in the background to proclaim her adoration, but, alas, she never does. After all, life can not always be a fairy-tale, but sometimes one day is enough.",

            "content": "Roman Holiday (1953) is a Romantic Comedy starring Audrey Hepburn as Princess Ann and Gregory Peck as Joe Bradley. Princess Ann seems to have it all- She's beautiful, she's rich, she's classy, and everybody loves her, but inside she feels that something is missing. Princess Ann is sheltered and she wishes that there were more to her life. She runs away from her guardians and falls in love with an American newsman in Rome. The best things about Roman Holiday are the acting of Audrey Hepburn, the overall mood of the film, and the chemistry between the leads.Princess Ann is stunning and perfect. Audrey Hepburn is perfect in every film so it is no surprise that she is lovely here as well. As you are watching this film you will no doubt relate to how she is feeling inside. She has grown up now and she wants to experience the world- the simple things in life that most people experience. She doesn't want to have to be classy all of the time and keep up an act. Her part is very believable and will have you rooting for her to find love.Roman Holiday is the ultimate chick flick because it is a classic romantic comedy. Like most romantic comedies, Roman Holiday combines an interesting couple with great chemistry and unique personality traits with hilarious situational comedy. The conflicts are generally light and entertaining when done well, making it perfect for a Girl's Night In. The way that the two main leads meet is very funny. She was drunk and laying outside. When Princess Ann meets Joe Bradley, you can instantly tell that he is going to be a love interest of her's because of the chemistry between them. He examines her behaviour and makes observations. He takes her to her house in a taxi cab and continuously makes jokes. The whole scene is hilarious and lighthearted and sweet and it will have you hoping that they will get together. Princess Ann is too drunk to speak and Joe Bradley takes her to his house instead. Both Audrey Hepburn and Gregory Peck do a good job at acting in love in the movie and they are a great looking couple. Overall, Roman Holiday is a great classic film that I would recommend to anyone who loves watching old movies. Audrey Hepburn is only 22. She looks much older as she has perfectly formed features, is tall and commands the room. She is always classy in everything she does. Even laying drunk in the street, she looks like a goddess. This movie is spectacular even though the plot is simple. It is hilarious. I love the part where Joe Bradley tries to convince his boss that he actually went to interview the princess when he had not. Overall, the acting of Audrey Hepburn, the overall mood of the movie, and the chemistry and believably of the main leads make this an excellent timeless classic movie to watch.",

            "content": "The early 50s were, amongst other things, a time of fear and paranoia in Hollywood. After the HUAC hearings, it seemed many in the business were more afraid of being accused of being a communist than they were of the communists themselves. And so we see cases like Frank Capra turning down the chance to direct Roman Holiday, even though it appears to be right up his street, because he didn't want any association with its blacklisted screenwriter Dalton Trumbo. You see, good director as he was, Capra worried immensely about his reputation. William Wyler, the eventual director and not such an obvious choice, simply knew a good story when he saw one, and didn't otherwise care who had penned it.And yes, the plot can be vaguely read as a left-wing political statement, although it has to be one of the most gentle and inoffensive of such ever devised. First and foremost it is a light and flighty romantic comedy, and in some ways harks back to screwball comedies of the 30s. What is nice about the humour is that it is all very much by-the-way, mainly coming from supporting characters or situations to one side of the main narrative, like the man dancing with Audrey Hepburn in the opening scene glancing down to see if she managed to get her shoe back on, or Giovanni peering judiciously at Gregory Peck giving money to Hepburn. None of this stuff is quite hilarious, good for a chuckle at the most, but it serves to give the whole thing a light-hearted atmosphere without distracting from the central plot. It's a careful balance \u2013 on the one hand, Roman Holiday is not tragic or passionate enough to be straight romantic drama, but neither is it trivial enough to be a farce.Wyler made the choice to shoot in black-and-white so that the gorgeousness of the Eternal City would not overshadow the intimacy of the story. A couple of years later David Lean would shoot another Italian romance called Summertime in glorious Technicolor, and his picture is none the worse for it. But Wyler and Lean are very different directors, and Wyler's way is to bring out the truth and beauty of a situation through our total focus on people and performance, locations being of secondary importance. Wyler's style as a director seems far more relaxed than usual, although he is actually playing a number of very subtle tricks. Notice how, in the scenes where Hepburn is all \"loved-up\" as a result of her tranquillizer shot, we don't really see her that clearly \u2013 she is often partly obscured or has her head turned away from us, so that all we get is an impression of her state, the wave of an arm or toss of the hair. This stops this extremely exaggerated part of her act outshining her later scenes, when she is more calm and natural, but must appear full of joie de vivre. For these moments Wyler films her front-on with many generous close-ups, and the effect is achieved.However, to quote another great picture from this era, even the greatest magician in the world cannot pull a rabbit out of a hat unless there is already a rabbit in the hat. In other words, this is a fabulous cast that Wyler had at his disposal. Audrey Hepburn is startlingly effective in her first leading role. So many Best Actor or Actress awards go to very intense, emotional performances, but sometimes it's nice to see someone simply capture the essence of a character in happy times, which is what Hepburn expertly achieves here. Peck is pretty good too, but this role is really no stretch for him and he is just going through the motions. Eddie Albert provides some nice moments, mostly comical, but he shows capability for great sincerity in the final scene. There's also a bevy of fine Italian actors, most of whom would sadly never again feature so prominently in a Hollywood picture. Best of these is Alfredo Rizzo as the taxi driver. If that guy had two scenes instead of one he'd have stolen the movie.Had Capra directed this picture, even if he made it shot-for-shot the same as Wyler did, no doubt everyone would call it a shining example of the famous \"Capra touch\". It would probably even have revived his flagging career, which had never really recovered from his split with Robert Riskin. After all, it certainly didn't do any harm to Wyler's, leading on to many more hits and Oscar nods throughout the 1950s. It also turned Audrey Hepburn from an unknown into one of the industry's most bankable stars. Even Dalton Trumbo won an Oscar for his screenplay, although he did it under an assumed name and had to wait until after he was dead to actually receive it. HUAC may have caused a stir, but Hollywood was weathering the storm, and still making good things in spite of the blacklist.",

            "content": "After World War II, the world entered a period of rehabilitation, and businesses began to rebuild themselves, contributing to the rebound of the economy. Due to the world's economic rebound, money slowly started to trickle back into many American households, leaving money for recreational purposes. A young woman who, like many, had been oppressed by the Nazi power in Europe, had just begun her journey in the recreational industry known as Hollywood. A young Audrey Hepburn was sent to attend ballet school and had been dancing ballet during the war time to bring joy to others. The entertainment industry which had been turned into a propaganda machine to ignite civilian support of the war was now being reverted into an enjoyable past time which didn't include the topic of the war in every screening. Unfortunately for America, after the war had ended, the nation entered the Cold War against the USSR. The films that came out during the 1950s were a form of joy and relief in a time of great insecurity in America as the country pa in the Cold War. One of the films which brought back the light and innocence to audiences was Roman Holiday, directed by William Weyler. Starring Gregory Peck and introducing young Audrey Hepburn, the movie captures the innocence and morality of the time, giving us a look back into a world which no longer exists.Although there may not have been complete peace during that time, this film reflects the respect that men had towards women, the chivalry of that time. There has never been such thing as a perfect world, but when considering human morality, there have been times where the world was much more safe and closer to perfect. In the beginning, when Joe Bradly (Peck) finds Princess Anne (Hepburn) asleep on the side walk, he stopped to help her get a cab, and when she was too tired to direct herself home, he took her home and paid for the ride. When at his house, he let her sleep on his own bed while he took the couch. He did not face the same way as the princess to honor her modesty. Keep in mind, throughout this entire time, he had no idea who she was and yet, he was a complete gentleman to this complete stranger who he found laying on the side walk. Today, a pretty well dressed woman would be harassed if she had passed out on the side of the street, or even at a college party. There have been many cases and trials of college boys who rape college girls who were unsuspecting and vulnerable at the parties. No longer is the world where men take care of all women.Now days, just being out alone at night as a young woman puts you at so many risks. Being unable to go out at night without others due to the way people in the world are now, Many people have no respect for others, and are completely self centered, willing to commit crimes against innocent unsuspecting passerby's, to fulfill a need of their own. The children could freely play on the streets and the neighborhood children were all friends, frolicking around, playing games, not video games, and getting fresh air and exercise. Due to the over population of the world now, there sometimes just isn't room for that. With towering apartment buildings, many families can't afford to live in a friendly neighborhood with a back yard and room to run around. They spend much of their afternoons staring at screens and don't get to practice basic social skills which are acquired through the afternoons of outdoor play with other children. Additionally, the family home has changed as no before, families could leave their door open all the time, and never needed to worry about anyone or anything happening to them. This is not the case now days, as burglars and thieves ruthlessly break into homes, stealing the hard earned possessions of the family. In the movie, Roman Holiday, Joe Bradly lives in the semi-crowded city of Rome. He does live in an apartment of sorts, but his building and the ones surrounding it are two story buildings, unlike the skyscrapers today. He is able to leave his door unlocked when he is away, and the only time he locks it during the movie is when Princess Anne is sleeping and he figured out who she was. He locks the door to make sure she doesn't leave as he wants to interview this significant figure, but it locks from the inside and Princess Anne would be able to exit any time she pleased, so he was not holding her against her will. This world no longer exists as there have been many cases of kidnapping of women and holding them against the will in a house as a slave. The safety of a house which is captured in the movie is in a world unlike today's, dangerous and suspicious world.In a less dramatic sense, the world which is filmed in the movie is no longer the same as the economy and technology has changed. In the movie, we see the antique cameras of the paparazzi and audio recorders when they are given the chance to interview Princess Anne. The cars which drive around are what we would consider old classic cars, the types which are mainly for show and collecting now, but then, everyone who drove had a car similar. The nostalgia in this video brings back a world which we have never known, and my never know again. Through pictures, videos, and music, life is preserved to be enjoyed for a time to come. Although this movie was made during a time of great panic and fear in the United States, the directors and film makers created a morally correct , and it brings the audience back to the realistic world with it's twist of an ending.",

Her youth, enthusiasm, sweetness, charm, pretty face and slender figure make a package that is so spectacular it's probably never been surpassed since. It's hard not for anyone not to fall in love with her. And they dress her to show it all off! Gregory, himself tall, dark, handsome and slim, is also remarkable with his comedic style. He also has a charm that is unique to him and is very attractive. They are both the best of actors, and the script let's them shine.What some consider the best scene is when Gregory puts his hand in the mouth of the statue and pretends his hand is being bitten. Audrey's reaction, they say, was completely natural, as Greg's acting was so good it fooled her.Eddie Albert is very good, as is his beard!Of course, when you look at who directed it, Wyler, who made some of filmdom's greatest, like Wuthering Heights, Ben Hur and many others, it may make sense that this movie is so good. But putting together a \"dream team\" has often flopped. But there's no smugness or overconfidence here. Like in the scene when Princess and Reporter separate in front of the palace. The vulnerability and emotion is remarkable. And the end, with the \"making love\", as they used to say, with their eyes, again remarkable.For such a lighthearted movie, it has at bottom a dark theme: the classes cannot mix. The audience feels this as the source of the sadness at the end of the film. It's reminiscent of The Great Gatsby: people can interact with the Rich, thinking they may be treated as equals or even ascend, but in the end the Old Guard accepts no newcomers and even tramples whomever it encounters.A rating score of 10 is the best that can be given in IMDb. This movie rates higher than that.",

            "content": "Stifled by her royal entourage on a trip to Rome, Princess Ann escapes to explore the Italian city on her own. While incognito, she falls in love with an American newspaperman, Joe Bradley. When Bradley learns of Ann's true identity, he finds himself torn between following his nose for news--and turning her into a big story--or the growing affections of his heart.ROMAN HOLIDAY, for me, is what I would call an ideal romantic comedy. Everything in here is utterly delectable and almost perfect with a few minor flaws here and there. I found the plot to be perfect for a romantic comedy. It's almost like a mix of THE LAST HOLIDAY and HOW TO LOSE A GUY IN 10 DAYS but, in this case, the girl is naive on what's going on around her. I also like the story because it has the theme of \"do what you like before you won't ever do it at all.\" The film asks the question: Would you sacrifice your reputation to do what you would love to do despite that you're not supposed to?I also found some of the clever lines very witty and the movie funny. Also, the location of the film is really great. You're being put right in the middle of Rome. The performance by Gregory Peck is weird to describe by me. I could never get PAST his serious role in TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD, which is one of his most well known roles in his acting career. In here, he plays a very charismatic and comedic role. He plays alongside Audrey Hepburn, who also does a great job as the naive princess who's blatantly unaware of the scheming plot going on around her, which I actually thought was sweet. Eddie Albert also did a pretty great job as Peck's companion.When the ending credits rolled, a huge smile spread across my face. I really wasn't expecting this great of a movie. I found very little things to complain about because almost everything in here, in my opinion, is irresistible. Peck and Hepburn have a great chemistry together, which you can especially see in the last few shots of the film. ROMAN HOLIDAY is actually one of the best romantic comedies I've seen in my life because it's my ideal romantic comedy. Funny, romantic, and with a bittersweet ending, you should give this at least one watch before you die. After all, it's a classic for a reason.",

What she finds is American newspaperman Joe Bradley (Gregory Peck), who keeps his profession a secret in order to snag an exclusive story. The pair experience Rome together and begin to fall in love although their relationship is built on deception.This is the film that made Audrey Hepburn a star. She is exquisite as Princess Ann and it's no wonder that she (deservedly) took home the Best Actress Oscar for her performance. Gregory Peck is stalwart as always and has wonderful chemistry with Hepburn. Additionally, Eddie Albert received an Oscar nomination in support for his spirited performance as Joe's photographer pal. The rest of the cast is fairly forgettable but nevertheless quite capable.Possibly the film's best aspect is the Oscar-winning script by then-blacklisted screenwriter Dalton Trumbo. The high-concept story may seem hokey at first but the script wrings every possible bit of drama out of the situation. Of course, watching Hepburn, Peck & Albert together is also just plain fun, which makes the ending all the more affecting.William Wyler's Oscar-nominated direction is good as always and the film features a wealth of quality location work. The film garnered a number of Oscar nominations in technical categories, including art direction-set decoration, cinematography & editing. Meanwhile, the Edith Head costumes won the film it's third of three Oscars.In the end, \"Roman Holiday\" is deservedly lauded as a classic nearly sixty years after its release.

The story is well-known, simply because it works so well and has been told so often. Two mismatched individuals from different worlds find each other by happenstance and slowly begin to fall in love. The reasons for this working so well come down to the leads and their natural presence in front of the camera. This was Hepburn's first leading role and she proves why she remains a beloved figure to this day.It's filled with many wonderful moments and vignettes, with Eddie Albert providing some excellent comedic support as a news photographer. The progression from one scene to the next feels like a natural day of two people getting to know one another.

            "content": "Even today, almost a half-century later, there is excitement in watching \"Roman Holiday.\" How even more thrilling it must have been to be in a 1953 theater, watching this story unfold, and knowing that you were witnessing the birth of a truly remarkable star.Of course, that star is Audrey Hepburn, and her American film debut earned her a Best Actress Oscar and the hearts of millions. Miraculously, \"Roman Holiday\" still holds up and doesn't collapse under the weight of years and myth.The story is simple and well-known (POSSIBLE SPOILERS): Princess Anne (Hepburn) is a young, popular European princess on a goodwill tour of Europe. In Rome, she finally tires of smothering protocol, slips out of her embassy disguised as a schoolgirl, and meets Joe Bradley (Gregory Peck), who takes her on a whirlwind tour of Rome. Bradley is a newspaperman, unbeknownst to Anne, and is recording this carefree day with the intent of selling the story and accompanying photos for a high sum. Of course, Bradley falls in love with Anne; she returns to her duties as princess an even more regal and endearing leader thanks to having discovered love, and Bradley loses some of his cynicism as he forfeits the story (and its price) for the sake of his love.Don't be put off by any details of the plot which may sound trite. Of course, the very idea of a princess running away from the palace to mingle with the commoners requires the suspension of disbelief anyway. The script is so well-written, and the performers are so persuasive, natural and beguiling, one cannot help but believe in it, as well.As Princess Anne, Hepburn never hits a false note. While radiating, even at that early age, the serene elegance that would become her trademark, she also projects a charming awkwardness that fits Anne's naitivity and youth. This writer, I think, fell in love with her in the moment that the Italian hairdresser tells Anne that she is the prettiest girl. There is a moment of shock that crosses Audrey's face, then a shy and utterly delighted smile--as if she's never been told she was pretty before. Such scenes as Anne on an impromptu, reckless spin on a Vespa, could come off as contrived or forced in other hands. Hepburn's joy and exuberance are contagious, and we willingly go along for the ride. The ending, too, is extremely satisfying (SPOILER CNT'D!): Anne, having returned to her royal duties, holds a press conference at which Bradley is present. They can only express their mutual affection and sadness through their eyes--a trick which invites silent-star-mugging, but which Hepburn and Peck carry off effortlessly. At the close of the conference, Bradley remains after all the other journalists have left, perhaps hoping that Anne will reappear. Then, slowly, he walks down a long corridor, toward the exit. Throughout this long sequence, one expects (hopes?) that Anne will reappear, cry \"Joe!\", and rush into his arms as the studio orchestra swells to a big Paramount Pictures finish.But she doesn't. Joe keeps on walking. And, even though our hearts have dropped, it is the perfect ending. A \"fairy tale\" ending would have cheapened and lessened the film. Instead, there is the bittersweet knowledge that Anne has learned through her one-day experience of complete freedom (her perfectly-played confrontation scene with her advisors and chaperones, as well as the press conference scene, conveys this wonderfully), and Joe has learned a few lessons as well.This is as good a time as any to point out that, though Hepburn obviously steals the show, Peck is a fantastic leading man. Combining Cary Grant's smoothness with Bill Holden's ruggedness, Peck is the ideal match for Hepburn's first major pairing. He doesn't overshadow her, but neither is he a colorless sop. Eddie Albert is also extremely engaging as Irving, the smart aleck photographer, and Paolo Carlini is adorable as the Italian hairdresser who cuts Princess Anne's locks, and tells her how pretty she is. He may have been the first; we have lined up to echo his sentiments ever since.",

I never heard much adoration about Audrey Hepburn in her lifetime, but for some years now I've heard many nice things said about her. She wears the costumes well, here. There is the regal princess gown, the casual town ensemble and then there is the white suit at her ending interview. Gregory Peck was fine. He had a lot of tongue in cheek humor. Some of his winks and nudges didn't quite hit well with the slow witted character portrayed by Albert. Nice scenery and location shots. This was post-World War Two Italy. There was an outdoor market.

As a three-year-old, the real Princess Anne was probably oblivious to the shenanigans of her namesake Princess Ann. As an adult, with her divorce and all, she has shared the unruly instincts of Hepburn's Ann, but perhaps lacked the talent for self-sacrifice evidenced when that Ann limited her association with journalist Joe Bradley (Gregory Peck) to 24 hours of fun.",

Audrey Hepburn as the princess of a small country plays the role of a royal icon on a visit to Rome. The royal visitor manages to escape for some fun with journalist Joe Bradley (Gregory Peck) and photographer Irving Radovich (Eddie Albert). Made shortly after a youthful Elizabeth II came to the throne of Great Britain, this movie shows how public and media fawned over young royals. To a large extent, this is still as true as ever. A number of vignettes liven up this wonderful romantic comedy. The shoe scene is a light treatment of the perfection required by royals at every public moment. The hand in the mouth of the ogre gag is nicely pulled off by Gregory Peck. A night out dancing by the Tiber turns into a hilarious brawl. The spontaneous decision to have a haircut turns into a delightful change of hairstyle for the young princess.The show is still enjoyable today because royal ornamentation is always stunning and the story is a classic. Filmed entirely in Rome, the DVD version I saw is sharp in black and white with landmarks like the Spanish Steps and the Trevi Fountain making grand backgrounds as action takes the viewer from palace to marketplace to bachelor apartment. This has to be one of Audrey Hepburn's signature roles, even though she was very young. Peck had already made his mark but is still youthful enough to pursue the princess. He is a great actor who always seemed to move and perform almost effortlessly in his early roles during the forties and fifties, as he does in this one. Eddie Albert is outstanding as his press buddy assigned to the royal tour. Another achievement in the great body of work by director William Wyler.",

            "review_title": "Still The Best Romantic Comedy Ever Made",
            "content": "William Wyler, arguably one of the best directors of all-time, is my all-time favorite. Few directors covered the spectrum of genres in a way that did, from the epic historical film of \"Ben-Hur\", to one of the best World War II dramas in \"Mrs. Miniver\", to epic western in \"Big Country\", to the masterpiece of soldiers returning home from war in \"The Best Years of Our Lives\" to the best romantic comedy of all-time in \"Roman Holiday.\"There have been many great romantic comedies made over the years, but what puts Roman Holiday over the top for me, is the setting (how can you go wrong with Rome), the story (simple yet captivating tale of a princess desiring a day away from the oppressive job she has) to the performances of the actors themselves. Audrey Hepburn was every bit the princess she portrayed, and to basically \"knock it out of the park\" in her first film role, still ranks as one of the greatest debut performances in cinematic history.Gregory Peck is perfect in his role of Joe Bradley of the American Press Service, who is living a meager life in Rome. It's fairly obvious that he lives paycheck to paycheck, often losing much of it in poker games with his friends and co-workers. It's quite obvious that he's not all that fond of his job. However, like a man who's finally holding the winning lottery ticket, Joe finally seizes an opportunity to turn things around for himself. The big question of the film is: will he cash it in?Princess Ann is at the other end of the spectrum. A European princess of vast wealth and prestige has grown weary of the in-and-out days of drudgery, tedious schedules, and evenings of crackers and milk for a snack. Every day seems the same as the last. She decides to escape from her life and unwittingly finds herself in Joe Bradley's apartment after he mistakenly thinks she's just a silly, drunken girl.Upon finding out who she really is, Joe decides to do whatever it takes to stay within Ann's circle (as she is operating under the name of Anya) to get the story of the year. Upon hearing Ann's desire to have some time around Rome, he wisely suggest a holiday; a day to do all of the things she's always wanted. It's here that the story really takes off and the chemistry between Joe and Ann begins to deepen.The film is simply a wonderful delight. We feel as though we've been given our own holiday in this classic fest. However, as with all good things, it must all come to an end. I was thrilled the Wyler didn't go for any cheap gimmicks or tricks to keep them together or bog the generally light story down in needless melodrama.The last scene of the film is perfectly done with perfect tough and sweetness. The brief looks and exchanges between Joe and Ann demonstrates that neither one has given over to selfishness or greed. Joe assures her (after she realizes who he is) that he has no intention of ever writing the story. And Ann assures him that, not only is her trust and faith in him warranted, but that she will always cherish him and the day that they had together.As good as the cast is, it really is Audrey Hepburn who makes the film work so well. I truly cannot imagine any other actress in this role. She was the epitome of sweetness and innocence mixed with a rebelious nature not unlike a young woman who's finally grown up a bit by the film's end. She sees the life she could have but knows that she can never have it. The moment between Hepburn and Peck in the car before she returns to the palace is tender and heart-breaking and performed perfectly by both. But it's the end that I found truly touching, as a last look is exchanged in a slightly tearful farewell.Of all of Hepburn's work, this one is still my favorite, and it's a film and a story that I never get tired of. For every once in a while, I treat myself to a holiday by watching this movie one more time.",

Even today, this film's plot and writing seems fresh and original. One reason I enjoyed this film so much was because few films of this type can make me care so much about the main characters. Although the ending disappointed me slightly and wasn't the ending I would have chosen, I realize that the film went for a more realistic and believable ending, and I compliment Hollywood for that. If you want the film to end perfectly, it may not be for you.

Usually the result is an obnoxious royal whining about housework or expecting to still be waited on hand and foot by others, but this is the exception. Audrey Hepburn's princess is charming and innocent. She takes delight in trying for the first time simple things others take for granted, like eating ice-cream, dining at a quaint open-air cafe, going sightseeing, even just getting to choose her own haircut (which is completely adorable!), and it's that childlike wonder of experiencing life for the first time that draws us into her character. I'm sure that's also what draws Gregory Peck's reporter in. He sees nothing wrong, at first, with selling out the young princess for the sake of a bet and a news scoop, but through the course of the day's events, he finds himself genuinely falling for her. In the end, love wins out, and though he really could use the money, he finds he can't betray her. In a more modern movie, we would expect the two to run off together, but in a way I think it's better as it is. She knows it would be selfish to abandon her family and countrymen that way, and that's not who she is. But even good responsible princesses could use a holiday once in a while.",

It will give you goosebumps. This is a true classic, one which hasn't lost its magnificence even 70 years down the line. 4 out of 5 for this. Very highly recommended for all the rom-com lovers.",

            "content": "There are many stories concerning the Royal families of Europe, and occasionally a sliver of truth concerning one of them is factual which lends much to this Hollywood offering. This story is a comedy and called \" Roman Holiday. \" It was originally written by Dalton Trumbo the Black Listed screen writer, but the movie credit was given to others. However with William Wilder as director little is lost from the original script. The story is of a down-on-his-luck American writer named Joe Bradley (Gregory Peck) who happens upon a sleeping Princess (Audrey Hepburn) who has escaped from her strict, regimented and enclosed life behind the royal gates. Realizing his incredible luck, Joe takes full advantage of the situation, but pretending he knows nothing of her real Identity and hopes to acquire a Scoop for his newspaper. Enlisting the help of Irving Radovich (Eddie Albert), a close photographer friend, he takes the Princess out for a Holiday. Although it's a comedy, dull slap-stick adds little to the mostly slow, but poignant sympathetic situations. The main emphasis zero's in on Peck and Hepburn's increasing romantic tension. As a result, their Holiday is a fun escapade through the streets of the eternal city. One which becomes more memorable as the years accumulate for their fans. ****",

            "content": "Melodrama. The first and one of the most famous roles of the beauty Audrey Hepburn. So it's time to finish the marathon of paintings with her participation. What can I say - it was interesting, exciting, and even fun to some extent. This picture was specially left \"for dessert\" in order to get the maximum viewing pleasure - and did not regret it. And here is my brief opinion - a breathtaking day in the Eternal City. I note right away that I do not intend to talk about the minuses, because there are none. Well, it's more true, though it will already be in the field of nit-picking, so I don't intend to hammer your head with them. Therefore, I will dwell on the expressive virtues of this legendary picture, which for all the years that have passed since its release in hire has become a classic of world cinema.\nSo here they are:\n1. Romantic story - the young Princess Anna arrives on an official visit to Rome, but endless receptions, presentations, social events tire her so much that one day she decides to escape. She is found by a casual passerby who turns out to be an American journalist who has a unique chance to collect exclusive material. Will he be able to do this? How will a princess hide her social status? What comes of all this? Pure romance, uncomplicated, maybe a little pathetic and pretentious, but so attractive. The princess and the journalist, in two hours of timing, go through a series of funny, dramatic, and simply interesting adventures, which are not only interesting to watch, but even want to travel to the other side of the screen and join the heroes. Many critics, and the audience both here and in the West, consider this romantic story the best in the cinema - I strongly disagree! I have a story that interrupted this, but this is pure subjectivity. Personally, I liked this story, but I simply have no right to call it the best, because my heart has already chosen another!\n2. Rome - the first Hollywood picture, which was completely shot in Europe - and this is felt. The beauty of the Eternal City is presented in all its glory. Connoisseurs of history and tourists will surely recognize many of the monuments where the main characters visited throughout the painting. And although not all of them were able to be shown, this fact delivers aesthetic pleasure. Even despite the fact that the picture is black and white, she managed to convey the full power of the charm of these ancient ruins left over from the once greatest empire on planet Earth.\n3. Humor - I was very pleased with this fact, because all the comedic moments were a success. Absurdities, sometimes antics, sometimes tough jokes - all work on the images of heroes. No comedic moment will cause a violent reaction here, but a light smile and laughs are definitely guaranteed for you!\n4. Final - but it was really a surprise. He is happy on the one hand and sad on the other. But it is definitely logical. The whole mood of the picture and the behavior of the main character hint at him. I still have not decided how I feel about him. On the one hand, I understand the heroes and I'm sad, on the other, I'm happy, because sometimes circumstances are much stronger than us. I counted on the well-known outcome, but this is a fairy tale, a tale of a princess and a commoner, magnificent, unforgettable, sensual. Here it is.\nA little about the main characters:\n1. Princess Anna performed by Audrey Hepburn is the young heir to the throne. A little eccentric, partly naive, spoiled girl who wanted adventure on her own head. How could she know what this hasty decision would lead to? The beautiful Audrey beautifully played the young princess, who during the timekeeping was transformed and experienced love - this is an eternal feeling, without which it is very difficult for a person to remain himself. Bravo Audrey!\n2. Joe Bradley performed by Gregory Peck - a journalist who picked up a stranger and brought to his own house, until he accidentally found out who she was. At first, he behaves prudently and cynically, which results in a sea of various funny situations, but gradually awareness comes to him. Gregory perfectly embodied the role of man as one of the most unscrupulous professions on Earth. At first you cannot empathize with his hero, but the further, as they say, the more interesting. Bravo Gregory!\nThe picture was a resounding success at the box office, only in America the fees were quite modest. Even the premiere in the Soviet Union was very warm. Even the censors of the party were concerned about the extraordinary success of this melodrama. It was melodramas, not a romantic comedy, the script for which was written by the famous Hollywood screenwriter Dalton Trumbo, who in those years suffered greatly for \"sympathy for the Communists\", because of which his name was crossed out of their picture captions. Only two decades later, justice was restored.\nIt's time to take stock of this marathon, and I'm confused. I can't choose the best picture with Audrey, although I looked at five of them, and in all Audrey was amazing and gorgeous. I do not know what to do!\nAs a result, we have an excellent melodrama about the breathtaking adventures of a young princess and a cunning journalist, with a good romantic story, excellent views of the Eternal City and wonderful acting. Audrey and Gregory duet - great!",

A very clever movie that has an interesting subtext (the movie is in many ways a quiet celebration of the lies we tell each other, and sees love as a kind of mutually-accepted illusion) and seems ahead of it's time: this is the first movie I know of to see not just riches, but more specifically celebrity, as a kind of prison.Rome looks lovely here.",

Hepburn's character wishes to be free of royal duties for a day, a whim which Bradley facilitates.The 1950s witnessed a wave of \"travelogue movies\" (\"Summertime\", \"To Catch a Thief\" etc), a wave to which \"Holiday\" belongs. Much of the film consists of Hepburn and Peck frolicking amidst beautiful Mediterranean scenery, she elegantly poised, he immaculately chiselled. Charming, frothy and fantastical, the film was one of Wyler's attempts at emulating the comedies of Billy Wilder and Ernst Lubitsch. \"Holiday\" finds Hepburn as a commoner playing a princess playing a commoner. In real life she was the sickly child of a dead aristocratic line. She was then plucked from obscurity to become the princess of 1950s/60s style and fashion. It's a rags to riches journey which most of Hepburn's films (\"Sabrina\", \"My Fair Lady\", \"Funny Face\" etc) are themselves about.7.9/10 \u2013 See Vincente Minnelli's \"The Clock\" for a better, similar picture.

But it is on a recent list of \"best\" movies so I snagged my opportunity when I found it at my local public library. The DVD is very nicely done, with interesting extra features.Just in her early 20s, this is the film that got Audrey Hepburn noticed. Gregory Peck was approaching 40, and Eddie Albert was approaching 50. But the three of them are just wonderful together in this caper.Gregory Peck is Joe Bradley, in Rome with the American News Service. By all indications, including owing 2 months' back rent on his very modest apartment, the money was not flowing in.Audrey Hepburn is British Princess Ann, heir to the throne, forced by \"duty\" to make appearances all over but otherwise very tightly controlled. She longed to break out of her chains.One evening, feeling particularly moody, her handlers gave her a shot of something to help her sleep, but she managed to crawl out of a window at the British Embassy in Rome and escape by hiding in a laundry truck that shortly left. She found herself at night in a strange place and as luck would have it was discovered by Bradley as she slept on a bench. He tried to get a taxi to take her somewhere but practically incoherent she ended up sleeping at his place.At first Bradley has no idea who she is, but when he realizes she is the Princess sees an opportunity for a real story and some real cash, $5,000. He recruits his friend, Eddie Albert as photographer Irving Radovich, to help out (for 25%) by snapping exclusive photos of the Princess on her one-day \"holiday\" all around Rome. She thought he was just being nice to help her sight-see, he looked at it as strictly a business opportunity.Ann finds out how it is to live like a real person, but in the end she returns to her Princessly duties, and finds out who Bradley and Radovich really are, as she fields questions from them and a host of other newsmen. Their secret safe, as Bradley has too much respect for her to sell the story, and both their lives are changed for the better, as a result of this one magnificent day.",

Also it was filmed in beautiful black and white that really adds to the picture.The screenplay by Ian McLellan Hunter and John Dighton is very charming. With a script this good you can see why so many marquee stars of Hollywood were attracted to this project. Many memorable scenes stem directly from the witty dialog.The acting in the film is, of course, amazing. Audrey Hepburn screen debut is the one she received her, regrettably, only Oscar for. But boy did she deserve it. As soon as I start talking about Ms. Hepburn I speak only in hyperbole. Obivously the best actress ever, bar none, Her screen presence, charm and beauty radiate off the screen. Gregory Peck does a pretty good job himself though. He slowly becomes intoxicated with Ms. Hepburn throughout the movie, as I'm sure any man would in a similar situation. Eddie Albert is thrown into the mix for some comic relief and he is quite funny but the movie is really about the two leads.Set in the stunning beauty of Rome this is one of my all-time favorite romantic comedies.

The scene at the \"Mouth of Truth\" is fantastic.Second, the bad stuff.  (1)  Gregory Peck just does not fit Audrey Hepburn. He lacks her light touch.  He is a bit wooden --- just like Humphrey Bogart in Sabrina.  I thought that Gary Cooper was a better romantic lead in \"Love in the Afternoon\".  (2)  I am always uncomfortable when Italian characters are portrayed as a type of buffoon.  (3)  A princess on the lam is a great idea, but monarchy as a real institution, as portrayed in this movie, has very little meaning anymore.  I realize that Queen Elizabeth was crowned a couple of years before this movie was made, and the pomp, mystique, and the royal ethic of self-subordination were probably still very much alive.

            "content": "Roman Holiday is a strong film in all areas. It gives two actors an incredible script and puts it to the beautiful backdrop of Rome to make one of the most memorable rom coms and creates two instantly recognisable characters. The combination of both humour and genuine sentimentality makes this film highly memorable and definitely worth the watch if you get the chance. The plot outline is simple enough. A sheltered princess escapes her guardians meets a boy and begins to fall in love. It's a clich\u00e9d story that's been done before the film was released and has been reused many times since. But whilst it does meet the clich\u00e9s of the Romance genre, it uses them well and proves that the clich\u00e9s can still be great. Together Peck's great charm mixed with the kind and playful nature of Hepburn makes for one of the most memorable romances put to film. At first they don't seem to have any real affection for each other with both of them using one another for their own benefit. Hepburn lies so she can have a day of freedom and Peck lies as he wants nothing more than a good story.But over the course of the film we really begin to see genuine affection grow between the two. It never feels forced, but instead evolves naturally as they begin to enjoy the others company more and more over the course of the day by becoming more playful with one another and bonding because of it. Largely this is because both Peck and Hepburn's brilliant on screen chemistry with moments like the Mouth of Truth scene being entirely improvised to add realistic charm to all their scenes. Mixed with this is the beautiful and romantic backdrop of Rome with their exploration over the city containing many memorable and beautiful settings. Everywhere they go is as new to the leads as it is to us allowing us to experience their journey with them. On top of this the beautiful sights go with the couples growing relationship to create an even greater feeling of romance.",

            "content": "I know Roman Holiday won Audrey Hepburn an Oscar and made her an instant star, so I might be the only person in the world to say this, but I wish the producers had won out on their original choice to play the princess: Elizabeth Taylor. The second choice was Jean Simmons, but she couldn't get out of her studio contract, so I've read, and William Wyler became attached to Audrey Hepburn's screen test. The rest is history.Think about it, though. Elizabeth Taylor would have been perfect! She absolutely could have handled the royal scenes, and when the princess runs away from the palace in search of adventure, young Liz would have given a wonderful, wide-eyed, innocent, curious, charming, mischievous performance\u2014a performance I didn't feel from Audrey Hepburn. Audrey came across as entitled, snobby, and worst of all, knowledgeable. The princess is supposed to be innocent, with a thirst for knowledge. She wants to see Italian landmarks, smoke her first cigarette, go to a nightclub, and get her hair cut. Audrey seems like she's already done all those things. Liz would have been better. And Jean Simmons would have been perfectly fine.Audrey's performance aside, there are two other actors who share the screen with her: Gregory Peck and Eddie Albert. They play a slacking reporter and photographer who discover the runaway princess and plan to write a front page news story about her. The rapport and snappy dialogue between them is pretty funny, but overall, I find Roman Holiday an overrated film. It's a light romance, and somehow was elevated to multi-Oscar winning, ultra-classic status. Whenever I watch it, I try and take it for what it is.",

Yeah, one of \"those\".It's a truly wonderful picture. Peck and Audrey and Eddie Albert and all of the supporting cast are terrific.This last viewing, I noticed the hair stylist more than I ever had before and found Ann's reaction to his admiration of her just so... sooo ... well, watch it and you'll see what I mean.All in all, it's deserving of its \"classic status\" and a \"must see\"...many times !",

It proved to be the most dissapointing of the three. Which is too bad, as the story had potential, and was filmed on location in Rome, Italy. Their were a number of issues, which interfered with my enjoyment of it. Firstly, the lack of chemistry between Peck and Hepburn. We have to wait until near the end, when they kiss, before we finally feel the romance. Secondly, Eddie Albert is annoying and his acting sucks. Thirdly, it fails to show the city of Rome in an intimate way. (Was that now why it was filmed there?) All we get are some scenes with famous locations serving as a backdrop. Fourthly, the ending is schmaltzy with a capital S, and drawn out to the point that you will start twiddling the convertor.",

The lightness of the situations and comedic touch amaze from the moment you meet the characters. As an experienced cinema lover, I should probably be thick-skinned and impervious to the little visual jokes but here the warmth and childish manner of the exposition melts my cold heart and gives clumsy sweet giggles.As soon as I saw Gregory Peck I knew that this is a real kind of man in front of me. Truly, the first impression knocks a person from own sneakers with looks and demeanor that represent an utmost gentleman. Although deeper into the story you'll get to see the sneaky-snake alter ego of a reporter the affection to him will always be there.The picture brings us to Rome and as a skilled tour guide for a day shows marvelous places of the city that wake the spirit of adventure and force you to book tickets straight away. It is still unbelievable how so many events are put all the way through the plot without the feeling of being cramped together.I could go on for hours but I should just say that the movie left me the pest of possible memories, unspoiled and genuinely romantic. For what it's worth I recommend to watch it as soon as two free hours pop into your tight schedule.",

            "content": "William Wyler gets a great performance out of Gregory and Audrey. And the film received more than its share of awards. There are more than the average number of comments re this film.I saw this film in the theaters shortly after it came out, and was captivated by it. However, I recently watched it on TCM and thoroughly enjoyed it again.But...I could not watch it this time without wondering about some practical considerations. Dalton Trumbo is a great writer, despite his erroneous political beliefs. Was it Trumbo who created this fantasy about Audrey being a Princess from an Eastern European Country. Come on Dalton, all of Eastern Europe was under Joe Stalins's dictatorship in 1953. What remained of the Central and Eastern monarchies after WWI, was completely demolished by Stalin and the Communists. Isn't that what their revolution was about.Trumbo's dialog in the first minutes of the film makes it quite clear, that Audrey who in real life was born in Holland, is an Eastern European Princesses whose mission is tie her imaginary Eastern Monarchy with Western Europe. I began to wonder if Trumbo was trying to exonerate himself from his pro-red tag, by writing this endearing film that is a fantasy. In the last scene of the film I couldn't help but laugh at the \"polite\" press corps. I doubt whether there would have been many at Audrey's press briefing, but if there was an interest in her, the press would have not been as polite as shown. In reality, there would have been a mob scene as reporters and especially photographers grappled with each other.For those who find my observations picky, I apologize. This film is great despite my observations because it is an implausible love story that is credible with my above noted exceptions. The Roman background of post war Rome was a reminder to those who watched this film originally, that Europe was finally getting out from under the ruble of WWII. This is a wonderful love story without naked bodies doing all sorts of things that were better off left to our own wicked imaginations. This film lives on, as we forget the semi-pornographic films that have replaced gems such as Roman Holiday.",

            "content": "This is still the quintessential Audrey Hepburn movie. If you think Angelina Jolie, Julia Roberts, and Kate Winslet are the essence of Hollywood beauty but have never seen Audrey Hepurn, you are missing out on one of the greatest of screen icons. Although there are wonderful actresses who have graced many-a Hollywood film, there is only one Audrey Hepburn. She may be the greatest Hollywood female icon of all time in terms of her combination of acting, demeanor, charm, intelligence and personality. There was always an innocently vulnerable, adolescent quality to Audrey Hepburn, even when she was much older. Simultaneously, she had this spunky mischievous side to her that shines through in \"Roman Holiday\"--innocent curiosity that has been immortalized in the two decades she graced the large screen. And of course she was one of the most enduringly beautiful women in the history of film. \"Roman Holiday\" is Hepburn doing what she does best.The premise of \"Roman Holiday\" is a bit of a Hollywood contrivance, but the dialog and the acting save it from becoming corny. It is Cinderella in reverse. The essential plot concerns Audrey Hepburn as a royal princess from a \"nameless\" European country. (Even one supporting character reaffirms that the country will remain nameless.) She is bored with her overly protected life which is so highly structured and ceremonial that even when she inadvertently loses her shoe during a high-class engagement, retrieving it becomes an act of refined etiquette. She is in Rome, one stop on a European tour with her entourage of dignitaries, and residing at her country's embassy. Anxious to leave, if only for a moment, the gilded cage of her life of royal obligation, she sneaks out of the embassy and enters the heart of Rome via a food truck.Later she ends up drunk and unconscious on a Roman sidewalk. And guess who should happen by but Gregory Peck as Joe Bradley, second-rate American reporter who would like nothing more than to get the scoop of the century and hop back to the New York press scene. But of course he doesn't know who she is. Being a relatively good Samaritan, he rescues her from the streets and brings her into his studio apartment. All the while it is unbeknown-st to him that she is the princess who is having a press conference the following morning in which he is scheduled to attend for his newspaper. Despite the fact that she is still the epitome of ultimate cuteness (young women like Hepburn always look the cutest when they're sleeping), he dumps her on his couch while she is still amidst her drunken stupor. The next morning, however, his feelings toward her do a 180 when he realizes who she really is. It would be a great story, worth $5000, for a reporter whose career has stagnated to get an exclusive interview with the princess. And he solicits friend and press photographer Irving (Eddie Albert) for pictures to prove the story. At first the movie is a kind of madcap scheme to get the story at all costs. Some of the funniest moments are when Albert meets Hepburn and Peck at a caf\u00e9 and Peck has to figure out a way to tell his colleague about the circumstances without letting on to naive Hepburn. But then the story begins to develop into something else as the relationship between Hepburn and Peck evolves into something deeper. And the ending of the movie is bitter-sweet saving the story from becoming pure sap.There is no question that this movie is rather schmaltzy by 21st-century standards. The story is a fantasy-comedy, but the writing and the acting which never lapses into too much sentimentality save the film, which could have been much sillier and much more syrupy. The sobering ending makes the film much better than it could have been. And of course Audrey Hepburn who essentially made her major screen debut steals the show. Best to see this one with your significant other and some clean-ex.",

I sure didn't think that the end would be that bittersweet. Actually, I ended up throwing my empty tissue box at the television set and yelling at Peck to turn right around and run into Hepburn's arms. But, of course, he didn't. What else can I say? Audrey was fantastic, as usual. She was graceful, witty, goregeous, and most of all, charming. Gregory Peck was delightful, sneaky, and pretty handsome. I adored this movie. It is a must see.

Spending the entire film travelling around one particular location, the film can become disjointed as the story is sacrificed in favour of simply showing the sights. Luckily though, \"Roman Holiday\" never succumbs to this problem. Travelling around Rome, the film might include major areas of Rome's history, but never at the expense of the love story between Gregory Peck and Audrey Hepburn. Working well together, the two leads make this story a beautiful tale of love and happiness.Audrey Hepburn plays Princess Ann. As a member of a royal house, she faces countless chore like duties. One night however, she sneaks away with the intention of truly experiencing life. Being found by journalist Joe Bradley (Peck), she is shown the sights of Rome as Bradley helps her to achieve all of the dreams she'd always wished for.Despite sounding like an unlikely partnership, the way Hepburn and Peck work together on this film is breathtaking. Winning an Oscar for her performance, Hepburn thrills as the innocent princess who learns about life and love all in a day. Peck by the same accord is equally superb with his eye on a story, and the money it'll bring. Showing the changes in the two characters as they spend time together, the two leads are wonderful. Unfortunately because the film was released in the same year as \"From Here To Eternity\" and \"Julius Caesar\", Peck never even received an Oscar nomination for his performance. This might seem unfair considering most other years he would be probably looking at actually winning the award itself.With some wonderful jokes, and some amazing moments, \"Roman Holiday\" never ceases to thrill. Hepburn deservedly won the Best Actress Oscar for this role, and it was this which made her a star. Teaming up with Gregory Peck, she thrives as the two produce one of the most beautiful romantic stories ever told. Two fine performances, amazing scenery and a great plot, make this one holiday to remember forever.",

The two leads are played flawlessly by Audrey Hepburn and Gregory Peck, two of my all-time favorites. Hepburn is charming as always and Peck is as classy as ever.In this viewing, I paid more attention to the writing and dialogue, and some of the comedy is pure genius. The ending is different from the rest of the movie and is done in a different tone. It's not funny, yet not sad. It's not satisfying, yet not disappointing. I feel like everyone in the audience can relate to Peck, slowly walking down the Sala Grande Galleria, lost in his thoughts of what could have been. Cue the end credits.This is just one of those rare timeless love stories that I will forever consider one of my favorites. Guaranteed to enjoy.",

She was just *perfect* for the role, I can't imagine it being done by anyone else.o Gregory PeckIt is well known that Cary Grant was originally offered the part, and I'm a huge Cary Grant fan, and consider him my favorite actor. But hands down, Peck was the right man for this role. He has a great chemistry with Hepburn that I don't think Cary could've pulled off.o RomeRome is absolutely delicious in this film. Just a couple years ago, I had a wonderful vacation in Rome, and watching this film brought it all back for me. Scene after scene after scene, I was going \"I was there!\" or \"I know that place!\" Rome is a wonderful city, and the decision to film entirely on location there really puts the movie over the top.Finally, for those who wonder what country Audrey was the princess of, well, while the movie never explicitly states it, the answer is obvious: Freedonia.",

            "content": "Roman Holiday (1953): Dir: William Wyler / Cast: Audrey Hepburn, Gregory Peck, Eddie Albert, Hartley Power, Harcourt Williams: Engaging romantic comedy about adventures beyond our usual psyche. Audrey Hepburn plays a Princess who is bored with the meaningless schedules and wishes to partake in normal activities. Seizing the opportunity she runs away one evening but is discovered by a reporter, played by Gregory Peck who mistakes her for a drunken teenager. When newspapers announce that the Princess is ill as a cover-up, Peck realizes who his guest is and participates sight seeing about Rome while his photographer sneaks snapshots. Beautiful film full of hilarious situations and an ending worth applauding. Director William Wyler previously made Mrs. Miniver. Here he highlights normality and showcases exquisite Rome. Hepburn is hilarious in her innocence while Peck is wonderful as the scheming reporter overcome by guilt. Eddie Albert makes a great foil as Peck's willing photographer. In limited supporting roles Hartley Power plays his editor who engages in a bet and never fully realizes how far ahead he truly was. Other roles are rather one dimensional but viewers will be likely focused on Hepburn's radiant energy. One of the greatest of romantic comedies. It celebrates normality while honesty makes this just about the best holiday ever filmed. Score: 9 \u00bd / 10",

Audrey Hepburn, as other people have pointed out, was basically the Julia Roberts of her day. Looked alright, wore nice hats, had what people would consider good fashions (although if I want good fashions, I'll watch a film from the 1930s or 1940s), and couldn't act her way out of a paper bag with a blowtorch. Also, both had (have) rather large mouths with what appear to be four dozen teeth in them. Audrey Hepburn is shoved so far down the throats of us classic film fans that I just don't know how people still like her. Or Bette Davis. Or Liz Taylor. Or Marilyn Monroe. Or Grace Kelly. Or Ingrid Bergman. Or Katharine Hepburn.Okay, I'll stop before people start throwing things at me.I haven't seen enough of Gregory Peck to decide if I like him or not. He was quite good looking in the 1940s, in that real Henry Fonda-esque 'teacher fresh out of college' way. He was terrible in this film, so I don't know how I think of him as an actor. Maybe it was his female lead. Eddie Albert I like, although I may be biased towards him because Green Acres is the only TV show I can watch full episodes of.The plots lifts quite a lot from It Happened One Night- as it may have been pointed out. Of course, they changed the main female character from a heiress to a princess, changed the locale from the USA to Rome, changed the ending so the two leads don't end up together (the only good part of this film) , took out the famous hitchhiking scene and replaced it with a brawl at a party, and crammed the adventures of the two leads into a day.It doesn't work. The ending change just screwed things over. Speaking of screwed, It Happened One Night was a screwball comedy. Because screwball was a dead genre by 1945, they slowed the dialogue down so that 1953 audiences could understand. It doesn't work.How the heck did Audrey Hepburn win an Oscar for this film? Were there no other good female performances in the year 1953? Okay, so it was the year of Torch Song (compared to that film, Roman Holiday is the greatest picture ever made), but there were other good female performances. I think.So, I'm in the minority, but I'm going to say that unless you have nothing better to do and you really, really want to watch this film, go ahead. But watch It Happened One Night after. And maybe The Princess Comes Across, if you feel like it.You might like this film: I did not.",

It's simply a magical combination of diverse and unreproducible elements that came together one magical summer in Rome.Audrey Hepburn, a young beautiful, multilingual war refugee was just catching the attention of the film world after abandoning a dance career. Everything in her background made her the ideal modern day princess.Gregory Peck, having established himself as the first great postwar leading man, in the mold of Jimmy Stewart, Clark Cable and Gary Cooper, was looking to demonstrate his comic chops and loved the script.William Wyler, a deft and non doctrinaire director, believed the character's emotional journeys and not his own psychological demons made a memorable film. He was no less an auteur for this, he just knew how to get the hell out of the way.Money! The studio had enough of it tied up by tax laws overseas that it didn't wish to repatriate it under Obama's( oops...Truman's) high tax rates. The solution...shoot a film in Rome with the loot.Rome....By all mean Rome...in glorious, sharp Black and White which allows tremendous depth of field in each frame. No fuzzy close-ups here. In almost every frame Rome is the co-star un-nominated for an Oscar.History. Europe was divided, in ruins, and yet still the wellspring of the American mind and soul. And there were two young princesses in England, one dating a commoner, that provided a real world context to the fantasy we enjoy on screen.Spoiler Alert. Finally, it is a romantic comedy about loss. The boy does not get the girl because she chooses duty over love. We love many during our lives, and lose most. Roman Holiday does not gloss over this, but shows why, in the end, we can never not take the trip.",

I've visited that wonderful city three or four times and can readily appreciate its being termed the Eternal City, it's so full of remarkable, historic buildings and monuments, so that even today many of these famous sites still look the same as they did then.The story seems recycled from Capra's \"It Happened One Night\", as a scoop-seeking news-hound, Peck, bumps into Hepburn's frustrated, pent-up Princess Anne character, just after she's bunked off her royal duties to get out and see the real Rome.In her ensuing twenty four hours of freedom, with Peck and his long-suffering and frequently soaking wet photographer Eddie Albert as her guides, the young princess first crops her hair but in every other respect, lets her hair down for a night of fun, frivolity and music.For me, the only wrong note was the improbable instantly-flowering romance between the plainly much older Peck and the young Hepburn, but compensations abound elsewhere not only in the fine cinematography capturing Rome in its glory but also the witty script, stylish direction by Wyler, not forgetting the warm and attractive acting by the two leads.It's rare to see a film of this type so deftly balance the mixture of romance and comedy as maestro Wyler achieves here. All I know is that seeing this film again and remembering that my last time there I duly threw my coin in the Trevi Fountain, I'm reassured that I will visit the city again at sometime in the future.",

            "content": "SPOILERS!  BEWARE!\"Roman Holiday\" was a delightful little movie.  It has a warmth and sweetness that still hold power 50 years after it's creation.  At the same time, it's not exactly \"Pollyana\" either.  Key moments are when the \"naive little princess\" smokes her first cigarette, drinks wine, sleeps (in the same room) with a complete stranger, passes out in the street, and gets in a brawl.  This is truly the stuff of exploration and is still convincing today.  Probably one of \"Roman Holiday's\" most significant aspects is its surprisingly narrow scope.  Despite its grand, cosmopolitan locale, \"Roman Holiday\" encompasses about a day and a half and its plot is basically what would've constituted one chapter in Tom Sawyer.  (Protagonist climbs out of room under the cover of darkness, sees the sights, meets some interesting people, and then goes back home).  This myopic focus is an important part of \"Roman Holiday's\" charm but also probably keeps it from being a perfect film.Obviously, Audrey Hepburn, is a delight to watch.  She manages to simultaneously be feminine and boyish, elegant and common, and flighty but grounded.  Of course, these are characteristics that not only perfectly represented Princess Ann but remain a key element in Hepburn's acting whatever her role.  Gregory Peck was good too.  Some criticize the lack of chemistry between the two.  I agree that things are a bit wooden romantically but their initial spark of interest coupled with fundamental incompatibility is a key part of the story (as it is in \"Random Hearts\" with Harrison Ford and Kristin Scott Thomas).  Finally, I really admired the \"walk away\" ending.  Sure, it stung a little but it made sense and it was beautifully done as Peck walked through that elegant, cavernous room.  It was good to remember that serendipitous \"love\" doesn't need sex or even marriage to validate it.  Like the fleeting friendships established in \"The Breakfast Club\" some things, however special, aren't meant to last.  That's part of what makes them so special. (How easy this is to say, but how hard to remember!) Lucky for us though, Ann and Joe's little fling, can be revisited time and again in \"Roman Holiday\".",

Ironically all the rom-com film components and techniques derive from classics like 'Roman Holiday', but it is the one that feels like clich\u00e9 after watching many films with same genre. I understand why it was popular at that time. Gregory Peck, a named actor with handsome feature and Audrey Hepburn, a newcomer, however, magical enough to allure audience are credited for its success. It is set almost entirely in Rome, a gracious and exotic European place where Americans look up to. It is the story about royal princess (in 1950s). However, in modern day perspective, it is slow-paced to the point of boredom with the addition of clich\u00e9. Because audience can predict the storyline, it feels more slow and boring. The director decides to show Hepburn roaming around the market for 15 minutes just to tell the viewers that she is freely enjoying herself without worrying about title or responsibility for the first time. After about 10 minutes, I'm saying, 'Well.. I got it now'. Hepburn is gorgeous, beautiful, and gracious, no enough words to describe her beauty and majesty, but she fails to absorb audience to the story (in part because the story is so simple and linear).",

Dalton Trumbo was at the time harassed by the McCarthy inquisition and could not use his name to his film scripts in public but continued writing scripts nevertheless, and this is one of his most eloquent.

For me it's all that exuberant youthfulness of Hepburn's wandering around Rome that matters here. Today we would do it quite a bit different, it does seem chaste. An icecream cone is enough, a glass of champagne in a caf\u00e9 with two boys, smiles and roses - things that would be truly ratchet for someone with her royal background, innocent for us. But the moped ride still smells of that reckless spring break or summer and I urge you to try to experience it not as a carefully groomed classic but as a vibrant breeze of air now.She is a princess, but we only need to know the sheltered sweet girl who thirsts for dancing. He is a cynical journalist, but we only need to be able to see the storyteller who (along with his photographer friend who captures images of this) creates the cinematic framework that reveals inner life. It all begins with a film noir device, her falling asleep in the palace and tiptoeing out from a dream to find this man who will seduce the story of surprised discovery, bumping into him of all people.Godard several years later in his debut would move the whole thing to Paris, have her as the journalist with the crew cut, turn the man into a boyish actor who imagines himself in a film. It would be much more obvious about cinematic fantasy and the contrast to real time, here it's the same mannerism. Celine and Julie would have it at a much deeper distance from the viewer, unspooling a longer wandering and having us lose our own selves in the playful search, but the inner structure is similar, awakening a sense of purpose; there an inner child is rescued from a soap opera, here she returns a responsible adult.The denouement is a problem. Having it set up the way they did, they can't be together, her abandoning royalty would be too radical for the time, perhaps too sappy. We're stuck with predictable acknowledgments of how meaningful it all was. The rest is worthwhile.",

            "content": "Princess Ann alludes to the Cinderella story by saying, \"And at midnight I'll turn into a pumpkin and drive away in my glass slipper,\" which, of course, mixes up the elements of the fairytale. In similar way, the movie itself is a Cinderella story with the elements mixed up.Cinderella was a lady by birth, but forced into servitude by her wicked stepmother. For one night, she is able to dress up like the lady she really is. Princess Ann is a commoner by nature, and for one day she is able to dress up like the ordinary person she really is. At the end of the fairytale, Cinderella comfortably slides her foot into a glass slipper; at the beginning of the movie, Ann slides her foot out of the shoe that is bothering her. Cinderella marries the Prince she has fallen in love with; Ann does not marry the commoner she has fallen in love with.We expect there to be a moment when she finds out that Joe is a reporter, causing her to feel hurt and betrayed, believing that he tricked her for the sake of a story; and that he will say that was true at first, but now he is in love with her; and then she will say she does not believe him, and so on. That is the formula for movies when there is deception about someone's identity. In \"The Prisoner of Zenda\" (1952), for example, when Princess Flavia finds out that the man she fell in love with is just an impostor, she jumps to the conclusion that his courting her was part of the act, and thus she feels betrayed. In \"Roman Holiday,\" however, it is refreshing that Ann trusts Joe so much that one brief assurance from him is all she needs.As with Princess Flavia, Princess Ann gives up the man she loves for the sake of her royal duties, but we have to wonder why. \"The Prisoner of Zenda\" was written in 1894, back when monarchs still mattered. And in the movie, much is made of the danger of letting someone like Michael seize the throne. But by 1953, monarchs had pretty much become ceremonial, kept around as tourist attractions. After all, when King Edward VIII of England abdicated his throne to marry Wallis Simpson, civil war did not break out, so it is hard to believe that Princess Ann could not abdicate without precipitating some kind of political disaster.In fact, I have my suspicions about King Edward VIII. The story is that he loved Wallis Simpson so much that he made the great sacrifice of giving up his throne for her. But I think he was just using her as an excuse. The idea of being a titular monarch, with no power but lots of ceremonial duties, might have been maddeningly tedious to him, and he was glad to get out of it. Just to say, \"I don't want to be King, because it's boring,\" would have been a great insult. But everyone understands that love conquers all, and with that as a cover story, he made his escape.And this brings us back to Princess Ann. She clearly hated her duties, and she loved Joe. How nice it would have been, when Joe indicates that he will not publish what happened between them in the newspaper, for her to immediately renounce her position, and say she intends to marry him, the two of them walking away together to live happily ever after. As it is, we sort of feel that the boring life she has resigned herself to is just what she deserves.",

Despite its wildly unrealistic dressing, the central idea that relationships have value even when they can no longer continue (for whatever reason), and that their worth is directly derived from how much the people in that relationship value and respect one another, is a great deal more romantic and sincere than many of cinema's classic romances.Wonderful performances from both Hepburn and Peck certainly don't hurt either!",

            "content": "Roman Holiday (1953), directed by William Wyler, was the first starring movie role for Audrey Hepburn. (The credits say, Gregory Peck and \"Introducing Audrey Hepburn.\") Hepburn, at 24, wasn't exactly an unknown, but her success in Roman Holiday changed the course of her career. Hepburn won an Oscar for her portrayal of Cinderella-in-reverse. She is Princess Ann, heir to the throne of an unnamed European nation. Cinderella dreams of becoming a princess; Princess Ann dreams of leading a normal life.Hepburn, having been given an injection to \"quiet her nerves,\" wanders the streets of Rome, where she encounters newspaper reporter Joe Bradley, played by Gregory Peck. The next day, with Bradley and with photographer Irving Radovich (Eddie Albert) she sets out to enjoy one perfect, normal day.In 1953, Hepburn was at the height of her ingenue charm. She is breathtakingly beautiful in this film. With her strong elegant features, her lithe dancer's body, and her tiny waist, she dominates the screen in every scene in which she appears. Both Peck and Albert do their customary excellent work, and Rome looks wonderful and romantic.IMDb reviewers have ranked this film within the top 250 films of all time, and I would agree with them. It's not a masterpiece, but it's definitely worth seeking out and viewing. We saw Roman Holiday in the wonderful Dryden Theatre in George Eastman House, Rochester. It will work on a small screen, but seeing it in a theater is even better. Find it and enjoy it!",

            "review_title": "Roman Getaway",
            "content": "Warning do not read unless seen movie.I always love going on holiday. There always special to me not just in simply getting to relieve tension but they always give you a sense of clarity, from seeing and experiencing things realizes theirs more to life outside our familiar surroundings but also makes you realize where else you want to go and what more you want to be in life.This is one of the other romance films I really like, I'm not a fan of the genre per say it's not really my genre, but I do like some of them when their done right and this is one of them. It's true this is a romance that takes place in only about one day's time which makes this a little unlikely. But what makes this endearing is the fact that both characters are genuinely interacting.There is just a lot to like about this film, from the music which is very good. The cinematography and the use of the Rome locale, even though this film was a long time ago the scenes of certain locales of Rome are still beautiful to look at. It sorts of makes the film a lot more interesting almost a photography/cinematography history lesion as it's all shot in black and white. The use of them also in a way reflects the romance between both the leads which just says adventurous and beautiful.But of course, what really drives this film are the two main leads.Gregory Peck is great as John Bradley he's a reporter that is kind of on the underdog side of things as he's a bit washed out from his fame along with his carrier which is common with most star reporters. I really like his sense of integrity and that he's not a stereotypical egocentric reporter. At first in the film it almost seems like he's going to fast track back to fame by exploiting Anya which is tempting but unethical all the same. But we see he decides not to do that as he's gets to know her a lot more and as we see fall for her. I really like how he has this dry charisma and humor to him which makes him a likeable guy.And of course, Aubrey Hepburn herself, this film of course was her film debut and it really was the one the started it all for her. I really like this actress, I'll admit I had a bit of a crush on her when I was a kid, she is just beautiful inside and out. Just has this radiance of loveliness, it was just in the looks but her voice and persona that just has this draw. Aubrey in a way was sort of playing herself in the film as she puts on her usual lovely sweet classy charisma but also sharp humor.I really love her character Princess Ann, she's a really sympathic character when we see at the beginning, she is just kind of in a psychological funk despite not showing it, she is keeping hidden as best she can with her royalty mask but as we see there are cracks forming. She is bored, lonely, no one really treats her like a person more like how someone would maintain a nice classic car. Just seeing that makes me wonder about the lives of certain celebrities out their or other famous figures, it just goes to show that fame and fortune aren't all it's cracked up to be.So does what any sane person should do to save their sanity, go on Holiday, and I thought \"way to go dudete\" that's what I always do whenever I feel my stress levels are off the charts or I'm feeling like crap, why the heck not and as an old saying goes \"a man's got to do, what a man's got to do\" or should I say woman. Her journey throughout Rome to me wasn't just a fun getaway for her but kind of a coming of age tale for her. As she's a person that wants to be independent that wants to be treated as a person and liked for who she is not because she wears a crown.There is humor, and it's done right and hits at all the right spots. In most romances whenever humor is included I most of the time cringe more than laugh, because most of the situations the chacters are in are just so fraking ridiculous it's not even funny but worst of all it's also too much of a distraction for the characters to properly interact.The humor in this film is done right because during those times both characters are properly interacting and really, we're having a good time, but also we're funny and memorable. There are lots of funny and memorable moments, I'll just say a few of my favorites I don't' want to give too much away.Really like that fight at the dance with those secret government agents intrude, though they aren't very good ones, yeah like no one's going to notice the clich\u00e9d black trench coat and hat look. Ok it's not a great fight but I just thought it was fun and funny as we see Ann, John and Irving (Eddie Albert) were all getting in on the action. I always thought this scene shows John has guts, he's doing what any good boyfriend should do though likewise for Ann doing what any good girlfriend should do.The other is of course when both first met and of course he doesn't really know it's Anya, he mistakenly thinks she some random girl that's doped up which Anya was, but it was a sedative. It's just funny how Aubrey plays a person under sedation, though even in that state she's still lovely and sweet.Though my absolute favorite is the mouth of truth scene, it was both funny and suspenseful as we see both are tempting fate. Audrey's reaction was just priceless, and I couldn't help but crack up, and believe it or not that reaction actually was genuine it wasn't scripted.But it's really those sweet interactive moments I really loved when both truly to interact with one another, there are a lot of good pieces of dialog. You can see both are good for each other as he really draws out a more adventurous and slightly aggressive quality in Ann. While Ann draws out certain feelings, he let himself close himself of from but is now experiencing again.The dynamic between both is interesting, as it's one between one that has almost everlasting fame to another that was formerly famous but also just someone that has more experience in the world to another that has hardly begun to experience the world. My favorite moment in the interacting which I thought was really bitter sweet was when both of them kiss for the first and last time, when she says \"I don't know how to say good bye\" it's almost kind of heartbreaking because just like the whole adventure throughout the movie you wish it didn't have to end, you really wish both of them had more time together but like all holiday's it's has to end sooner or later.The only problem I have with the film is the ending, it just felt like there was something more that needed to be there. Personally, I would of liked it if both main characters had at least one final private conversation or something. I don't know that's just how I feel, it's a minor quibble.But as I said the film is bittersweet because we know even before the end that despite the good time both have spent together, their both not meant to be. I feel that's a reality that most of us face whenever we have some sort of relationship with someone, mainly because we're going different directions, lack of commonalities, just any kind of factor that can set people apart. Yet despite this you never forget the feelings you felt for one another and despite how far apart you are, those feelings stay with you because that person is never far from your thoughts.As Sarah Connor put it \"even though we didn't have much time together, we loved a lifetimes worth.\"Rating: 4 stars",

It is narrated in a linear fashion and we see how the characters evolve throughout history, learn through everything they live.The story is simple and flows through the personality of the characters, how they react to the situations they face. We see the characters astonished to do things for the first time, go through changes to start over, trying to be someone else for people to accept them for who they really are ... all to finally build confidence and trust.It's a movie that offers a glimpse into the life of a person \"lucky\" by his social position, which apparently seem more extraordinary and simple for the luxuries and comforts, but despite that fails to be happy and admire the grandeur of the life \"common\", is surprised by what others do may seem ordinary.While Wyler directs this classic with great performances of Hepburn and Peck, in this story that could be a rare version of \"Cinderella\" but that account so that the characters generate empathy with the viewer and make him spend some quality time.",

Ann's 24 hours of Wilding, comparable to an Amish youth's sowing their wild oats in \"Rumspringa\" season, has come to a bleak ending. Unlike the similarly-plotted \"best picture\" of 1934--Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert's IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT--there can be no \"she lived happily ever after\" close to ROMAN HOLIDAY. From the moment she was conceived, the possibility of casual \"hook-ups\" flew out the window, and now that Ann is newly hooked on cigarettes, the main question for her future is whether she will produce a properly-pedigreed heir before lung cancer claims her. Not that the world will suffer greatly from the loss of a few inbred Royals, or that such an excruciating demise would be preferable to sudden death by car crash, as was the case with Princess Diana of Wales and Princess Grace of Monaco. However, many historical cultures have had their \"Royals\" serve double duty as national scapegoats, validating Irving's \"open season\" remark. Not every film has the power to make an \"ordinary Joe\" give a hoot about a crowned head. This makes ROMAN HOLIDAY a rare triumph.",

Gregory Peck gives a charming and remarkably humorous performance as Joe Bradley, the reporter who stumbles upon Ann and brings her back to his place so he can get an exclusive story of the Princess on the town. The two of them take a trip through Rome for one day, seeing all of the beautiful sites and falling in love with one another. It's one of the most charming, adorable films I've ever seen with a beautiful romance in the center created expertly by Peck and Hepburn. She gives what is easily one of the best female performances I've seen. One of those films that makes you feel like you're falling in love, as you see these two people do the same, while seeing absolutely beautiful scenery. I hear it said all the time with the film, and I feel the same way; it makes me want to spend a day in Rome.

            "content": "I own a copy of this film which I bought years ago, and I probably haven't viewed it since I first bought it...until tonight. And once while playing a home-made version of Scene It with some friends, I used the footage where she puts her hand in the wall. So that is the part of the movie I tend to remember most. But I did re-watch it in its entirely tonight on TCM. I have to be honest. It is wonderfully absorbing but it is a product of its time and definitely too slow for young modern audiences who may not have the patience to allow the story, or at least the relationship between the three main characters, to carefully unfold. It became very clear to me that ROMAN HOLIDAY's 119 minute running time could easily be whittled down to 95 or 100 minutes and it wouldn't hurt this picture at all. But then we might lose some of the deeper, meaningful pauses and the sightseeing tour of Rome that sort of exists within the movie. I suspect that if it had been made back in Hollywood on the Paramount back lot, there would have been less drawn-out sequences where the director is encouraging us to absorb and take in real Rome. And speaking of taking in the Roman sights, I think it was a mistake to have filmed it in black and white. They had young stars who did not need black-and-white photography to help conceal aging, and the beauty and splendor of the Roman culture would surely have looked much grander in Technicolor. I also think there should have been more local music and dialects in the background, like we see in BUONA SERA MRS. CAMPBELL or A ROOM WITH A VIEW. As it is, ROMAN HOLIDAY is too silent and quite frankly too un-Italian in some of its representations.Also, I think the picture seems unsure of itself in spots, trying to decide if it's a slapstick comedy or a romantic comedy. The repetitiveness of Eddie Albert getting splashed with beverages and falling down silly leaves one thinking that Wyler was absent on those days and the Marx Brothers had temporarily taken over directing.However, despite these slight gripes, the picture is still very effective in creating a mood. And it gives one reason to rejoice in the fact that a romantic feeling without a lot of contrivance or saccharine cuteness can be captured and sustained for much of a film's running time-- a rarity in most newer films.",

Having recently seen \"Twelve O'Clock High\", I'm also growing fond of Gregory Peck; the worst you can say about him in this movie is that he's no Clark Gable or Cary Grant, but then who is?  It's also a treat to see Eddie Albert in the pre-\"Green Acres\" days.  The Roman scenery is absolutely lovely, and it's interesting to compare this film with the Italian \"neo-realist\" films which were all the rage in the previous few years; one wonders if William Wyler saw, say, \"Open City\", and wondered what a Hollywood film crew could do with scenery like that?As for the plot, well...to be charitable, there's not a whole lot to it.  On the other hand, with Audrey Hepburn up there on the screen, who needs a plot?  With her, incident would seem to be sufficient.  Even though I personally prefer the more intricately worked storyline of \"Sabrina\", I understand why \"Roman Holiday\" could be considered the definitive Audrey Hepburn movie, why she won her only Oscar for it, and why it was the first of her films named to the National Film Registry.(SPOILER WARNING)  Nevertheless, there is one feature of interest in the story itself, especially considering that it was written by the blacklisted Dalton Trumbo, who'd been jailed as one of the \"Hollywood Ten\" who refused to cooperate with the House Un-American Activities Committee.  As Joe Bradley gets to know Princess Anne, she becomes more important to him as a person than as a story.  Just before letting her go back, he almost tells her who he really is, but she doesn't want to know.  (Does she already suspect that Joe might be too good to be true, and fears knowing for sure?) In that moment, Joe seems to realize that the best thing he can do for Anne is to keep silent about their \"holiday\", and this is confirmed by his subsequent actions.  In those days of \"naming names\", was Trumbo trying to send a message about the importance of keeping confidences?  (Compare the previous year's \"High Noon\", written by the soon-to-be-blacklisted Carl Foreman, on the importance of hanging together in the face of impending threat; contrast the following year's \"On the Waterfront\", written  by Budd Schulberg and directed by Elia Kazan [both friendly witnesses before HUAC], a justification of squealing.)Perhaps I've read too much into a film that has been a source of innocent enjoyment for several generations of filmgoers, and I hope I haven't spoiled that aspect of \"Roman Holiday\" for anyone.  Even so, I suspect the message about confidences may strike home below the conscious level for many viewers, which might explain why this film is an all-time favorite for so many.  (Besides Audrey Hepburn and its other naturally appealing elements, of course.)  It doesn't even have to have political significance, but only to reflect a wish for a world long gone.  Alas, in these days of information explosion, media time to be filled, and far too many people willing to sink to the lowest level to fill it, it is impossible to believe that such a \"holiday\" as Anne and Joe's would remain secret for long.",

Peck was charming and debonair, while Mrs. Hepburn was young and had that spark of innocence that just made you fall in love with her.  Together they turned a classic story idea into a fun movie that endears itself on your heart and in the process gave birth to the legend that is Audrey.",

            "content": "An elegant woman's shoe - abandoned, not at midnight to beckon a prince, but, mid ankle-stretch, by horrified royalty unable to stoop to retrieve it, for fear of losing decorum in front of her austere procession. It's one of the most understated, classic bits of physical comedy in cinema history. And it's the perfect start to Roman Holiday, director William Wyler and screenwriter Dalton Trumbo's effervescent souffl\u00e9 of a travelogue, which remains as irresistibly charming as it does deceptively clever, over half a century on. It helps, naturally, that six decades on, our obsessions with not only celebrity culture but Monarchy-mania have only intensified. This makes the film feel simultaneously timely, but also a delightful escape to the ages of pre-digital social media (imagine Princess Ann's antics on the town going unnoticed in the era of Twitter or Instagram ). Trumbo's script crackles with subtly acidic tongue-in-cheek humour and heart, sailing along with breezy abandon. What is a product of its time (in the best possible sense): Princess Ann's claustrophobic, nauseatingly regimented royal life doesn't just poke fun at the disempowering nature of life in the public eye. It serves as perfectly metaphoric for the stifling, ideologically rigid 1950s housewife lifestyle, stripped of all autonomy under the veneer of glamour and elegance. Still, Trumbo nudges this subtext rather than hammering it, keeping the mood delightful, if not frivolous. The Rome locations, shot in crisp black and white, are utterly gorgeous, and tie the entire film's joys up in a sophisticated bow. Audrey Hepburn is a luminous delight here, achingly convincing as both flawless princess, and the exuberant young woman cooped up inside her, ready to burst. She bubbles with infectious joy (and some A+ comedy-drunk acting) throughout, before snapping shut again with mirthless, icy composure, which is all the more heartbreakingly impressive, making her Oscar win here indisputably well-deserved. Bouncing off her, Gregory Peck struggles to overcome being a touch too stiff for a part unmistakably earmarked for Cary Grant, but lends it a clipped charm of his own all the same. Finally, Eddie Albert, in the long-suffering Donald O'Connor 'friend/foil' role, is an adorably acrobatic sensation, brimming with beleaguered pratfalls and beard-yanks galore. If there's a sole complaint to be made, it's that Wyler's luxurious, congenial feel lends the film a more laboured, drowsy, and overlong feel than its sparky plot of hi-jinx on the town deserves. Still, Roman Holiday is one for the ages: airtight, clever, and heartwarming, it's still arguably the romantic comedy to beat, decades down the line, and a cinematic treat worth indulging in for viewers familiar or new. If nothing else, for a film that puts so much stock (ha) in images, that closing shot - long, lingering hallway procession, keeping the audience agonizingly dangling from the bittersweet lure of potential - is a doozy.

It's not that Peck look mature; anyone would look old next to a girl who looks and acts like she's an entitled 14 year old.6. It's supposed to be cute that a young girl basically steals a Vespa, causes traffic problems and then gets away with it. At the dance she manages to bang a guy on the head with a guitar and it's sooooo cute.7. The Princess doesn't want to meet the common folk as everyone seems to think. \"I want to do all the things I always wanted to do\".8. It always amazed me that Hepburn became as big a star as she did. They could have given her elocution lessons or taught her to speak slightly faster. Until she gets a \"Thank you\" out you could hold your breath.9. I have a lot more, but it's obviously a rip off of IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT only not funny and with less interesting characters. It's so similar that the reporter gives up a windfall money wise (the price of the interview vs. The reward for the daughter).....and I felt bad for Eddie Elbert whose sole role in the movie is to get drinks spilled on him and trip each time Peck touched him.

I had never seen an Audrey Hepburn film until a few years ago when my girlfriend (now wife) picked it up on video and said I would like it. I'm a big Gregory Peck fan, so I was like sure, I'll watch it. From the moment Audrey first appeared as the delightfully charming Princess Ann, I fell in love with her. I know that's a commonly used phrase when describing Audrey's performance in this film, but I don't know how else to describe it. I literally fell in love. I'm not a big fan of romantic comedies, and I think most movies are worthless crap that have done more to destroy our culture than advance it. But my god this is the best film I've ever seen! I've probably seen it 10 times now, and every goddamm time I see it I fall in love all over again and in the end my heart is left broken. Audrey and Peck's chemistry is magical. The scenery is beautiful, even in black and white. Dammit, even Eddie Albert is wonderful! Every time I watch this movie I want to hold Audrey in my arms and kiss her and never let her go. I never felt this way about a stupid movie. But I can't help it. I refuse to own it. Why? Because I would spend all my free time watching it, to see if maybe, just maybe, this time they'll end up together. I end up catching it every few months on AMC, after which I'm in a funk for a few days. I know this sounds ridiculous, but this is the only movie that hits me so deeply, so passionately. I'm almost angry that it does so, but what can I do? \"Well, life isn't always what one likes, is it?\"What also bothers me is why these two never worked together again? Does anyone know? Please tell me. After Roman Holiday, I've found every other Audrey film to pale in comparison. The major fault of all of them is the lack of chemistry she shares with her costars (grouchy Humphrey Bogart in Sabrina; the laughable Gary Cooper in Love in the Afternoon; a decent effort by George Pappard in Tiffany's; the \"I-bet-I-can-be-more-suave-than-you\" performance of Cary Grant in Charade; I could go on forever). Audrey is wonderful and beautiful as usual, but the films are generally poor. Peck went back to the gritty hero roles (and was perfect in all of them), while Audrey was pawned off to every Hollywood romantic lead. I just don't get it. But then again, I don't think I'll ever get Hollywood.",

From the start we feel that the princess appears to have more human characteristics than the royal people she is surrounded with, e.g. losing her shoe, and also her exhaustion and frustration with having to remember unrelenting daily schedules and routines. This helps to draw us in to her character to such an extent that we later delight in little things such as Anya getting her hair cut, and seeing her discover what it is like to have the freedom of being just a \"normal\" person.. something that we all take for granted. She thoroughly deserved her Oscar for best actress. Not that this was a one person film, Gregory Peck is also great as the news-reporter, and we genuinely believe that his character goes from initially seeking to profit from the princess, to actually falling in love with her.\nThe film is successful at involving us with the adventures of the main characters. We feel that we are actually tagging along with the romantic excursions, but not to the point where we feel that we are intruders. Hence we seem to share a lot of the characters' emotions. In the end we develop such sympathy for both characters that we feel their individual pains, and the hopelessness of their situations in that they are denied what they want because of who they are. Perhaps drawing the audience in, to the point where they are able to empathise with the characters, is where a lot of modern romantic films fail.. sure this film might appear dated in it's black & white form on-screen, but the emotions are timeless.. and it more than stands the test of repeated viewing.",

I had actually planned to skim through it, but once the film started, I couldn't help but watch all the way through - for about, oh, the tenth time at least. And it still makes me smile, and laugh, and cry. In the film, 'Anya'/Anne speaks of a lack of sweetness and decency in the world. And you know what? It doesn't sound hokey - just very sad, and very true. The cynicism that abounds everywhere today (especially in film) is suffocating. And 'Roman Holiday' is the sweetest, most decent antidote. There are many bits in the film that stand out: the opening scene where Anne is literally uncomfortable being in the shoes of a princess, the mouth of truth where Audrey's reaction is absolutely genuine, the scooter ride, her very first cigarette, Eddie Albert's photo session with the model 'fishing' in his studio (always cracks me up!), the dance on the barge, the kiss on the river bank, the sudden, passionate yet sad embrace in Joe's apartment - the list is endless. But I think the part that really clinches it for me is when Anne returns to the palace and is being chastised for running away from her duty as a princess. She cuts off the General firmly with something to the effect of \"If I were not perfectly aware of my duty to my family and my country, I would not have come back tonight,\", here we cut to a sublime close-up where Anne is barely able to contain her tears, and then, \"...or indeed ever again.\" There is the slightest tremor in her voice which belies her composure. Anyone and everyone who thinks/says Audrey Hepburn is not really 'acting' but just 'being herself' in the film, just take another look at this single, remarkable shot - she conveys everything with these four simple words, expressed as only she could have.Bravo!",

            "content": "\"Roman Holiday\" is an interesting film. It starts slow, showing Princess Anne trying to escape from the bounds of monarchy. She takes one day to herself to explore Rome with her new friend the reporter. This feels like somewhat of a metaphor for Europe as a whole which struggled with war, conquest, and dangerous pretensions during the decades preceding this film in 1953. But by 1953 Europe was beginning to emerge from the wreckage of World War 2 and a more optimistic spirit was birthed. Touring Rome became something possible and desirable again. Unity and harmony were the feelings of the day with the modern European Union getting its start in Rome just four years later in 1957 with a treaty creating the European Economic Community.Returning to the film, it does keep a realism though as illustrated by the ending. I thought that it did a nice job of portraying a fleeting relationship, but some of those can be more meaningful than any other type. I also liked how the reporter and photographer didn't just sell out for the money, they placed their new friendship above monetary and professional success showcasing laudable and rare restraint. Though it is a shame that this film was not shot in color. And the acting was fine, but I am surprised Audrey won an Oscar for this one. So I view \"Roman Holiday\" as a good film which will make you smile in parts, but not the masterpiece that some say. My rating: 7/10.",

How come then, that the only feeling I'm left with is pity for the rich and powerful, who have to live such dreadful lives of duties and no fun at all. Poor, poor princess, jau, jau. Having written this story, Dalton Trumbo deserved to be kicked out from the communist party for being a capitalist spy and not the other way around! We now know, or should know, that Sovietism was not communism. Fidel Castro's Cuba was much closer to communism. The iron curtain was not communism, it was protectionism of power. Nothing hurt the idea of communism more than the Soviet Union claiming to be communist and at the same time establishing the iron curtain. They did it in order to protect their party in which they had invested their lives, not in order to protect communism. It can be argued that communism is at least partly to be blamed. It says: From all according to ability and to all according to need. Who decides that one man needs a castle to live in and another man only a shed? Only power would decide such a thing and that's not the idea of communism. \"Prosperity to all\" is a better slogan, but that is anarchism, which is maybe the better ism. Communism or anarchism - one thing is for sure - none of them profits from films, that make us feel sorry for the rich and powerful! If I were a communist and had to choose between writing stories like the one for this film and go to jail, I'm not sure what I would choose, provided that the jail was decent with good food and no chance of being raped.

Ann, the royal princess, is played by Audrey Hepburn. Joe Bradley, the reporter, is played by Gregory Peck.Roman Holiday is a well put together film. The movie's age is not transparent save for the black and white nature of the movie. The movie's plot, direction, characters, and acting are all top notch and timeless. The only age that the movie shows is in its pacing. The movie has a running time of 118 minutes. This running time can feel slow to the fast paced movies of 2018. The movie does utilize the time well and this shows with the chemistry between the leads.The chemistry between Ann and Joe Bradley is unique. That is the movie's biggest strength as\nboth of the characters writing is well supported by the actors. The entire running time focuses on these two characters and it is well worth the watch. There are many fun situations that the two characters become involved in. I found myself enjoying the comedic moments in the movie a lot. The movie can also switch tones drastically into a more traditional romantic drama. I really felt for Joe Bradley at the end when he gave the photographs' over.I highly recommend 'Roman Holiday'. The movie is one of the best romantic comedy movies across all time.Grade: A",

I've really liked him in other things, but what if Albert's more lively, light-hearted character had been the object of the princess' affections? I can envision a more entertaining movie under those conditions, but maybe that's not the way things were done in the 1950's\u0085 maybe the tall, handsome leading man was a must-have. I've read that one of the reasons Peck wanted this film was because he felt he needed to 'lighten up' his image\u0085 I'll agree with him on that, and sincerely hope he did even more lightening up after it, because there was still room for improvement.Audrey Hepburn might have acted a bit childish and under her implied age at times (mostly in the embassy bedroom scenes, when she seemed to be channeling an eight-year-old), but she was sweet and lovable and filled the role of Princess Ann very well.To be totally honest, I didn't watch this out of any real interest in the film itself, but only for the on-location scenery since I'm going to Rome in six months. I share the sentiments of those who wish it had been in color, but even in black and white it's visually stunning. The best part of the movie was the scenery; the second best part was Eddie Albert.

The movie stars Audrey Hepburn in an Academy award winning film debut as Princess Ann of Italy who runs away from from her palace for one night while being dizzy at the same time, after she escapes and sleeps on the side of a bridge for a few minutes, and then she encounters an American journalist by the name of Joseph Bradley (played by Gregory Peck).Then the following morning they miss the Prince's interview and instead of the Princess exploring Rome on her own the princess and Bradley end up exploring Rome together along with another journalist named Irving Radovich (played by Eddie Albert). Then after the sunsets and they are at a dinner party all hell breaks loose and a huge fight breaks out because of a few secret service agents forcefully trying to take the princess back to her palace (in which this scene made me think back to the fight scene in John Ford's She Wore a Yellow Ribbon (1949). The one thing I love most about this movie is the chemistry between both Hepburn's and Peck's characters, as well as the music, photography, humor and among other things. Also while watching this movie it made me think back to that Woody Allen movie I saw a few days ago which was Midnight In Paris (2011). But in the end I would recommend this picture for people who like romantic comedies and as well as romance movies in general.",

Just those two names should be enough to make you want to watch this movie. :-)The story is great, it's about a princess (Hepburn) who visits Rome, Italy and meets a reporter (Peck) who wants an exclusive story about her. Pretending that he doesn't know who she is, he hangs around with her hoping to get his scoop. But the plot quickly changes when they fall in love.This movie's called a Romantic Comedy because it's good as a romance and as a comedy... there are plenty of funny scenes, but you don't find yourself wondering why they bothered with the romance like in a lot of other comedy movies.Great camera work, too.It's Not Rated, but I would give it a G.

            "content": "Roman holiday is effortlessly entertaining masterpiece, providing 2 hours of pure fun and joy. Audrey Hepburn, in her American debut, plays a bored, tomboyish and posh aristocrat, wanting to explore Rome like an ordinary tourist. Her performance on this film is probably her best- it is easily naturalistic, and there is good chemistry between her and Peck. The comedy in this film is simply done just right- it is funny without descending into unbelievable farce, and at the same time utterly charming, the sort of film which would inadvertently bring a smile to your face. Part of the fun of course is the interesting plot, which puts this naive, tomboyish princess in a new, exciting environment. Rome also features almost as a supporting character- our couple visit the major landmarks, which were filmed on location, delivering a realism which is rare in 1953- most films them were simply shot on a large soundstage. Perhaps this is why the film holds up very well today. Roman Holiday offers immense fun and effortless charm which is sorely lacking in romantic comedies today, where the comedy seems contrived and farcical and the romance takes itself too seriously.",

            "content": "Watched this picture with my Daughter which I believe triggered her adventurist side of traveling to far away lands. Definition of the term \"Roman Holiday\". An instance in which someone experiences enjoyment on account of someone else's suffering or taking a break from the usual lifestyle to see what your missing out on. I had my first of many such experiences but the first time was in early March 1975. Unusually warm day for that time of the season. I decided to ditch school and head to the Mall. I had just gotten paid the day before and deposited my check at the bank. Free with cash in my pocket, I roamed around, went to a couple of clothing stores and ended up at a ticketron office. I wanted to buy Hockey Tickets for the New York Islanders. Unfortunately the system was down so the only way I could buy tickets was to travel to the Nassau Coliseum. Behind the Mall was a fleet of Buses. I randomly asked one of the drivers how to get to the Nassau Coliseum . He told me to take the N32 to Hempstead terminal and switch to the N70 to the coliseum. It was only 10:45 and I thought what the heck. I took the long winding road trip on the buses to the arena. I was at a point of no sudden return. Roman Holiday is about a Royal Princess Ann (Audrey Hepburn) in he first starring role. The picture doesn't tell you her country of origin but from the initial narration the Princess toured England as a guest despite Audrey Hepburn's British accent. Held by a rigorous schedule and itinerary, the velvet chains were pulling the troubled Princess much too hard. The private physician was called to apply a sedative to make her sleep. Instead the agitated Princess escapes the luxurious confines of the Rome embassy to the humble neighborhoods of Rome,Italy. The sedative finally takes effect as Newsman Joe Bradley (Gregory Peck) finds her sleeping on a bench and takes her to his second story apartment. Bradley leaves for his office telling his boss Mr. Hennesey (Hartley Power) with some excuse why he missed the press conference for Princess Ann sees the photo and realizes that the drunk tired woman he brought home is the same Princess in the photo. Joe realizes he's sitting on an exclusive story, gets his photographer friend on the action. Bearded Irving (Eddie Albert) comes by as they pretend to not tell their new guest they know her true identity. Light comedy and flirty conversation takes over most of the picture as the two frolic through the streets of Rome. Joe keeps up his cover as the handsome couple ride a motor scooter and sample the sights of the City of Fountains. The only problem I had was that the movie wasn't filmed in glorious color. Fine screenplay by Dalton Trumbo and this movie also launched a courtship with millions of fans who found little, svelte, elegant, refined, Audrey into their hearts forever. Gregory Peck showed his compassion and humor despite appearing wooden at times. Eddie Albert was also a fine third wheel in this one day adventure along the winding streets of Rome. Watching this film was like enjoying a cup of gelato yet you know you'll soon be done with an empty cup. That being stated I still recommend a viewing on a rainy day.",

Audrey Hepburn exudes girlish charm and doesn't reflexively show us her navel in every scene as she would have to if this were a modern film. Gregory Peck actually plays someone on the horns of a moral dilemma instead of someone who simply follows where the money takes him. You get the sense that in 1953 Italy an English princess could still just about disappear on the streets instead of being torn apart as today's huddled masses would. In short, this breezy, beautiful shot romantic comedy stands as testament to the decline of Western civilization and some of those things that were once good about it.",

Of course, everyone talks about the perfection of casting Hepburn in this role. It is hard to believe that Hepburn had been self-conscious about her looks in this movie, her very first. She was so beautiful as Princess Ann that she radiated and made the entire world fall in love with her (even the Academy, since she won best actress). Her innocence and beauty shines and outshines everyone else, even Gregory Peck, as hard as that may seem.Peck was brilliant himself though, in a type of role that he didn't normally play. It was an astonishingly well-played transition from the normal character roles he had played previously. He was handsome and debonair in this romantic lead.The setting is gorgeous, of course, since it was filmed on location in Rome. The streets are busy and filled with life. It is easy to see why so many people travel to Rome to get a taste of the beauty culture.Roman Holiday is one of the sweetest romantic movies I have ever seen, because it is subtle and warms the heart. It also brings out faith in the human spirit. Hepburn's wide-eyed innocence is a perfect example of the beauty of life, from the first time she steps out into the wondrous magic of the real world.I recommend everyone to see this movie because of it's magical embrace of life and love.",

However brilliant acting by Audrey, who was a new star in Hollywood at that time, made the story real and superb. I am absolutely sure that she is worth receiving Academy Award for Best Actress in 1953.\nIn the beginning, she had been overwhelmed because her schedule had been too regimented and she had had no freedom.

First of all the film is a miracle of timing--there is not one wasted moment. It is so perfect--that we want to see it again, and again--and each time it feels just as fresh, just as surprising and witty, just as heartbreaking as the first viewing. Most importantly, we the viewer, relate. We're not Royalty in a receiving line waiting to greet dukes and counts and foreign dignitaries....We're not ex-pats in some exotic locale scrounging for a living...and yet, the characters all feel so real to us. Who hasn't felt the pangs of unrequited love? Who hasn't experienced the laudable feelings of loyalty to a lover...to a friend? Who hasn't felt desperate, or lonely, or deliriously happy, or contentedly at peace...these emotions abound in the film, as real to us as they are to these wonderful characters on that silver screen. So many moments to cherish in this film: the genuinely funny opening reception line, Audrey Hepburn's smile and luminous beauty, the first view of sunny Rome from Joe Bradley's plebeian but wonderfully colorful terrace, the great comic persona of Eddie Albert's beatnik photographer, the ancient Roman ruins lit up in the dark of evening, Wyler's textbook perfect filming of the police station episode with just a few bars of the Wedding March heard as Joe Bradley gleefully lies his way out of an arrest of the Princess, the myriad characters--whether the cleaning lady, the landlord, the barber, each with brief but memorable and memorably adorable scenes, that moment of heartbreaking loneliness toward the end of the film, in Joe's apartment when the princess prepares to leave her \"new life\" and \"new love\" forever, and the final, amazing scene as the Princess greets the reporters--what a cascade of emotions the characters (and we, the audience!) feel! Its clever and funny one moment as Eddie Albert takes that last picture with his cigarette lighter and the princess gets a quick glimpse of her \"photo\". Its reassuring and so satisfying, how with a simple sentence across that palace room, Joe is able to convey to the princess that she needn't worry--their story is their story--no one else's to betray or to be regretful about! And in another heartbeat, the scene fills us with heartfelt emotion and tears, as Joe and the princess are as far apart as physical distance and life and their world could make them.....and yet with an eye glance, and a touching few words, and a final loving smile from our radiant princess--they are as close as two human beings have ever been. This is a film to treasure forever. For us film buffs, as someone else has commented upon in these user comments,..in our minds Audrey Hepburn and Gregory Peck are forever young, forever beautiful...and just about to begin their wonderful, enchanting, fun and love-filled day in their and our beloved Rome--a Rome of Heart and Magic and endless possibilities of life and love and happiness.",

I'm Japanese, so it is difficult for me to judge an acting ability of foreign actors and actresses, but her acting is so charming and it made her popular in Japan, I think.And I surprised at her short hair style, maybe no one but her suits he style. Her fashion was also fresh. I love a classic movie, so I have watched lots of films, but there is no heroine like Audrey Hepburn. Those things are reasons why she is so popular and still be called \"fashion icon\" now, I think.Off course, the story of this film lets me feel painful, but very good. Performance of the eyes of Gregory Peck is masterly. Love romance between Princess Anne and Joe is very pure and beautiful. Various tourist attraction spots like \"the mouth of Truth\" supports this movie. I would like to visit Rome and trace the locus of them.",

            "content": "If you are a sucker for a 1950's romantic comedy like I am, than you will adore this film. Audrey Hepburn's charm shines in this 1953 Oscar winning film. This coming of age movie reminds us to take time for ourselves to remember who we really are and to follow our hearts once in a while. Hepburn plays a sheltered young Princess Anne whose life is structured and planned down to the very last second by her royal staff. While on the Rome stop of a goodwill tour of Europe, the stress of her controlled life finally gets to her. She is given a shot to help calm her down and sleep but before feeling the full effects of the drug, she sneaks out of her room and into the night streets of Rome. Gregory Peck plays a tall dark and handsome struggling American reporter stationed in Rome named Joe Bradley. After a late night of cards, he stumbles upon Princess Anne sleeping on the streets. He attempts to help the young lady home, not yet knowing of her royal status, but realizes she is far to intoxicated to help herself so he brings her to his apartment to sleep it off on his couch. It's not until the next day that Joe realizes that he has the biggest story of his career sleeping in his apartment. He encourages Anne to spend the day out doing everything and anything she has ever wanted to do, all the while Anne thinks she has fooled Joe into thinking she is Anne Smith, the student, but Joe's intentions are to sell his princess story to the press. As the day goes by, he realizes that this private day they have shared means more to him than the price he would get for the story.Spoiler!Anne's day in Rome with Joe helps her discover herself in more ways than she expected. She lives, laughs, and loves her way through Rome with Joe by her side. Most of the scenes with Anne and Joe are shot from a lower angle, I believe this was done to make Joe appear taller and more like a protector to Anne. But, like Cinderella, Anne rushes back by midnight to her royal responsibilities and she must say goodbye to her beloved Joe. In the closing scene, Joe is walking out of the royal press conference being held in a lavish and large room. You see the empty throne over his shoulder getting further and further away. He stops at the end of the room and looks over his shoulder. This signifies the distance and impossibility of his relationship with Princess Anne. The movie is only shot over a 3 day period but you feel as though you have witnessed Anne grow up in front of your eyes from a spoiled Princess to a lovely young woman.",

            "content": "All one has to do to get some idea of how well loved William Wyler's romantic 1953 comedy-drama ROMAN HOLIDAY is -- is to read several of the Reader's Comments recorded here! Having a Laser Disc copy of this title, I have eagarly awaited its arrival on the DVD format. Several times I have been tempted to order a Hong Kong release. (I'm glad I didn't!) The wait is over as Paramount has released ROMAN HOLIDAY and Billy Wilder's 1950 classic, SUNSET BOULEVARD on DVD, in beautifully restored Collector's Editions that are breathtaking! There is a short \"Restoring ROMAN HOLIDAY\" featurette that gives one an appreciation for the efforts involved in making this film look and sound like it did when originally released. At age 15, I saw and re-saw ROMAN HOLIDAY many, many times when it was first released. Like most of the movie-going world, I fell in love with Audrey Hepburn in this \"star is born\" performance. Last year (2001), my wife and I saw a revival of this film at a local theater. Most of the print was fine, but the film was projected in a ratio of 1.85:1, thus destroying the composition of the picture by cutting off the top and bottom of the frame. ROMAN HOLIDAY came out in the year Hollywood was moving from the standard screen format (1.33:1) to the wide-screen (anywhere from 1.66:1 to 2.60:1). This was the year that 20th Century Fox's THE ROBE introduced their CinemaScope process. 1953 was also the year for 3-Dimensional movies -- you wore special glasses and the screen image had depth and things jumped off the screen at the audience. But this was also a year with some outstanding classics still being released in regular format -- films like ROMAN HOLIDAY, STALAG 17, SHANE, FROM HERE TO ETERNITY, MARTIN LUTHER, YOUNG BESS and THE STORY OF THREE LOVES. Now Paramount has released ROMAN HOLIDAY on DVD in a full-frame version that sparkles with its beautiful black and white tones. The sound is excellent -- Mono, yes -- not in 5.1 surround that suits films that were recorded that way -- but in a very nice rendition of the original track (both in English & French). The Featurette, \"Remembering ROMAN HOLIDAY\" is choice. Included as \"Extras\" are 3 different Theatrical Trailers; a Photo Gallerie, a Featurette on costume designer, Edith Head (that is also included on the SUNSET BOULEVARD\" DVD). Paramount, who is celebrating 90 years, is to been highly commended for this ourstanding restoration. (P.S.: Paramount's WAR AND PEACE is scheduled for a DVD release the first week of Dec. 2002 -- Here's hoping that they have done an equally fine job of restoring that film, which features Audrey Hepburn, Henry Fonda and Mel Ferrer in a epic telling of Leo Tolstoy's famous novel.) ROMAN HOLIDAY is a must own DVD, that should delight old and young alike! Thanks Paramount!",

That smile she puts on her face feels so genuine, it simply bewitches me. There was a guy who was constantly laughing too annoyingly in the theatre (and sometimes my girlfriend and I exchanged short kisses) but when there was a closeup of Audrey's face hardly anything could have made me take my eyes off the screen.Such values like liberty and giving free rein to your curiosity are well explored in this classic romantic comedy and I believe Dalton Trumbo (the screenwriter who was not officially recognized as the true screenwriter until many years later) made a good choice to not choose a conventional, all-too-optimistic course for the way the movie concludes. I was also content with the choice of the cast. I wonder if the movie was by any means inspired by Queen Elizabeth's II's coronation, which happened one year before the movie's release, namely in 1952, though I cannot envisage any parallelism whatsoever as of the moment I'm writing this review.A 9 out of 10 from me.",

After sneaking out of the palace she hops a small paddy wagon and rides down a street in Rome, stops in front of a building where she sits on a bench when the American newspaper reporter Tom Bradley (played by Peck)sees her on the bench and later takes her to his apartment. (To indicate how ancient the movie is, nothing lewd takes place there.) He is late for work the next day, but quite by accident in his boss' office he sees a picture of the princess on the cover of a Rome newspaper. He then bets his boss that he will do a story on that \"dame\", and he in his own mind knows he will win. Naturally, the princess' entourage, a cold group, has no idea where she is, and is worried about her and the fact that she will hold a press conference the next day. In the meantime the princess does not know that Bradley is a newspaper reporter, nor does she know that at the same time he knows that she is the princess. He is, again, going to do a story on her, replete with pictures taken by his friend Irvin Radovich(Albert)who owns his own photo service. Bradley later tells her to take the whole day off and have a holiday, and so they do and it's filled with much fun; the fun ends at a pier where there is a big shindig where, in turn, she tells him that he has been so kind to her and so unselfish. At this point, though there is a fight at the pier which is comical in its own right, the story becomes serious and romantic.Though it is very amusing in so many places, it is, again, also serious in places as well. Whether or not the ending is amusing or serious is something the viewer(s)will have to personally decide. Though the movie is filmed in B&W, the sights around the Eternal City-such as the Victor Emannuel Memorial, the Spanish Steps, the Fountain of Trevi, the Wall of Truth, and the Roman Forum-are still very captivating. And William Wyler does manifest the fact that he is a prolific producer. It is another movie I have watched so very many times, yet do not get jaded despite that.",

            "review_title": "Full of fun and frivolity but wafer-thin in depth",
            "content": "The film which is famous for introducing the world to Audrey Hepburn is a curious mixture of screwball and broader romantic comedy. Hepburn plays European royalty in the form of Princess Ann; a young woman who is stifled by the pomp and routine associated with her role. Therefore, in a fit of frustration and desperation, she takes advantage of an opportunity for temporary escape, just so that she can have a taste of \"normal life\".Gregory Peck, on the other hand, plays newspaper man Joe Bradley. He's fallen on hard times both financially and professionally and needs a big story to raise his standing in the eyes of his employer. As Joe is making his way home following a long night of gambling, he discovers a seemingly drunk young woman helplessly wandering the streets. Seeing that she is all alone, he resentfully assumes responsibility for her at first. But, eventually, he realises who this young woman is and that the story he'd been looking for may well have just fallen into his lap.A remake of sorts of the depression-era film It Happened One Night (1934), Roman Holiday retains elements of the odd-couple dynamic which sees a royal princess joined through circumstance to working man, Joe Bradley. Yet Hepburn's Princess Ann is much less spiky than Claudette Colbert's Ellie Andrews and Bradley is never close to being as domineering as Clark Gable's Peter Warne; as a result, the developing romance between the leads in this film is far smoother than it was in the original picture, which leads to a slight lowering of the stakes and a definite lowering of romantic tension. Nonetheless, Hepburn and Peck do make a charming couplet.It should also be noted that this film has the distinction of being one of the few major 1950s Hollywood productions to be shot entirely on location in a foreign country, and it makes the most of its surroundings. It moves along at a leisurely pace and delights in the excitement and novelty of Princess Ann's care-free jaunt through Rome. Tourist hot spots are highlighted, most memorably the Bocca della Verit\u00e0, and space is provided for comical interactions to occur between both the leads and a number of minor native Italian supporting cast members, most of whom speak very limited English. This interplay provides the opportunity for comedy to be generated as much through physical gesture as it does dialogue. The scene in which a flower seller is trying to pedal his wares to Princess Ann being a particularly notable example.Hepburn is at her most whimsical and delightful as Princess Ann, a role which would set something of a blueprint for her Hollywood career. The combination of her youthful, classically beautiful looks, her regal accent and bearing and, just as crucially, her overt appreciation for mild mischief and gaiety make her both a figure of admiration as well as thoroughly relatable. This may well point to the fundamental juxtaposition which made Hepburn such a unique star, she was simultaneously attainable and unattainable, both abstraction and reality. It seems a stretch that someone as sweet, attractive, humorous and good-natured as the persona Hepburn created in this film could truly exist, yet, watching her perform, her presence certainly possesses a high degree of authenticity.The script is well-written with some excellent use of repetition and verbal call-backs. This alongside the physical comedy provides for a thoroughly entertaining experience. The issue with the film; however, is that everything comes together a little too perfectly. It is pure, unadulterated escapism, but escapism through the mostly quotidian. There is certainly charm in this and, even at times hilarity (Hepburn's drunk acting in the early scenes of the film are simply brilliant), but the film never quite delivers on its early promise in which a little more depth was suggested.To elaborate, around 10 minutes into the film, we witness an inner-glimpse into Princess Ann's life in which she is experiencing palpable emotional suffocation. She initially sarcastically and then increasingly disdainfully utters her verbal preparations for her meetings with a series of foreign dignitaries alternating between the reponses of \"Thank you\" and \"No thank you\" like some sort of demented royal parrot. Each time she repeats her response, there is an increase in panic and disgust culminating in a disturbing fit of hysteria. In this one scene, one can imagine how robotic and stifling Princess Ann's life must be. She is a free spirit, a lover of spontaneity and authenticity trapped in the life of pageantry and fancily costumed public relations. Alas, after this moment, the film becomes much more light-hearted, which makes the whole thing rather more fun, but also rather less consequential.",

            "content": "Roman Holiday will forever be considered a classic because it is one of the best movies for three superstar names in the industry: actor Gregory Peck, actress Audrey Hepburn, and director William Wyler. The story revolves around an English princess (Hepburn) who grows tired of the stuffy day-to-day life of royalty and sneaks out during a visit to Rome. An American reporter (Peck) stumbles across her and reluctantly decides to take care of her, not yet knowing who she is. When he finds out, he sees a golden opportunity for his newspaper for an exclusive interview. But then love gets in the way (as always). This movie is like many other light-hearted romantic comedies, but the last scene elevates it to the top tier (remember, no spoilers on this site). Audrey Hepburn plays the part perfectly, as if she is indeed a real princess and I can't imagine anyone else playing Gregory Peck's role as well as he does. Eddie Albert adds some good laughs and Rome is always a great setting. Good movie!",

            "content": "We should all be so lucky as to experience a holiday as magical and satisfying as the one featured in this movie. Audrey Hepburn stars as Princess Ann, so frustrated with her royal schedule and commitments that she leaves the palace for one night... or so she thinks. Not knowing that she's been given sleeping pills, she ends up falling asleep all over Joe Bradley (Gregory Peck), a hard-nosed reporter who soon realises that he's sitting on the story of the year. What follows is a charming tale set in one of the most beautiful cities of the world, Rome. As Ann/Anya wanders by the Trevi fountain, or visits the Mouth of Truth with Joe, you can't help feeling that there's something magical about the setting. (Obviously, this is helped by the obvious chemistry between the gamine Hepburn and the very handsome Peck.) Everyone should be so lucky as to fall in love in Rome, as Anya and Joe eventually do.Favourite part of the movie: It would probably have to be Joe dumping 'Anya' off his bed and onto the uncomfortable couch, and trying his best to shift her back onto the bed when he discovers that she is actually 'Ann'.\nNot to give away the ending, but there is one thing I must say about it: although the premise of the story is itself unbelievable, the ending rings true, incredibly so, and the entire film is the better for it. The last scenes are touching and heartbreaking and inspiring, all at the same time. Well worth the watch.",

All other settings are cardboard, especially the view outside Gregory Peck's apartment.  What are those buildings anyway?  And how high up is he?  Audrey Hepburn is way too much to take for an entire film.  Her speaking is so slow and phony.  I think I saw just about all her films.  I liked her in The Nun's Story; her role in Breakfast at Tiffany's is way over the top.  Peck appears as stiff as the scenery and as old as the hills.  And what's with the attention paid to a princess:  ooh -- aah -- let us watch her as she walks toward us, let us ask her about world events, let us not breathe in her presence, let us listen to every syllable uttered and let us memorize her singular answers that will be parroted by future Miss America contestants.  After all, she IS a princess!  And is she speaking English/American to all those men from many nations while in Rome?  Did I miss that explanation?  I know this film is 50 years old so, perhaps, I am a wee bit too harsh.  In the spirit of this holiday season, I offer these few compliments about this film I viewed yesterday.  Peck's eyebrows are not as luxuriant as in his recent appearances and Hepburn does not use a cigarette holder.  At the end when the noble and blessed by birth -- better than anyone else -- princess returns to her fine digs, she is really nasty to the countess and to those two men who cower before her.  I'm wondering who removes her glass slippers and unmakes her 22-mattress bed and brushes 100 times her tresses and sets out her flowing nightie.  Surely \"her royal highness\" does not.  The premise of this film is amusing, but never will a remake be attempted.  We do not bow before those who think they are royal.  Thanks, John Hancock!",

Not only did she win an Oscar for this movie, her elegance, charm, and genuine demeanor really shine. The plot here is rather simple: An overworked, traveling Princess Ann is finally fed up with her chaotic schedule. After being treated by her doctor (read: sedated!) she goes out and is able to see a bit of Rome before the sleeping sedative hits. And of course, after this, she meets the handsome American Joe Bradley, (a sweet Gregory Peck) and they take the following day off to have a holiday in Rome. It's an old film, and it is a bit old fashioned but unlike other older films, it ages well, and captures just a little bit of Audrey Hepburn's irresistible magic. If you don't fall in love with this movie immediately, as I have...well then, chances are you'll at least fall in love with Audrey. It's almost impossible not to like \"Roman Holiday\" - even if it is in black and white! \nBeing an older film (from the 1950's), the only negative I could possibly give, is that the dialogue is a little hard to understand in some parts. I would think a remastered/cleaned up DVD version would help...or subtitles. But don't let that, along with the absence of modern color turn you off: plenty of great movies are in black and white, and this is one of them. \nHepburn is a true star.",

She ended up walking off with the Academy Award for Best Actress for this performance.  Frankly, I think the only other performance in my opinion that was that memorable was Hilary Swank's 1999 turn as doomed teenager Brandon Teena in Boys Don't Cry.William Wyler struck gold with this story of a restless princess with her heart set on freedom, who ends up running from her duties and falling for a \"commoner\".  I dare anyone reading this to try and NOT think of Diana, Princess of Wales and smile.  Her adventures throughout Rome only take up about fifty or so minutes of this two hour film, so there's not much that she can do other than look at the sights and create mayhem with her two cohorts, Eddie Albert and the irrepressible Gregory Peck.  My favorite scene is the one where Audrey is on a moped and she goes flying off down the street with Gregory Peck in hot pursuit.This film was nominated for ten Academy Awards including Best Picture, Director, Actor and Actress.  Of course, this is the film that shot Audrey Hepburn to stardom.  Films like Breakfast at Tiffany's and Sabrina only cemented her legendary status.My rating: 3 stars",

Well, that's not 100% accurate. A couple of minutes before the movie started, two other people walked in. I feel so sorry for all the people who could have occupied all those seats and seen this overwhelming movie as it was intended to be seen.Who remembers the supernatural charm of 23-year-old Audrey Hepburn? Who remembers the imperturbable, virile strength of Gregory Peck, just about to be perturbed to his limits? Who remembers how hapless Eddie Arnold could be as the sidekick? Who remembers the uncredited fourth brilliant member of this great cast: glorious Rome?Princess Anne (Hepburn), from an undetermined country, is concluding a European tour in Rome. She has been decorous and dutiful (the first sounding of the theme of the movie), but she is just about exhausted. How brilliantly the great director William Wyler shows us her state: during another stultifying reception, the young princess, under the cover of her long dress, has slipped her left foot out of her shoe, and is scratching her right shin with it! Her face is unchanged, but we keep going back to that errant foot. Immediately we all know how she feels, and that night, in bed, when she can't take anymore and begins screaming at her attendants who are trying to go over her packed schedule for the next day, why, we are right there with her. In fact, we're thinking, \"I'd've cracked long ago!\" But she is Royal, without the luxury for hysterics. So they summon a doctor, who gives her a sedative, telling her it will make her feel very good, and then it will make her sleep. The attendants leave, and, under the influence of that happy drug, she dresses, slips out of the mansion, finds a delivery truck about to leaves, stows away, and makes her escape into the Rome of Common People.Joe Bradley (Peck), an American journalist who is just barely getting by, is losing at poker to, among others, his photographer friend Irving Radovich (Albert). Bradley takes his last 5,000-lira note, puts it in his jacket pocket, and calls it a day. Walking home, he sees the princess asleep on a curbside. He tries to go past, but somehow can't, and he tries to put her in a cab. When she drunkenly insists she lives at The Coliseum, the cab driver will not take custody, and Mr. Bradley is stuck with her.Who remembers a day when an intoxicated woman could stumble into a single man's apartment, drunkenly ask for help out of her clothes, and he NOT take advantage of her? And here the movie sounds the theme of duty again. Bradley gives her pajamas, points her to the bathroom, and leaves the apartment for a few minutes to allow her to arrange herself. He comes back and finds her asleep, almost comatose, in his bed.At the office the next day, he picks up a newspaper and realizes he has the princess asleep in his apartment! He gets his editor to promise him $5,000 (not lira) for an exclusive interview with Her Royal Highness, calls Irving for help, and rushes home. There he finds her dressed, a little embarrassed, buy royally poised about what has happened. Gently, slowly, he tempts her to extend her hookey-playing for the rest of the day.The rest of the movie is a luscious travelogue of Rome. You will forget almost immediately that you are watching in black and white, I promise! And the burgeoning relationship of the principals, Mr. Bradley and Her Incognito Highness, is nothing short of a delight.(POSSIBLE MINOR SPOILER) In the last few decades, when \"If it feels good do it\" has become almost a religious mantra, to the ruination of literally millions of people, a sweet and simple comedy where all the people ultimately do their duty, do the right thing, even when it is hard, even when it is painful, is like the first rain after a long drought. There is a fabulous moral here, one desperately needed today. This is a beautiful movie, romantic, a little screwball here and there, heart-breakingly beautiful, and, if you pay attention, an underlying ode to duty. You need to see this movie. Over and over.",

The underlying tension makes it inevitable that the story that would earn Bradley $5000 simply cannot be published because it would betray the pure love he experienced. The tension is secondary to the romance, but still interesting because it would destroy the romance if the photographer decides to release the pictures he took -- but, in the end, honoring the joy of the relationship wins out and even the photographer has to honor it. The moment when the photographer gives her the pictures so she will have mementos of the wonderful day was extremely tender. The bitter part of the bittersweet ending has nothing to do with the trivial loss of the newspaper story and the $5000, but the fact that they will never be together again. But the sweetness of the grand memory that can never be reproduced makes the perfection of the day stay completely intact. So the sweet swallows the bitter and swells the heart. I loved this film.",

They take you to all the important places in Rome. I was shocked to know that Audrey was cast since they wanted a new comer. She looks at her delightful best in the movie. Apart from the Black and white tinge and the happy sense in the move, the movie is also backed by some heavy acting in the end.

            "content": "Before I saw Roman Holiday, I had not seen many romantic-comedy movies. In fact, before I saw Roman Holiday, the only live-action romantic movie I probably had seen was Titanic. I guess I just wasn't really that interested. But then I saw Roman Holiday, which forever changed my perspective. The movie's plot was fairly simple, which is good because that allows the movie to not get tangled in its own plot; like other romantic-comedy movies made these days sometimes do. This also allows people to easily track what is going on in the film too. The simplicity of Roman Holiday's plot also allows the film to be a little more lighthearted and breezy that other movies like itself, due to the fact that the movie doesn't allow itself to get caught up in its own plot; this also means that the movie can focus more on the two main stars and their film relationship, and not on the princess's royal obligations, which allows the film to focus on things such as the iconic motorcycle tour scene and scenes that explore the chemistry between Audrey Hepburn and Gregory Peck like the boat-dance and gelato scenes. But during all of this, the story still manages to create an unforgettable enjoyable love story as well, all confined within a fun-loving Roman atmosphere. The acting in this movie is just great! Hepburn is funny and charming. Peck is cool and handsome, and Eddie Albert does a great job portraying the side role of the clueless photographer Irving. They're great fun-loving characters which at times feel very, very real. What's more, they're characters that you just can't help to root for. What's good about the movie is that both of its two star actors manage to portray a variety of deft emotions throughout the film with great execution. Love, sadness, frustration, happiness, confusion, you name it! Both Hepburn and Peck perform all these emotions with terrific execution! And besides portraying emotions well, Hepburn and Peck also have an excellent chemistry which shines through the film like a flashlight. Their chemistry makes them a great duo to watch. They also balance each other out as well. And even though the acting is probably the strongest driving force behind Roman Holiday, there are other equally-important forces behind the movie's success. One of these forces is the Roman Holiday's cinematography and set design. The opening scene comprises various beautiful shots of locations in Europe and the cinematography doesn't let up there, we see beautiful shots of various Rome locations such as the Colosseum throughout the rest of the movie. And the set design is often natural looking, gorgeous, and extravagant. And if you combine these factors with decent costume design and good makeup and hairstyling, you get a rather good-looking movie. Stylish sequences such as the previously-mentioned motorcycle sequence and topical humor delivered by both Hepburn and Peck are also strong driving forces of this movie. Not to mention well-designed characters, a bittersweet moving back-to-reality ending, fun-sequences, and decent morals. If you were to combine all of these elements into one big package, you would get Roman Holiday. And then what do you do? You probably ask. Well, you watch it. And after you watch it, with a little bit of luck, you will probably find that you enjoyed it as much as me.",

What a natural! She played the part of a princess with such unforced grace and charm that it seemed she was born for the role. And how easily she changed from a regal monarch to a fun-loving girl cavorting about Rome with her new friend, Joe, perfectly played by Gregory Peck. No American director has been able to film love scenes as convincingly as William Wyler (see FUNNY GIRL and WUTHERING HEIGHTS, e. g.), and here, the developing love between Peck and Hepburn is flawless. If the ending is bittersweet, at least both characters matured from the experience. Maybe Princess Di should have cut loose and run around free for a while, but with this information age, she probably would have been instantly recognized and tailed by papparizzi with far less finesse than Peck and Hepburn.",

            "content": "Audrey Hepburn was magical, from her earliest film roles, until the day she left us. She shines brightly on the arm of Gregory Peck in this light-hearted but meaningful romantic comedy. There are several references to the papparazi, as Peck is a stringer (reporter for a Syndicated News Agency) out to get a scoop. He takes the hapless young Princess under his wing for his own purposes at first, but she soon wins his loyalty, and probably his heart, with her guileless charm.Since the death of Princess Diana of Wales in 1997, this movie has a particular bittersweetness to it. Once again, we are reminded that although being a Princess has its glories and glamour, sometimes the ordinary joys of a simpler life are longed for and cherished above all else. The recurring theme in the movie is the control that royal life had on the young girl, and the lengths that she went to in order to experience a brief respite.The \"holiday\" is light, funny and very enjoyable. Hepburn seems to be better matched with Peck in this film than with some of the older leading men that she was paired with during her early years. Peck is funny, Audrey is delightful, and the movie is a treat!",

So the question is: does she deserve the Oscar given she was playing herself, rather than playing a difficult role well?Only snag in this film are the sometimes over-zealous efforts on being comic, such as the spilling of drinks by Peck and the somewhat noisy music.Entertaining and highly recommended on Hepburn alone.",

I've not seen the film, but on the strength of this alone-I was recently made aware of it-I now intend to buy a DVD of it.

Audrey Hepburn with her debut performance in the movie sets the stage on fire. This movie actually made Audrey a superstar overnight. Whereas, the work of Gregory Peck as Joe an American reporter is ice on the cake. Roman Holiday is a nice blend of fantasy and reality. The whole movie set is located in beautiful locations of Europe. Wyler has shown all his professionalism and wide knowledge of romantic comedies in the movie. If Wyler has to make some movie and it does not get huge success, this can never be possible. This movie also won an Oscar for the Best story. The movie starts with the goodwill tour of a royal Princess Ann (Audrey) of an unknown European country. The tour begins with London and follows to the great Buckingham Palace and later on Rome, Italy. Ann finds this tour with full of obligations where she has to follow high class customs. It is more than a royal cage for her, which she later escapes and meets a journalist, Joe in Rome, who is covering her royal visit to Italy but has never seen her in reality. So, being unaware of Ann's identity he offers her a night to spend in his apartment as he sees her lying on a bench in cold. But when he gets to know Ann's reality, he plans to earn a lot of money by not revealing that he is a journalist. Eddie Albert also did a fabulous job in the movie. The way he takes Princess Ann's photographs for the secret interview proves him a perfect match for Joe's support, which also leads him an Oscar nomination. Even in black and white era, the beauty of the locations makes you mesmerize. The storyline of the movie never takes you out of track, not even for once. It holds you till the last and beautifully depicts Audrey's innocence and how she frees herself from the prison of royalty. The terrific performance of Hepburn gets her Academy Award for the best performance in the lead role. It is an amazing film that I'm sure no one could miss. Audrey and Greg have great chemistry. It is a masterpiece from true classic collection. It is a worth watching and one of the most charming classic fairy tale of all time. A must watch movie!!",

The reverse of \"Queen for a Day\" the ideal of most people's dreams.After an outburst of independence is treated with a tranquilizing injection from the royal family doctor, the heroine finds herself falling asleep on a bench, picked up by a news reporter, and taken to sleep off what he thinks is her alcoholic stupor at his modest apartment. After her adventures in Rome with the reporter and his photographer for the next 24 hours, the royal princess returns to a worried staff and resumes her monarchy.The role of the press in the \"holiday\" for the Princess is clear. After photographing compromising pictures of royalty, the situation unfolds, due to surfacing human compassion, that the reporters refrain from publishing the scenes, or telling the story.All in all, it's an enjoyable movie, from the past, applicable to the present.

I do understand the decision to focus on the journalist and near the end trust in facial expressions and silence.Truly a masterpiece and for anyone that is young and watches movies from now, these old gems are really important.

The film is shot in BW, but it is a known fact that Wyler wanted to switch to color stock.  It wasn't to be due to costs.  The on-location shooting in Rome is beautiful, one can only dream of how it would have looked in \"glorious technicolor\"!  The cinematography was exceptional, it captured the very heart of this timeless city called Rome.  Hepburn, in her first American film caught the hearts of millions world-wide and created a legion of fans and worshippers that would influence social culture for the next twenty years.

As another steppingstone towards finalizing the genre's standards we minimally watch in the present, it beautifully stuns and wondrously delights with familiar antics that garners amusing chuckles along an elegantly solid script amid brilliantly captured scenery. Audrey Hepburn's other breakthrough charismatically and innocently shines as it initially defines through her acclaimed roles afterwards while her shared, humanly humble chemistry with Gregory Peck, who performed naturally with praiseworthy ease, finally realizes the realism in romance that most of today's romantic pursuits rather sugarcoat to satisfy the desperate as realistic acceptance finds a way in gems.

The film gives an abundance of scenery. In Roman Holiday a princess escapes an embassy in Rome and then ends up falling in love with a news reporter. \n\tThe writing in Roman Holiday enables the characters named Princess Ann and Joe Bradley to be very involved with each other. Joe Bradley and Princess Ann don't fall in love instantly or the moment they meet because then she's sedated. Later on, they act as if they've known each other for months or even years.  They kiss and hug so passionately that it's philosophical because it makes us wonder which is more passionate a kiss or a hug? It's heartbreaking when Joe drives Ann to her embassy and they say goodbye. It's almost or just as distressing as losing a loved one through death.\n\tAudrey Hepburn and Gregory Peck give lots of attraction between the central characters with their acting abilities. When Joe drives Ann towards her embassy towards the end of the film he looks as if he wonders if she's sure she wants to go back to her castle.  He acts as if she has a choice or possibly has a choice. Audrey Hepburn brings plenty of connection between Ann and Joe. When she sees him at the news conference, and they both look at each other with so much emotion that you could swear they both are looking into each other's eyes.   \n\tRoman Holiday shows a great deal of scenery.  This is absolutely appropriate since it's actually shot in Rome. It shows a love interest between the central characters particularly with them going to well-known places like the Colosseum and the Trevi fountain. \n\tRoman Holiday is very romantic with creating unity between two characters and shows pretty scenery.",

            "content": "A timeless romantic affair.\n\nWilliam Wyler's romantic comedy Roman Holiday (1953) is a sweet, classy, and beautiful picture of enduring warmth, charm, and craft. Wyler takes you on a neat Roman getaway as this film is practically a travel brochure that makes you want to visit Rome for 2 hours. Wyler's direction feels well honed and refined with a clear focus on the personal relationship building naturally as they visit Rome and get to know one another, instead of the romance genre's cliche of love at first sight.\n\nDalton Trumbo's story is very cute about a bored princess, sick of her responsibilities as a royal, who escapes into the night for a quick vacation throughout Rome. Trumbo's focus on deception, duties, and romance make for a grounded relationship. He juxtaposes a princess on tour across Europe with an American newspaperman stationed in Rome as mutually bored with life, longing for romance, and stumbling into genuine forbidden love. Trumbo's writing is deft and realistic with a zest for just relaxing and enjoying life for what it is no matter where you're supposed to be in that moment. Roman Holiday is as charming as romance comedy has ever been.\n\nRobert Swink keeps Roman Holiday moving at a steady pace, so you can relax and enjoy the ambiance of Rome alongside the heroes for 2 blissful hours. Henri Alekan and Franz Planer's cinematography is stunning with lovely wide shots all around Rome and intimate close-ups that capture a fleeting feeling or deep love alike. Georges Auric's score is dreamy and romantic, which helps the Roman backdrop feel all the more serene.\n\nI must mention Edith Head's adorable costumes for Audrey Hepburn. Head makes Hepburn look fashionable, comfortable, natural, and cool in every single scene. Her style choices are remarkably modern for an older picture. Wally Westmore and Alberto De Rossi's make-up is very cute and effortless for the adorable Audrey Hepburn. Her short pixie cut is refreshingly contemporary and brings out her pretty face. Hepburn herself is simply a darling of charismatic charm, flawless beauty, playful humor, forlorn dramatic longing, and timeless grace.\n\nGregory Peck is excellent as the funny man out for himself, who learns to love a curious lady with all the dreamy personality of a princess. His chemistry with Audrey Hepburn feels authentic because of Peck's grounded sternness. He never comes across like he's trying to fall in love, which makes his amorous fall all the sweeter to watch.\n\nIn all, Roman Holiday is one of those enduring classics of romantic comedy and sincere sympathy for its hero and heroine. Audrey Hepburn alone is worth watching Roman Holiday for honestly.",

The climactic kiss appears more an impulsive and exploitative gesture, not motivated by love or even passing desire.\n\nGiven the huge publicity around this princess, is it reasonable to suggest she could wander the crowded Roman streets filled with tourists, including I presume many from her (unstated) Anglophone home nation without a single person recognising her? \n\nA great disappointment, considering the plaudits this film and its two leads received.",

Unfortunately the presence of the always annoying Audrey Hepburn spoiled the film and a lack of chemistry between herself and Gregory Peck, who I expect so much more from, sinks a film that has a decent premise from the outset. I simply cannot believe that Hepburn would be rewarded for her work in this film as she is sickening in how poorly she acts and her competition included Deborah Kerr in From Here to Eternity (1953) and Ava Gardner in Mogambo (1953). If you want a great romantic comedy from the early 1950s watch The Quiet Man (1952) or Singin' in the Rain (1952) both of which far exceed this overrated film in wit and charm.\n\nPrincess Ann, Audrey Hepburn, is bored with her lifestyle of being ferried around to various exotic locations and being forced into attending events she does not want to attend and having to follow certain etiquette. She finds freedom when she meets reporter Joe Bradley, Gregory Peck, after taking some sleeping pills and falling asleep on a park bench where he finds her and takes her back to his apartment. He decides to use her in order to have a decent story to publish in the newspaper he works as a journalist for but the two predictably fall in love as they spend more time together. The two end up apart however as she is still bound to her responsibilities while he decides not to publish the story and sadly leaves her.\n\nA good romantic comedy needs a likable female lead, think Claudette Colbert, Meg Ryan or Barbara Stanwyck, unfortunately Hepburn is not that. Her performance features her indulging in some of her worst habits as an actress as she fails to convince me that she is tired within the opening scenes, attracted to Peck during the mid section of the film and finally melancholy in the closing scenes which were presumably why the Academy felt safe in awarding her the Best Actress trophy. The other element that a good romantic comedy needs is chemistry between it's leads and despite Peck being a fantastic actor, as shown in To Kill a Mockingbird (1962), he and Hepburn are flat as they spend time together. The dynamic between them seems off as we are meant to see him become less uptight through his romance with her while she experiences real freedom and love for the first time but I wasn't wrapped up in the excitement when they ride a Vespa through the city. Failing on both counts makes this film a poor representation of a wonderful genre and I am sad that this film gets more recognition than classics like The Lady Eve (1941) and A New Leaf (1971).\n\nThe big romantic set pieces in the film, the Vespa ride, the dance on the boat, the big kiss etc. lacked the sweetness or the sexiness of the best scenes in films like It Happened One Night (1934). I wasn't caught up in the childlike excitement of Hepburn as she carelessly zips about on her Vespa and the kiss landed with a dull thud instead of being the dramatic climax it would have been in a better film. The screenwriters seemed to run out of ideas as they moved beyond the basic premise as the fish out of water gags that the Princess receives are not particularly funny and there was no flirty banter between the two leads to occupy the first act of the film. A better screenplay would have used the same basic structure but included more interesting characters, stronger conflicts for both of the main characters and better execution of the big moments.\n\nI am shocked that this film came out in the same year as a classic of the romantic drama genre From Here to Eternity (1953) which features a better screenplay, performances and location. This is one of the lesser films nominated for Best Picture in 1953 along with The Robe (1953) and Julius Caesar (1953) while Shane (1953) and the aforementioned winner are absolutely fantastic films that earn their status as some of the best films of 1953.",

The comedy may not be up to the standards of those more contemporary rom-coms which owe their existence to this one, but the romance and passion and chemistry feel like they haven't aged a day, as eternal and impossibly phantasmic as the Eternal City of Rome itself, the city of perpetual desire, where nothing lasts forever except its self-perpetuation.",

            "content": "Watched Feb 26, 2018\n\nMatt Kerr's review published on Letterboxd :\nThis review may contain spoilers.\n\nThis is the second film I have seen in the last week where Audrey Hepburn gains confidence after getting her hair cut short in Europe, upon which she is manipulated by an older man who lies to her for their own financial benefit, only for the two of them to realise they have fallen in love and these fiscal plans to be abandoned. However, where Sabrina (1954) gets caught up in massive plot contrivances, irrational decisions and suffers from not writing its characters relateable enough, Roman Holiday (1953) [god were these two extremely similar films really released a year within each other?!] is able to mostly avoid lots of these problems. Instead of actively going into the situation with distructive intent, like the formers Linus Larabee (Humphrey Bogart), Joe Bradley (Gregory Peck) falls into this situation, and acts impulsively on what he sees as an opportunistic offering, making him already more understandable, *spoiler* his decision to give up his plans in the end more admirable.\n\nI am of the opinion that it may be impossible to shoot a film badly in Rome (The Great Beauty is a personal favorite). Roman Holiday stands the test of time for a few reasons. One is its nostalgic tinge of Rome in the 1950s, a city that is ever changing yet hypocritically has also remained the same for a millennia. Another is its compelling casting, Peck and Hepburn both in their prime (sorry to fire more shots at Sabrina, but not something that could be said for Bogart at the time (sorry not sorry)). Finally, and most importantly, it manages to be pretty damn funny at times, although a lot of this is more likely to draw a sentimental smile rather than booming laughter. A compelling piece of Golden-age romantic comedy.",

The scenery and architecture are gorgeous, and they take advantage of all the areas they film in. The Vespa ride is a classic scene, as is the Liar's Mouth statue scene. Gregory Peck takes his first proper crack at comedy, and while he's often completely outmatched by his co-star, he still turns in a likable performance. The truth is, while it has its faults, Hepburn is the real reason we remember this film. She illuminates every shot with her eyes and lights up every moment with her smile. She's a joy to watch and makes the role completely her own. Hard to believe she almost received considerably lower billing.

Gregory Peck, less wooden than usual, is the American reporter who stumbles upon her when she makes a late-night break for freedom from her minders.  The next day, the two (along with photographer Eddie Albert) spend the day visiting Roman tourist destinations (shot on location) in a carefree way but comically underscored by the efforts of the journalists to conceal their identities and true purpose (to get a scoop for their paper).  Of course, Peck and Hepburn fall in love - but, after all is said and done, she is a princess and must return to her duties.  Or must she? Dalton Trumbo came up with the story (while blacklisted as part of the Hollywood 10) and received his Oscar posthumously in the 1990s.  Breezy and special, due primarily to Hepburn's charisma but Wyler also knew a thing or two about directing and hits the right emotional notes, expertly playing the audience.

It all makes for a very romantic film.   Hepburn played her part perfectly, expressing frustration and joy with such economy, as well as the restraint that comes from being a royal.  Among several others, the scene with her getting her hair cut short is captivating, and it's no wonder that she won an Oscar for her performance.    Peck's performance is also excellent, and Eddie Albert pulls off the part of a young rogue quite well despite being 47 at the time.   I won't spoil the ending, except to say it's touching and poignant, and so perfectly shot in the Palazzo Colonna.

He was on the verge of getting fired for he sleeping in and missed an interview with HRH Princess Ann. Princess Ann runs away from her life and rescued from danger by handsome reporter. Comparing to the current a lot of rated R romantic movies, Roman Holiday did a really good job. First of all, director used all beautiful scenes to tell a charming love story instead of using sexual scenes, this makes Roman Holiday becomes the movie that whole family can enjoy together. Second, this movie taught audiences that love are no races, classes, and boundary. \nThe Mouth of Truth was considered the funniest scene of the whole movie. Joe Bradley puts his hand into the sculpture's mouth at The Mouth of Truth. According to legend, the sculpture would nip off the hand of liars who are put hands in its mouth. In the film, Audrey Hepburn's reaction was not an act, as he decided to pull a gag without telling her beforehand, not because of her na\u00efve, just because of she was totally trusted Joe. There is another famous scene of Joe deriving a Vespa scooter with Princess Ann sitting behind him and her arms holding around joe. I felt function of these beautiful scenes are ten times stronger than sexual scenes of current movies. \nBeautiful loyal princess fell in love with American news reporter. Even if there was a whole different between them, the different class, different nationalities, we could even say they lived in two whole different society. But the pure love between them let them over came all the differences and has made Roman Holiday became the most remarkable movie for generations.   \n There is no doubt Roman Holiday is classical, sweet and charming romantic comedy. Made world fell in love with Audrey Hepburn and her beautiful smile. And almost every man want to run out and buy a Vespa scooter have a ride with their beautiful women.

The plot is always the same, it is about a famous person running away and meeting someone who lies about their identity to get something from the celebrity. Naturally they fall in love. This movie handled it in a very sweet fashion with rather innocent adventures that I couldn't imagine being all that embarrassing for her. That is the one thing that I had difficulty with when watching Roman Holiday. With the exception of a few details, which could have been left out, it felt like they could have written an article that wasn't even remotely salacious. In the end, I was genuinely worried about Gregory Peck's financial well-being because of how things are left. That little quibble aside, I found the ending simply magical. It was so different from any of my expectations that I had a huge smile on my face throughout that sequence. Gregory Peck and Audrey Hepburn were excellent and showed why they are legends in the business. Eddie Albert offered good comic relief moments, and his interactions with Peck genuinely felt like 2 friends who totally understand one another. There were definitely slow moments in the story that I wish it had moved through more smoothly, but the overall experience of watching Roman Holiday was nice. It's a charming film that I would recommend to others.",

And he's a reporter who is just after the 5 grand his boss promised him which was a small fortune those days. And, you expect me to believe virtually no one recognizes her as she travels around Rome despite being on the front page of the newspaper? And, I found the brawl discomforting; the film would have been better off without it. And, you expect me to believe that after physically brawling with half a dozen men, he has no injuries, no cuts, no bruises, no black eye?? But, ultimately the allure of Audrey, and the chemistry between them overrides all this. And the ending is FANTASTIC. It's in the subtle way he lets her know he won't scandalize her by publishing what he knows. And when Eddie Albert terrifies her by showing her his camera, he quickly makes up for it by handing over the photos. And the greatest part of all, that haunting unforgettable last look she gives to Gregory Peck, full of pain, anguish, but overridden by gratitude and love. Yes, all that in just one unforgettable look.",

            "content": "4/4 stars. This is a fun, feel-good romantic comedy. It took the formula from \"It Happened One Night\" and cemented it into nearly every romantic comedy that followed. \n\nIf nothing else, this film is worth seeing because it is Hepburn's first major role. She is magnificent, and even won an Oscar for her performance. Gregory Peck is impeccable (ba-doom-crash) as well. William Wyler is an incredible director, and the most amazing thing about him to me is his incredible range (if you told me that this was the same guy who directed Ben-Hur and The Collector, I would have called BS). He does a great job here, making sure the actors are top-notch, as well as taking full advantage of shooting on location in Rome. The film as a result is always involving and pretty to the eyes. The plot is standard romantic comedy, with a few twists (especially the ending), and a few moments of real suspense. Luckily, things are kept lighthearted with some subtle humor. However, there are a few plot holes (i.e. ((spoiler alert)) Why did they just instantly fall in love? Why does he refuse to publish the story?). Character development isn't lengthy, but it doesn't really have to be. \n\nUltimately, the aforementioned flaws are just scratches on the surface of a great movie. The look is beautiful, the acting is great, the humor is very subtle and/or slapstick, but also funny. Modern day romantic comedies (i.e. impersonators) could learn a lot from this film. While modern day romantic comedies rely on explicit sex jokes to entertain, this one simply relies on a few slapstick gags and a feel-good vibe, and because of that is also about five times better than it's modern day impersonators.",

It provides a better understanding for love, as to how it sets you free from the boring routines in life and makes the world around you so much more lively and exciting.

Her performance is magical and charming, winning her an Oscar for Best Actress.  Although I believe that her performances in \"My Fair Lady,\" \"Wait Until Dark,\" and \"Breakfast at Tiffany's\" were more deserving of an Oscar, this is still one of her greatest films.  I cringed when she had her hair cut, and somehow she became even cuter.  This is why Audrey is one of my favorites.  As endearing as Hepburn's character is, she requires a boisterous man to provoke her and Gregory Peck is the perfect man for the job.  The setting is wonderful but it is the dialogue and the characters that really make this into something special.  Its perfect blend of comedy, romanticism, and curiosity as to which resolution the story will take makes for an emotional first time watch and a heartwarming second, third, and fifteenth watch.  Simply put, it is one of the greatest chick flicks of all time.  My favorite moment is when Peck puts his hand into the \"Mouth of Truth,\" not warning his co-star ahead of time of his planned visual gag and eliciting a 100% genuine scream from her.  Even better is the chemistry in the 10 seconds that follow that moment, as they laugh about it like two best friends - true love.  The plot is clever and sneaky, Hepburn is cute as a button, and the ending is incredible (although I have never pleaded so hard with the tv not to say \"The End\"...) - \"Roman Holiday\" is a perfect portrait of love.",

The two stars, Audrey Hepburn and Gregory Peck are magical together.  It is one of those films that I never get tired of watching, especially since it introduced the world the lovely Audrey Hepburn to the world.\r\n\r\nHepburn plays Princess Anne who is in Rome on a diplimatic trip.  She decides to shake off her guards and see the city incognito.  She meets Joe Bradley (Peck), an american journalist covering a story.  Bradley recognizes Anne and sees a great story coming.  He offers to give her a tour of the city.  He, however, finds himself falling for her.\r\n\r\nWhen they were filmming the film Peck said that Audrey is so good that she will win an Oscar for her film debut.  He was right.  She was awarded the Best Actress trophy for her performance.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v48/Zeppo1/RomanHoliday_zps3c9a6a7e.jpg[/IMG]",

The last movie to really get this formula (I hate that word) right was \"Silver Linings Playbook\", a shamelessly traditional throwback to screwball movieland, that was also not afraid to touch on larger and more important themes than a happy ending (even if \"SLP\" ultimately and unfortunately feeds one to you anyway.) Both films land a big smile on your face without delving to sap, and those kind of rom-coms shouldn't be stoned for it. Life's enough of a bitch already.

Along the way, she meets an American journalist who accompanies her on her one day of freedom and also inevitably falls in love with her. The jokes are mostly comprised of simple slapstick and gender gags, and are only mildly amusing, though the directing talent at work makes it enjoyable to watch and the pacing doesn't lag at any particular juncture in the story.

Hepburn won Oscar for Best Actress for her performance in the film; movie also won two more in the categories of the screenplay and costume design. \r\n\r\nPrincess Ann (Audrey Hepburn) represents an unnamed European country. She is on a continental tour, and this is her latest in Rome. She's fed up with messy schedule and planned life. One night she slips out of the palace and into the city. She poses as a drunk, homeless girl. Finally spotted by reporter Joe Bradley (Gregory Peck) he brings her back to his apartment so she can sleep it off after seeing her in pitiful sleepy condition. Very next morning, he discovers the identity of his mysterious guest and fun starts.\r\n\r\nThis is most certainly unique story, and I must state here that having watched this movie I was so excited that I jumped in the air. Audrey Hepburn looks sweetheart and kissable every time her delicious persona appeared on screen. What a mesmerizing character she made out of it, changing the core and fundamental understanding of bubbly character. One thing I did come to accept, is that Audrey was truly a cheerful actress that lived in her times. Gregory Peck put humorous fun to his character, so much that I started questioning myself, is that Peck who I often envisioned to be rather dramatic and expressionist. \r\n\r\nWilliam Wyler's direction is superb; I cannot stop thinking how much fun and amusements the cast and crew might have had during the filming. Somewhere I read that this film bears extraordinary magnetism to pull audience (even) from modern era more forcibly than most of other b&w movies. A worth watching whimsical film.",

            "content": "When Roman Holiday was in the planning stages William Wyler envisioned either Elizabeth Taylor or Jean Simmons in the role of the princess. When neither proved available, he and Paramount studios decided to do a Scarlett O'Hara type search for an unknown for the part. The film then would only have Gregory Peck as the star to draw the people in.\n\nBut when Peck saw the screen test and also realized the film would rise and fall on the performance of the princess part, he insisted on top billing for Audrey Hepburn. Audrey had only done a few small bit parts in some English films up till then, however Peck insisted on the billing of her right after him with 'introducing Audrey Hepburn' as her title credit. \n\nIn the same way that William Holden credited Barbara Stanwyck with helping him get through Golden Boy, Audrey Hepburn credited Gregory Peck with her performance in Roman Holiday. As well as William Wyler who still has a record of more people getting to the Oscar sweepstakes for his films than any other director.\n\nRoman Holiday is simple and delightful film about a young princess of some unnamed European country who gets tired of her programmed routine and wants a break from it. In Rome while on a European tour, princess Audrey fakes an illness and runs off for a day of fun.\n\nAn American wire service reporter Gregory Peck finds her and realizes he's got an exclusive. So he chaperones her around without letting her know she's on to him. He even gets photographer Eddie Albert to help him out.\n\nEddie Albert got the first of two nominations for Best Supporting Actor for Roman Holiday, the second one being The Goodbye Girl. He lost to Frank Sinatra for From Here to Eternity. Though Albert is funny in this film, for dramatic work I never understood why he was not nominated for Attack or for Captain Newman, MD.\n\nIf you're thinking that the film is starting to bear a resemblance to a continental It Happened One Night you would be right. And if that's your thinking it will come as no surprise to learn that Frank Capra originally had the idea to film this. The property reverted to Paramount as part of his settlement to leave that studio after doing two Bing Crosby films.\n\nI wish Paramount had done Roman Holiday in color though. Darryl F. Zanuck over at 20th Century did Three Coins in the Fountain in gorgeous color and later on MGM did The Seven Hills of Rome also in color. Still the Roman locations really add a lot to Audrey's adventure.\n\nWhen Oscar time Audrey Hepburn in her first starring role and really first role of any consequence won an Oscar for Best Actress. Until the day she died Audrey Hepburn had charm enough for ten, you can't help but love her in anything she ever did. Even if the film she did was not that great, Audrey sparkles through.\n\nEven in black and white, the Eternal City with Audrey and Greg make anyone young at heart.",

Hepburn is as adorable here as she would be the rest of her career, and while I wouldn't call her performance exactly Oscar worthy, at least by today's standards, it isn't difficult to see how the entire planet would become so smitten with her. My complaints with Roman Holiday have little to do with Hepburn, rather more so with the directing and her costar. Now I love Gregory Peck as much as the next guy, but he feels miscast and I never entirely bought his character's arc, especially the romance stuff. They have a decent enough chemistry, but I wouldn't describe it as from the classic mold. The directing I also feel lacks energy and is much too leisurely for a romantic comedy, even for one depicting a \"holiday\" in Rome. It's no surprise the guy who directed the borefest Ben Hur was behind this as well. The plot is as by the books as these things go, but it throws a slight wrinkle in towards the end and the bittersweet ending is a strong touch. Roman Holiday is a perfectly likeable and charming film, albeit one I feel is a bit overrated and one Hepburn would surpass a year later with the more well-rounded Sabrina.",

It's unique in its own right - and quite poignant as well. The ending is slightly bittersweet in my view, but that's also one of the beauties in this wonderful classic. Comedy is also plenty in it - the fight by the Tiber river being a high point.\n\nNeedless to say, all this could not have happened without the presence of Hepburn. She has a sense of simplicity that we perceive in her movements and words - she never spices her words with sophistication or royalty. And Gregory Peck as Joe Bradley is awesome too, as is his sidekick Eddie Albert. Roman Holiday is a romantic comedy with a touch of bitterness and pessimism towards the end: a much loved film that should never be forgotten and taken for granted. It is a Cinderella story turned upside down - a contortion that ultimately becomes even more delightful than that original fairy tale itself. It is also one of the most breathtakingly beautiful films I've ever encountered thus far.",

Roman Holiday is not only the Oscar winning debut of Audrey, but it sets a new high in the romantic comedy genre.\r\n\r\nStaring my 2 favourite classic actors, Audrey Hepburn and Gregory Peck, roman holiday debuts Ms. Hepburn as Princess Anne who is traveling all across Europe. And she hates every minute of it. Though administered a drug to sleep, Anne escapes her guarded palace and goes out into the city of Rome. Peck stars as a reporter for the American newspaper who finds Anne, drugged and passed out. Not knowing she is the princess her takes her into his apartment to sleep, but when he finds out her true identity he also finds a story of a lifetime. The 2 play a game of wits, both of them spending the next day together but not revealing who they really are. Even with the kind of cliches that have developed since this movie, Roman Holiday doesn't loose its romantic charm for an instance. This tale of deceit turns into a very romantic forbidden love tale to die for. And no one better could have been in to than Hepburn and Peck. Roman Holiday is incredibly romantic, very funny, and the last 10 minutes of the movie will leave you breathless.\r\n\r\nThe great William Wyler directs this movie wonderfully. He chose to direct this movie under the condition that they use absolutely NO BACKDROPS. Roman Holiday is entirely filmed in Rome. We see plenty of wonderful sights Rome has to offer. We're taken down various streets, we see wonderful architecture, and we even go into the Coliseum. We get a great view of the wonderful city, and it works wonderfully, making the movie even more romantic. The directing of scenes is just wonderful too, making a lot of moments very memorable, hilarious, and the hard to pull of romance that seems to appear naturally in the performances of Hepburn and Peck. But the best executed scene has to be \"The Mouth of Truth\" scene. You have to watch it. It's brilliant. The cinematography captures as much of the beauty of Rome as it does out of Audrey Hepburn. The camera angles and lighting for scenes are appropriate and fantastic, especially the ending. (seriously. I love the ending) And lets not forget the costumes of Audrey that make her look like a real princess. Very fashionable.\r\n\r\nOne of the best romance movies of all time, and it can be enjoyed by all. Audrey Hepburn and Gregory Peck make a heartwarming pair on screen, and the way this movie was made just makes the entire movie brilliant. You don't have to be an Audrey Hepburn fan or a rom-com fan to enjoy this one. Roman Holiday is the perfect movie to cheer you up at any day.",

It's two stars have a good chemistry too. Ann (Audrey Hepburn) is the crown princess of a country that isn't named. But, she's tired with tradition and the demands of her duties as a royal. One night, she runs away from her countries embassy where she's staying, and heads off into Rome, but falls asleep on a bench. and is found by American Joe Bradley (Gregory Peck), a reporter working for the Rome office of the Daily American newspaper. He tries to take her home, but she ends up at his place. But, the next day, Joe discovers who the young girl at home really is. He wants to get an interview with her, and hides the fact he's a reporter, and Joe asks his photographer friend, Irving Radovich (Eddie Albert), to tag along and take photos while he and Ann enjoy the sights of Rome. But, Ann seems to enjoy her freedom just a little too much, and it isn't before long when officials are out looking all over Rome for her. It's a very well made film, very lavish and rich in local flavour. This was Hepburn's first big film, and she makes quite an impression, while Peck makes a smooth, charismatic lead male to rival Cary Grant. Nearly 60 years on, it still hasn't aged.",

Once there, reporter Joe (Peck) finds her dazed and confused, and he helps her out. He and his friend Irving (Albert) then give Ann a day in the life. Coincidentally, Joe and Ann fall in love, which leaves you asking, will she choose her kingdom or romance? \"Roman Holiday\" is not just another chick flick like so many people are seeming to say here (it's most likely because Audrey Hepburn stars). This is an exceptional film that truly stands out from all of the other movies coming from the '50's. This isnt just another romantic comedy. It's stylish, witty, and in Rome, which is one of a kind considering how many rom-coms Paramount put out through the decade. This really captures the essence of the perfect movie. Audrey Hepburn does a superb job in her first role, doing things that most actresses usually don't do until years of experience. That Oscar win was correct for once, and somehow came to be her only win ever. Greg Peck is surprisingly excellent as well-- I was expecting him to not be too great considering he wasn't even nominated. What's wrong with the Academy? He really is almost equivalent to Hep on acting ability in this one, and I think though now it is realized that its one of his best roles, but then, he was just another leading man. The coincidence was, it seems like this film was what propelled Hep and Peck to stardom. This could possibly be in the top five list of William Wyler's best films. Though he was very experienced, you can see his genius shining through in every moment, especially in the ending when we finally see someone pick reality over happy ending. Bravo to him! \"Roman Holiday\" is a standout motion picture, and any fan of movies should have this on their must-watch list.",

For many cities, such as Los Angeles and Paris in La La Land, the way in which they are perceived by many does not actuallyBack when I reviewed La La Land, I discussed postmodernism. In particular, I discussed the concept of hyperreality. For many cities, such as Los Angeles and Paris in La La Land, the way in which they are perceived by many does not actually exist. These cities tend to be dream-like cities that people, over time, have romanticized heavily. Others can include Tokyo, Manhattan, Las Vegas, Miami, or maybe even London. These cities are ones where people have a concept of the city in their mind, but when they arrive, they realize the city of their dreams is not located there. What they imagined was this hyperreality that, in fact, was never really there. Rome, where Roman Holiday is obviously set, also meets this measure with various films and individuals romanticizing Rome to the point that the city ceases to exist. It is no longer there and what stands in its place is nothing anybody recognizes as Rome. Given that this romantic comedy is set in Rome, there is a connection between the hyperreality of Rome and their day spent together.In exploring the bounds of this dream world, Princess Ann (Audrey Hepburn) escapes from the embassy for a night out on the town. However, some sleeping medication ensures a night turns into a day when she is found by newsman Joe Bradley (Gregory Peck). Once he recognizes her, Joe hopes to score a good story out of his day with Ann, only to wind up falling for her instead. Together, the duo encounter the cops, drive mini-bikes, dance by the river, fight private security guards, and visit various tourist traps and memorials. Yet, their time together is fleeting. Ann must return to her country and duty as a princess. Joe wants to return to America. No matter how much both enjoy their time together in Rome, none of it really exists. Their relationship is one built on mutual deception and one that acts as a ticking time bomb. It must end and they must snap out of this dream world that is unlike any other experience in their life. Rome, for them, goes hand-in-hand with their dreamy day together and will, likewise, be imagined to be a far grander place than it really is under the surface of their dreams.Director William Wyler and screenwriter Dalton Trumbo quickly separate their dreams from their realities with their demeanor and actions in both. For the latter, Ann sets out to do things she never gets to do. As her family and upbringing is quite conservative, she wants to let loose and have a day to herself. She cuts her hair, dances with strange men, and dresses down. She paints the town red and turns Rome into the canvas upon which her dreams have been painted and drawn out. Alongside her, Joe indulges in a dream for a better life, only to come to realize that this better life would include Ann. Through this day together, both indulge in their dream world that both know cannot and will not last long, but they make the most of their time together. In many ways, this is somewhat akin to a film along the lines of Brief Encounter or The Bridges of Madison County. Though both concern affairs, they also depict forbidden love that has a time limit. Roman Holiday has a far shorter time limit and is scandalous for different reasons, but is scandalous nonetheless.In regards to their demeanor after the encounter, both are incredibly professional. They share nothing but looks with one another that imbue the passion they feel for one another akin to films such as Carol. Via nothing more than a look, the two show their passion and nostalgia for another, though both recognize that the relationship is not meant to last. Thus, there is no need to pretend otherwise. Furthermore, this finale that lacks a climactic romantic overture shows a direct influence on La La Land. Not only does that film often define itself by simple looks by its lovers, but it also tears them away from one another and leaves us waiting for Ann or Joe to go running after their love. Yet, that moment never comes and they go their separate ways. Naturally, Roman Holiday's finale is likely also influenced by Casablanca, as was La La Land's. Their relationship is not built to last and is best to remain in the dream world of Rome. Testing it out in a non-dream world would provide enough strain to tear them apart as they would feel their heart calling them away from that whom they love. This separation between dreams and reality is further established by the photos being returned to her and by Ann remaining tight-lipped to her servants. There is no record of what happened and nobody is speaking about anything. It will instead live on in their hearts and minds before it reaches the point where all parties begin to even wonder if it happened at all or if it were merely just a dream from a better world.",

However, where Sabrina (1954) gets caught up in massive plot contrivances, irrational decisions and suffers from not writing its characters relateable enough, Roman Holiday (1953) [god were these two extremely similar films really released a year within each other?!] is able to mostly avoid lots of these problems. Instead of actively going into the situation with distructive intent, like the formers Linus Larabee (Humphrey Bogart), Joe Bradley (Gregory Peck) falls into this situation, and acts impulsively on what he sees as an opportunistic offering, making him already more understandable, *spoiler* his decision to give up his plans in the end more admirable.I am of the opinion that it may be impossible to shoot a film badly in Rome (The Great Beauty is a personal favorite). Roman Holiday stands the test of time for a few reasons. One is its nostalgic tinge of Rome in the 1950s, a city that is ever changing yet hypocritically has also remained the same for a millennia. Another is its compelling casting, Peck and Hepburn both in their prime (sorry to fire more shots at Sabrina, but not something that could be said for Bogart at the time (sorry not sorry)). Finally, and most importantly, it manages to be pretty damn funny at times, although a lot of this is more likely to draw a sentimental smile rather than booming laughter. A compelling piece of Golden-age romantic comedy.",
