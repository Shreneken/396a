            "content": "One of the big blockbuster best sellers of the post World War II years is James Jones's From Here to Eternity, a tale of the peacetime army in Hawaii before Pearl Harbor. The book was definitely going to be made into a film and it was only a question of casting to make it a success.Director Fred Zinneman had a good intuitive sense about casting here, even against type. The two principal female parts were done against type. Deborah Kerr who made a career of playing respectable women played a captain's wife who's drinking and playing around. Not that husband Philip Ober is letting grass grow under his feet either, but Kerr's latest sexual exploit involves her with the First Sergeant of her husband's company, Burt Lancaster. Donna Reed, who up to that point was best known for being Mary Bailey in It's A Wonderful Life, plays a prostitute here. A girl from the wrong side of the tracks, jilted by a rich boyfriend stateside, she's in Hawaii to make money and then go home and buy some respectability. She's not looking for romance with any soldiers, but you can't plan these things.Especially Montgomery Clift if he comes in your life. It's been argued that this is Clift's greatest role and a case can sure be made for it. His character of Robert E. Lee Pruitt is like so many who still join the army today, from small town America who have no future there and find a home in the Armed Services. What makes Clift unique is that strong sense of individualism he can't control in an organization that does not encourage individuality.Clift and Lancaster are a great study in contrasts and that's what drives From Here to Eternity. Lancaster as Sergeant Milt Warden is the ultimate professional soldier, held in the highest regard by his men. Lancaster is someone who knows how to work the system, you see it in the way he manipulates his captain. Of course he's got to be a manipulator there since he's having an affair with Deborah Kerr. He tries to protect Clift from himself and ultimately fails.Clift has transferred into an infantry company and he was at one time a boxer. But he blinded someone in a fight and quit boxing. Philip Ober who prides himself on having several champions in various weight classes worked to get Clift in his company. Clift upsets his plans by refusing to box so he has the various sergeants give him \"the treatment.\" Clift's best friend in the company is a tough street wise soldier from the big city named Angelo Maggio, played by Frank Sinatra. Sinatra read the book and knew this part was for him. He did everything he had to do to get that part, including working for scale. At the time Sinatra was considered a has been as singer and actor. Sinatra was right on the money in terms of picking a role. His faith in himself and Columbia Pictures and Fred Zinneman's faith in him netted him an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor, one of eight awards won by From Here to Eternity.By the way Sinatra credited both Lancaster and Clift in helping him through this film as a dramatic actor. Lancaster and Sinatra didn't inhabit the same Hollywood orbit, but they remained friends for life. The same could not be said for Clift. Allegedly, some five or six years after From Here to Eternity and after Monty Clift's automobile accident while shooting Raintree County, Clift at some party at Sinatra's made a drunken pass at one of Sinatra's retainers. That got him kicked out of Sinatra's circle permanently.In fact From Here to Eternity was also the Best Picture of 1953, with Zinneman getting his second Best Director Oscar in a row after the one he took home in 1952 for High Noon. Donna Reed won for Best Supporting Acress. Burt Lancaster and Montgomery Clift were both nominated for Best Actor, but split the vote allowing William Holden to win for Stalag 17. Another great acting job itself. And Kerr was up for Best Actress, but lost to Audrey Hepburn for Roman Holiday.From Here to Eternity is a film loaded with good actors in small roles who got their first notice in this film. Ernest Borgnine, Robert J. Wilkie, Claude Akins, Jack Warden, Mickey Shaughnessy, all play various soldiers and each one is memorable. Especially Borgnine as the vicious sadistic sergeant of the stockade.TV's Superman was in From Here to Eternity also. George Reeves who was looking to escape the typecasting from Superman has a part as another sergeant who warns Lancaster about Deborah Kerr. He gave a fine performance, but most of it wound up on the cutting room floor. That would have unforeseen tragic consequences.This is not any kind of glamorous army. These people are all too real and not very noble. The original novel was toned down quite a bit for the screen. But when the attack on Pearl Harbor comes, the men rise to the occasion, do their jobs in a more than competent manner and led by Burt Lancaster in that company. It's these men who won that war in the Pacific and the one in Europe as well and From Here to Eternity despite the less than noble portrayals of them as individuals is a great tribute to them as a team.",

            "content": "James Jone's novel was deemed impossible to put onto the screen {how many times have we heard that one before?}, but nobody told director Fred Zinnerman and the cast of dreams. Troubles with the making of the film were many, the film was thwarted by a censorship requirement that the army not be portrayed as careless and over brutal, and some of the sexual themes from the novel had to be toned down. Zinneman also had to fight a continuous battle with Columbia's head ego tripper Harry Cohn. He interfered with every script that was shown to him, and casting was also a tough thing to achieve with Cohn trying to call the shots. As it turned out we got one of the best composition of actors in one film to have ever graced the screen.From Here To Eternity is a film about the lives and loves of a number of characters at Schofield Barracks-Pearl Harbor, just prior to the infamous attack by the Japanese that changed WW2. Illicit affairs, friendship, nobility, bravery and cruelty come crashing together in one gigantic lavish production that defines the word classic. Burt Lancaster, Montgomery Clift, Frank Sinatra, Ernest Borgnine, Jack Warden, Deborah Kerr, and Donna Reed all give performances that any other actor would be proud to have given. On another day they all could have won awards such was the strength of performance they all gave. Reed & Sinatra won best supporting Oscars, while Fred Zinneman rightly won for best director to cement the film winning outright for best picture. Yet the film's crowning glory didn't win an award, for to me, Montogomery Clift gives one of the best performances in motion picture history, it's layered to perfection and it's one of those character portrayals that has me involved to the point of exhaustion. One scene in which he plays a bugle lament as tears roll down his face is just stunning, and I know how he feels because I cry along with him to, such is my involvement with his turn as Robert E. Lee Prewitt.Laced with memorable scenes {the kiss, the bugle lament, Lancaster blasting away at the Japanese planes with machine gun in hand}, and performances to match, From Here To Eternity is essential cinema to be viewed every year and homaged and praised whenever possible. 10/10 in every single respect.",

            "content": "It's often said that the simplest stories are the best. This isn't true. The simple stories are easy to get right, but a complex ensemble piece with multiple protagonists and numerous subplots can be just as effective, although it's a lot harder to pull off successfully. From Here to Eternity stands in the tradition of The Best Years of Our Lives, Seven Samurai and The Godfather, of pictures with interwoven plots that have become classics thanks to strong screen writing, intelligent direction and powerful acting performances.Part of the reason From Here to Eternity works is because it is very quick in establishing its characters and plot lines. It opens with a series of interlinking scenes, introducing us to Montgomery Clift, Frank Sinatra, Philip Ober, Burt Lancaster and Deborah Kerr, giving us clues about Clift's past and hinting at the future relationship between Lancaster and Kerr, all in the space of five minutes. Director Fred Zinnemann, with a confidence that is lacking in his earliest features, shoots these scenes with subtle technique to give them maximum storytelling effect. For example, he gives Clift's character a superb introduction, walking at a right angle to the marching column until he is brought right into close-up. Once the dialogue begins he uses sudden changes of angle to highlight certain lines, for example the close-up of Lancaster telling Kerr \"I'd be happy to help\", at which point the audience know exactly what is going to happen between those two characters. Donna Reed is of course introduced a little later, but to compensate she is given a very distinctive first shot, framed on her own immediately after some busy crowd shots.But Zinnemann's direction isn't all pure functionalism. He makes sparing use of attention-grabbing stylisation when the moment demands it, such as the dolly-out through the rain-soaked window during Lancaster and Kerr's first kiss. And this stylisation even helps keep the narrative together, for example cutting from the roaring sea at the end of the famous beach scene to the smoke rising from Clift's cigarette. Throughout the various parallel plots there is a tone of melancholy and regret, and Zinnemann keeps this commonality with his consistency of style.Of course, you get the same problem or at least the same feature in From Here to Eternity as you do in They Died with Their Boots on or Titanic, in that the audience, knowing their history, know what is going to happen at the end. The strength of the non-combat story lines is such that we forget when and where we are, and as such it is important that we are eased into the finale of the Pearl Harbour attack so it does not seem such a surreal break in tone. This is done with characteristic subtlety, with two objects placed noticeably yet not obtrusively into the frame to jog our memories. The first is a calendar showing December 6th on the wall beside Burt Lancaster, and the other a signpost reading \"Pearl Harbour\" after his final meeting with Kerr.One of the biggest challenges for the makers of an ensemble piece is that you need a larger than normal pool of leading players, and yet you must ensure none of them will overshadow the others. This is another thing they got right in From Here to Eternity. Clift, Kerr and Lancaster are all competent performers without big egos, and they all give steady performances, even if they are far from career-bests. As to Sinatra, what's amazing is not the quality of his performance (it was always evident he could act) but that he was even allowed to play a dramatic, non-musical role. It just goes to show the increased flexibility of cinema in the 1950s, as well as the rising status of the musical genre. To give it some perspective, can you imagine Fred Astaire or Bing Crosby having done the same thing in the 30s? From Here to Eternity won 1953's Best Picture Oscar, and like all successful pictures was followed by a host of imitators. 1955's Battle Cry for example is another many-stranded story about soldiers at the start of World War Two, and even features a rather tepid knock-off of the famous beach scene. However, while Battle Cry has some nice moments, structurally it is an absolute mess, an example of how easy it is to do a botch job on a complex storyline. That's why From Here to Eternity is such a rarity, being an ensemble piece that really works.",

            "content": "Classic 50's Hollywood feature documenting the lives and times of the US Army personnel in Hawaii leading up to the Japanese air attack on the Pearl Harbour naval base which precipitated the US entry into the second world war. Shot in black and white by Fred Zinnemann to emphasise the war-time setting, the drama is peopled with convincingly realistic characters with a credible, episodic narrative edging ever closer to the pivotal date of December 7th.Multiple plot lines are skilfully interwoven until their climactic convergence at the end aided by top acting from a superb cast. The dramatic thread to the film is Montgomery Clift's Prewett character and his relationships with the characters played by Burt Lancaster, the firm but fair sergeant himself drawn into a sexually charged relationship with his superior officer captain's disaffected wife, played against type by Deborah Kerr, Donna Reed as the \"hostess\" he falls in love with and especially Frank Sinatra's rascally but likeable and always supportive Maggio.Sinatra famously begged for the chance to show his acting skill in a straight role to reignite his career and duly given the chance, he grabs it with both hands. Lancaster and Kerr fire up the screen in their doomed relationship, especially in the famous scene by the crashing waves, Reed plays her part with admirable restraint but Clift's acting exceeds them all, whether in his reluctant fight scenes, blowing a bugle like Satchmo or playing a drunk after he's exacted revenge on Maggio's tormentor, played memorably by the recently deceased Ernst Borgnine.The action climax as the Japanese attack is thrillingly portrayed especially the high camera shots, although I would question the too obvious and thus jarring insertion of real footage of the actual attack.Controversial in its day for its unblinkingly honest depiction of the US army, it can be seen now as one of the best films of the 50's, a master class in dramatic narrative and character acting.",

            "content": "\"From Here to Eternity\" is sometimes classified as a war film but the attack on Pearl Harbor only occupies the last few minutes; for most of its length it is (like, say, \"Reflections in a Golden Eye\" or \"An Officer and a Gentleman\") a film about life in the Armed Forces during peacetime. It charts the complex relationships between six main characters, Captain Dana Holmes and his beautiful wife Karen, Sergeant Milton Warden, Private Robert Prewitt, his girlfriend Alma, and Prewitt's closest friend, Private Angelo Maggio. There are a number of interconnected sub-plots. Perhaps the most important concerns Prewitt's relations with his commanding officer, Captain Holmes. Holmes is a boxing fanatic, who believes that his promotion prospects will be improved if he can put together a successful team to compete in the Army boxing championships. He has therefore had Prewitt, whom he knows to be a talented middleweight boxer, drafted into his unit. Prewitt, however, refuses to join the boxing team, having given up the sport after an accident in which a sparring partner was blinded, so Holmes attempts to force him to do so by beginning a campaign of persecution against him. In another sub-plot Karen, whose marriage to a hard-drinking, unfaithful husband has become no more than a sham, becomes embroiled in an adulterous affair with Sergeant Warden. (The scene on the beach between Deborah Kerr and Burt Lancaster was considered scandalously daring by the standards of the early fifties). The other plot lines concern Maggio's battles against authority, especially a brutal sergeant named Fatso Judson, and the growing romance between Prewitt and Alma. (Contrary to what some reviewers have stated, Alma is not a prostitute; she may have been one in James Jones's novel, but in the film she became a nightclub hostess to appease the Hays Office). In many ways the film gives a negative picture of military life, although less so than the original book. A strict system of discipline may be necessary to make the Army an effective fighting force, but it also has the unwanted side-effect of allowing bullies like Holmes and Judson to abuse their authority. Holmes attempts to force Prewitt to join the boxing squad by imposing a series of unjust punishments and onerous duties on him; most of the NCOs are happy to go along with him, and even those like Warden who disagree with Holmes's actions see no alternative but to comply. This was the Big Picture of 1953; it won eight Oscars, including Best Picture, against a very strong field which also included \"Roman Holiday\", \"Julius Caesar\" and \"Shane\", and Best Director for Fred Zinnemann. Five of the cast were nominated and two of them, Donna Reed (Alma) and Frank Sinatra (Maggio) won. This was the film that made Sinatra a big star as an actor as well as a singer. He plays Maggio as likable and easygoing, in contrast to his more intense friend Prewitt, but also a man with reserves of both moral and physical courage; he is not afraid to stand up to Judson, who is much larger than he is. (Ernest Borgnine is very good as the thuggish Judson). I must say that I agree with the Academy's decision to award \"Best Actress\" to Audrey Hepburn ahead of Kerr; Kerr is good here, but Audrey is absolutely brilliant in \"Roman Holiday\", as she normally was. American audiences might have been surprised to see Kerr, normally one of the cinema's good girls, playing an adulterous wife, although British ones might have remembered her as the mercenary Sally in \"Love on the Dole\". She does, however, make Karen a fairly sympathetic character; she is not, contrary to what the film critic of \"Variety\" thought, a nymphomaniac, even though it is made clear that Warden is not her first extra-marital lover. She is driven not by sexual lust but by a need for love that cannot be satisfied by her husband, who cruelly neglects and mistreats her. I have never seen \"Stalag 17\", so cannot say if William Holden deserved \"Best Actor\" ahead of Montgomery Clift and Burt Lancaster (or, for that matter, Brando in \"Julius Caesar\"). Both, however, are excellent, especially that intelligent, sensitive actor Clift as Prewitt, a young man with firmly-held principles, who will not allow himself to be dissuaded from doing what he believes to be right. Despite his mistreatment by Holmes, he never considers leaving the Army, an institution which has previously treated him well and has become like a family to him. (The depiction of military life is not entirely negative; the Army may allow unpleasant sadists a chance to vent their spleen, but it also provides young men with a sense of belonging and self-respect). Lancaster's Warden is another man for whom the Army has become his whole life. Although he outwardly seems a strong character, he is inwardly weak. He is compromised by his affair with Karen (a crime under military law), and lacks the strength to stand up to Holmes. He loves the Army life but despises its officer class; when he gets the chance to become an officer himself he fails to take it, even though he knows that such a promotion offers him the best chance of a life together with Karen. Some Big Pictures from the past have not aged well, but \"From Here to Eternity\" is not among them. What makes it such an outstanding film is the strength of its acting and characterisation and the power of a good story well told. It is the sort of film they don't make any more, and the cinema is the poorer for it. One of the best films of the fifties. 9/10.",

            "review_title": "Involving Military Soap Opera Elevated by Sturdy Performances from an Offbeat Cast",
            "content": "In hindsight, this 1953 classic doesn't seem as much a military drama as it does a highly charged soap opera, which shouldn't come as a surprise given that master filmmaker Fred Zinnemann (\"the Nun's Story\") was at the helm. The veteran director upended the western genre just a year earlier with the Gary Cooper classic \"High Noon\", and he places the same incendiary focus of character over action here, that is, until the inevitable climax which uses the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor as a catharsis for the characters' dilemmas now dwarfed by the coming world war.Based on James Jones' epic novel, screenwriter Daniel Taradash manages to reduce the complexity of the book's themes without trivializing them, and then-offbeat casting enhances the movie immeasurably. Set on a U.S. Army base in Hawaii in the months leading up to the attack, the focus is on two men, both dedicated to the military with no aspirations to become the officers they have grown to detest. One is Private Robert E. Prewitt, a talented boxer (and bugler) who refuses to fight on his regiment's team since blinding a sparring partner. The other is First Sergeant Milton Warden, a take-charge, professional soldier who earns the trust of his men even as he kowtows to his weak-willed commanding officer.Life in the barracks is fraught with adversarial personalities, chief among them Private Angelo Maggio, Prewitt's loudmouthed best friend, and Staff Sergeant \"Fatso\" Judson, the sadistic stockade warden. Both Prewitt and Warden meet women who seek to change their lives. Prewitt finds cynical nightclub \"hostess\" Lorene at a brothel masquerading as a social club, while Warden embarks on a passionate affair with his commanding officer's wayward wife Karen. Burt Lancaster is well cast as Warden, and he brings surprising nuance to his character's clandestine encounters with Karen. However, it's Montgomery Clift - despite looking too slight to be genuinely believable as a boxer - who transcends his loner role by playing off his innately sensitive nature to portray a man who will never sacrifice his honor despite how dire the consequences. Well within his comfort zone, Frank Sinatra's turn as Maggio is small but impactful.Still two years away from \"Marty\", Ernest Borgnine makes Judson's malevolence palpable in just a few scenes. Deborah Kerr submerges her Scottish accent and previous lady-like demeanor to reveal the embittered, sexually assertive side of Karen without sacrificing any of the character's vulnerability. The legendary, much-parodied beach scene with Lancaster still sizzles after all these years. Similarly, Donna Reed foregoes her good-girl image (epitomized by her memorable turn as Mary Bailey in \"It's a Wonderful Life\") to play the sultry, delusional Lorene. The 2003 DVD comes with a small set of extras - a three-minute making-of retrospective short, a nine-minute collection of on-set footage and interviews from a documentary entitled \"Fred Zinnemann: As I See It\", and the original theatrical trailer. The best extra is the commentary track from Tim Zinnemann (the director's son) and screenwriter Alvin Sargent (\"Spider-Man 2\"), who had a small role in the movie.",

You know the black-and-white makeout scene on the beach that's been spoofed and referenced hundreds of times since? The two actors kissing are Burt Lancaster and Deborah Kerr in From Here to Eternity.This is a WW2 movie, and one of the best classic war films, even though there are no scenes on the battlefield. Montgomery Clift, a recent transfer to the Hawaiian army base, has a reputation for being a good boxer, but he refuses to continue fighting at his new base. To punish him for his refusal, the captain makes his life miserable to hopefully wear him down. If you want the captain to \"get his\", read on. The captain's wife, Deborah Kerr, has an affair with a sergeant, Burt Lancaster. In the meantime, Monty and his army pal Frank Sinatra frequent a nightclub on their nights off. While Monty finds love with a prostitute, Frankie manages to anger the very mean and violent Ernest Borgnine.See, there's plenty of drama without stepping foot on the battlefield! From Here to Eternity is a very famous movie, but it's also a fantastic one. Deborah Kerr bleached her famously red locks and tried on an American accent for the role, a seductive type she wasn't used to playing. Donna Reed, as goody-two-shoes as it gets, plays the hardened hooker Monty falls for. She won an Oscar for her against-type performance, paving the way for other good girls like Shirley Jones, who also won an Oscar when she went against type and played a prostitute in Elmer Gantry. Frank Sinatra also won an Oscar for this movie, but it's far from his best performance. He himself always said he should have won his Oscar for The Man with the Golden Arm. Montgomery Clift and Burt Lancaster, while in very different situations in the film, both fall in love with women they shouldn't, and try to stand up for their convictions even when it's difficult. It's great to see the different acting styles: Monty with the word \"conflicted\" tattooed on his forehead, and water boiling beneath his sensitive reserve, and Burt with gritted teeth and lava simmering beneath his strength.At the 1953 Oscars, the film swept Best Picture, Director, Screenplay, Sound, Editing, Cinematography, and Supporting Actor and Actress awards. While Burt and Monty were pitted against each other for Best Actor, William Holden beat them out in the overrated Stalag 17. Deborah Kerr, who never won a competitive Oscar, lost to the ridiculous performance of Audrey Hepburn in Roman Holiday.",

This lengthy novel, of almost 900 pages presented a problem for Columbia Pictures because how could a book this size be condensed into a two hour movie? The task of the adaptation fell into Daniel Taradash, an excellent screen writer with a good track record.The end result, as seen through Fred Zinnemann's brilliant direction, showed aspects of the book, but because of the censorship reigning in Hollywood in those years, could have never been shown to the vast audience this film attracted. One of the novel aspects deals with the homosexuality in the Honolulu of the times. It's clear that some of the enlisted men had liaisons with the gay men that treated them to things their meager income didn't allowed them to have. Maggio, is one of the ones instrumental for involving Prewitt into visiting his closeted friends.The film deals with two other thorny aspects: adultery and prostitution. Milt Warden, the right hand man of Capt. Holmes, has an eye for his wife Karen, who rumor had it, loved to played around, just as her husband does during his \"business in town\". In the novel, Karen has an eight year child, who is conveniently disposed of. Their love affair consumed both Milt and Karen. At the same time, a manly Milt, is seen in an intimate moment when he is trying to console Prewitt, who has been ostracized by his refusal to become one of the boxers in the base. Milt caresses Prewitt's hair in what might have been an overture to have something more than a friendship with the gay Prewitt.The prostitution issue comes when Maggio takes Prewitt drinking and introduces him to the Congress Club, a brothel. Prewitt's relationship with Alma, the girl from Oregon, is toned down because of the fear of trouble with the Hays Code people. It was a hypocritical way to do things, but who knows what would have come out had the film been done today.\"From Here to Eternity\" still keeps its crisp black and white cinematography that Burnett Guffey gave the film. It's inconceivable to think of it in Technicolor! The score by George Duning serves the action well with its haunting melody. Fred Zinnemann vision paid big time because his vision for the project had the right approach even when it masks the original text.Montgomery Clift, one of the most handsome actors working in films at the time, is about the best thing in the film. It appears Mr. Clift was a catalyst for the film, in that he made everyone else excel in the performances they gave. As Robert E. Lee Prewitt, this actor is a pure joy to watch because his transformation into the character. Frank Sinatra has been celebrated for his role as Maggio, yet, he only has a couple of scenes where he shows an intensity and a range he hadn't projected before.Burt Lancaster as the all American, and supposedly macho Sgt. Warden, does a fine job. Deborah Kerr work as Karen Holmes showed an actress who understood what made her character tick. It's hard to imagine that Joan Crawford was supposed to have played her and she would have thrown the film out of balance. Donna Reed, as the kind Alma, gave a fine performance. Philip Ober, Mickey Shaugnessy, Ernest Borgnine, Jack Warden, Tim Ryan, and an uncredited George Reeves are seen among the supporting players.\"From Here to Eternity\" is a must see film for all serious fans.",

Every man who declares himself free to his friends has to make a slave out of his wife and employees to keep up the illusion and prove it; and the wife to be free in front of her bridge club has to command her Help, Husband and Heirs. It resolves itself into a battle; whoever wins, the other one loses. For every general in this world there has to be 6,000 privates.\" - James Jones (\"From Here to Eternity\") \"You and me might change the world. It wouldn't show up until a hundred years after we're dead. We'd never see it. But it'd be there.\" - James Jones (\"From Here to Eternity\") Based on a 1951 novel by James Jones, Fred Zinnemann's \"From Here to Eternity\" (1953) stars Montgomery Clift as Robert Prewitt, a private stationed at a US Army barracks in Oahu, Hawaii. As he refuses to fight in an upcoming, regimental boxing match, Prewitt is subjected to abuse by his fellow soldiers. Prewitt is wise to their motives, but accepts this abuse with cynical indifference.Jones' novel was preoccupied with characters who refuse to betray their ideals and convictions. Prewitt's a bit of a pacifist \u2013 a \"hard head\" as his superiors call him - and so refuses to fight. First Sergeant Milton Warden (Burt Lancaster) likewise refuses to pursue a promotion, much to the chagrin of his lover, Karen (Deborah Kerr). Karen is herself torn between fidelity to her husband, Captain Dana Holmes (Philip Ober), and her own personal happiness. Encapsulating their dilemmas is Private Maggio (Frank Sinatra), who refuses to break when put in solitary confinement. All are seeking freedom from confinement and control. These are themes typical of Jones, whose best novels (\"From Here to Eternity\", \"Some Came Running\", \"The Thin Red Line\") find characters rebelling against systems, tradition and assigned roles. The marriage, the army, the corporation, the workplace, the church, the school...Jones' heroes are often outcasts who rebel against venerated American institutions. They resist conformity and compliance \u2013 both inside and outside the military \u2013 a resistance which always leads to marginalization and then self-destruction.How to reconcile \"freedom and individualism\" with \"authority and patriotism\" was the obsession of many great post-war novels. Prewitt and Maggio themselves anticipate the heroes of \"Cool Hand Luke\" and other anti-establishment films/novels of the era (\"The Sand Pebbles\", \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\", \"A Thousand Clowns\" etc). They're hard-headed, they're rebels, they refuse to budge. But like Karen, whose promiscuity is a reaction against her imposed domestic lifestyle as an Army wife, they can't really articulate why; they unconsciously lash out.\"From Here to Eternity\" was made with the support of the United States Army, and Fred Zinnemann's always been a bit of a sell-out anyway, so the film never really tackles Jones' themes. Jones was anti-military, anti-war, anti-establishment, whilst Zinneman's busy sucking on the teats of the Production Code. For Zinnemann, all bad military behaviour is a result of \"bad eggs\" (who are \"weeded out and punished\"), all brutal men get their comeuppance, bad captains resign, bad boxers are demoted and the death of Maggio is \"his own fault anyway\" (he falls off a truck). Jones' cynical portrayal of soldiers (always knee deep in booze, sex, violence and bad language) and officers (ruthless careerists who toy with lives) is also toned down. \"This country's Army is why I hate this country,\" Maggio says in Jones' novel. \"What did this country ever do for me? Give me a right to vote for men I cant elect? You can have it. Give me a right to work at a job I hate? You can have that too! They say I'm a citizen of the greatest, richest country on earth, that if I don't believe it I should look at Park Avenue. Carnival prizes! All carnival prizes! They shouldn't teach their immigrants' kids all about democracy unless they mean to let them have a little bit of it! Me and the United States is dissociating our alliance as of right now, until the United States can find time to read its own textbooks a little!\" It's rage like this which Zinnemann's film goes to lengths to avoid.Still, Zinnemann gets some things right. Jones, whose war trilogy moved from WW2's prelude to aftermath (\"Eternity\", \"Line\", \"Whistle\"), had no time for jingoism, contrived heroism, and his grunts were always consigned to a drudgery at sharp contrast with the high adventure promised by recruiting posters. Zinnemann captures all this well. He also coaxes fine performances from Burt Lancaster, Montgomery Clift, Deborah Kerr and Donna Reed, the latter two floating about like noirish femme fatales. Zinnemann's cutting, sense of place, time and compositions are also a head above most melodramas from the era.7.9/10 - See Vincente Minnelli's \"Some Came Running\", a marginally better James Jones adaptation from the 1950s. See too Jones' excellent Hawaii-set short story, \"The Way it Is\" (1949).",

There are so many things that make this film my favorite all time and my choice for number one but it's 3 scenes that clinch it: First, the one with Burt Lancaster and Deborah Kerr in the car when he says: \"I have never been as miserable as I am since I met you\" and her reply \"neither have I\" and then he follows with \"I wouldn't trade a minute of it\" and again she says \" Neither would I\". That is what real, deep love between 2 people makes them feel. How many films brought love to screen like that? no other movie I have ever seen. The second is when Montgomery Clift tells Donna Reed: \"No one ever lies about being lonely\". That is so, so real. And third, the scene when Frank Sinatra says his last words and then dies. I know very little about how Oscar's are voted on, but I feel Sinatra won his right in that scene. How many other films can you say that? This film never gets dull. It's 2 + hours of pure human emotion that has never before or never since been put on the screen.",

Would it have been the same with Joan Crawford instead of Kerr?  Hard to say.

But war is very important to this motion picture... The December 7, 1941 Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor is its definite point, its explosive end, the ruthless attack on U.S. military mind...The attack is one of the great sequences in War Films... The sound of the Japanese planes is heard, then there are explosions, and confused soldiers rising from their early breakfast... The Japanese Bombers dive and sweep firing with machine-guns the courtyard and its large buildings, while men run in every direction...When a non-fighting companion refuses to pass out arms to his pals, the soldiers break down the door of the ammunition room, take the machine guns to the roof and fire to the flying planes...When they succeed in hitting one plane they are delighted by the flavor of war...With this powerful scene all the connecting parts that hold together the characters of the story are permanently altered... The great event reduces the characters' pains and passions... World War II is a force that modified everything... War, in this film, is bigger than people... The highlights of the film are many, but let me mention the best: Clift playing a flamboyant blues in a local beer joint... The blues came rushing out, expelled from his body by the strength of his feelings; the romantic-erotic scene between Lancaster and Kerr on a deserted beach; Clift playing \"Taps\" and his tears running down his face...Burt Lancaster portrays the tough 'efficient' sergeant who knows how to bend the rules without breaking them... He guides and supports his 'philander' pretentious Captain... He proves himself as an inspiring leader of men when the barracks were under attack...Montgomery Clift gives, perhaps, the best performance of his career as the bugler-boxer soldier, whose convictions are stronger than 'The Treatment.'Deborah Kerr plays the cool and reserved young lady stimulating her feelings of love in different ways...Frank Sinatra is terrific in his rebellious role of Angelo Maggio... He gives a deep and intense characterization, winning an Academy Award...Donna Reed is excellent as the charming social woman of the evening...

            "content": "No amount of black and white art-house tastefulness can hide the fact that \"From Here to Eternity\" is one big splashy soap opera of a movie. I've not read the James Jones book on which it is based, but it wouldn't surprise me to find that the romantic subplots that dominate the film are only a part of a much larger and intricate narrative in the book. \"A Place in the Sun\" did much the same thing to \"An American Tragedy.\" I've grown to like Burt Lancaster as I've seen him in more and more movies, and I think he got better as he got older, but he's at his hammy worst in roles like this. Though he's a big, rugged looking man, I can't take him seriously in these macho, stud roles. He overacts and never once convinces. Montgomery Clift does much better with his role as the sensitive and moony Pruitt; these were exactly the kinds of roles Clift was born to play. Frank Sinatra, again, could be a fine actor, but his role here is boiled down to a couple of aw-shucks moments before he kicks off in a sentimental death scene. Deborah Kerr and Donna Reed are largely wasted; they're definitely women adrift in a male-dominated film.I don't know about Fred Zinneman. I used to think he was a good director who made socially relevant films at a time when Hollywood would have been content churning out widescreen Technicolor junk, and he did do that. But his films during the 1950s all feel very pompous, like he was aware that he was making ART while everyone else was making MOVIES. I have the same feeling to an extent about George Stevens, though I think overall his films are more fascinating than Zinneman's.\"From Here to Eternity\" is certainly no where near the worst that the 1950s had to offer, but it has been overpraised. The fact that Pearl Harbor was still a very distinct memory for so many people probably had much to do with its popular and critical reception at the time, and for its lasting appeal. Watching it now, one kind of wonders what the big deal is.Grade: B",

It stars the eternally youthful Montgomery Clift (fresh from playing the role of the tormented priest in Hitchcock's I CONFESS) as a raw army recruit based in Hawaii during World War 2 who is subjected to endless bullying and bad behaviour for an unlikely reason: in peacetime Clift was an amateur boxing champion, and his superiors want him to join the army boxing team, but he refuses due to personal circumstances.It's a slight premise but as a film FROM HERE TO ETERNITY works very well indeed, in fact achieving the status of something of a classic. That's because it has real narrative depth and various sub-plots that interact in ways both expected and unexpected. The film boasts from a gritty realism and a lack of sentimentality that means not all of the characters are going to have happy endings. Frank Sinatra shines in the role of a brash young recruit who falls foul of Ernest Borgnine in a star-making performance as a bully. Burt Lancaster is the weary sergeant trying to hold everything together. The story climaxes with the attack on Pearl Harbor, portrayed in a way that is just as powerful as you could hope for.",

The main attraction isn't World War II, or the soap opera story lines - the main attractions in \"From Here to Eternity\" are the actors' performances.Montgomery Clift's is the \"main attraction\" performance. He makes his character the central figure, despite other story lines, and his performance is mesmerizing. Every look Clift gives, every facial tic, every syllable is fascinating to watch. And, it's all very natural\u0085 very character-driven. Not that all the others aren't terrific, too. Burt Lancaster is a close second, and everyone performs exceptionally well.Mr. Clift's performance helps elevate both the other performances, and the film in general. Check out how great he makes all the other actors, \"look\" simply by playing a bugle. This is a case where an actor's performance affects both the other players in the scene, and even leaves its impressions in scenes where the actor doesn't appear. If you take Clift out of the film, you have a much more ordinary movie.I'm not sure, however, what/if the film is trying to say about war - is it making a statement of some kind? The main story is: Will Mr. Clift's character box (fight)\u0085 or, won't he fight (box)? I guess he is bullied into fighting, but does not initiate fighting (he blinds a man, symbolically, by knocking him out in an unseen fight). I am not sure if I got the film's message, or even if there was one.I would have also made either MORE EXPLICIT or MORE SUBTLE the whole prostitution part - it was a place to have sex during the time, I guess. Donna Reed and the other women were prostitutes, I guess. Since they couldn't make it more explicit, they toned it down to make us really think these men went to town so they could exchange \"nice\" smiles with \"nice\" women. Elsewhere, Mr. Lancaster and Ms. Kerr's sound like they've had physical relations, when, it looked, to me, like they'd only been hit by a wave. I know this was the '50s, but filmmakers had developed many subtle ways of relaying this information\u0085 for the prior half century...

Clift is especially touching in his combination of toughness and the ability to show his tender side; Sinatra is well cast as Maggio and makes the most of a strong supporting role.As Karen, DEBORAH KERR has been reduced to a supporting character, but she effectively portrays a lonely woman who cannot stay immune to the charms of equally lonely soldiers. Her famous love scene with Lancaster on the beach is the stuff movie magic is made of. It's the sort of role one might expect Joan Crawford to turn up in, so it's surprising to find Kerr in the role, a woman whose ladylike image made it a risky casting choice at the time.The most effective part of the film is Clift's fatal encounter with \"Fatso\" (ERNEST BORGNINE). Their bitter exchanges lead to a nifty fight scene. Borgnine is such a believable bully that it's a wonder he was able to stretch beyond bully roles after this film. The antagonism between him and \"Prew\" (CLIFT), as well as the big action set piece of the attack on Pearl Harbor, are just a couple of reasons why the film captures so much of the flavor of the best-selling novel. The love stories (both of them) are interwoven into the structure of the story with telling effect.But all in all, I've always felt that this film was overpraised from the very beginning by the critics. Perhaps because I read the hard-hitting James Jones novel first and was awestruck at what an accomplishment it was.The film only manages to be a pale carbon copy of the original work--but, as I said, it's still absorbing entertainment even with some of the characters diluted to meet censorship requirements.",

The number of stars is breathtaking, and there are so many subplots, they are needed to keep every section of the movie sharp, which it is. That's one marvel here, is that all these disparate parts make sense and have equal power.Montgomery Clift takes on the most tragic of the men, and the most obviously brutalized. And yet, in that way he has of being vulnerable and steadfast, he makes you really feel for him. Burt Lancaster as the good sergeant is steely and strong in that way we admire, and Frank Sinatra is given another of those roles that make him a likable nice guy who gets in trouble for the good of others. Throw in Ernest Borgnine and Jack Warden, and a host of secondary actors in top form.There are two women with roles, and both shine. Deborah Kerr, in particular, gives what might be her most intense and satisfying performance, edgy and filled with inner anguish we never see. And Donna Reed plays a men's club companion girl, and she is rarely so alive and interesting. Everyone represents a type, and a larger scene is painted of lonely army men hoping for something to do, either in their work or in their love lives. One theme is rampant drinking, another is a culture of no escape. It's oppressive but it's the army, and they seem to enjoy life anyway.But then the end comes around. Pearl Harbor. It was all set in Hawaii and I should have known. I've even seen the movie before but I had forgotten completely (partly because there is a 1953 brightness to the filming, and I was thinking this was post-WWII). But it happens, and it's really moving. There are no heroics, no great war stories to be told, just a bunch of regular guys, some with hangovers, having to suddenly fight, and die, for their country.

Montgomery Clift is assertive, funny, tough, sensitive and charismatic in the pivotal role of Robert E. Lee Prewitt, the rebellious loner with the streak of nobility. It is easy to see why James Dean idolized him after seeing his portrayal in the film. It is also a shame modern actors don't mention his name more often when listing their influences. As often noted, he preceded Brando by two years (he first appeared in Red River, released in 1948; Brando bowed in The Men in 1950)and created the arch-type of the 1950's rebel. But due to his intelligence, Clift also informed his characters with a sense of purpose. He didn't simply rebel. For instance, in Eternity, he apologises after an angry outbreak at his girlfriend. Instead of appearing weak, he impressed me all the more for doing so. It makes him appear more mature than the typical rebel. In another instance, when he feels his friend Maggio is being unfairly attacked, he \"stares down\" the attacker proving he looks out for his friend, another attractive quality. When the non-coms dole out extra punishment to him to force him to box, he refuses to file a complaint but likewise refuses to comply to their demands. Such moments distinguish Clift from other, more typically macho Hollywood leading men of the era and contributed greatly to Eternity's long initial run at the box office and its status as a classic piece of Hollywood cinema. It is time someone set the record straight and restored Montgomery Clift's name to its rightful place in the pantheon of Hollywood's great leading men.

            "content": "This is one of the finest examples of Hollywood craftsmanship during the studio system in the 'Golden Age' of film. 'From Here To Eternity' is perhaps the most famous of all war films, yet very little action is seen. Rather, this is a human drama that shows the 'other side' of war.The key ingredient that makes 'From Here To Eternity' work is it's fantastic cast. Sure, this was always going to be a big hit because of it's subject matter, but the reason it remains so critically acclaimed toward is because of the vivid performances. Montgomery Clift turns in one of his finest portrayals as army private Prewitt. A champion boxer before he came to the Hawaii base, Prewitt resists joining the boxing company, and his new captain and army mates make his life living for it. Clift is at his tortured best here, brilliant in his loneliness and confusion. Lancaster's performance is the better known today (because of his famous frolic with Kerr on the beach), but Clift exceeds him here in talent and depth of feeling.That said, Lancaster is very good as the second-in-command Milton Warden who falls in love with his senior's wife, Karen Holmes. Lancaster and Kerr make movie magic in their love scenes, sharing wonderful chemistry. Kerr's performance is amazing also. She was cast against type here as the nymphomaniac wife- Kerr, the English rose, generally played English roses. Kerr shows she has range in the role and incredible acting talent. Nice Donna Reed is also cast against type here as a sort of 'good-time girl' Lorene, who Clift falls in love with. Reed and Sinatra won Best Supporting Oscars for their performances. Indeed, Sinatra's turn is more presence and charisma than great acting skill, but he proved he was more than just a crooner in this one.A range of classic scenes here- the justifiably memorable 'beach scene' between Kerr and Lancaster, Clift's emotional bugle playing etc. The final scene though, between Kerr and Reed, is what gets me.This film brings out emotion from it's audience like very few others. Through focusing on character interaction rather than stunning battle scenes like many other war dramas have done, by the time Pearl Harbour is inevitably attacked by the Japanese we really feel a connection with this group of people. Zinnemann's direction never fails either. Many have compared 'Eternity' to the modern-day film 'Pearl Harbour' (2001) because of it's similar subject matter. That's where the similarity ends. FHTE is emotional and deeply felt, 'Pearl Harbour' is gimmicky and more concerned with special effects than plot development. If you are faced with a choice between seeing the two, run towards 'From Here To Eternity' and don't look back. FHTE is a true monument to cinema and acting.10/10.",

COMMENT: Zinnemann himself persuaded Montgomery Clift to undertake the pivotal role of Prewitt, ex-bugler, ex-boxer and professional soldier. He has been transferred to Schofield Barracks, Honolulu, where he refuses to join his company's boxing team despite Captain Philip Ober's determination to win the regimental championship. Ober orders Sergeant Burt Lancaster to give Clift \"the treatment\".Prewitt's spirit is sustained partly by his buddy, Frank Sinatra, who is beaten to death by a sadistic sergeant, Ernest Borgnine. Even this does not break Prewitt, whose girl, a prostitute from the New Congress Club (played by Donna Reed), cannot understand his loyalty. \"What'd the army ever do for you, except treat you like dirt?\" she asks bitterly, as he prepares to return to his company after the Pearl Harbor attack. To which Prewitt replies very simply: \"What do I want to go back to the army for? I'm a soldier.\"The screenplay retains all the violence and pace of the novel, whilst eliminating much of its vulgarity and a little of its sex. Taradash has enormously improved the narrative structure, giving it a compactness and a polish that is lacking in James Jones's sprawling original. To it, Zinnemann has added his own refined craftsmanship. He has drawn superlative portrayals from his cast (Deborah Kerr's performance is possibly the best of her career), taut images from his wide-screen camera, and has effectively re- employed the editing devices of \"High Noon\". \u2014 John Howard Reid in \"A Man for All Movies: The Films of Fred Zinnemann\".AVAILABLE on an excellent Sony DVD.",

            "content": "Interwoven tales of two mismatched couples on Oahu: (1) dedicated soldier Montgomery Clift and ambitious hooker Donna Reed who wants to return to the states rich enough to snag a proper husband, and (2) authoritarian but sensitive top sergeant Burt Lancaster and self-pitying officer's wife, Deborah Kerr, who finds salvation in their love.Daniel Taradash adapted the screenplay from James Jones' immensely popular novel of the early 1950s, and the movie was directed by Fred Zinnemann. They both must have had a heck of a time with it.Taradash had to meet all the requirements of the movie code of the period. That meant that the villainous Captain Holmes, instead of being promoted for his sadism and inefficiency, must resign under threat of a court martial. It turns an ironic and brutally realistic story into a fairy tale. Donna Reed, instead of being a whore, does get promoted by this movie -- to a kind of paid but chaste female escort. I can't imagine how the writer slipped her line past the censors: \"If you keep drinking you'll be as much use as a melted candle.\" Kerr's unfaithful wife is in, but the syphilis is out. Also out is Clift's spell in the stockade, in which the prisoners beat each other bloody in games, in order to gin up their resistance to the beatings by the MPs. In the novel, Clift's character maintains his sanity in solitary by practicing meditation. (I swear I'm not making that up.) Director Zinnemann had his problems too. The casting, unquestionably, is nearly perfect. With the exception of a weak performance from Donna Reed, you can't beat the choice of the leads or the chief supporting players. Sinatra does one of his two outstanding dramatic roles, the other being \"Manchurian Candidate.\" And Clift is impeccable as the beautiful young man who was an expert at soldiering, bugling, and boxing. The problem is that the actor was almost always drunk or strung out. He carried around a thermos full of fruit juice and vodka and was pounding innumerable psychotropic drugs. Zinnemann tried no end of takes during a scene in which Angelo Maggio's body is loaded into an ambulance and Clift's line is \"See you don't bump his head.\" Fred finally gave up. Fred also had a problem with Clift's fighting, in that Clift didn't know how to make a fist, let alone throw a punch. The use of a stand in during the brawl on the grass is obvious, and the editor had to make sure that none of the medium shots revealed too much of Clift's hands.Philip Ober as the scurrilous Company Commander acts like he's in a cheap B movie, and Donna Reed sounds like an amateur, but everybody in the cast LOOKS right. I shouldn't sound too harsh. I'm sure Philip Ober (a familiar face) was smart enough to realize he was in a potential blockbuster and gave it everything he had. It's just that he didn't HAVE anything.It's also mandatory to mention here the photography, wardrobe, and location shooting. The barracks LOOKS like Schofield Barracks should have looked in 1941. The crummy urban street full of cat houses, tattoo parlors, and drunken enlisted men LOOKS like Hotel Street, though it was shot at the studio's back lot. Even the HASP, or \"the MPs\", as Sinatra's character calls them, look right -- huge, bemuscled pituitary cases -- the kind of agents of social control that sober you up with celerity if you note their walking your way. And I've never gotten over the tan summer uniforms of khaki drill cotton. You can almost feel the fabric.Two scenes are memorable. One -- parodied a thousand times -- has Lancaster and Kerr rolling around and smooching in the Hawaiian surf while a wave rushes over their bodies. The other is the attack on Pearl Harbor by the Japanese, brief, and with multiple inserts of newsreel footage and shots from an earlier documentary by Gregg Toland, but exciting and well done.A gripping film that ends unhappily, but unforgettable. It may lead some people to read the novel. The novel opens unexpected doors into human nature. Jones knew whereof he spoke.",

It's difficult to see how Donna Reed rated an Oscar although there was absolutely nothing wrong with her performance whereas Sinatra was a revelation and thoroughly deserved his.

            "content": "This is ostensibly a film about life before war breaks out - the climax (not a spoiler I don't think) is the attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7th 1941 - but it's also about how much it sucks to be a man. And a woman. Actually it is not something that is too appealing it would seem to be a part of an army base during peacetime from the looks of this. The women in this world are in miserable marriages or at miserable jobs, and the guys are stuck in the same super-masculine patterns: do some boxing, trust me, Pruitt, it'll be good for you (nevermind that he blinded a guy by accident in a fight years before), and make sure to have plenty of booze when it's the nighttime.Even the setting is deceptive: the beautiful beaches and sweet presence of Hawaii (those shirts!) are masking how if a person cant take being around other a-holes it doesn't change anything. Through this it makes for a compelling batch of stories; you have Lancaster as a sergeant who falls for the Captains wife (Deborah Kerr in a performance that is so intense at times it nears going into being too much, but she always keeps a scene and her delivery of these lines in check) and the conflict in whether to go for it in the 'after all this' thing; Pruitt (Clift), who this feels like the movie is more about than its top billed star, is filled with guilt and angst and should also be too much to take, but also finds those lines of keeping it compelling and interesting, full of pain and fury and all that, but also not going too far.The only one who may be having 'fun' up to a point is Sinatras Maggio, who becomes the brunt of racist remarks (damn you Ernest Borgnine, who's great in his few scenes by the way and cuts a mean impression), and is the first to drown himself in booze when it becomes clear life is being much too oppressive. Though one knows how this story is leading up to its eventual conclusion, it feels more like a post war story (and it is by way of it being filmed in 53) while coming before. A guy like Maggio would've faced likely the same sort of bullies and pricks in post war life as pre, but in this world he has no escape from what this BS tough guy male world has to do to people. Or does it have to? Yeah, it does.There are points where it likely has dated, where the hopes and aspirations for the women especially (or some of them men too) are different than it would be today or even like 20 years after the pre Pearl Harbor days. What were the options then, one has to ask, and it leads to having to take things on the context when it was made. What makes it work today from being dated is the power of the performances and that the writing is smart enough to recognize everyone as flawed to varying degrees, and that Zinneman keeps a strong hold on the dramatic tone scene to scene. If there's anything flawed its minor, like leaving the Lancaster-Kerr relationship to the wayside for a good part of the run-time until returning to that in the third act.So if you only expect like the romance of that iconic bit on the beach you may be in for not so much disappointment but a heavier and more empathetic tale of soldiers and women and the problems in trying to be true to feelings when its not possible. Sure its a melodrama, but so what? If its done this well its worth embracing to this day, and Sinatra, Clift and Jean Arthur are worth noting for their terrific acting.",

The ending,played out between the two very different leading ladies,is outstanding,Miss Reed walking away with the honours.

James Jones's novel was both romantically cynical about the Army and deeply misogynistic. In the early 1950s it couldn't be filmed as written, for both moral and political reasons. In the book, of course, Mrs. Kipfer runs a whorehouse, not a social club, and Lorene is a whore with an eye for the main chance, not a hostess. In the book, Holmes gets away with his abuse of Prewitt, winning promotion by sucking up to his superior's superior. In the book, Maggio succeeds in getting a Section 8 psychiatric discharge. In the book, the underpaid privates are willing to flirt with wealthy homosexuals, and there is a mass \"queer investigation.\" In the book, Prewitt is impressed by Jack Molloy, the working class radical he meets in the stockade. In the book, Warden rejects both a proffered commission and Karen Holmes because he would rather stay an enlisted man and amuse himself with whores than be trapped in respectable middle class domesticity. In the book, Prewitt's desire for Lorene and Warden's for Karen make them weak, stupid and vulnerable -- Warden saves himself but Prewitt does not. In the book, Lorene goes back to the mainland with the money she's saved, to get a respectable job and pass herself off as the fianc\u00e9e of Lieutenant Prewitt, of the Virginia Prewitts, killed at Pearl Harbor. None of these things make it into the movie. The book ends with Warden enthusiastically getting to know a new shipment of girls at Mrs. Kipfer's. The movie ends with a tacked on coda in which Holmes is duly punished for Prewitt's suffering. The 1979 miniseries came a bit closer to what Jones was trying to accomplish. Maybe one day HBO will give us a six or eight hour From Here To Eternity as it was meant to be.",

The cinematography is stunning, the direction is great and the screenplay is really brilliantly written and powerful. The acting is superb too, none of the actors ranging from Burt Lancaster to Deborah Kerr, from Montgomary Clift to Frank Sinatra and Ernest Borgnine give a bad performance. In some ways the characters can be seen as stereotypes, Lancaster's macho Sergeant, Kerr's unhappy wife, Clift's reluctant boxer, Sinatra's persecuted Italian GI and Borgnine's sadistic stockade sergeant, but the performances and the depth the script goes to developing them ensure that the characters are much more than that. From Here to Eternity also contains one of the most iconic clinches in cinema with Lancaster and Kerr embracing in the pounding surf.

It took me a long time to get to \"From Here To Eternity\", but at a certain point you just have to pull the trigger and make the commitment. The first thing that surprised me was that iconic beach scene with Burt Lancaster and Deborak Kerr. If you've seen the brief three second clip of that highlight, you've seen it all. What you don't figure on is that they both wind up in an argument immediately after, and have to patch things up to keep the affair going. Needless to say, the sun never set on that romance.Maybe the clip they should show more often as representative of this film is Montgomery Clift blowing Taps for Frank Sinatra, tears streaming down his face over a wasted loss of life, that of a best friend to boot. When Fatso Judson (Ernest Borgnine) first emerged from the alley fight, I couldn't believe he got the upper hand on Prewitt (Clift); that was a great tease. I have to say, I identify with Clift's character, he didn't give in to 'The Treatment' and stayed the course over his own ideals. There were times I thought he would crack, but Monty didn't let me down. Knowing his personal history though, I did a sit up and take notice when Sinatra goads him to go into town after hours - \"You got any prejudices against girls?\" I wonder what he thought about that line.The surprise of the picture for me was Donna Reed. Not the role model Mom from The Donna Reed Show here. Though I don't go so far as to consider her character a prostitute that so many reviewers on this board adhere to. She was working a gentleman's club, true, but it didn't appear to me that she compromised herself to earn a living. Just stringing the guys along for drinks and a good time as part of the job.You know, I saw him in the picture, but was Frank Sinatra ever that skinny? He was a downright stick figure at times. I had to wonder with all the drunk scenes he did whether he was acting or if the filming was done around him to capture the essence of the character. I think his best moment was when he threw snake eyes with the pair of olives, very convincing.And then there's Lancaster. He sure fills out the uniform, especially when he's stripped down to swim trunks. He commands every scene he's in, even when in the proximity of Captain Holmes (Philip Ober). Except for the fact that the story was written that way, I didn't get the attraction for the boss's wife. The chemistry between Lancaster and Kerr didn't quite click for me, and I already mentioned that beach scene. In a way, I'm satisfied that they didn't hook up after all.Considering the film's reputation as a World War II epic, it was somewhat surprising to see so little in the way of battle action. The stock footage was expected, and I'm glad the good guys got to take out a Zero. But overall, the War played second fiddle to the human drama, and probably for the best. I don't much care for war films that get tangled up with romance and side stories, so in that regard, this one's execution stayed focused on the human element, and the fighting just happened to be a sidebar.",

Through the use of adult fiction in the form of the novel, we are given a multi-tiered presentation of, what many would consider, a much more innocent America.BEING SET IN the U.S. Territory of Hawaii, and more specifically, right at Pearl Harbor, our story follows the story of several widely divergent people; telling their various stories through some loosely connected events. The story is knit together only by the membership by those in the U.S. Army; which function as a sort of cohesive literary glue.STRICTLY SPEAKING, THIS film is not a War Movie; but rather a study of people coexisting and managing to live out their lives in the presence of and even in spite of some very difficult happenings. Surely, we would have to take into account the fact that this was an Amderica at the tail end of the Great Depression. The characters in the story would be hardened and already weary of life itself.IN RESPECT TO the times in which the movie was made, its style is highly representative of the early '50's; which in a small way, dates it. The manner with which many of the contradictory happenings are dealt with are much more subtly dealt with. There is no area more indicative of this than in the matter of S-E-X.THE PORTRAYAL OF Master Sergeant (Burt Lancaster) 'dating' his Commanding Officer's wife (Deborah Kerr) is done up rather casually and highly watered down from the print page counterpart in the novel. For Example; the two of them both just happen to have bathing suits on under their evening clothes; allowing for an on screen moonlight swim, but no skinny dipping here. This was the '50's and the censor wouldn't allow it! WITH REGARD TO the relationship between the Montgomery Clift character and Donna Reed's, she has been described as a \"Call Girl\". In the portrayal, she works at a \"hostess\" at a \"club\". In reality, the establishment is a brothel and Miss Reed a prostitute.THERE IS SOMETHING to recommend this to all; even with old fashioned 'cleaned up' version that it is. Being contrasted with today's, 'anything goes', butt naked, explicit sex laden methods, we prefer some subtlety and use of the power of suggestion. After all, it requires some higher degree of brain power (thinking) and is suitable for younger viewers. We can testify to the veracity of this; as we (that is I) were a very innocent 7 year old when we saw it at the old Ogden Theater, kin Chicago, and it all went strictly TWA (over my head).BEFORE WE SIGN off, we must give proper praise and tribute to the performances by Ernest Borgnine and Frank Sinatra in rendering this as being a sort of \"Noir goes to War\" offering.",

The plot has huge forward momentum, particularly when we see the page on the calendar.  This is a classic!  See it again!",

            "content": "This is a film that depicts the lives of a small circle of military personnel on the island of Oahu in Hawaii just prior to the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, which suddenly plunged the United States into World War II. At the beginning, Sergeant Warden (Burt Lancaster) stands at Schofield Barracks before a wall calendar prominently displaying \"December 6, 1941\". As viewers we are immediately struck by the circumstances of people caught up with their everyday problems at the very moment when the Japanese are finalizing their surprising and devastating attack, the most serious strike on U. S. territory by a foreign government since the American revolution, right where these people are stationed.As much as I love Audrey Hepburn, I do not understand how she was able to beat Deborah Kerr's portrayal here for an Oscar in \"Roman Holiday\", a film that failed to inspire me in any way whatsoever. That's show business. In its depth and strength, Kerr's performance here was as close to perfection as they get. Add that to some outstanding work by Montgomery Clift, Burt Lancaster, and Donna Reed. Director Fred Zinnemann once remarked how the lead actors, particularly Clift, who was known as a perfectionist, established a very high standard for the entire cast. Frank Sinatra believed that this was not his greatest performance and confessed of his dependence upon Clift's valuable guidance in this picture.As good as the acting is, much of the overall credit goes to director Zinnemann for another superb product to add to all of the others, including \"High Noon\", \"Man For All Seasons\", \"Act of Violence\", \"Oklahoma\", and \"The Nun's Story\", just to name a few. I will state, however, that the film does not rate among my favorite Zinnemann films as it tends to sag heavily in the middle with one too many, prolonged drinking scene and some tedious dialogue that significantly slows the movie down.I very much appreciate the film's location of pre-statehood Hawaii and observe how much of the movie seemed to be produced at that magical time in the evening before the sunset. \"It's the most beautiful place that I have ever seen,\" observes Karen Holmes (Kerr) in the final scene, and I quite agree with her on that point. The darkened light and shadows convey a very special time at the end of Hawaii's day, enhancing its beauty in glorious black and white, which contributes authenticity to the 1941 atmosphere. These elements also suggest, somewhat ominously, the catastrophic, climactic event to come, instantly plunging the heaven that is Hawaii into hell and the entire world into enormous upheaval.",

            "review_title": "Eternity In One Quick Installment",
            "content": "That James Jones' novel had the word \"Eternity\" in its title seems no accident. It runs over 800 pages, features multiple story arcs, and more or less continued through two subsequent books, one of which became a celebrated film in its own right: \"The Thin Red Line\".That film lasts nearly three hours. This one clocks in at under two. I give scripter Daniel Taradash and director Fred Zinnemann credit for that. The story is tightly focused, but with room to breathe. The characters stick out, but as people, not caricatures. There's a lot of good performances and some nice lines.So why don't I like it more? Maybe because I expected a movie that is set around the U.S. military in Oahu in late 1941 to be more about the stuff that interests me, particularly the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor that December. By focusing on the romances of two military men, including a dangerous affair with a commanding officer's wife, \"Eternity\" serves up a lot more \"Kings Row\" than Battleship Row.The best thing in the movie for me, by far, is Montgomery Clift's performance as the central character, Pvt. Robert E. Lee Prewitt. Clift creates in Prewitt a solitary, edgy character who just happens to really love being in the Army even as he is pushed by his commander to perform various hard duties in order to make him box. \"A man loves a thing don't mean it's got to love him back,\" he tells his unbelieving girlfriend.There's distinctive support work, particularly from Burt Lancaster as Prewitt's virile, understanding \"topkick\" master sergeant, Warden; and Frank Sinatra as Prewitt's wisecracking pal Maggio. All three were nominated for Oscars, and Sinatra won his in part because he didn't have to compete with the other two. (Lancaster and Clift were both nominated for Best Actor; Sinatra for Supporting Actor). Ernest Borgnine lends such menace to his first big role as prison sergeant \"Fatso\" Judson it's hard to believe he didn't go on to fame strictly as a cinematic heavy.Are the romances of Prewitt and Warden really so involving, or are they more like dead-end relationships that tie down the film for long stretches into exercises in alcoholic navel-gazing? Prewitt's core conflict with the military is compellingly introduced but never adequately resolved. Both Prewitt and Maggio are set up as victims of circumstance, but seem more in the end like prisoners of their own stupidity.There are a number of good scenes in \"Eternity\", and a couple of great ones. In one, Prewitt takes on Judson in a back alley in a scene that is played not for excitement but sordidness; I felt like I needed a bath just watching it. The other is the last scene, where lead actresses Donna Reed and Deborah Kerr meet for the only time. Reed's final speech was a head-scratcher to me for a while, but it sticks with you precisely because it's so off-kilter - like war's aftermath itself.But \"Eternity\" also has one scene that is overrated: Kerr and Lancaster getting wet together on a beach. It set pulses racing in 1953 but doesn't do so much now except remind me of \"Airplane!\" Overall, \"Eternity\" offers a master class in the art of boiling down something big into something that's cinematically digestible. The result is decent enough but doesn't leave you wanting more.",

            "content": "Though a little uneven overall, \"From Here To Eternity\" has some compelling moments and sequences, and it also has an assortment of interesting, if not entirely sympathetic, characters. It succeeds fairly well in at least two basic ways. First, it gives an interesting and credible portrayal of the nature of the servicemen in Hawaii, showing both their good and bad sides. Then, it also is effective in contrasting everyone's peacetime concerns with the sudden new concerns brought on by the outbreak of the war.Most of the characters and their situations are quite interesting, and much of it is presented in a surprisingly unflattering and uncompromising light. The way that it portrays military life is probably the most interesting aspect of the movie. Nothing is glorified, yet it doesn't take a lot of cheap shots at easy targets, either.The cast does a lot to keep the material on track. Burt Lancaster probably has the most interesting character, and he does a good job in the role. Frank Sinatra does well in making his rather pitiable character into an interesting presence. Montgomery Clift's role gives him plenty of opportunities for brooding and looking melancholy, so he is right at home. Some of the minor characters are also portrayed well. Donna Reed and Deborah Kerr do well enough in roles that don't really give them a lot to work with - they mostly have to react to the male characters.A lot of the material is pretty weighty, and as a result there are a few times when it might would have been better to lighten things just a little. But overall there are enough good, tense scenes, and more than enough depth to the characters, to make it worth seeing.",

            "content": "This movie tied \"Gone with the Wind\" (1939) for the most Oscars won by a single film up to that point in time -- eight. So, prior to seeing this, I had every idea it was going to be the masterpiece that an 8-time Oscar winning movie should be.But then after the conclusion, I was left saying \"Huh\"? First, the ending made no sense to me at all - the conversation between the 2 women on the boat leaving the island. I have since learned from the message boards that there was a lot cut out from the book and they explained the book ending. Someone shouldn't have to have read the book to understand a movie's ending - it should be a self-contained complete story.Secondly, I went into movie believing it would be a gripping tale of the events of Pearl Harbor, only to see that the attack is relegated to the end of the movie, and then as only a side note. So really, this isn't as much a war movie as a melodramatic soap opera surrounding the people who just happen to be inconvenienced by the attack at the end. The attack itself lasts mere minutes and seems to trivialize the tragedy of it. I think our servicemen and women who actually experienced this deserved greater respect than that.I wasn't that impressed with Sinatra's performance either. His character died halfway into the movie - I just didn't see an Oscar caliber portrayal.But given all my reservations, there are some fine performances by the cast. Kerr, Lancatser and Clift's portrayals stand out the most to me. There is some beautiful cinematography, especially the infamous kissing scene on the beach. And to think it was originally scripted to have been a vertical (standing up) kiss!So, overall, this is still a movie worth seeing. Just go into with realistic expectations - that this really isn't so much a war movie as it is a soapy melodrama about people who just happen to be in the military.",

            "content": "Its power may have waned a little bit since it first came out over 50 years ago, but FROM HERE TO ETERNITY still remains one of the classic war films as well as an interesting look into military life circa 1941. The story follows a handful of characters whose lives all intersect in Hawaii during the months prior to the bombing at Pearl Harbor. You have Montgomery Clift as Pvt. Robert E. Lee Prewitt: a loner with a troubled past, Burt Lancaster as Sgt. Warden: a tough, but understanding NCO, Deborah Kerr as Karen Holmes: the company commander's wife, and Frank Sinatra as Angelo Maggio: a wiry Italian fellow who befriends Prewitt and loves to drink. As was typical for films of the period, there is a romantic/melodramatic element which forms the basis for the story and informs the way we see the characters. This aspect was kind of dated, but it allows the casual viewer a window into these characters' lives the way a straight military picture couldn't have done. The two main romantic narrative threads are between Montgomery Clift and a girl, Loreen/Alma (Donna Reed) who works at a club he frequents, and Burt Lancaster with Deborah Kerr. Both of these couples lament the situation that life has put them in and desire to get away from it all. Montgomery Clift has become the target of cruel treatment based on his decision not to join the company's boxing team, while Donna Reed's character has grown weary of her employment at a gentleman's club where she has to entertain service members. Parallel to that, Burt Lancaster romances the wife of his CO, a philanderer who has lost interest in her. One common element is the desire to return to the States and get married, which would provide the stability that they all want. However, fate has other plans as the bombing at Pearl Harbor throws their somewhat stable world into chaos and the men of the Army must put aside petty differences to fight the bigger enemy. These are rather heady themes to be tackled in a film that could easily have been a fluff piece for the Armed Forces, yet FROM HERE TO ETERNITY never feels like propaganda. The biggest thing on its mind seems to be portraying what happens when something unexpected throws our best-laid plans into disarray. When that happens, the best we can do is to band together and make the best of a bad situation. In the end, our commitment to each other will outlast any temporary plans that we have. Overall, FROM HERE TO ETERNITY does feel \"of its time\" but it's also the only Pearl Harbor film worth watching.",

            "content": "Some films are classics in their time, some films are classics for all time. From Here to Eternity is more the former than the latter. When you watch the film you can see why it may have been so highly acclaimed upon its release, why it was awarded a bushel of Oscars. But you can also see that it has clearly not aged as well as some other notable films of its era. To the modern eye it's more soap opera than classic film. And often a rather hokey soap opera at that. It's a film with a style which struggles to convince all these decades later.The plot unfolds in an Army barracks in Hawaii in 1941. Army. Hawaii. 1941. No prizes for guessing where this story is ultimately headed. But this is really not a war story, it is more than anything else the personal story of one soldier, Robert E. Lee Prewitt. Montgomery Clift plays Prewitt who has been newly transferred to the barracks. What drives Prewitt's story? He once was a talented boxer but he doesn't fight anymore. His commanding officer wants him to fight on the company boxing team and Prewitt refuses. The officer and members of the boxing team thus set out to make Prewitt's life as miserable and difficult as possible. And that is the story at the center of the film. If you think that sounds rather trivial you'd be correct. In the grand scheme of things, especially considering the time and place, are we really supposed to care all that much about some Army boxing team? The rest of the story deals mostly with some romantic entanglements and that is where the soap opera aspect comes into play. We have Deborah Kerr playing the commanding officer's wife and she's a woman who gets around if you get my meaning. Donna Reed of all people plays a prostitute but this is a film made in 1953 so we're not actually going to call her a prostitute. She's a \"hostess\" in a club but what her hosting duties entail is quite clear. But she's one of those movie hookers with a heart of gold and she falls for Prewitt. Meanwhile Kerr's character's current affair sees her involved with Sergeant Milton Warden who happens to work directly under her husband. Actually it's Warden who really seems to be running things at the barracks as the commanding officer is much too busy carrying on his own affairs. It's quite the tangled web. Oh and there's Frank Sinatra too, hamming it up as Private Angelo Maggio, a rather entertaining drunk whose character seems to be there for comic relief until things take an abrupt turn and we all of a sudden are asked to take him seriously.All in all it's quite the soapy melodrama. Prewitt is at the heart of the picture and Clift does a fine job in portraying the put-upon soldier. Probably the best performance in the film comes from Burt Lancaster playing Sergeant Warden but even Lancaster is not immune from the moments of overacting which this film has all too many of. The women are mostly shunted to the side. Kerr doesn't have much to do. Reed makes a bit more of an impression but the story really belongs to the Army men all the way. And at times it is hard to really take that story all that seriously. The story certainly has its dramatic moments but at its heart it's all about a soldier being abused...because he won't join a boxing team? And there are the love affairs which seem better suited for modern daytime television. And Prewitt's story does not really pay itself off satisfactorily which is a problem since the film has spent its whole running time trying to get us to invest our emotions in Prewitt's fate. The end result is a bit of a letdown. This is not a bad film by any means but it certainly has its share of flaws. In its time it may have been a true classic. But some films do not age as well as others.",

Basically its 1941, and the film shows the life at the US Army's Schofield Barracks at Pearl Harbor, in the days leading up to the December Japanese attack. Pvt. Robert E. Lee 'Prew' Prewitt (Oscar nominated Montgomery Clift) has requested transfer, and he doesn't want to box anymore (which he is good at doing), and because of this, Capt. Dana 'Dynamite' Holmes (Philip Ober) is getting others to make his life a living hell. 1st Sgt. Milton Warden (Oscar nominated Burt Lancaster) is seeing Holmes' wife Karen Holmes (The King and I's Oscar nominated Deborah Kerr), who has a history of going with other men during a troubled marriage, there is also the love story seen a little between Prew and social club worker Alma 'Lorene' Burke (It's a Wonderful Life's Oscar winning Donna Reed). Pvt. Angelo Maggio (Oscar and Golden Globe winning singer/actor Frank Sinatra) taking life pretty easy at the barracks, and getting drunk quite often, is having quite a few arguments with Sgt. James R. 'Fatso' Judson (Ernest Borgnine), until Judson beats Maggio to death, and Prew wants revenge when he finds out.

Some of the stories include a man (Montgomery Clift) being abused because he refuses to box. Another (Frank Sinatra) having to battle an abusing brute (Ernest Borgnine). Then there's a Sergent (Burt Lancaster) who begins having an affair with his boss' wife (Deborah Kerr). The most amazing thing about this picture is how many talented actors they managed to get in it. Not only do you have Clift, Landcaster, Sinatra (Oscar-winner), Borgnine and Kerr (Oscar-winner) but there's also Donna Reed giving one of the best performances of her career and even Jack Warden. Needless to say but the performances are without question the greatest thing in the picture as everyone is at the top of their game. Clift really gives a tremendous performance in the role of the man being abused because he refuses to do something. I really liked how Clift played this part and especially when you consider this type of character had been done countless times in movies. Another standout is Lancaster who packs some real anger in his role here. Both Kerr and Reed were going against the types they usually played and both of them nailed the parts perfectly. I also think this here was Sinatra's greatest moment on screen as the usual tough guy managed to be so soft and fragile here that it shows what a strong actor he could be. The story of all of these people is one that just grabs you and doesn't let you go. I think the film does a very good job at giving everyone enough of the story to where you can care about them and it perfectly holds everything together before the eventual Pearl Harbor attack. The attack sequences are quite good and I thought the way it concludes all the personal stories was quite good. FROM HERE TO ETERNITY is without question one of the greatest films ever made when it comes to an ensemble cast. You're just not going to find many films out there with so many great talents giving so many great performances.

It would win seven others, including picture, director Zinneman, screenwriter and fellow supporting player Donna Reed, who's really has as much screen time as Deborah Kerr. One of Sinatra's problems was a merciless beating he gave to a reporter few years earlier and he gets beaten to death here. Well, this was made when my parents' generation was young and they loved Sinatra. That's why I started my first sentence the way I did.The real stars are Burt Lancaster, who doesn't want to be an officer though he definitely acts like one even when doing work he disagrees with. Actually, a more conflicted and less likable character than Montgomery Clift's, who gets the treatment for refusing to box because he blinded somebody.To get back at his commanding officer, Lancaster romances Deborah Kerr, who's at the top of her game here as is he. But I found myself more involved with Cliff getting the treatment. His one friend is Sinatra who at times shares in getting the treatment too.Cliff falls for one of the girls, actually a prostitute but this is 1953, sensitively played by Donna Reed which pretty mush throws logic out the window. Frankie boy gets drunk and tangles with Ernest Borginine which will eventfully lead to fatal results.However, I can't help liking this film. Zimmerman made his actors all act earnestly and I believed them even when I knew I shouldn't.Unspoken but it's there in the last Lancaster-Kerr scenes, is that he really does want to an officer in the army but in his terms not hers. Then the Japanese strike and Lancaster takes command.Cliff gets cut down from friendly fire hiding out with Reed after killing Borgnine out of revenge for Sinatra. The movie ends with two female leads on a boat to San Francisco with their tossed leis showing that neither will return to Hawaii.Contary to urban legend, George Reeves is in this.

I mean, I'm glad Donna Reed-who I always first think of as Mary Bailey in my favorite movie, It's a Wonderful Life-won the Oscar for her performance but if it had been revealed she was a prostitute and not just a dance hall girl, her performance would have been so much more powerful. And Frank Sinatra was very compelling in his first straight role but if he didn't have a death scene-and his character actually survived in the book-he probably wouldn't have been nominated, not to mention eventually won, his Oscar for this. Still, this was a fine showcase for such actors like Montgomery Clift, Bert Lancaster, Deborah Kerr, and Ernest Borgnine of which this was his first major film role. So, overall, From Here to Eternity was mostly a very well made film. P.S. Another of the players was one Philip Ober, who was married to Vivian Vance at the time.

            "content": "An intense and steamy drama packing romance, emotion, physical passion , jealousy , violence , anti-semitism and set in a Honolulu , Hawaii , just before the beginning WWIi . As at the military barraks happens various events among the troubled soldiers immediately former to Pearl Harbor bombing by the Japanese aviation .It describes a hard-hitting , complex look at the on and off-duty life at the Army base with Lancaster having a torrid affaire with the commander's spouse : Deborah Kerr .Romantic melodrama with emotion , thrills , engaging love stories and a great main/support cast cast , all of them snapped up thair chances . It contains a raw , strong portrayal of the torments, suffering and opressions of the soldiers at the beginning of WWII , that's why it made this movie a sure box office success . A good film that still has the best waves-on-the-beach love scene in filmdom , which was toned down by the censors . Interesting and taut screenplay by Daniel Tardash , including several incidents and moving moments . It won eight Academy Award and it launched Frank Sinatra's career when he won one of the prizes to the best secondary actor. Burt Lancaster and Deborah Kerr starred some known and scorching love scenes , an adulterous romp in the surf. There are performances that stay in the memory, particularly those of Montgomery Clift as sensitive Pvt Pruitt and his best friend Pvt Maggio : Frank Sinatra . While Donna Reed as a call girl , working at a club hostess, was another Oscar-winner , providing an interpretation of a woman a lot more vulnerable than she is willing to admit . Outstanding a great secondary cast as Claudie Akins , Mickey Shaughnessy , Philip Ober , Jack Warden and special mention for Ernest Borgnine as a sadistic sergeant .It displays an atmospheric cinematography in black and white with crisp monochrome camerawork by Burnett Guffey . As well as evocative and stirring musical score by George Duning . Fred Zinnemann's adequate direction , though extremely overlong , it does produce its dull and flat moments . Fred Zinnemann was a good Hollywood professional who directed all kinds of genres with penchant for dramas , some of them considered to be masterpieces , as he made the following ones : Kid Glove Killer , The Seventh Cross , My Brother Talks to horses , Act of violence , The Men , High Noon , Oklahoma ! , The Search , The Nun's story , The Sundowners , A Man for all season , The Day of Jackal , Julia , Five Days one Summer , among others . Rating : 7/10. Better than average , the flick will appeal to star-studded cast fans",

            "review_title": "Once controversial, still an impressive piece of filmmaking",
            "content": "Fred Zinneman's From Here to Eternity is based on James Jones' lengthy and controversial novel of the same name, but with a screenplay that toned down the source material to get past the Production Code Office (all references to homosexuality, gonorrhoea and prostitution, for example were removed). Despite that, it still managed to be quite controversial, partly because of prudish Conservative objections to the extra-marital affair it depicts and Burt Lancaster's famous beach romp with Deborah Kerr, and partly because of its harsh depiction of bullying in the army which resulted in the US Army refusing to be associated with it. This being the case, the fact that it not only met with critical and popular acclaim on its release but also that it won the Academy Award for Best Picture might seem surprising, but instead simply reflects the fact that it remains an assured piece of film-making.\nThe story focuses on the lives of a group of American servicemen in an army base in Hawaii in the run up to the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, and intertwines several parallel subplots. One concerns newly-transferred Private Prewitt's refusal to join the boxing team and subsequent persecution by his commanding officer Captain Holmes; another concerns First Sergeant Warden's affair with Holmes' wife Karen; and a third concerns Private Maggio's enmity with the thuggish Staff Sergeant \"Fatso\" Judson. These three subplots all converge, making for a satisfying narrative. The film looks like a Hollywood romantic drama for much of its length, but anyone who is expecting a happy ending will be disappointed: whilst Holmes and Fatso get their comeuppance, Maggio and Prewitt end up dead, and Karen rejects Warden, realising they have no future together. On top these personal tragedies, the inevitable attack on Pearl Harbor - and the army base - catches the characters by surprise and shapes the end of the story.\nDaniel Taradash's screenplay provides believable characterisation for the cast to work with (even those with limited screen time are convincing, at least enough to sustain the needs of a narrative that asks us to sympathise with multiple characters) and the actors assembled by Zinneman uniformly impress. Montgomery Clift, a Method actor, is as naturalistic as Pewitt as one might expect, but we also get impressive performances from Burt Lancaster, Donna Reed, Deborah Kerr and Ernest Borgnine, as well as Frank Sinatra, who is totally believable as Maggio, the only soldier who stands by his friend Pewitt and who loses his life as a result. Lancaster and Kerr's on-screen chemistry is palpable, which undoubtedly fuelled the rumours of an off-screen romance between the pair during filming. Occasionally, the actors have to exceed the limitations of the script, since the screenplay strays into melodrama at times. During the beach scene, the dialogue between Warden and Karen doesn't sound remotely like anything people would say in real life, even though Lancaster and Kerr just about manage to make it sound otherwise, especially when Karen bluntly tells Warden about her miscarriage and hysterectomy.\nZinnemann, with his documentary background, isn't a flashy director, and has an understated style that allows the audience to pay attention to his actors almost without noticing his skilled workmanship. He works well here with cinematographer Burnett Guffey, who favours medium and long-shots over close-ups. There are of course exceptions: Warden's first kiss with Karen is filmed in close-up, after which the camera pulls away through a window, giving them their privacy. Guffey also uses lots of both wide angle- and deep shots, which make good use of both the Hawaii locations and the convincing sets. Zinnemann's direction gives the cast room to move about in front of the camera and it pays off; it also requires the crew to pay attention to detail in the use of props and the performances of extras in the often roomy backgrounds. Zinnemann also makes the best use of George Duning's soundtrack, which is an effective blend of the non-diagetic and the diagetic; the latter predominates and generally works better, especially since Duning is prone to sentimental tendencies which are played over the film's romantic moments.\nThe film's finale is notable for its use of real-life stock footage of the attack on Pearl Harbor, which jars with the film stock used for the rest of the film but adds powerful historical authenticity. It neatly serves to illustrate that the lives of ordinary people, on which most of the movie focuses, can be unexpectedly and mercilessly be disrupted by the broader events of history. It's a message that remains as relevant today as it did in 1953, which helps to explain From Here to Eternity's lasting presence on lists of great American films.",

What viewers should also remember is the acting from all the principle characters and secondary characters.  There is not a flawed performance from anyone. Montgomery Clift is perfectly stubborn and Frank Sinatra is loud but likeable.  Ernest Borgnine brings a quiet menace to the role of Fatso Judson.  The scene where Sinatra is brought into the stockade shows the menace and joy in Bornine's eyes and the fear in Sinatra's.  Deborah Kerr and Donna Reed are the women who fall in love with soldiers.  Kerr has a loveless relationship with her husband and falls for Lancaster's no nonsense Sgt. Warden.  Reed loves Clift, but they can never know true love.  Clift loves the army, and he's too stubborn and proud to ever bow before anyone.  Set against the backdrop of Hawaii before the bombing of Pearl Harbor, the film remains a timeless classic of epic, but doomed romance.",

            "content": "My own estimation is that this is a pretty poor movie cinematically, with the exception of the then-shocking juicy exuberance of the beach scene.But it is crackling good storytelling and that overcomes the wooden direction and uninspired acting.I'm a believer in the power of structure in stories. Here we have the rule of three in two dimensions.We have the three stories that unfold in the first part:-The story of base strumpet Karen Holmes and her illicit affair with her husband's inferior-The story of a retired fighter and bugler who would rather fight the system, and who also falls for a whore, though the movie waters her down to a `dance hostess'-The story of the Italian impulsive who gets trapped in system in a way mirroring the fighter and is thereby killed.These three stories intermingle in controlled ways: the sergeant plays a key role in two, the fighter in two. In both cases their role in one story contradicts or opposes their role in the other: the reluctant fighter in one thread is passive, in the other is a killer. The sergeant in one thread is the colonel's patsy, in the other he cuckolds the colonel.There are two women, both promiscuous, but for opposite reasons: one because she cannot have a proper family and the other because she desires one.Wheels turn with carefully machined interlacing, and we follow each one. That's the first part. All during this, we know that an external force will break the machine. It comes and is treated as a story segment in its own right. But it is just heavy punctuation. Both affairs have ended. The Italian has been killed and his killer killed and his killer in turn killed. End of act two.What makes this novel in my mind is the very odd and short act three. The two endearing sluts are on a boat together, and Alma herself tells a story. I believe in a law of film stories that I discover in hundreds of films: the story IN the film - even a simple, short story as we have here - is precisely as abstracted from the story OF the film as the film is from the reality of the viewers in the audience. That's what we have here, and it really highlights and cements the memory of what we have seen before.But don't see this for any cinematic values: the direction, camerawork (except for that beach scene), acting and production design is ordinary, even tepid. Its the fabric of the story here, and it pulls us like a tractor.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",

            "review_title": "Superb Military Drama About An Individual Struggle Against Conformity!",
            "content": "America in the 1950s developed into a land where conformity ruled. Suburbs with look-alike housing proliferated in the form of Levitttowns. People grew fearful of anybody who criticized the American way of life. These critics became easy targets for anti-Communist crusaders, like The House Committee on Un-American Activities, whose mandate it was to investigate anybody with suspicious activities that might threaten America. Meanwhile, the affluence and domesticity that swept America were reflected in lowered rates of divorce and homicide. Nevertheless, some Americans feared that people had sunk into a morass of complacency and conformity that came with the impetus of a consumer-oriented, materialistic culture. Novelists in the early 1950s challenged this ideology and dealt with individuals trying to maintain their personality in the midst of mass culture that oppressed them. These problems had lain dominant since before World War II. Former soldier turned novelist James Jones unleashed them in his scandalous bestseller \"From Here to Eternity\" (1951) about the dehumanizing environment of military life at Schofield Barracks on Oahu, Hawaii on the eve of the Japanese sneak attack on Pearl Harbor. The novel contained adultery, promiscuity, sadism, and racism. The climate of the 1950s virtually guaranteed that Jones' novel, which was very critical of the U.S. military, would never illuminate the silver screen. Nothing, however, could dissuade Columbia Pictures studio boss Harry Cohn would producing the novel. Cohn called on MGM contract director Fred Zinnemann to helm the project. They agreed that filming \"From Here to Eternity\" without the cooperation of the U.S. military would make such a production impossible.Producer Buddy Adler, a former Army officer himself, helped resolve the conflicts between the military and the filmmakers so that a palatable version of \"From Here to Eternity\" could be produced. Columbia Pictures not only had to placate the military but they also had to contend with the repressive Production Code Administration, the industry's internal censors who objected to anything that did not portray American and its institutions in an idealized manner. Meanwhile, Cohn and Zinnemann argued about the casting, especially Montgomery Cliff, who eventually won the role over studio contract player Aldo Ray, the man that Cohn favored. Cohn and Zinnemann cast Deborah Kerr, whose reputation for playing proper women, went against type for the role she would have. The most notorious bit of casting involved crooner Frank Sinatra, whose career was tanking horribly, instead of Eli Wallach.The first time we see Private Robert E. Lee Prewitt (Montgomery Cliff of \"Red River\") he is marching across the parade ground in the opposite direction of the soldier drilling. Zinnemann deliberating staged the opening scene so that it would be clear that Prewitt differed from the rest of the men. Prewitt meets Maggio (scrappy Frank Sinatra) and says that he has transferred out of the bugle corp. Maggio advises Prewitt that he has made a terrible mistake. Maggio comments: \"This outfit they can give back to General Custer.\" First Sergeant Warden (Burt Lancaster of \"Criss Cross\") lays down the law during their first encounter. \"This here is a rifle company. You ain't supposed to enjoy yourself until sundown.\" Prewitt meets Captain Holmes and explains that he accepted a demotion from corporal to private to transfer out of the bugle corps because his first sergeant replaced him with the friend. Prewitt was the best bugler, but friend counted more to the sergeant than quality. Holmes has pulled strings to get Prewitt into his outfit so that they can win the boxing finals. Prewitt refuses to fight for Holmes. It seems that Prewitt blinded a friend boxing and has since refused to don the gloves and enter the ring. \"Looks to me like you're trying to acquire a reputation as a lone wolf,\" Holmes observes, and adds, \"In the Army, it's the individual that counts.\" All of Holmes' sergeants, who do box, except for Warden, give Prewitt 'the treatment' to make him change his mind. Prewitt, however, doesn't capitulate. Meanwhile, Warden takes up with Karen Holmes (Deborah Kerr) and they secretly date behind her husband's back. Warden is playing with fire because if he were caught, he could land in Leavenworth for twenty years.Maggio introduces Prewitt to society in town at a place called 'the New Congress Club.' In Jones' book, establishments like these were really whorehouses, but the Production Code required that Columbia sanitize these settings into harmless social clubs on the level of USO Clubs. Prewitt meets a strikingly beautiful lady, Lorene (Donna Reed of \"It's A Wonderful Life\") and they fall in love. Meanwhile, Maggio clashes with a brute of a first sergeant, Sergeant Judson (Ernst Borgnine of \"Marty\"), who prefers to plink away on the piano with all the dexterity of a monkey. Judson's bad piano music interferes with Maggio's dancing with a girl and they confront each other. Prewitt pulls Maggio off before the two can fight. Holmes' sergeants redouble the hazing, but Prewitt holds his own against them, until the irritable captain wants to draw up court marshal papers. Warden intervenes and suggests that Holmes put Prewitt on double punishment duty. Eventually, Maggio goes AWOL, and he winds up in the stockade where Judson beats him mercilessly until Maggio escapes. Maggio dies in Prewitt's arms and Prewitt tangles with Judson in a back alley and they fight until Prewitt stabs Judson to death. Unfortunately, Judson stabs Prewitt who flees to the safety of Lorene's house. Lorene came to Hawaii so that she could earn \"a stocking full of money\" and return to her small home town in Oregon to live out her life in style and respect. At the same time, Warden and Karen date and have to hide out from all military officers.\"From Here to Eternity\" won Zinnemann the Oscar for Best Director. The film claimed eight Oscars, including Best Picture and Sinatra, in his career reviving role, won a Best Supporting Oscar.",

There seemed to be no positive takeaways here, really a dour film and dim view of humanity. And abutting this story to the Pearl Harbor attack seemed unnecessary, incongruous, and only done in an attempt to lend credence and gravitas to a lurid tale. While the cast and crew went through the motions well enough and the film is technically ok, it is not one I would recommend due to the focus on adultery, bullying, and using of other people. Even the Lorene character at the end shows no growth and is just as shallow and scheming in the final scene. This film is almost more depressing than \"Nightmare Alley\" come to think of it. So, a punitive 4/10 rating from me. And I did not like the casting of the women, it did not fit their image well; Kerr and Reed are both much better at playing the good girl.",

            "content": "This is a very good wartime soap opera--with a stronger emphasis on love than on war. The film stars a strong cast and all try very hard to make this an exceptional film. Burt Lancaster was very good as the 1st sergeant and Frank Sinatra was surprisingly good as a hot-headed G.I.--so much so, that this film rescued his flagging film career. The female love interests of Donna Reed and Deborah Kerr were also good--and Ms. Kerr did a good job of creating an American accent. However, for the life of me I cannot understand the decision to cast Montgomery Clift as Private Prewitt. While he was generally a good actor and did well in movies such as THE SEARCH, he was totally wrong for this part. I am assuming his recent popularity was the sole reason he was given this part, because physically he was all wrong. Clift played a guy who was supposedly a great middle-weight boxer--despite him being a very thin and delicate man who looked like he would have had a hard time beating Ms. Reed in a fight, let alone beat up two savage sergeants like he did in the movie. This appears to be yet another case of someone being cast for a role purely because he was a hot commodity at the time.Fortunately, aside from one bad casting decision, the film was excellent--blending romance and wartime well and making for a very entertaining film. While not as great as you might expect from a film that earned so many Oscars, it is nevertheless an exceptional film.FYI--The Japanese planes in the movie are actually American Texan trainers and SBD Dauntless bombers. Apparently there weren't any flight-worthy Japanese planes available, so the airplanes attacking Pearl Harbor are American ones!",

But......I felt sadly let down by the character development in the film. Maggio is seldom more than irritating jolly - except for the bar stool - loved that move. Prewitt is more interesting and he is the leading character. He comes across as noble and principled. which is in stark contrast to all of the other male cast except 1st Sgt Warden. But I felt a bit let down by him at the end when hes hiding and awol. Basically I couldn't see him not having the courage to go back to the unit after dealing with Fatso.Burt Lancaster's character was the most interesting and believable - and I felt Lancaster did a good job with him. As you would expect. And he certainly has the frame for the beach scene - what a physique that man had. And by the end of the film we see both sides to the character - his tough macho outer, and a more emotional genuine inner.But all in the all I felt the plot was running in tandem all the time between the 3 main men in the film. It never seemed to tell a greater story. Other films like Casablanca do a much better job of character development within a strong central plot. FHTE seemed to flit a great deal from place to place within the story.Sorry :-( I really wanted to like it more but it got a 6.",

            "content": "This was the darling of 1953, winning a whole slew of Oscars and several more nominations. One of the Oscars went to Sinatra for Best Supporting Actor. Most of us remember Sinatra for his singing but he was a fine actor with 64 roles credited to him.This story takes place in Hawaii in 1941 on an Army base, just a few months before the eventual December 7th surprise attack of Pearl Harbor, the event that got the USA into WW2 against the Japanese. There is a boxing theme running through it, with the military championships scheduled for December 15th, and we know that will be upstaged.Burt Lancaster in his early 40s is the lead as Sgt. Milton Warden. He is confident and runs a tight ship, but he also has his eye on the pretty girls, one in particular, the wife of his commanding officer. It seems pretty well known that the officer routinely cheats on his wife so that makes the pursuit somewhat logical. Deborah Kerr in her early 30s plays that woman, Karen Holmes. The second main story involves Montgomery Clift as Private Robert E. Lee Prewitt, a former boxer who quit after a man he knocked over was badly injured and lost his sight. So he was transferred to Hawaii and ceaselessly harassed by men in his platoon trying to get him to change his mind and fight on the team.In his Oscar role Frank Sinatra was Angelo Maggio, a little guy with a big heart but who drank too much. In a bar another man, Ernest Borgnine as Sgt. 'Fatso' Judson, insulted Angelo's mother so Angelo hit Fatso over the head with a chair. The fight was broken up but later when Angelo was thrown in the brig for deserting his guard post, under the 'care' of Fatso, it eventually led to Angelo's death.The last scenes in the movie depict the attack of December 7th and it appears that some real news footage of the attack was used.Several good stories are woven in and while I haven't seen the movies this was competing against I can understand why it was then and still is considered such a timeless movie.",

            "review_title": "Summary notes from my recent introduction of this wonderful & powerful classic...",
            "content": "Few movies were greeted with more anticipation than Fred Zinnemann's From Here to Eternity when it opened in 1953. Adapted from one of the best-selling novels of the previous decade, filmgoers had high expectations. It lived up to all of them -- even adding a new level of violence and frankness to popular dramatic films. It was based on James Jones' hefty, 859-page smoldering, 1951 novel taking its title from Rudyard Kipling's poem \"Gentlemen Rankers\" which had the line about soldiers of the British Empire who had lost there way and were\u0085 \"damned, from here to eternity.\" However, Jones' sprawling and complex story-line about Army life with its strong language, violence and raw sexual content was considered unsuitable and unfilmable. Nevertheless, major concessions and changes from the novel had to be and were made. About the cast: Burt Lancaster plays macho Sergeant Milton Warden, the professional soldier who wet-nurses a weak, pompous commanding officer and the GIs under him. It is a performance to which he gives depth of character as well as muscle; Montgomery Clift, with a reputation for sensitive, three-dimensional performances plays the independent GI who refuses to join the company boxing team, taking instead the \"treatment.\" Montgomery Clift threw himself into the character of Prewitt, learning to play the bugle and taking boxing lessons. Ernest Borgnine dominated every scene he was in as Sgt. Judson, a vicious brute far from his Oscar winning character Marty or in TV's McHale's Navy (in 2010 he had five films in production and was 93!); Beautiful Deborah Kerr, previously known for her innocent, lady-like roles, got to play an unabashedly sexual woman, and a married one at that; Donna Reed, cast against type as a prostitute gives an honest and gut wrenching performance; And Frank Sinatra, cast against all prevailing wisdom, became a great actor overnight as the doomed Maggio. While some may be amazed at Sinatra's versatility, it will come as no surprise to those who knew he was much more than a crooner. Burt Lancaster agreed, commenting that \"Sinatra's hunger and passion had something to do with the character of Maggio, but also what he had gone through in recent years. A sense of defeat and the whole world crashing in on him... it all came out in that amazing performance.\" In gritty, documentary-style and black-and-white photography, Fred Zinnemann (who had directed High Noon a year earlier) accurately captured the isolation and boredom of the military personnel in a close- knit Army barracks on the island of Oahu, combining social and military history with the drama of the personal lives of its main characters - an enlisted man and a neglected officer's wife, a prostitute and a military outcast. The major male characters wage their own 'battle' against corruption high up in the military ranks, each in their own ways. The film, was both critically and financially successful becoming the second biggest hit of 1953, just behind The Robe (the first CinemaScope film released) and ahead of Shane (the Alan Ladd western.) That said, the ground-breaking film's subjects still include prostitution, adultery, military injustice, corruption, violence, alcohol abuse, and murder. From Here to Eternity raised the bar for realism and the harsh or ugly side of life in war movies, and in movies in general. There is an urban myth regarding the casting of Frank Sinatra that the Mafia made Columbia Pictures an offer they couldn't refuse. This of course was fiction, director Zinneman said that \"The legend about a horse's head having been cut off is pure invention, a poetic license on the part of Mario Puzo who wrote The Godfather.\" The real reason for Sinatra's casting was mainly his then-wife Ava Gardner suggesting Sinatra to studio head Harry Cohn according to biographer Kitty Kelly. And Cohn realized Sinatra's stock was so low at the time that he could get this once big name cheap. Sinatra lobbied hard for the role, even suggesting he would do it for nothing, he was eventually hired for the token sum of $8,000. From Here To Eternity reignited his now iconic career. Another rumor has been circulating for years that George Reeves, who played Sgt. Stark, had his role shortened after preview audiences recognized him as TV's Superman and laughed. This is depicted in the drama Hollywoodland (2006). That too is not true. Look for author James Jones who can be seen briefly in the background over Ernest Borgnine's right shoulder as he plays the piano at the New Congress Club. Jones is the one with the bald spot that keeps his face down while flirting with a bunch of so called \"hostesses.\" The now classic scene between Burt Lancaster and Deborah Kerr in the rushing water on the beach was a last minute inspiration from the director. And the classic clinch on the beach was to be filmed standing up, it was Lancaster's idea to \"do it horizontally in the surf.\" The chemistry between Lancaster and Kerr was alleged to be real, they supposedly became romantically involved during filming. The MPAA banned photos of the famous \"horizontal & passionate\" kiss on the beach for being too erotic. Notice on the posters the image of the tangled legs are blurred out so that only two of the four legs appear. The scene was filmed at Halona Cove on the eastern side of Oahu, near Koko Head Crater and Sandy Beach, it has since become a major tourist attraction. Shot on location (including a three-week shoot in Hawaii's Schofield Barracks), this film was a monumental award winner - Tied with Gone with the Wind for the most Oscars won by a single film up to that point in time. By coincidence, George Reeves appears briefly in both films. William Holden, who won the Best Actor Oscar for Stalag 17, said that Lancaster should have won. A final bit of trivia, From Here To Eternity is the last Academy Award Best Picture winner to receive nominations in all of the four acting categories.",

Clift is superb in this movie, and certainly deserved the Oscar he was nominated for but did not win.I knew, going in, that the movie is set in the days before the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor in Hawaii. I did not know that it also contained a drama so well acted that I would forget about that climactic event. The movie grabbed me from the beginning and wouldn't let go. I didn't care about the bombs and the planes and the kamikaze.Until they attacked. That has to be one of the best scenes of air-to-ground warfare I have seen in a movie.The movie is also notable for making a star out of Frank Sinatra, and that's nowhere near as bad as it sounds. Old Blue Eyes was no Elvis Presley: he could act as well as sing.Also, be on the lookout for that amazing actor, Ernest Borgnine. Who other than Borgnine could play a truly psychopathic bad guy - evil incarnate - as he does here, but also turn in a performance as a loveable lug, like he did in \"Marty\"?I have to admit though, the romantic subplot with Burt Lancaster kind of left me cold, but I think that's just me.

The characters are solid and each has just the right type of personality to make the story believable when they interact and create intriguing situations.I feel kind of silly for having missed out on this terrific movie for all these years (as I also did with \"The Bridges of Madison County\" - another I thought was 'just another love story.').

I kept thinking, \"some war movie... Where's the war?\" Maybe there was a title that fixed the date, and I missed it. Maybe the book was so well known they thought a title card wasn't needed. Eventually, I thought the story must only be about the routine goings-on at a peacetime barracks. You can't blame me. Nobody ever mentions the war (!) and there really isn't much going on in the movie. Then at the last minute, the Japanese attack. Would you make a 2-plus hour movie that included Pearl Harbor and toss it away as a 4 minute sequence? The concerns of three soldiers and two whores whose fates are torn asunder by the war are small potatoes; the very smallest way to tell a story about WW2. Foregrounding these trivial stories and pushing Pearl Harbor to the rear is positively bizarre. Lancaster is good, as is Clift, but every one of the plentiful \"funny drunk\" scenes in this is cringe-inducing and heinously acted. If you're going to be deep about about emotions, why not film the actual effects of alcoholism, instead of pretending drunks are charming? Ditto for annoying scenes of white people trying on black culture (blues music) in a bid for authenticity - just embarrassing. They Were Expendable also features a cringe-inducing, half-assed blues tune. The story lines are trifling and not blended well. As Clift gets gunned down near the end, I'm asking, \"that's your big ending? Deborah Kerr's \"bad girl\" is about as ridiculous as Tom Hanks bad guy (Road to Perdition)... you know a plot-point that excuses everything will be forthcoming, so a hopelessly wholesome actor can save face. Donna Reed as a hooker is another absurdity. Sinatra got an Oscar for playing this flimsy goof?",

            "content": "Using three different plot lines the film paints a panoramic view of military life in Hawaii about a year before Pearl Harbor. That attack hangs over the film the entire time and there are subtle hints that it is coming throughout the film. Mostly through the subtle use of dates and newspaper headlines you feel the slow burn of the fuse before the bomb of the attack goes off. It is surprisingly effective way of giving the proceedings dramatic weight even as the pace of the film is purposely slow to allow for the slow burn. Furthermore, the juxtaposition of the of the importance of Pearl Harbor and the human pettiness of the plot lines acts something like a implicit critique of the military failing to properly prepare for WWII. It is rather unusual to find that in the film from the 50's.Each of the plot lines are sordid affairs that provide a refreshingly human take on the US military. Whether it is the infidelity and loveless marriage of the Walden-Karen story, the vindictive battle of wills between the company and Prewitt, or the ethnically charged conflict between Fatso and Angelo the picture painted of the military is a lot more human and morally complex than you usually get. That each story is compelling in its own right; This is really the first Best Picture winner with anti-heroes at its center.A lot of this is due to the acting. It is all wonderful but I have to say that this is Clift's best role. Clift was a tortured soul, forced into the closet by the 1950's society and struggled with alcoholism and drugs as a result. That soulful pain is present in this film and Prewitt is a strong figure of stubborn masculinity yet laced with tender sensitivity that he stays with you even if the rest film didn't.This is a really strong Best Picture winner.",

Both films have to do with the attack on Pearl Harbor, but, \"From Here to Eternity\" does it with an unanticipated, left hook. The victims of Pearl Harbor were never prepared. Perhaps the several, very involving plots in the story were contrived to make us unprepared. The attack by Japanese planes on the army barracks is realistic, even on the emotional level. But, the scene that will forever stand out for me is the knife fight between Pruitt(Clift)and Fatso(Borgnine). Shot through a dark, Honolulu alley, with the music of bars and dance halls in the background, and with very little camera action, we can only imagine and wait, mesmerized in anticipation. This scene sold me on film as a valid art form. It illustrates the vastness of technique that is possible within film to portray any given idea. In this duel to the death scenario, the idea was masterfully depicted without the graphics that would predictably be used today as an attempt to enhance the same idea.",

It's not a terrible movie, but suffers from some highly implausible scenes and dialogue. For example, at the end why doesn't Prewitt stop when the soldier yells \"stop or I'll shoot\"? Throughout the movie he displays remarkable self-control, so this very crucial scene makes no sense. And the really bad lines, like this one by Deborah Kerr, \"Of course .. the baby was dead\". You didn't know how to use the telephone to call a doctor yourself? On the good side, there are some fine acting performances, and the movie maintains dramatic intensity for most of its duration. But near the end there are a couple of turns which just dissipate the tension without really resolving the conflicts the movie worked so hard to set up. Quite a disappointment, I thought. Again though, it was just after the war, and I wonder how this movie struck viewers in 1954. To win 8 Oscars it must have had a much greater impact than it does today. Despite the great acting performances, to be truly great a movie needs a good story and a great script. In that area, this one falls short.",

And before you start whining, what the W.W. II generation did was nothing short but save the world--literally and I am eternally grateful to them for that. But they are no better than the Baby Boomers or Gen X.

There were surprises; it's so different it came as a shock.It's almost as though screenwriter Daniel Taradash and director Fred Zinnemann worked from a few plot points and invented the rest. Doubtless they dissected the book quite analytically, but much that is in the film wasn't in the book or was considerably rearranged.In the book, the characters are more complicated; more flawed; they argue and even tire of each other before the end. The movie tidied things up.James Jones' novel was based on his experiences in the pre-WW2 U.S. Army based in Hawaii. 1953's censorship stopped many of the novel's themes from reaching the screen. Along with the gambling, anti-Semitism and racism, there was the interaction between the soldiers and Honolulu's gay community. The long sequence in the novel where Prewitt and Maggio head off to a gay bar to sponge money and booze from a couple of older gay guys went AWOL in the script.It's a brick of a book with the characters projecting James Jones' worldview on just about everything. The raw look at the lives of the tough pre-war regular soldiers gave the book its clout, especially the treatment handed out in the stockade, but every episode seems drawn out. The filmmakers dismissed a platoon of characters to shape the brilliant screenplay.The cast stays in the memory, Burt Lancaster, Frank Sinatra, Deborah Kerr even Ernest Borgnine as Fatso Judson, but especially Montgomery Clift. For me, he was America's finest actor. Even after his face was smashed and his life fell apart, he could still give performances such as those in \"Judgement at Nuremburg\" and \"The Misfits\" - Brando was wary of his talents. In \"Eternity\" he was at the top of his game.There is another version of \"From Here to Eternity\", the mini-series starring Natalie Wood, William Devane and Steve Railsback. It's not bad and contains more from the book - the gay guys finally report for duty and we go inside the stockade. However it also used scenes from the 1953 film, which were not in the book including the bottle vs knife confrontation between Warden and Fatso Judson.James Jones didn't like the movie. I love the movie. The book is harder to love, but it made me want to read \"The Thin Red Line\", a sequel of sorts.",

Why I don't want to call it a war movie? Mainly because most of the time it shows us life in a military camp during peace time. Only at the end of the movie, we get to see some 'war action' when the Japanese attacks on Pearl Harbor start.As I already said, this movie shows us life during peace time, in 1941 at a military camp called Schofield in Hawaii. Private Robert E. Lee Prewitt had requested Army transfer and this is the base where he's stationed. His new captain, Dana Holmes, knows that Prewitt is an excellent boxer and wants him to represent the company at the next championship. But Prewitt has decided that he'll never ever fight another box match and nothing will make him change his mind, not even when Holmes gets his subordinates to make Prewitt's life a living hell. But not everybody hates him. His friend Maggio for instance takes him out for some drinks and introduces him in a social club, where he meets Lorene, one of the girls that work in the club. In the meantime Seargeant Warden starts seeing the captain's wife, whose marriage doesn't go to well, Maggio gets in trouble with the sadistic stockade Sergeant 'Fatso' Judson and the Japanese are preparing themselves for attacking the unsuspecting Americans...What I really appreciated about this movie, was its somewhat naive innocence combined with a good story. For instance by the way how the men and women deal with each other in this film, you can see that this movie wasn't made in the nineties or later, but that it is a product of its time, the fifties. Nevertheless this is a very good movie that deserves to be seen even today. The acting is nice and the fact that they have used some authentic battle footage adds to the realism of this movie. I give it at least a 7/10, maybe even a 7.5/10.",

It also won seven other Oscars (from thirteen nominations), tying the mark set by \"Gone With the Wind\" fourteen years earlier.The story takes place at a U.S. military base in Hawaii in the months preceding the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. There are two main threads to the plot: One centres on a private who's being cruelly treated in an attempt to bend him to the captain's will while the other concerns an affair between the captain's wife and a sergeant. Apart from this there are further sub-plots, which is perhaps unsurprising given the considerable length of the novel. Nevertheless, the script is tight and the screenwriter won an Oscar for his efforts.The cast is a good one, as evidenced by the five Oscar nominations in the acting categories. Donna Reed and Frank Sinatra both took home Oscars but I feel that the film's other nominees (Montgomery Clift, Burt Lancaster & Deborah Kerr) were actually more deserving. The supporting cast is pretty decent, too, including Ernest Borgnine in his breakout role.Zinnemann's direction won an Oscar and the film also landed awards for its cinematography & editing. The visuals are consistently attractive and Lancaster & Kerr's scene on the beach is genuinely iconic.

Instead of going full ham on propaganda and the glory of battle and the military it's the exact opposite. You don't even see the Pearl Harbor attack before 2 hours into the movie. It takes way too long to get there and it becomes a pretty dull affair. Overall it's top range acting, proper sets, and often a storyline moving forward. There is just no plot here. Bad things happen. A boxer doesn't want to box anymore. The commander bullies him to make him box for the regiment, but it doesn't work. His friend gets killed trying to escape the army prison after doing a bunch of totally stupid things to get there. The boxer takes revenge by killing the prison guard who beat his friend up. Then of course we know the boxer will die. It's a movie from the Hollywood code era so there is nothing else to be done here. He will either die or be imprisoned for life - boring. We also spend like half an hour on the boxer's romance which clearly didn't go anywhere. The lady is attractive, but she has no personality and even tells him she won't stay with him.The commander also has a male secretary who dates his wife. They fall in love, but the commander gets fired for bullying the boxer and gets sent to the mainland. The wife, who hates her husband and he her in return, wants to divorce him. But as he goes to the mainland from Hawaii she tells her lover that she has to go with him. Why? Every scene with them together they bicker and they don't sleep together. They hate each other. Yet she just follows along instead of remaining with the man she loves. I didn't understand this storyline. The movie takes an hour telling it. But what is here? Is she being a faithful fake wife? Was that a thing in the 1940's? But then why is she constantly talking about the upcoming divorce? Just random noise really. They spent 2 hours setting up 2 relationships then ruin them in a few minutes with just random events making no sense. The boxer died because he was trying to run into the military base. Why? We never get a clear answer. Several guards shoot at him and tell him to stop and he keeps running clearly knowing what will happen. So they shoot him. I don't get anything about these stories. At least make it logical.Only the acting is great really. Everything else falls completely flat. The stories set up are at least interesting initially. But they go nowhere. The Pearl Harbor attack should have happened at the hour mark. 1 hour prior. Then build on top of that instead. And let the romance get somewhere or at least use some logic to break the couples apart.",

Not much, but it is worth the 7 I am giving it just because of the actors. Burt Lancaster made greater films, Montgomery Clift the same and Deborah Kerr has a ' Marilyn Monroe ' haircut, and she does her best to be a sexual object to hunk Burt Lancaster, but somehow I do not believe in their chemistry. Gloria Grahame could have convinced and that elusive thing called sexual desire could have been more convincing. Frank Sinatra is good and the film is a toned down version of the book, which was typical of the period. But it is a MALE film all over and macho to its fingertips. A lot of fights and that is not just the WW2 background. Fred Zinnemann's direction is bland, and it is bland visually. And Donna Reed is playing sexy and convincing. What more could the hetero-normative world want back then, but overall the film is dated and overrated. And don't forget the sexual waves!!!",

            "content": "Movies are one of the things I love the most in my life, and I really want to know about the things I love. So I believe that in order to appreciate films, you should watch everything; to become a cultured person in the matter. Not just watch the contemporary films, or in Descartes mode, watch only the films made after I was born.Everything includes classics like \"From here to eternity\". Made in black and white: with pure passion. While I watched I tried to think about the way movies were made at those times. The power the big female stars like Deborah Kerr had, the money actors like Burt Lancaster made per movie, the low budget of the projects, the little shooting time.What were the results? In the case of \"From here to eternity\"; an Oscar winning film where everything fits perfectly. Because it was not easy to make it work, or at I least that's what I think. I think that at the time there was an honest cinema, with lots of true spoken words. Nowadays we have P.T. Anderson and his encounters between people, but in the 50's it took a man named Daniel Taradash to make moving a two people chat.When Private Prewitt (Montgomery Clift) arrives in Schofield, he has a little \"catch-up\" talk with a soldier. In three minutes, with non-exaggerated words, we understand the essence of Clift's character. The army is his life; and he's destined to end his days there. He'll have his problems, he'll have to fight, he'll have to gain his place, but that's how things go with the hero. Then he'll meet his woman Alma (Donna Reed) and fight for love, too.But it's not just about him and his love story. There's another man, Prewitt's superior; Sergeant Milton Warden (Burt Lancaster), who has another superior, Captain Dana Holmes. However, Holmes goes out with friends and the honorable Warden does all the work. From time to time, Holmes' wife Karen (Deborah Kerr) visits the base, and the Sergeant approaches. Later both of them experience two of the most romantic scenes I've ever witnessed.And here comes an issue probably discussed many times. In a movie where the character that highlights the most is Prewitt, Montgomery Clift is second-billed, and Lancaster is first. Yet Lancaster goes into the water and the sand with Deborah Kerr, third-billed. Who is the leading man? Lancaster or Clift? And if they're both leading men, why is Clift's woman supporting actress and not Lancaster's? Well, supposing the latter four are the \"leading team\", each of their performances is incredible and impossible to detail about. On the other hand, supporting performances or a supporting performance is from another world. Frank Sinatra's Angelo Maggio is priceless. We don't get many given friends in today's cinema. In a story like this one, Prewitt needed someone beside him, and that little guy was there from the start until the end. They'll meet again.The work of Fred Zinnemann (\"cine\" is cinema in Spanish, and \"zine\"..Zine man: The man of the cinema) is wondrous too. Now the final product of a film depends of lots of people, and influences come from different parts of a production; but I think back then the director was like a king. It was his word in his world or something like that. Zinnemann's camera always makes close ups in the characters' faces.Maybe he believed it was very important to show feelings and maybe the face is the part of the body that expresses them best. I would do the same.",

James Jones' multi-character novel gets brought to the screen in a great film that manages to capture something of the essence of the novel, showing army life not as some campfire circle but as a big cynical game of fitting in, going with the flow, and not getting caught. The one purist, a truly fine soldier, fearless and loyal, played by Montgomery Clift, is the polar opposite of all the BS that is around him. He loves the army as if it were his family, but the feeling isn't mutual. The scene where he plays Taps epitomizes his depth and elegance. It's a truly beautiful performance, though not too far behind is Burt Lancaster the master sergeant who's secretly having an affair with the CO's deeply unhappy wife played by Deborah Kerr, a target of rumors that she'll sleep with anyone. We find out why in one of the film's plots, just another lurid episode depicting all the hypocrisy that the story delves into. Their famous roll in the surf is a passionate moment in an exciting and dangerous affair, that this very complex film somehow managed not to short change.",

            "content": "FROM HERE TO ETERNITY is a very mature and touching drama about the lives of American soldiers. Intended brutality and a few vulgar in the film gives a realistic dimension. The film deals with the problems of soldiers, who are stationed in Hawaii during the months leading up to the attack on Pearl Harbor. Trumpeter was transferred from the music division into unit \"G\" in Schofield Barracks on the island of Oahu. When local captain learns of his reputation as a talented boxer, problems arise...In the story are woven 'empty' lives of professional soldiers, their love woes, selfishness and past. The film realistically points out the problems related to military career, personal frustration and sexuality. It's tough to be a soldier, but worse was to be a soldier's wife, or just a girl. I would never describe this movie as a tragic drama, but as quite realistic relationship in which a sick sense of belonging to something wins over life. Revolt and rebellion is certainly evident, but is repressed in the military system. What is interesting. Protagonists in this film you can not admire, but they are persistently trying to be understood.The director was somewhat restrained. I believe that Mr. Zinnermman did not want to answer the questions in the movie, but scratch the surface of the sensitive topic. In this he succeeded.The cast performance is generally good. Burt Lancaster as First Sergeant Milton Warden is married with army. The protagonist who is not able to accept anything that would undermine some of his concept of life, and above all duties. This is not solely about honesty. Sergeant rejects love. Deborah Kerr as Karen Holmes is a classy lady and passionate slut at the same time. A woman who was defeated between unsuccessful marriage and love in vain. The famous scene on the beach. Making love or is she touched his lips. The incoming tide.Montgomery Clift as Private Robert E. Lee \"Prew\" Prewitt He is sensitive protagonist. The young man haunted by the past, abused in the present and for him the future is uncertain. That his attitude that he has nowhere to go except into the army is quite bizarre. One has to follow its own path, even if it leads to destruction. Donna Reed as Alma Burke / Lorene looks more like the girl next door than the dangerous seductress in \"fun club\". However, it does have its moments through the monologue of smoothness or loneliness.Frank Sinatra as Private Angelo Maggio is the most colorful protagonist. Aware that such a life of soldiers does not make sense, but it now has to accept and want to enjoy every moment outside the military base. He is an \"island\" of true pathos.",

            "content": "On a quiet, unspoilt beach, two lovers embrace in the sand. The fierce waves of the ocean are tossed upon the shore, and the couple is momentarily submerged in a surge of water and foam. Gloriosly oblivious to this, the lovers continue to hold each other tight, as if it is all in this world that matters.This iconic image between Burt Lancaster and Deborah Kerr has since become one of the most famous scenes in the history of film. As such, it comes as a surprise to discover it does not even appear in the script \u0096 the idea to film with the waves hitting them was a last minute inspiration from the director, Fred Zinneman. It is always fascinating to discover that the inspirations that spring forth at the last minute will often prove to be the most enduring.On a bright, sunny morning at a Hawaiian military base, Pvt. Robert E. Lee 'Prew' Prewitt (Montgomery Clift, 'I Confess') strolls amidst the marching soldiers. He has transferred across from the somewhat more prestigious Bugle Corps at Port Shaftford because he felt that a less-talented bugle player had been promoted ahead of him. \"His feelings were hurt\u0085.\" smirks 1st Sgt. Milton Warden (Burt Lancaster, 'Birdman of Alcatraz') amusedly. \"Kids they send us now.\" Yet it is this uniquely steadfast pride and determination that forms the heart of \"From Here To Eternity.\" \"A man don't go his own way, he's nothing,\" declares Prewitt after refusing his commanding officer's (Philip Ober) request to join his boxing team. \"Maybe back in the days of the pioneers a man could go his own way,\" retorts Sgt. Warden. \"But today you got to play ball.\"All this petty persuasion proves futile in Prewitt's case. However, his fellow comrades (and his superiors) believe that his participation in the boxing team will be beneficial, as Prewitt had once been a seasoned fighter, only to inexplicably quit a year earlier. As a means of cruel coercion, Prewitt is unfairly persecuted by his superior officers, and targeted by his comrades. Only one fellow soldier, Pvt. Angelo Maggio (an Oscar-winning Frank Sinatra, 'The Manchurian Candidate') looks out for Prewitt's wellbeing, and they become good friends.Amidst all this struggle and adversity, several love stories begin to blossom. Sgt. Warden takes a fancy to the unappreciated wife of his direct superior, Capt. Dana 'Dynamite' Holmes. Karen Holmes (Deborah Kerr) is fully aware that her husband is cheating on her, but is denied a divorce because it could affect his reputation. Whilst she is initially quite terse towards Warden, she soon falls in love with him, and the two must maintain a low-key relationship behind the army's back.Prewitt, meanwhile, is dragged by a very drunk Maggio into a local club known as the New Congress Club. Here, Prewitt immediately spots the women of his dreams (an Oscar-winning Donna Reed), and he saunters over to her, only to discover that she is simply being paid by the management to mingle with the Club's guests. Indeed, the name by which she originally introduces herself \u0096 Lorene \u0096 was given to her on her first night on the job. Nonetheless, Prewitt sees an opportunity for love, and entices \"Lorene\" to meet him outside of work.'From Here To Eternity' is a classic Hollywood film. It encompasses riveting drama, timeless romance and, when the occasion calls for it, a few highly-entertaining action sequences. The acting is brilliant all-round from a large cast, which also includes a small role for Ernest Borgnine as Sgt. 'Fatso' Judson, Maggio's sworn nemesis. Winner of 8 Academy Awards (including Best Director and Best Picture), and nominated for a further five (including two Best Actor noms for Clift and Lancaster), 'From Here To Eternity' deserved them all. This is a film that reminds us why we watch movies in the first place.",

            "content": "James Jones' risque trash masterpiece \"From Here to Eternity\" quickly got the red carpet treatment by 1953 and was turned into a motion picture that shocked audiences with strong sexual undertones and intense situations during the backdrop of upcoming doom at Pearl Harbor. Officer Burt Lancaster (Oscar-nominated) has the hots for his superior's wife (Oscar-nominee Deborah Kerr). She is upset and bored with her husband and a lightning fast affair based more upon lust than love quickly comes about. New bugle man Montgomery Clift (another Oscar-nominee) has an odd past in the military as he refuses to do prize-fighting for the Army. Thus he pens up his anger and becomes more of a ticking timebomb. He finds short-term happiness with a beautiful prostitute (Donna Reed in her Oscar-winning role), but their relationship is also strained to say the least. The likeable Frank Sinatra (Oscar-winning) locks horns with the crazed Ernest Borgnine and his safety becomes a major concern. While all this goes on, the Japanese attack becomes imminent. Watching \"From Here to Eternity\" is a study in caring for rotten characters. It is bad when Sinatra is the most endearing performer by a landslide. This production is not patriotic and in fact it is a down-right sad commentary on U.S. soldiers in Hawaii just prior to the attack. Jones was actually a soldier that experienced Pearl Harbor firsthand and also got a stay in Guadalcanal (using that as his inspiration for the equally crazed novel \"The Thin Red Line\"). While Jones' writing skill cannot be questioned, his want to shock was always puzzling to me. \"From Here to Eternity\" was definitely trail-blazing with its undertones, but the film is far from excellent and it is a curiosity more than a classic. Director Fred Zinnemann picked up his first of two directing Oscars with this one. 4 stars out of 5.",

I had seen From Here to Eternity a long time ago (but not in 1953, hahah, as I am not that old) and didn't remember much from it. I think it's not much of a film for kids, and I perhaps watched it first when I was too young to really appreciate it. I think the story is beautifully crafted with much care for character building and story arcs. No fluff here, no contrived endings, no pulling of punches (pun intended). It works really well as a romantic story (stories), without being consumed with sappiness. It's a mature film. I bet this easily overshadows most films made today.The acting is really solid. I was most impressed by Burt Lancaster. He has an immense screen presence. He carries his role like it fits him. Physically, he looks impressive, too: tall, in excellent shape, and good-looking. I just looked up some information about him and learned he had been a gymnast. In the movie, everybody smokes like a chimney and drinks, but maybe it was reflective of the times or someone paid for the ads on screen. People still looked a lot healthier then.Not so physically impressive is Montgomery Clift. I don't know if he consciously hunched over all the time, but he always is hunched over with his shoulders hanging forward, like he carried a burden too heavy for him. Solid acting, though. His character is still believable.Beautiful women in here as well. Back then, they could be beautiful and classy.I think I could spend a lot of time writing about this all, but I can suffice writing it's a film to watch. I have rated it 8 out of 10.

His freewheeling hijinks don't land him a permanent score, but he still manages to meet up with a couple ofgals anyway! All this ended with tragedy, mostly due to the conflict of the big war.

I won't dwell on the topics others have covered in praising this excellent film; I DO want to point out two examples of great, great film making. Montgomery Clift as Prew playing Taps upon the death of Sinatra's Maggio is one of the most moving scenes ever put on film. The musician who actually played the instrument was a virtuoso, as the emotion expressed in the performance is tangible. That scene is followed almost immediately by Clift accosting Ernest Borgnine -- the man responsible for the death of his friend -- and asking him to step into an alley. In just a few seconds the two of them are locked in a knife fight to the death, while in the background, just feet away, pedestrians are strolling along Hotel Street, happy honky-tonk music playing in the distance. The contrast between the human activities happening in the same scene is a masterpiece of direction. See this film.",

Joan Crawford was a much better actress than given credit for and technically one of the best actresses ever, but wasn't her persona that her characters slept around? Rita Hayworth would have also been a great selection and as Queen of Columbia surely was considered. Ms. Kerr had a ladylike image and this role was casting against type. The beach scene is erotic and yet understated. If the film were made today that scene would be so blunt Splendid work by Donna Reed, Frank Sinatra, Ernest Borgnine and Montgomery Clift. Kudos to All and to Harry Cohn of Columbia who was also referred to as uncouth but what films Columbia made under Cohn's tenure: Mr. Smith Goes To Washington, Lost Horizon, Love Affair, Mr. Deeds Goes To Town, The More the Merrier, All The King's Men, Born Yesterday, Picnic, and this film among many many others, and just before Cohn died a Columbia Pictures masterpiece, The Bridge On The River Kwai, maybe we need more \"uncouth Executives\" like Harry Cohn!!",

            "content": "I was acutely struck by how many similarities this movie shares with \"The English Patient\". Both are revolve around illicit affairs. Both take place in World War II. Both were critics' darlings and won a ridiculous amount of Academy Awards. And both are incredibly sordid.But enough about \"The English Patient\"--let's move on to this movie.\"From Here to Eternity\" is said to be the definitive movie on Pearl Harbor. Hmmm, maybe if you're talking about more than the battle, which only took up the last 10-15 minutes of the movie. But this movie is really more about the two sorry affairs taking place: the one between Sgt. Warden (Lancaster) and his captain's wife, Karen Holmes (Herr); and the other between Private Prewitt (Clift) and Lorene (Reed), a worker at a gentleman's-club-sort-of-place.Maybe I was misled in my expectations, but I thought a movie from the '50s would be a lot more cheerful than this. I expected a rousing, well-made movie to watch with my parents, who only like upbeat productions of a rather brief length. This movie was the exact opposite. It was highly depressing, and when it comes to sordidness, only \"The English Patient\" passes it in my books. This movie was 118 minutes, but by the time my mom and I reached the end I felt like we were closing in on three hours instead of two. My dad left the room long before out of disinterest, and, though we rarely see eye-to-eye with the kinds of movies I watch, for once I couldn't blame him.Take all the stigma attached to an Oscar-winning movie, then get rid of all the positive aspects associated with that stigma. What's left is a movie rather like \"From Here to Eternity\"--well-made in a purely technical sense, great acting, a good deal of nascent talent, but an overall depressing work that is quite downtrodden and never really elicits sympathy. And, after considering my comparisons between this movie and \"The English Patient\", you come to realize that this sort of story has been told a million times before. Really, if you've watched one movie about a sordid affair of illicit love, you've watched them all.",

It is indeed an everlasting classic - with that famous love scene on the beach. It is a highly emotion filled drama which draws you in from beginning to finish.

This story about military injustice somewhat differs from Stanley Kubrick's \"Paths of glory\" for two reasons because it shows how two G.I.'s are bullied whereas \"Paths of glory\" shows how careless the army is towards its soldiers and it deals with other themes than military injustice like adultery for example. \"From here to eternity\" is a little ahead of its time because of its heavy references to adult themes like prostitution, alcohol abuse, violence, and murder.  Lancaster and Clift lead a terrific cast which also includes legends such as Deborah Kerr, Frank Sinatra, and Donna Reed (who is as beautiful as ever).  Reed and Sinatra took home well-deserved supporting actors Oscars.    Another reason for which I love this movie is that it is the movie that sent Sinatra to stardom.  After its release, he became a lot more popular in Hollywood and was offered many more important roles than before.  All in all, \"From here to eternity\" is a great, compelling, realistic movie.  The Clift-Reed, Clift-army, Clift-Lancaster, Clift-Sinatra, Lancaster-army, and Lancaster-Kerr relations are extremely well interpreted. This is one of those films that are worth at least five viewings.  It's great.",

            "content": "'From Here to Eternity' is a film set at Pearl Harbor in the weeks or months preceding the Japanese attack of 1941. The title is awarded a great performance by Montgomery Clift as the 'Cool Hand Luke'-esque Robert E. Lee Prewitt, and Clift manages to project a level of complexity that I haven't seen since I watched Laurence Olivier in 'Rebecca'. The character of Prewitt, after transferring to the Schofield base, is urged by his superior, well-played by Philip Ober, to replicate his allegedly remarkable boxing talents and champion his new company. Prewitt is reluctant, and consequently a large portion of 'From Here to Eternity' charts the character's awkward integration into the new company. In the film, Clift is joined by Burt Lancaster; his performance is equally solid, but not quite mesmerising. I feel that this reflects the design of the characters, though, as opposed to Lancaster's acting. Another enjoyable performance to look out for is Ernest Borgnine's, who lends his easily menacing talents to this title, and his role as Sgt '(don't ever call me) Fatso' Judson is very enjoyable. Most of all, I didn't expect to find a Frank Sinatra performance so impressive. The only other films I've seen (so far) starring the swing legend are 'Ocean's Eleven' and 'The Devil at Four O'Clock', and I think he was outperformed in both of those films, by Dean Martin and Spencer Tracy respectively. However, one could consider him in the same league as the likes of Bogart and the aforesaid Tracy in this title as the live-hard-die-young Angelo Maggio. Deborah Kerr and Donna Reed similarly enhance 'From Here to Eternity' with their performances, but they rarely get a chance to shine given the \"life in the barracks\" focus of this title. (However, there is one brilliant, even iconic, scene featuring Kerr, alluded to by the cover poster of the film.)The cast is far from the only winning quality of the film; another of the title's incredible traits is its framing of its fictional story in the larger context of the all-too- real war. At one point, the film employs some real footage from the Second World War, and it is absorbed within 'From Here to Eternity' excellently, feeling both symbolic and convincing. One of the messages I take from this film is that history is often, to its detriment, acknowledged only in response to great events, and this is amplified in times of war. 'From Here to Eternity' doesn't chart the Schofield troops' unfathomable plight against the invading forces, and the Pearl Harbor that people know and remember (i.e. the bombings), whilst integral to the story, doesn't dominate the film. It brings the characters to life, and shows that the people in history aren't represented by lists of achievements, statistics and the like; they were often very ordinary, doing very human things. I rarely give ten stars to a film, but I felt compelled to do so in this case. I was absolutely amazed by 'From Here to Eternity', and I currently rank it as one of my top five films.",

Still, actors today will not accept this. They cant admit that one of the greatest actors, who influenced them was gay! Thats why as an openly gay male, it is so important to be true to yourself and force people whether they want to or not accept it. When have you heard an actor on Oscar night, mention Monty? When did you ever hear the Academy Awards ever acknowledge the debt all actors have to him. Marlon Brando, James Dean..etc..etc..ad infinitum. Ask any professor of acting, who was the most naturally talented , and Monty is always mentioned. It doesn't matter. He was gay, so he has to be denied as a person. I've never heard Marlon, Paul Newman, Steve McQeen ever publicly address this, including todays actors. The only actors I have ever heard praise him, and acknowledge his worth were women. Elizabeth Taylor, Joanne Woodward, Natalie Wood, Faye Dunaway, the list goes on, but um their women and again its Hollywood, and their opinion doesn't matter either cause they are women!

            "content": "This is a film that many people now will know for its most famous scene. The kiss and embrace on the beach between Deborah Kerr and Burt Lancaster. That scene is truly awesome. Technically, emotionally and for its timeless appeal. Often copied and even parodied, it is one of the best lip-clinches in cinematic history. For viewers looking back on it now, little can be said of the rest of the film in such superlatives. But is worth watching for that kiss.The story is a watered down version of a famous novel. Set in the American army just before the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbour, it shows the harsh reality of the bombing (in a finale that is in sharp contrast to the easygoing flamboyance of the rest of the movie). It was one of the first films to show the harshness of military life, including bullying (though this was one of the many aspects watered down for the censors at the time). It has award-winning or famous performances from many stars that are still household names. A vast amount of talent was poured into it. Some subtleties (such as Deborah Kerr playing against her standard, pure-as-the-driven-snow roles) will be lost on modern audiences if they miss the contrasts. But who has not heard of the title?Two love stories form subplots to the main story, which is one of a harsh and unfair commander (together with a brute also in charge of the stockade) and an unfairly victimised young bugler. There is a passionate and illicit love affair between a First Sergeant and the Commander's wife. Then there is an equally furtive liaison between the young bugler (in between beatings) and a 'hostess'. Using Hawaii as a backdrop, there is great contrast between the idyllic setting on one hand, and the vicious treatment of junior soldiers (not to mention the horrific bombing scenes) on the other. And some nice bugle playing.The merits of the film could be eulogised at greater length, but in the interests of balance and to reflect the concerns of modern audiences, two other aspects might be mentioned. At least they were things that stuck out quite horribly to me, so I am going to mention them.The first is the overwhelming portrait of drunkenness and brawling (according to reports, the first was common among some of the stars, not just the characters). There are many justifications, including the sufferings they were going through and the general tolerance of alcohol in American society. But what I found disconcerting (and still find disconcerting in many modern films featuring American soldiers, both fiction and documentary) is the toleration. If viewed through the lens of a society that doesn't embrace drunkenness (for instance Brasil, which is about the same size as America), it portrays a simplistic picture of American G.I.s as drunken louts. The datedness of the scenarios, although probably effective at the time, makes such obnoxious behaviour stand out all the more.The second thing that made me feel uncomfortable (though not to the same extent as the thoroughly awful modern film, Pearl Harbour) is the pervasive jingoism. America, it seems, can confront its own weakness in films about Vietnam (when the war was so obviously lost), but in 1953, as now, America was 'all perfect' and Japan was 'all evil'. It would be refreshing to see a film that embraced not only the inhumanity of Japanese attacking forces but acknowledged some of the background - the Washington-imposed oil-blockade of Japan that gave that small nation state the bleak choice of capitulation or war.From Here to Eternity is a great film. But it is perhaps little wonder why the excerpted clips are usually of Burt and Deborah on the beach rather than Sinatra falling about drunk. The realistic footage of unexpected bomb attacks however, probably deserves more acknowledgement.",

One is between Sergeant Warden (Burt Lancaster) and his Captain's wife, (Deborah Kerr); and the other between Private Prewitt (Montgomery Clift) and Lorene (Donna Reed) a prostitute in a private club.The affair between Kerr and Lancaster happens very quick in the film and they are soon rolling on that famous scene in the beach very much on their first proper date and soon after having their first big bust up.The film does have other cross cutting story lines such as Captain Holmes trying to force Prewitt to join the army boxing team, his friend Maggio's (Frank Sinatra) rivalry with Fatso and then the outbreak of the Japanese attack and the soldiers engaging in action.The film has fine black and white photography and strong performances from the leads especially Lancaster, Clift, Kerr and Philip Ober as Captain Holmes. Strangely I was not too enamoured with Sinatra and he won the best supporting actor Oscar for the role.The film actually does look rushed and also for a film set in Hawaii we see very few native Hawaiian characters in the movie, it might as well be any army base in the USA.However its an engaging melodrama even though you will kind of sense that this may not be a happy ever after tale.",

            "review_title": "Reel Look: 'From Here to Eternity'",
            "content": "\"A man should be what he can do.\" 'From Here to Eternity' (1953) embodies a whole new glimpse on U.S. history film all on its own. Shot in glorious black and white with a sharp, savvy screenplay and directed by the great Fred Zinnemann, (who had directed High Noon a year prior,) does this picture accurately capture the life of the soldiers that are stationed on the Schofield Barracks on the Hawaiian island of Oahu in late 1941? Let's take a look. Entering into the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor, thus beginning World War II and while waiting around on the island, it is revealed to the viewer the soldier's emotions of boredom and utter loneliness. The film stars many popular actors of the day. Montgomery Clift plays Private Robert E. Lee Prewitt, transferred to the barracks of Oahu. There, Captain Dana Holmes, played by Philip Ober, learns of his talent as a talented boxer and pressures him into joining a regimental boxing club in which Prewitt stubbornly rejects. 1st Sergeant Milton Warden, played by Burt Lancaster, agrees to change Prewitt's mind by making his life as difficult as possible. Prewitt is also supported by his friend Private Angelo Maggio throughout, played by Frank Sinatra.In discussing the history portrayed, it tells the viewer that it was designed to show a world that, even though tropical and lush, would soon unfold near the end into traumatic chaos and destruction. It was shown at a time just before the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor where young soldiers were sent off to be stationed far away, and not one of them really knew what was going to happen or what the next day would bring forth. World War II was indeed on the deadly brink of a surprise attack, and every American soldier knew that they had to be on their guard nonetheless.In prevailing attitudes/prejudices that were noticeable, one example would be the constant squabbling and rough-necking between Maggie and the bigoted Staff Sergeant James R. \"Fatso\" Judson, played by Ernest Borgine. One night, Prewitt and Maggio are in a bar and Maggio is so inebriated that, according to him, \"Fatso\" is playing the piano too loudly in the background. This ensues into Maggio and \"Fatso\" almost having at it in the middle of the bar, only to be broken up by Prewitt. But their bantering does not end there. Later on in the film, their disdain for each other unfolds into a knife fight in a back alley, in which Maggio winds up in the stockade by \"Fatso\" for antagonizing him. \"Fatso\" beats the new prisoner repeatedly until Maggio escapes to find Prewitt and then tells him of all the pain he has endured and then dies in his arms. Prewitt sets out to find \"Fatso\" and kills him in revenge with a knife fight, and Prewitt receives a sharp slash across the stomach in return. He is later shot by a sentry after coming out of hiding.In describing historical accuracy, it probably comes close as to where the soldiers and recruits are just marching or hanging out and enjoying the paradise around them. Many of them back then may as well have done that. However, the locations was a beautiful oasis, and the surprise attack neat the end of the film comes very close to an accurate depiction. The side-angles of the planes zooming in or overhead dropping bombs were amazing effects, as well as guns being fired by the soldiers and the loud explosions of shells going off everywhere on the island. The air once filled with a tropical breeze was now choked in the thick black smog of war. The time period itself was quite accurate too, even though it was twelve years after the actual event had occurred. And the barracks looked just like they would have that the soldiers were stationed in. Nonetheless, great accuracy and detail throughout the picture.My overall reaction towards this film is that it is one of Zinneman's best. His directorial persistence and settings in this film are as only he can do them. The film was indeed worth watching. Some parts were slow and mushy, including the famous love scene on the beach portrayed by Lancaster and Deborah Kerr laying on the sand as a wave crashes over them, to brutish as Maggio and \"Fatso\" duel it out with a knife fight at night in a black alley. The most action is near the end of the film with the famous surprise attack on Pearl Harbor itself, when air raid sirens are blaring and gun shots and explosions light up the tropical sky. It is, after all, a classic World War II movie masterpiece, with intriguing action, fight scenes, romance and explosions. How I reacted to the film as a moviegoer was for me, quite a unique experience. I really had no idea what I was in for. I actually felt the hardships and loneliness of the soldiers being stuck on the island, not knowing what would happen or when they would return home. I also felt the horrors of the surprise attack when the bombs where booming and the blood was flowing. All in all, a great movie experience.'From Here to Eternity' was one of the greatest films on U.S. history that I had the privilege of viewing. I thoroughly enjoyed the plot, the actors and actresses and the beautiful settings portrayed, filled with action, flair and horrific atrocities and aftermath of war. The film had thirteen nominations and won eight Academy Awards. Every detail and precision in this film paid off magnificently. A film unique among films, this truly is a must-see for all U.S. history film buffs or for anyone who wants to experience the same pleasure and gratification I had personally gained from watching this wonderful classic motion picture about friendships, romance and war, thanks to Mr. Zinneman and Mr. James Jones novel-turned-feature as well.",

Gosh, I felt like I was going to burn in H-E-double hockey sticks for that if I didn't get that out. :D Sorry, I just always talk about in the first paragraph how I came across the movie, so that's the story. But anywho, I just finished From Here to Eternity, the timeless classic that was before An Officer and a Gentleman and I have to say that I really did enjoy this movie.A private, played by Cliff, is brutally treated badly by his army crew since he refuses to fight, boxing, for them. He falls in love with this hired lady to entertain the army men and she falls for him, finding herself in jeopardy of her job with an AWOL private who is now on the run for murder! Also, the second in command chief is falling for the captain's distressed wife and they have a very steamy affair that they find themselves getting deeper and deeper into trouble with.From Here to Eternity was such a great film for the simple fact of how honest it was. I was thinking about film classics today when a friend and I were discussing it and I mentioned how they are so different from today's films, they seem so acted, but not over done, and they were never ashamed. They did the best they could and these films were made to be good, not to make money or get famous. That's what makes From Here to Eternity a great film to watch, we need more films like this today! 8/10",

Great excuse !\nIt is amazing how many scenes involved drinking . No wonder they weren't ready for the Japanese!The most famous scene is the one with Burt Lancaster and Deborah Kerr rolling around on the beach . Very controversial at the time but it looks tame now and I have to say not very well filmed , especially because of the bad lighting .Although I appreciate the significance of this film I think it hasn't aged brilliantly but that's not to say I didn't enjoy it .10 likes",

            "content": "There are a bunch of stories all going on at the same time in From Here to Eternity. It becomes overwhelming at times trying to take it all in at once. It's not that I was confused, or didn't follow any of the stories, because I thought they were all told well. In fact, I think most of this stuff comes together at the end to make a good cohesive film. However, when we're bouncing around getting snippets of each character's story, I started to feel overloaded with the drama and desired a bit more focus. I do think, now that I see how it all links up in the end, I might enjoy it more on a second watch. This is a well-told story, and I have a feeling the novel might be even better because the author would have more pages to tell each story that the director had to condense into 2 hours of film.The cast of From Here to Eternity is amazing. I was particularly impressed with Montgomery Clift. He brings a lot of heart to the film, and has a challenging part to play. I totally connected with his emotional journey as he resisted the pressure to go back to boxing, even when it meant he would have to endure punishment and ridicule. His choices later in the film all made sense to me, because of this difficult journey. I also thought Frank Sinatra's subplot opposing Ernest Borgnine was powerful. Surprisingly, the romance between Burt Lancaster and Deborah Kerr that leads to the most famous scene in the film, was probably the least interesting aspect to me. Before going in, I thought the entire movie was going to be about them, and by the end I found their story underwhelming. However, it's hard to point to one thing that I found bad about From Here to Eternity. It's a high-quality film, and I think over time it will go up in my estimation. I can certainly see why others love it.",

A realistic portrayal of a soldier's life, with an emphasis on two romantic relationships and a stubborn soldier that is irresistibly reminiscent of the protagonist of the 1967 movie \"Cool Hand Luke\". The film won eight Oscars out of thirteen nominations. The Academy Award for Best Black and White Cinematography seems to me deserved, and even the Oscars for sound and the best supporting role that went into Frank Sinatra's hands, but thirteen nominations is really too much. I wonder what the competition was like if this was the best movie that year. On the other hand, I may not be able to look at it objectively because I have a big problem connecting with characters like these. Similar to Japanese films, where the cultural gap is almost insurmountable to me, the military mentality is so alien to me that their perspective on things, their motivation, and decisions, seems totally illogical and even sick, so I am not able to sympathize with them and for the most of the movie I was thinking - God, what a moron, no normal person would do this. Because of this, the end of the film was not distressing to me but rather irritating and, although I cannot say that I did not like the movie, it did not leave a particularly strong impression, so I give it one extremely subjective seven.7/10",

It is quite potent stuff, especially towards the end, and the acting is superb from all the main players, with Montgomery Clift and Oscar winner Frank Sinatra in memorably powerful roles.

This man is ready to take anything or anyone on.Frank Sinatra, as Maggio, is also anti-hero. Both of our friends are in one scrap after another.Deborah Kerr is unhappily married and begins a relationship with Commander Burt Lancaster. Their steamy scene on the beach is absolutely memorable, quite controversial for 1953.Then, of course, there is Donna Reed, who as Clift's girl friend, was named best supporting actress of the year. With the bombing of Pearl Harbor, Clift, who had gone AWOL, wants to return to his unit. Reed utters those immortal words: \"What did the army ever do for you?\" Of course, he returns and is promptly shot. Everyone on the base is naturally upset after the bombing-it's shoot first and ask questions later.The film basically concerns itself with an army unit boxing tournament. One of our heroes will not box for his unit and as a result suffers for it. Of course, it is Deborah Kerr's miserable husband who gives the guy an awful a lot of problems for refusing to do so. An investigation after the Pearl Harbor bombing will drive him from the service.Sinatra, in his best supporting Oscar performance, fights with a bull-dog played viciously by Ernest Borgnine. When Sinatra winds up later in the stockade, Borgnine is in charge and beats Sinatra to death. Clift responds to this by stabbing Borgnine to death in a back alley. That's when he became AWOL.It is amazing that this anti-war, anti-army film was voted for best picture. Sure, it deserved the award but we're talking about 1953-the McCarthy era. Belated congratulations to the Motion Picture Academy for their fine choice which probably irked McCarthy. This film was certainly one of the best anti-war films ever made. It really delved into the military pointing out a very ugly side of it. The picture received 5 acting nominations, Lancaster, Clift, Kerr, Sinatra and Reed.",

The literary title seems ill-suited to the pettiness of much of the storyline and it fails to resonate even in the final fate of it's chief character, Prewitt (Montgomery Clift), which seems tagged on and unnecessary, like an alternative ending.Soldiers patronise their officers and chase their wives, squabble amongst themselves, even murder each other over trivial issues that assume life and death importance under the pressure-cooker lid of army life. It's a nasty world of philandering, drunkenness, ineptitude, vanity, and boorishness. The women put the uniformed clowns into context, rejecting them for their inadequacy and their soldier-ant careers. The film pushes away at the edges of the Hays Code (Deborah Kerr really checks out Burt Lancaster as he's getting undressed \u0096 but you can't prevent people going for a swim) - but just when you think the film is doing an admirable job of showing the seamy side of humanity and building up to something powerful, it backs down as the boys predictably turn into heroes during the Pearl Harbor attack.The main theme, the hard-head holding out against authority, is the same as in Zinneman's A Man For All Seasons, another film full of squabbling men with a downbeat ending. Clift and Sinatra (drunk much of the time) are outstanding, but the film belongs to Lancaster, bull-necked, angular as a piece of origami, who somehow manages to square uprightness and corruption, solidity and fallibility, and stands astride the rank and ruck of lesser men like a colossus.

As I grow older, now a veteran myself, and having grown up in the post wars years following world war two, the film is especially meaningful to me. I was born a scant four months after the bombing of Pearl Harbor, and grew up around the veterans of that war. Having worn the uniform in my 20's, I watch that opening scene when Prewitt reports to his new Company, and the sounds he hears, that we hear, like the door closing on the barracks and the hollow echo that it makes from inside, takes me back to my squadron compound, and the years I spent in service. Some of those old WW11 barracks where still in use on some of the bases where I spent time. There is no other experience like it, especially in a time of war. Once you have worn the uniform, you never really take it off. As a longtime fan of movies, I saw this one when it first appeared in theaters, and the only qualm that I had about the film is the final scene, that I didn't fully understand at age 10, and have wondered about ever since. Something, not sure what, seemed a bit odd to me about Donna Reed's remarks aboard ship as she and Deborah Kerr are leaving the island, when she tells Deborah something that is untrue. The scene had its intended effect, but I never quite understood why she had chosen to make up that story. The only motive seemed out of character for her. A black and white masterpiece, that is a must see for any fan of classic films.",

It's how you think Sinatra might have been had he actually been in the Army back then for real. The final scene on the boat with Deborah Kerr and Donna Reed is very poignant. Both have major regrets, but for such different reasons. Even in her grief, Lorene talks up Prewitt's military role and the cause of his death, demonstrating her real feelings for the man.

This movie is just not the best example of the greatness that the genre has to offer. And from a movie that won 8 Oscar's, including the one for best picture, you are of course expecting this.Thing with this movie was, was that it was feeling a bit incomplete to me. Not all stories reached a satisfying enough conclusion for my taste and the movie could had focused a bit better and more deep on certain issues handled in this movie. It's a melodramatic movie, with also some love stories thrown into it, against the backdrop of Pearl Harbour. It still of course beats the Micheal Bay movie by a long-shot but it's silly to compare both these movies really, since they are so much different in style and its goals.Still I liked the story and movie for not being as formulaic as you would expect. No everybody ends up-, or gets what you expect. Because the movie is not really predictable, the drama also all works out better.The movie is not as epic as it might sound, fore it got made for a fairly low budget and got shot in only 41 days. It's more a movie that still feels and looks epic due to its many different dramatic plot-lines and characters.It's a movie with some well known actors in it, like Burt Lancaster, Montgomery Clift, Deborah Kerr, Donna Reed and Ernest Borgnine, who is still alive and active in the business. It also has a really out of place Frank Sinatra in it, who tried to give his career another boost with this movie, with a more serious and demanding role. Amazingly enough he even won an Oscar for it. The only one he would get for his acting during his long career. To me he still seemed like the weakest actor in this movie.A great movie to watch but worth 8 Oscar's?

Army, is within the conflicted souls of its four main characters so well portrayed by Kerr, Clift, Lancaster and Reed. Notice I left out Frankie S. That's because he hams it up in ways both understandable (obviously the guy was desperate to revive a flagging career) and supremely annoying (his drunken schtick). Of course the academy loves a comeback story so they gave him an undeserved Oscar which should have waited for \"Man With A Golden Arm\". But enough about the Hoboken egomaniac. Everyone else is good in this film that is perhaps too long but doesn't feel it. And isn't that another reason to extol it? B plus. PS...Yeah, that's Superman on the cutting room floor. Too bad.

Company politics, love affairs, drunkenness, grudges--it's not that it's boring, because it's actually pretty effective drama. But it does seem petty given the impending disaster. I kept returning to the same thought--\"This is very good, but not all-time great.\"Ultimately, though, the point becomes clear. This is not a story about war at all, but about people. It does not treat Pearl Harbor as a monolithic tragedy, but rather a myriad of little individual tragedies, forgotten by history but no less significant.The time spent on character development pays off. The film's final act is deeply moving, and communicates a profound and lasting statement about war. I was wrong--it IS an all-time great film, and one of the best examples of how a film can be more than the sum of its parts.It's well-documented, also, that this is one of the great casts of all time.Oscar nominees Montgomery Clift and Burt Lancaster are superb in their leading roles as apparent opposites--the rebel and the good soldier--who turn out to be kindred spirits. The young and gangly Frank Sinatra is funny and bursting with energetic charisma in his Oscar-winning character role, and Donna Reed (another Oscar-winner) shows us some stunning moments of desperation and passion.

            "content": "This movie is clearly one of the highlights of the 1950s, a confident exercise in popular art. Everybody associated with the picture did a great job, but I do have some misgivings.Probably inherent with the problem of reducing 900 pages of text to two or so hours, the film's pace is relentlessly fast. It's one of the few movies I can think of that could have used an extra 10-15 minutes to linger on key scenes and set up suspense. The famous beach scene goes by far too quickly. Even Sid Caesar and Imogene Coca had more time to get wetter in their Your Show of Shows parody. I also think that they should have spent a little more time setting up a peaceful, partly hung-over Saturday night/Sunday Morning before the Japanese attacked.The against-type casting is justly celebrated for this movie, but are are some risks that didn't work out. I do think Deborah Kerr was a bit lost in her part. Nothing to do with her sexual persona, but the difficulties of playing an American and the impossibility of fully understanding the social milieu of American officers and wives. Kerr was very far from awful, but I sensed a tentativeness.I'm really going to step into it by saying that Montgomery Clift was wrong for Prewitt. Just too pretty and sensitive to be both someone whose last resort in the 1930s was to join the Army or be a boxer. Robert Ryan comes to mind as a more convincing choice--just as sensitive and ethically torn, but more convincingly proletarian.Donna Reed is great here, but I think the script let her down. The final scene between her and Kerr on the Lurline comes off as a misfired plot twist. Reed revealing herself as a fantasist going home to reinvent herself yet again inspires more \"WTF?\" than \"Ah Ha!\" I think there could have been slightly better set up earlier on with regard to the gap between her working life at the Congress Club and her almost college girl domestic setup bridged by her impressive powers of denial.Technically, the Pearl Harbor attack was marred by insertion of some obvious file footage and I also winced when the camera lingered a second on a calendar marked \"December 6.\" The best things in the movie are the cinematography, Ernest Borgnine, Burt Lancaster, and Philip Ober as the disgusting Captain Holmes. A real career-killer of a role. One of the things I've complained about is the movie's main strength: The script that strips down the novel to a censor-safe two hours. The audience knows what the Congress Club is about and that everyone wears their birthday swimsuit under their clothes at all times. Far more artful to deftly imply these things than make them obvious.Still, a wonderful movie.",

It puts the lives of a group of soldiers, all far from perfect, as well as two love stories into the backdrop of the year leading up to the attack on Pearl Harbor. Lives are torn apart not only by conflicting desires, but by this big moment of history which looms for most of the film, giving it an epic feeling.The cast is fantastic, and very deep. Deborah Kerr, Donna Reed, Montgomery Clift, Burt Lancaster, Frank Sinatra, Ernest Borgnine, and several others in supporting roles, my god. Clift is the strongest actor in the group, such a natural, and in that first wave of method actors that included Marlon Brando and James Dean. Lancaster is perfectly cast, with that frame and jawline of his, and he delivers a very strong performance too. I also liked how Kerr and Reed were cast counter to their usual types.The film critiques the Army, and at a pretty surprising time - not so long after WWII, and during the period of McCarthyism and the Red Scare. The commanding officer has a new solder (Clift) hazed because he doesn't want to fight for the regiment's boxing team. The men carouse heavily, getting drunk and visiting hostess bars (a Code-required softening of the brothels that they actually are). A couple of them go AWOL, to their own peril. The sergeant in charge of the stockade (Borgnine) is sinister and administers cruel beatings in retribution for past arguments. The love interests that form - a sergeant (Lancaster) for his commanding officer's wife (Kerr), and a soldier (Clift) for a prostitute (Reed) - are far from innocent. And yet these are the people who will rally when the country is attacked.There is a vision of a generation being presented here, and at its heart is a scrappy toughness. Clift is mentally very strong as he takes the abuse, but sticks to his principles (he doesn't want to box anymore because he blinded someone in the ring once). We don't see this on the screen, but we're told that Sinatra takes repeated beatings and responds by spitting in Borgnine's face each time. Lancaster sticks up for his men in bar fights, and is the epitome of the perfect Army man - intelligent, resourceful, and managing upwards as well as commanding downwards. All of them drink heavily. Kerr calls her husband out for his adultery, sleeps separately from him, and goes out and has an affair of her own. Reed moved to Hawaii from Oregon on her own to make enough money to return and settle down, and even here we see shrewdness and courage. All of these characters have an edge to them. \"Gimme a nail,\" Sinatra says, asking for a cigarette, referring to a nail in the coffin because of the dangers of smoking. \"Ain't you ever seen a dead man?\" barks Lancaster to a group of his soldiers, and of course, to many of this generation, they had. In aggregate I think there is a sense of pride on display, even in the face of the flaws of the Army and these characters, but it seems on the whole honest to me. It was a time when heroes rose to the occasion, but the film does not sugar coat them as people.Unfortunately, the treatment of women isn't always exemplary, despite Kerr standing up to her husband. That famous beach scene segues to Lancaster jealously questioning her about her past lovers, and the double standard is soon on full display. In a smaller scene, the men ogle and comment about a waitress (Moana Gleason, who is one of very few Hawaiian actors in the cast, and even this role is teeny).Despite the production code, the film gives us plenty of edgy material, most notably the adultery and abuses of the military. At the same time, quite a bit of the original novel was excised: the abuse toned down, profanity removed, prostitutes being transformed into hostesses, and the real reason for the commanding officer's wife not being able to conceive again altered. I didn't really have a problem with any of that. The biggest issue was with changes made to the ultimate fate of the commanding officer, which was unfortunate but not something that derailed the film.The film may seem to wander a bit while director Fred Zinnemann advances the various story lines, but it never lags. There are lots of very good scenes and memorable moments. Clift dolefully playing taps to the company at night. The calendar being revealed in the background, when we may have lost track of or be unaware of what's coming (as I was, long ago, when I first saw the film). Sinatra rolling a pair of olives at the bar as if they were dice. And Lancaster and Kerr's comments to one another when they realize the limits of their affair, despite the passion they share: \"I have never been as miserable as I am since I met you, he says, and she replies, \"Neither have I.\" \"I wouldn't trade a minute of it,\" he says, and she agrees, \"Neither would I.\"Great film, and as a side note, if you ever get a chance, I recommend venturing down to the beach at Halona Cove on Oahu. It's well worth re-imagining those moments from the film's most famous scene, and climbing on the rocks we see in the background.",

            "review_title": "So long as there are men...",
            "content": "That's the translation of the French title, and I like it. So long as there are men ... there will be wars, and lives and loves torn apart......so long as these things are, there will be the stuff that makes such movies as \"From Here to Eternity\". And getting back to the original title, in anything is to be deemed eternal in \"From Here to Eternity\" it is without a doubt Burt Lancaster and Deborah Kerr's intense and passionate kiss on a Hawaiian beach.Sure there have been kisses in movies before, remember Rhett and Scarlett's shadows getting closer while war painted the background in bright tones of orange and yellow, a passion burning like the city of Atlanta... yet \"From Here to Eternity\" surpasses that kiss thanks to two last-minute strikes of genius, earning the film its ticket to immortality : they kiss each other horizontally, lying on the wet sand, and like fire in \"Gone with the Wind\", natural elements interfere through the wave hitting the couple, the little touch to be parodied zillion times. It's not romantic love but nature in motion, sheer passion: he loves women...\n...and she loves men.... and that's that.I knew it would be impossible not to mention this scene, but there is more in what makes the film such an endearing classic, even more to be compared with \"Gone With the Wind\" as it was the first film to equal its record of 8 Academy Awards, including Best Picture. But this isn't any Best Picture winner, the film has a strange capability to please your eyes without trying hard, to challenge your thoughts without being intellectual, to touch your heart without being sentimental and to be erotic by only suggesting... it's a fascinating and insightful gallery of character studies disguised as entertainment or what some would call War movie or Romance.But there isn't much war in \"From Here to Eternity\" and not much romance,\nthe idyll on the beach was so iconic everyone forgot that it was followed by an argument less than a minute after. After the wave-kiss, they'd never have an opportunity to be so physically and passionately in love, for there is an obstacle called duty. And there isn't much war either, only when the film culminates with the Pearl Harbor attacks that the second romance between Montgomery Clift and Donna Reed (playing a prostitute) gets overly melodramatic. By the time the film becomes more Hollywood-like, it's over, women left and wept, men died and others got ready to it.And that sad irony is what the film carries deeply in its core, thanks to a magnificent script adapted by Daniel Taradash from James Jones' novel, it is poetically summed up in Lancaster's farewell line to a dead Clift \"You couldn't play it smart\". As Private Robert E. Lee Prewitt, Clift played a stubborn soldier who refused to box for his platoon because of a tragic accident, for much of Captain Holmes' displeasure who pulled the strings to get his middleweight champion. Retrospectively, boxing would have spared him months of humiliations, harassment, and so non-military treatment... without the championship even happening at the end. Well, no one saw Pearl Harbor coming.Basically, Prew was torn between his status as a soldier and his moral independence and ironically (again), that's what earned him the respect of Sgt. Warden (Lancaster) who could recognize a great soldier if he saw one. Prew represents this kind of lone wolves cherished by the director Fred Zinneman, the likes of Will Kane or Sir Thomas More. And Clift gives an intense performance as hard-nosed Prew, his piercing look threatened more than his body and defied anyone to shaken his integrity. Speaking of which I'm glad Zinneman gave the example by not surrendering to Harry Cohn's initial choices including Rita Hayworth, William Holden and Eli Wallach.But Lancaster was the only choice they first agreed on and he couldn't have been more perfectly casted. Indeed, Warden is not your typical Sergeant, if anything, nothing is typical in the film, he's quite easygoing, getting away from every situation with his killer smile and a charisma working with both men and ladies and he's enjoying his office work without minding playing the assistant for a less competent hierarchical superior. But he falls in love with his boss' wife and only becoming an officer can solve his dilemma. But like Prew, he feels his duty is to serve the Army and not even love can change that. Even Warden is incapable to 'play it smart', because it's not about being smart, but simply about being true to your personality.Only women are capable of changing. Kerr as Karen was a honorable woman turning into the Army 'obligee', while Alma was a prostitute trying to become honorable, the film is a successful of fascinating contradictions, even more delightful because many actors played against types, Kerr, more used to sophisticated and distinguished ladies play a repressed nymphomaniac while Donna Reed was the eternal Mary from \"It's a Wonderful Life\" (she won the Oscar for that role) And how about Frank Sinatra who accepted to be underpaid to get the part (no horse-head behind a deserved Oscar) and good old Marty (Ernest Borgnine) the villainous Fatso Hudson (Ernest Borgnine).But aren't we all against-type players? Isn't the conflict between duty and personality, the real war in the film? But you can't force people to be what they aren't and love be damned if it ever meant compromising, and this is why by the end, those who played it square didn't necessarily win the game. Neither the others, but only because the film had to sugarcoat some elements from the original novel to please the censors and the Army. Still, with such great performances (nominated in four acting categories), an intelligent script and an unforgettable kiss......well, the title says it all.",

Lee Prewitt, Montgomery Cliff, or \"Prew\" as he's called is really in for it, the business, in his refusing to take part in the regimental boxing championship that's slated for December 15, 1941. Prew has become very mild mannered, instead of violent, after blinding his army buddy Dixie Wells in a sparring match and has given up using his fists in and out of the boxing ring! This has his company commander Capt. Dana Holmes, Philip Ober, have his men use a little persuasion to get Prew back in the ring by making his life miserable while he's there!While this is going on Prew's top sergeant Sgt. Milt Warden, Burt Lancaster, has been keeping an eye on Capt. Holmes' old lady, or wife, the sexy Karen Holmes, Deborah Kerr, who with her being on the outs with him, after she caught Captain Holmes with another woman, is looking for action and tries to find it with the many men stationed at the the Schofield Barracks US Army military base.Prew gets to find love at the local whorehouse in town, appropriately called the New Congress Club, with Lorene Burke, Donna Reed, whom he mistakes for a normal All-American working girl from the state of Oregon instead of a hooker! You would think that Prew was smart enough, in being an army man for five years, to be able to see the difference! Thrown into the mix is the outfit's #1 screw up Pvt. Angelo Maggio,that's Maggio without the \"D\" in front, who knew Prew back at Fort Shafter where he was the company bugler. As the US moves towards war in the Pacific things get really spicy as well as dangerous for all the major characters in the film. Sgt.Warden and Karen have a hot and heavy love affair and Maggio in getting drunk and AWOL on guard duty ends up in the brig that's run by the sadistic Sgt. Fatso Judsdon, Ernest Borgnine, who's got it in for him big time! Prew meanwhile lose his ability to turn the other cheek when Captain Holmes has his boys push the poor guy to the brink and ends up wiping the floor with his #1 goon Sgt. Galovitch, John Dennis, who asked for and really got it from the former confirmed US Army pacifist. After getting his clock cleaned by the hard hitting Prew Sgt. Galovitch was busted down to private and put in charge, a fitting Job for the butt-kissing sergeant, of the company latrine. As for Galovitch's boss Captain Holmes he got canned out of the US Army for conduct unbecoming an officer or even enlisted man!***SPOILERS*** What really saves the movie is the Japanese sneak attack on Peral Harbor since up until then, with the exception of the Sgt. Warden & Karen Holmes sizzling surf side love scene, it was really going nowhere and nowhere fast. We had a few knife fights and a person beaten to death, off camera, as well as Prew getting his act together but by then, with the US at war, it didn't help him that much by him refusing an order for him to advance and be recognized! As for the women in the film Karen & Lorene they checked out of Hawaii never to return again in all the hurt and suffering they went through in them both being there.P.S Check out George \"Superman\" Reeves as US Army Sgt. Maylon Stark as one of Karens lovers back in the states, Fort Bliss Texas, who fills in a very much in love with her as well as very naive Sgt.Warden in just what he's in for by fooling around with the man hungry and sex starved Karen Holmes!",

Even if I just watch the movie to see his very strong personality and body movements it would be worth the time. He was such an unusual and interesting actor.Some of why the movie doesn't draw a higher score from me is because the pace of movies has sped up over the years, making this one seem slow. Also older movies tend to have a lot more dialog than new ones; whether that is good or not is subjective. But I find this movie lacked action.The morals of this movie must have stunned audiences back in 1953; perhaps that is what made it such a big hit.All in all it's still worth a watch.",

Other salient performances are Philip Ober as Captain Holmes,the antithesis of military leadership,and Montegomery Clift,an early method actor,playing the undrdog,a perrenial loser. As to the famous beach scene,I tried to analyze where its power and intensity come from.I believe it is an example of superb directing,using the viewers prior knowledge of plot and characters,with the beach scene being the tip of an emotional iceberg,possibly similar to Alfred Hitchcock's approach toward thrill.

World War II was over and the prosperous 50's was beginning but people recognized the importance of the War and how it had changed the world. This is a war movie and a romance all in one. It made stars out of all its principal actors - Montgomery Clift, Debora Karr and Burt Lancaster, each of who contribute strong and memorable performances. This type of film was actually very innovative and new for its time. Rather than being a straightforward, predictable war drama/love story, there are layers of complex psychological drama as well. This is mainly because it was drawn from a literary novel by James Jones, although the novel was more popular fiction than anything else. At this time, novels concerning World War II was big. Furthermore, the Korean War was raging. War was a big subject in film. For a man's film (and it is a man's film too), there is lots of talking and emotional aspects. Long before \"An Officer And A Gentleman\" (this film may have inspired that one), this movie deals with the problem of a soldier being romantically involved with his commanding officer's wife. Montgomery Clift woos Debora Karr, though with some difficulty before they fall in love, World War II rages on and for all the characters, the possibility that they won't see each other again looms big. This is a long but worthwhile movie, especially because it's such a classic. The love scene between Burt Lancaster and Donna Reed by the beach as the ocean waves surround them was rather provocative and overly passionate for its time, but it is one of Hollywood's most memorable movie scenes. Donna Reed would later become known for her \"Donna Reed Show\" in which she plays a sweet, suburban 50's housewife. Frank Sinatra is in the film for fans of the late great singer and this film, to top everything off, won Best Picture that year. This film is still a classic so many years later and a sample of 50's cinema and the direction it was heading toward. Overall, this is a powerful piece of cinema and an eternal classic.",

Corruption, hatred, envy, alcoholism and prostitution does one wonder if these soldiers need an enemy at all.Director Fred Zinnemann turned this uncomfortable message into a successful film. He did so by removing the sharp edges without affecting the essence. A drinking party becomes a pleasant evening off and a prostitute becomes a lady companion.Of course the all star casting with Burt Lancaster, Montgomery Clift, Deborak Kerr, Donna Reed and Frank Sinatra didn't hurt either.Talking about filing away the sharp edges, the famous love making of Burt Lancaster and Deborah Kerr on the beach is spicy enough. It's a wonder that these scene survived the censor at that time.One of the main characters of the film is soldier Prewitt (Montgomery Clift). He once was a boxer and the commander of the military camp hopes his achievements in the sports team will give his base additional status. It is therefore a big disappointment when it turns out that Prewitt doesn't box anymore. Attributing this to cowardice Prewitt becomes the victim of countless harassments, belittlements and humiliations. In fact he quit boxing because of feelings of guilt after he had permanently injured an opponent. The story of Prewitt is very similar to that of Sean Thornton (John Wayne) in \"The quit man\" (1952, John Ford).",

There's a company commander who has lost interest in his wife and goes a-philandering at every opportunity. Meantime, his wife - surrounded by any amount of available masculinity - does likewise. She opts for his top sergeant on this occasion. There's a new transfer to his company who is a bugler and capable boxer, but who has forsworn boxing on account of blinding his friend in the past. He won't box for the company, so his CO decides to give him grief. Whilst on leave he gets the hots for a sort of club-hostess down town. Meantime his friend makes an enemy of the stockade sergeant, only to get thrown in the stockade. That's about it.I don't mean to trivialise it. Crikey; this movie won 8 Oscars including Best Picture for 1953. There's a top-drawer cast of the day including Burt Lancaster, Frank Sinatra and Deborah Kerr. They all play their parts to perfection. It's just that the minutiae of US military life has never interested me at all, and neither has (other people's) sexual infidelity. Every character takes themselves far too seriously for my tastes. I wouldn't have fitted in to their lifestyles at all. But Zinnemann gives us a very believable, claustrophobic presentation of the pettiness and triviality of human endeavour, and non of it is particularly flattering.It's Hawaii. And it's set as a prelude to the attack on Pearl harbour. The attack comes. We see about 4 planes fly over. That's about it. And that's what I mean about pettiness & trivia; the most outrageous sneak attack in modern history that led to thousands of American casualties and the loss of all the capital ships of USA's Pacific fleet (less aircraft carriers) is little more than a footnote in a movie that both agonises and luxuriates about desire & adultery for over an hour and a half. The priorities seem confused.Still; you pays yer money and takes yer choice. It's a magnificent movie about the littleness of human purpose. And it ain't my scene.",

            "content": "Before watching From Here to Eternity, I thought I was getting an action film set in Pearl Harbor when the Japanese attacked. Instead, I got a romance drama with the aforementioned event in the backdrop. Despite that \"disappointment,\" Fred Zinnemann's wartime epic is a well-acted film which also has one of the most famous love scenes of all time. Maybe the script does not hold up very well and the dialogue is quite cringy, but this is still one picture worth watching. It was nominated for thirteen Academy Awards and won eight of them including Best Picture.This film is based off a controversial novel written by James Jones. Jones's novel was very provocative, especially for the time period it was published. In order for Daniel Taradash's script to be approved by the censors and the Army, it had to undergo some major changes. For example, the book has venereal diseases as an issue for bad marriage. You might recall the scenes between Maggio and Fatso, who was in charge of the jail? The book portrayed extreme violence between the two, violence that was only mentioned in passing during the film. When it comes to film history, the changes made is why this film is well-known. It is a little surprising how effective the movie was considering the changes that were deemed necessary to make. Still, the Army and the Navy banned this movie from being shown to their soldiers. They hated the Army's depiction in the book...and the movie. They originally did have the Army's support since training material, the ability to film at Schofield Base, and the use of Pearl Harbor stock footage was needed.Fred Zinnemann (A Man for All Seasons) was in the director's chair. He decided to cast actors that were against type, a very risky decision considering when the film was made. It worked out very well because his five main actors went on to be nominated and even win the big awards. Zinnemann himself worked very well with his actors.It is 1941, and the world is at war, with the exception of the United States. Although Japan has other things on their mind. Robert E. Lee Prewitt (Montgomery Clift) has been transferred to Schofield Air Base in Hawaii. Captain Holmes (Philip Ober) requested Prewitt because of his exceptional track record in boxing and could use his talent in the boxing tournament. Prewitt declines, and that allows Holmes to make Prewitt's life miserable. Holmes's second-in-command, Sgt. Milton Warden (Burt Lancaster) wants to be transferred away from his outfit but falls in love with Holmes's wife, Karen (Deborah Kerr). Prewitt's friend, Maggio (Frank Sinatra) has troubles with the stockade sergeant, Fatso (Ernest Borgnine). Prewitt also falls in love with one of the local girls, Lorene (Donna Reed) who works at a social club. Little do they know that their problems are minor compared to what is about to happen.The reason to watch this is because of the acting display given to us. Every actor did an absolutely fantastic job. The standout is Frank Sinatra as the violent, drunk friend of Prewitt's, Maggio. Unlike the book, his character is given depth. This role also rescued Sinatra's career. Rumors were abound that he only received this role because of his alleged ties with the mafia. Montgomery Clift is known for playing sensitive characters, so is his role here a surprise? Burt Lancaster and Deborah Kerr radiated intensive chemistry with each other. Zinnemann did not even want Kerr, but eventually was won over. Like most of the actors, she was casted against type and knocked it out of the park. Donna Reed won an Academy Award for her performance as Lorene, and she deserved it. Borgnine and Jack Warden have smaller roles, but they are good. In short, this movie is an acting tour-de-force. And yes, Lancaster was amazing as usual.I did not get the war film I was expecting, as I quickly discovered that From Here to Eternity is a melodrama, perhaps a bit outdated. Any thing that happens with Pearl Harbor is towards the very end. Before that, the actors interact and socialize with each other and that makes good viewing. I knew about the romantic scene with Lancaster and Kerr on the beach and it did not disappoint. If you want to hear a lovely blues song, there is a good one to listen to here. Not the best screenplay (in modern terms), but everything makes up for it especially those performances.My Grade: B+",

They might have considered James Dean or Paul Newman for the role of Prewitt.I don't care if Sinatra did win the BSAA for Maggio. He, not only was too old but, he was hammy. I'd have liked to have seen Tony Curtis or maybe John Derek in the role.Lancaster WAS 1st Sgt. Warden and kudos to Ernest Borgnine as \"Fatso Judson.\" Deborah Kerr, Donna Reed and all the rest of the actors were well cast and did superb jobs.The film depicts our prewar army with reality.

            "content": "Whereas the film is fun to watch on its own merits, it begs going back and reading the book if it can be got hold of nowadays. (December 2016 is when I type this review.) I have a number of questions, not the least of which is, where are the other officers in captain Holmes' company? A company was (and still is) composed of a number of platoons (three in those days; I thin that still holds true today) each led by a second lieutenant. Whether or not a fourth, 'heavy weapons' platoon (with mortars and machine guns) was also included, I don't know. I have it on good information that by July 1943 an infantry rifle company n the U.S. Army had six officers and one hundred and eighty-seven enlisted men; I'm not sure about the order-of-battle strength as of the 1941 Table of Organization. I also know that the 1943 company did in fact have a heavy weapons platoon, but that's really neither here nor there; the point is, there should have been a number of lieutenants in the company, one or more of which might not have approved of what the non-coms were doing in order to get Prewitt to box. That might have generated more conflict between Holmes, these officers, and the non-coms in question. It would become a conflict of the captain and the non-coms against Prewitt and the Lieutenants, with Warden caught in the middle. How's that sound? Other than that, the movies is always a good watch, but like I said above, it makes yo want to go back and read the book. The same holds true for the Harry Potter films and any other film based on a book. That way, you're never in the dark about what characters might be thinking. You also get to see what was left out of the film and, in this case, what all the fuss was about.Every character has his 'character merits', but Warden, the consummate professional staff enlisted man, is my favorite. It's guys like that who make the army run smoothly from day to day. I also like the way he takes charge as the Japanese air strike unfolds. Prewitt was right; he would have made a good officer.",

            "content": "I have the greatest admiration for Director Fred Zinnemann. Some of his films rank among the best I have ever watched, including HIGH NOON, NUN'S STORY, A MAN FOR ALL SEASONS, THE SEVENTH CROSS, THE MEN - but he falls well short of his best in FROM HERE TO ETERNITY.Burt Lancaster makes the best of a contradictory character who serves the Army to the best of his ability but goes right along with his captain's misuse of army time, and unbecoming conduct in forcing private Prewitt to become part of the platoon's boxing team against his will, all for the purpose of securing a promotion.Lancaster shows even more the instability and weakness at the core of his character when he gives up on the officer's course which would give him the woman he loves. He has hit the ceiling as sergeant and won't go above that. During the attack on Pearl Harbor, he shows that he can lead men but clearly he does not sufficiently in himself to become a leader.Given the moral code of the 1950s, I take my hat off to British actress Kerr's courage in accepting this ignominious role of cheating wife of a camp's commander. Yes, she lost a baby because of her hubby's cheating but somehow that does nothing for her character's appeal - which is further reduced at the end when she ditches the man she supposedly loves just because he won't take an officer's course and she won't go down below officer, She will not be a mere sergeant's wife. One other negative note: rain's pouring, it's December, can't be hot but she's wearing very revealing shorts while hubby is away.Kerr really was very brave to play this selfish and oppotunistic female. I doubt that any major US actress at the time would have done it, for fear of soiling her screen reputation.Monty Clift provides the best performance in the movie but only until he is involved in a fistfight. At that point, it becomes very clear that Clift knew nothing about boxing, you can tell that a double boxes on his behalf - and that hurts his character's credibility. Plus the way he goes AWOL and then stupidly dies.\nSadly, those minuses undermine Clift's otherwise superior performance - and even more sadly it would appear that he developed a drinking problem in this shoot that would stay with him and be the root cause of the car accident in 1956 that disfigured him and pretty much ended his career. He kind of reprised the role of Prewitt in YOUNG LIONS, taking another massing beating from boot camp colleagues in that flick.Frank Sinatra and Donna Reed deservedly won their supporting Oscars in this film. Like Kerr's character, Reed's Lorene has strange and selfish motivations but at least she has the strength of will and character to leave the life of army base prostitution behind. Sinatra is the loyal friend at a base where everyone is either looking for a promotion, to bed another officer's wife, to get drunkm to beat up a weaker person.To that end, no character is more evil than the one portrtayed by stockade master Ernest Borgnine, who derives pleasure from making soldiers suffer in the stockade. Borgnine's part is short but memorable, his eyes reflect genuine pleasure at the prospect of getting back at Maggio (Sinatra).Photography is usually superlative in Zinnemann's movies but here it is just standard fare - nothing memorable about it. Perhaps in keeping with the sordid characters, it shows nothing of the beauty of Hawai. Even the famous kissing scene between Lancaster and Kerr keeps repeating shots of turbulent sea waves, with foam shooting up, suggesting passionate sex between the two characters (who did in fact have an affair during the shoot).I have now watched this film four times, always in the hope of liking it more than before - but I have not been able to. The first half is good. After the famous kissing sequence, the film loses direction and ultimately becomes a rare waste of an opportunity and talent from the great director that Zinnemann was.",

I'd heard this film had won Oscars and I'd heard of the beach scene, but knew nothing else about the film. I thought it was partly a romance and partly a look at the army. I was caught up in the forbidden love of Kerr & Lancaster and interested in Clift & Reed's 'relationship' and was eager to see how they resolved their problems. I was also getting the impression that the Army was an awful place to be - Lancaster, Sinatra & Clift's characters experienced a great deal of hardship and misery because of their enlistment and from their fellow men. So it came as a shock to me when these men supposedly in love refused to try to better their miserable positions in the army by trying to move up or out of it. They spurned the women just to stay in the army? Even though they were miserable where they were they chose the army as their love. What? That made no sense. Their superiors were all incompetent or sadistic losers, in the case of Clift, nearly all his fellow enlistees treated him like dirt. The army was the reason his best friend was killed. Yet because that's all he knew, he stuck to it. IMO, that's not a good reason to choose something.As the film was from 1953, I thought it was set AFTER WW2 and didn't realize this was the days right BEFORE Pearl Harbor- so the bombing was a shock. I had to rethink my experience of the entire film. I could appreciate how even after all the misery everyone banded together for defense. If the men had turned away from their women after the attack that would have made more sense. I could understand not wanting to transfer away once the action starts. My biggest problem with the film was that I could not for the life of me understand why Clift did not identify himself when he was coming back to the base!?!?! That made no sense at all. Of course they're going to shot someone they don't recognize who won't identify themselves in the midst of an attack. So I went from sympathizing with him for most of the film to thinking he was an idiot.In the end I had very little sympathy for any of the male characters. I thought they were stupid for choosing to stay in their miserable lives. If this had been shown as a patriotic choice following the attack I could have understood it better. Also, I thought the scene with the guy refusing to pass out ammunition during an attack as showing the rigidity and stupidity of the military - which I don't think was the point of the scene/movie. I kept thinking if these dumb schmucks had transfered out they wouldn't have been there for the \"preemptive\" strike -they'd be promoted and (maybe) happily married. So I had much less sympathy than I think I was supposed to have.",

There are some amazing performances in this classic. If this isn't the best work Clift has ever done it certainly ranks right up there with his best and I'd have to say the same thing about Donna Reed and Frank Sinatra. Although I'd have to rank \"The King and I\" and \"Heaven Knows, Mr. Allison\" slightly above this performance of Deborah Kerr's, I emphasize the word \"Slightly\".I'd probably have to have given this work a solid 10 were it not for the studio's complete mishandling of the property. This was the era of Joe McCarthy so I suppose it's expected that everyone cut Harry Cohn some slack but I have a rough time doing that. James Jones hated this film and while I can't quite share his total contempt, I also didn't have to live through seeing one of my finest works prostituted on the altar of social expediency and misguided right-wing oppression. This was the film which instructed me about the perfidy which occurred at Pearl Harbor. It taught me the difference between being a soldier and fighting a war. I vividly remember seeing this as a pre-teen and being confused as to what the \"New Congress Club\" actually was. It wasn't an ordinary night club and it wasn't a brothel. In my ignorance of censorship and general juvenile naivet\u00e9 I finally concluded it was some sort of takeoff on the 'dime-a-dance' halls in cities of the time. Stupid me! Between sucking up to the Department of the Army and the 1950's censors Jones' work had been reduced to an insipid shadow of the book. At first I thought the studio would have been better off putting the screenplay on a shelf until an atmosphere prevailed which would allow the completion of the work as Jones intended but then we might have missed securing the services of this cast.With the unwavering clarity of hindsight, perhaps it would have been better had the film been faithful to the novel. It wouldn't have been able to be released at the time so, like 'Kane', it would have sat on a studio shelf until a time when it could be properly appreciated.",

Prewitt's endurance, physical and psychological, to the abuse he receives for refusing to fight is very inspirational as is Maggio's defiance of the sadistic Ernest Borgnine character.

It's military life relationships between genres, the struggles of human life FROM HERE  TO ETERNITY. In war you prepare then figure all angles out to succeed in the goal overtaking the enemy. Well this movie in my opinion FOCUSES on the INDIVIDUAL battles with their PERSONAL goals. THATS THE PARADOX. A GREAT MOVIE! Similar to Heaven Knows Mrs. Allison An Officer and a Gentleman, just name a couple.

The plot is classic and brilliant, and it is helmed with an even better screenplay. The screenplay is pretty much flawless with a lot of character development, good dialogue and no scenes that are just there for no particular reason. The performances are also very good. Frank Sinatra in particular is brilliant while everyone else is still very good. The direction is also very good. The director knows where he wants to go and how to get there, thats really all you need to be a good director, plus he ads more to it making it better. The effects are fantastic for the time and almost stand up now. A Fantastic movie that you should probably see.",

            "content": "I finally got around to watching this movie after hearing about it for most of my life as a great WWII picture from critics and also from Joe Strummer in the song \"The Right Profile\" by The Clash referenced in my summary line. Hell, The Clash (or most-likely, some suit at Sony Music) even named their post-breakup album \"From Here to Eternity: Live\".I'm not going to describe the plot line, which has been discussed numerous times here already. I'll just say I enjoyed it, and everyone should give it a look at some point.Rather, I'm going to throw out a few observations from some guy sitting on a couch nearly 60 years after this thing was filmed.--people were a lot thinner back in the early fifties, and not just the main stars. Look at all the extras in the bar scenes, and you'll agree. I'm sure it had a lot to do with enormous amount of cig. smoking back then, but it sure is noticeable. Ernest Borgnine (perhaps the only main actor from this cast still alive) is known as \"Fatso\", and he would have to put on about 100 lbs. to be on \"The Biggest Loser\" these days.--Frank Sinatra looks like he weighs less than 150 lbs.! --I had a hard time recognizing Jack Warden, even though he worked steadily in movies for almost 50 years after this film, but Claude Atkins looked exactly like his older self we saw on TV for years.--was Burt Lancaster the first guy to try out the wax-chested/speedo look which became popular in the SoCal muscle beach movies a decade later? --Donna Reed won an Oscar for playing a homogenized Hollywood version of a hooker. Why does the Academy always hand out Oscars to actresses who play prostitutes? Anyway, I didn't buy it. She'll always be Mary Bailey to me, the prototype for June Cleaver and every other beautiful housewife we saw on fifties & sixties TV. Donna even played one herself on her own show after this attempt to play against type.--Finally, Monty Clift was a pretty good actor, but seems to be all but forgotten today. Granted he flamed out early in life, his career wasn't that long and it ended about 50 years ago, but we seem to cherish the other screen icons from his era. I've got some theories as to why this is, but I'd sure like to hear other reasons why he's an afterthought in 2011.",

But there are still plenty  mean and selfish men like the Captain, idealistic guys like Prewitt, and torrid love has not changed an inch since Lancaster and Kerr were embracing on the Oauh beach.

After all, how could some of the book's grittier aspects of Army life in pre-Pearl Harbour be translated to the screen with any semblance of fidelity? This was 1953, and the Hays Office still wielded a lot of clout.As it turned out, Columbia's adaptation was expertly crafted to please everyone. The script by Daniel Taradash cleaned up some of the more sexually sordid details -at least for its time- by changing the brothel to the New Congress Club, a sort-of gentlemen's club for G. I.'s. The Army was okay with some of its dirty laundry being exposed, so long as the rotten apples were punished. Fred Zinnemann was called on to direct, and there wasn't a better choice. He had just received an Oscar nomination for HIGH NOON, which gave him the leverage to fight for the actors he wanted.It's interesting to note that all five principal cast members benefitted enormously from their participation in FROM HERE TO ETERNITY. Burt Lancaster's performance as Sergeant Warden allowed him the opportunity to stretch himself in a role that wasn't genre oriented. For the boxer Robert E Lee Prewitt, Zinnemann and Jones were adamant that Montgomery Clift was the only one who could do the complex character justice. But Harry Cohn wanted his contract player Aldo Ray, who looked the part of a pugilist but possessed only a fraction of Clift's acting talent. After much arguing, Zinnemann got his way.Prior to FROM HERE TO ETERNITY, Deborah Kerr was known mostly for her English duchess roles, yet Zinnemann was absolutely convinced that she was perfect to play an American army wife, since Joan Crawford backed out after an apparent wardrobe dispute. He fought just as hard to cast her as he did with Clift, and once again, the director prevailed over a skeptical Cohn. As the the part of Alma, the prostitute -sorry, I mean dance hall hostess- Cohn wanted Donna Reed. Zinnemann, having battled to land Clift and Kerr, gave in to this demand.But the biggest behind the scenes story unquestionably involved Frank Sinatra. In 1953, the legendary singer was considered a has-been and his vocal chords were (temporarily) hemorrhaged. His career was at an all-time low, and the role of Angelo Maggio was a character Sinatra knew inside and out. He had to beg Cohn for the chance to test his dramatic chops, working for only a small fraction of his normal price per picture. Sinatra won the part after Eli Wallach dropped out to do a play on Broadway.",

            "content": "As old school Hollywood romances go, From Here to Eternity is as good as it gets. Watching the four major stars play off each other and operate within their WW 2 reality (in the waining months before Pearl Harbor) is the closest thing to heaven. The warm spill of classical Hollywood lighting holds these characters in frames which do the same for a movie lover that Da Vinci does for an art historian. Whether it's Montgomery Clifts sharp brow line dominating a close up as he wipes the sweat from his face; Deborah Kerr inching into Burt Lancaster's towering figure, the two of them soaking up the rapturous glow that floats around them; or Donna Reed as she tries to reject love in favor of an accepted and comfortable position in society; this is what a true classic looks like.While it remains a pinnacle of romance in film (the scene of Lancaster and Kerr on top of one another, waves crashing in and all around them comes to mind), it also succeeds mightily as a melodrama. What is seen on screen becomes even more eternal because of the dilemmas that the characters are made to work through and around. There exists mutual understanding between the major players to where it's as if they are operating on a level above everyone else; or perhaps that they're tuned into their own private channel of reality. They share in each other's pain, understanding and ambition which gives each moment weight and allows for most scenes to emerge with momentous grandeur. They revel in their respected romances for as long as they can until they realize that what they have can't last in a world like this.For a film from this era, the female characters are incredibly complex and invested in, as Kerr's role especially never feels secondary or less important than Clift or Lancaster's. The film transforms the viewer's perspective of its leading heroine so that we are made to see her as strong and thoughtful, undermining initial assumptions of her as a floozy (a perspective based off of hollow rumors). It makes the viewer question their opinions of gender dynamics and the capabilities of women. On some level the film attempts to tackle the idea of misogyny altogether. These themes come out strongly when Kerr asks her hypocritical and philandering husband why it should make a man feel any different than a women to find out that their partner has betrayed them in marriage.The presence of Frank Sinatra's animated lush, Angelo Maggio, injects a vein of perpetual and essential comedy into this picture. His complexes which extend from his Napoleonic build, are not only in service of comedic relief but ultimately become a microcosm for some of the films more ambitious themes. After ignoring orders from a superior officer, Sinatra abandons his post and taxis into town where he can indulge in the smoky atmosphere of recreation and boozing. Clift, still in his sober mind, realizes how serious of an offense this is and goes to hale a cab to return his drunken friend. Sinatra's defiant utterances, \"can't a man get drunk? Can't a man do nothing?... a man gotta be hounded all his life? Well I'm tired. I ain't no criminal! I ain't no coward!,\" examine the psyche of a soldier. Both characters are stubborn and fight against the debilitating military structure. Ultimately, they are punished for attempting to maintain a sense of individuality within this parasitic ecosystem.In conjunction with the depiction of rampant alcoholism, what's most striking is perhaps just how closely the barracks resemble a prison, and the depiction of manual labor approaching pointless torture. Questions of duty and loyalty arise when it becomes clear that \"brotherhood\" is just a cheap Bureaucratic smoke screen to incite order and servitude. The real dynamics within the company more closely resemble a mob mentality where an individual is punished for not conforming.Widening its scope, the films pessimism was reflexive of the entire nation's disdain for war and misfortune. Coming out in '53 and taking place in '42 the films sour flavor echos the malaise of an entire country coming out of a depression and two World Wars. It's beautiful the way the film utilizes The Blues and the somber sounds of island music to underline its point of view.My only complaint was that the strength of the movie is in its ideological conviction and at times it falls prey to allowing its more condemning commentaries to become parodic slapstick. For instance the heavy drinking seems excusable because it seems so fun. This somewhat undermines the films more \"sober\" attempts at social insight. I have to say though, watching Lancaster tie one on a gyrate his body and head in a drunken orbit was mighty enjoyable.",

Montgomery Clift was truly a wonderful actor who did not get the recognition he deserved. I also like Burt Lancaster as Sgt. Warden. He played the 1st Sgt. role perfectly, although not as nuanced at Clift played \"Prewet\". Buts that as it should be as Sgt. Warden was more the hero than anti-hero as was Sinatra playing \"Maggio\". Donna Reed was wonderful in Eternity but I found it hard to believe she was a prostitute and would work in such a joint. When she talks about marrying a \"country club\" type, I didn't find that far fetched at all. I'm sure I will enjoy this movie just as much the next time I watch it.",

            "content": "Actually, it's an urban legend of sorts that Reeves's role in FROM HERE TO ETERNITY was cut down due to his sudden popularity as Superman. The source of this tale is Jack Larson, who starred with Reeves as Jimmy Olsen on the Superman show. He saw the film (FHTE) the day it opened and remembers audience members calling out \"There's Superman.\" The next time he saw the film, he says Reeves's role had been severely cut.The problem with this is manifold. First, Larson's next viewing of the film, as he told me personally, was some twenty-five years later. I'm convinced that his memory of what he'd seen in that initial viewing had \"expanded\" over the years, particularly in light of the later impact of Superman typecasting on Reeves's career and life. Secondly, Daniel Taradash's first-draft screenplay, and every draft thereafter, contains exactly the same scenes for Reeves's character that are in the film as released and as now seen, and not one scene more nor less. Taradash told me personally that he did not write a single scene for Reeves's character that was not in the final release print or in subsequent video releases. Thirdly, director Fred Zinneman told me personally that not only was not one of Reeves's scenes cut from the film, but that not one frame of the film was cut after the first audience screenings. He was at the same viewing that Jack Larson attended and, while he allowed as that there might have been some muttered reference to Superman from audience members, he does not remember any and that in any case, there was no impact whatsoever on the film as released, nor even any discussion of the matter. He said the video release of the film is identical to the original theatrical release and that not one frame of Reeves's scenes was cut for any such reason. Fourthly, the editor of the film and its assistant director also confirmed to me and concurred with the statements of Taradash and Zinneman. Fifthly, several of the cast members, including Frank Sinatra and Claude Akins, assured me they knew of no such reduction in Reeves's screen time for any reason.Part of the problem may stem from the fact that Sgt. Maylon Stark, Reeves's character, is a vastly more important character in the novel of FROM HERE TO ETERNITY. Scores of characters from that huge book were either trimmed or eliminated. Sgt. Stark remained, but in a smallish way, in the film. But it was a small part in the first place, long before George Reeves was cast. It was never reduced further, due to his Superman fame or for any other reason.",

In the early 80's they did a remake in the form of a mini-series. The acting wasn't bad, and the story actually included parts of the book that were not included in the 1953 movie.

In addition, First Sergeant Warden had problems with the other sergeants because they achieve their sergeant stripes because they were on Captain Holmes' boxing team - not because they were good soldiers who had leadership and excellent soldiering skills such as shooting, reading the map, etc. It just proves that not all sergeants are good at their profession and teaching their men the skills needed to survive on the battlefield.

Might I say, I was not at all disappointed! It was everything I expected and then some. I'm so going to buy this movie. It's one of my all time new favorites. How this movie played out, though, surprised me. As expected I loved Sinatra's character. He was awesome! A fun loving character you wouldn't mind being around. Of course, most of the times, your favorite characters are killed off, which of course happened to Sinatra's character. That made me kind of upset, to be honest. I was also shocked that Montgomery Clift's character was killed off at the end. That was really sad since he was mistaken as a Japanese from far away and was therefore shot several times. Then, I also thought Burt Lancaster and Deborah Kerr would end up together. Wrong again. Yet, it doesn't matter. Movies that have surprise twists and turns make it all the more enjoyable.

This was all largely necessary and the traditions were not without an austere beauty, the bugle calls for instance, but the demands of the organization, the rigid bureaucratic hierarchy had to predominate. The film is actually less cynical than the novel but the casting was pitch perfect, Lancaster, Clift, Sinatra, Deborah Kerr and Donna Reed and then the little gem of Ernest Borgnine's \"Fatso Judson\". Borgnine spent 10 years in the Navy, but the other thing that helped him was that being an Italian American he had a good ear for the bigotry that Italians faced in pre WWII America, and so he could create the truly frightening performance of the sadistic stockade Sergeant.Color would have helped the film.

As for the part of the prostitute Alma -sorry, I meant dance hall hostess- Cohn insisted on Donna Reed. Zinnemann would have much preferred Julie Harris, but having vigorously fought to acquire Clift and Kerr, Zinnemann capitulated to Cohn's demand.But FROM HERE TO ETERNITY's biggest behind the scenes story unquestionably involved Frank Sinatra. By 1953, the legendary singer was considered a has-been and his vocal chords were (temporarily) hemorrhaged. His career was at an all-time low, and the role of Angelo Maggio was the type of character Sinatra knew inside and out. With only musicals to his screen credits, he begged Cohn for the chance to test his dramatic chops, offering to work for only a scintilla of his normal price per picture. Sinatra won the part after Eli Wallach dropped out to do a play on Broadway.Despite Clift's second billing behind Lancaster, his Robert E Lee Prewitt is the main protagonist. Born in the mining communities of Kentucky, Prewitt, or Prew, has been fending for himself since being orphaned as a teenager. With no direction home, he enlisted in the Army with the intention of being a career man. His two exceptional talents are bugling and boxing, but after accidentally blinding his friend during a sparring match, he's turned his attention towards the bugle.FROM HERE TO ETERNITY takes place on Oahu, where Prewitt arrives at the Schofield Army barracks after voluntarily taking a demotion from corporal to private. It's due to the string pulling of Captain Dana Holmes, the base commander of G Company, that Prewitt is assigned to Schofield. Holmes also happens to be the regimental boxing coach, and he sees Prew as his outfit's ticket to the championship of 1941.However, Prewitt hung up his gloves for good after what happened to his friend, and when he informs Holmes of his retirement from the ring, the captain is less than ecstatic over the news. Prewitt's stubborn refusal to reconsider results in him being subjected to non-stop hazing from Holmes' sergeants.Prewitt's only relaxation from the abuse that is now a daily part of Army life is (a) boozing binges with Bff Angelo Maggio, a happy-go-lucky private, and (b) a romance with Alma Burke. His willingness to endure everything Holmes dishes out earns him the respect of his fellow grunts.....and even a few noncommissioned officers.One noncom who refuses to take part in punishing Prew is Milt Warden, the archetypal tough but fair ranking sergeant without whose administrative skills Holmes would be a deer caught in the headlights. It's Warden who should be in charge of the base. But like Prewitt, he's risking his career by embarking on a forbidden affair with Holmes' unhappy wife Karen. She has a strained relationship with her husband, the reasons for which will be revealed during the famous surfside love scene between Lancaster and Kerr.As for the cocky Maggio, his devil-may-care attitude puts him on a collision course with Fatso Judson (Ernest Borgnine), a sadistic stockade sergeant with who he twice nearly came to blows. And later on, after his conviction for deserting his post, who should be waiting to greet Maggio but the grinning, Billy club wielding Judson?All of these subplots will culminate in the Japanese sneak attack at Pearl Harbor, which Zinnemann re-creates quite skillfully despite some obvious authentic footage edited in. TORA TORA TORA, made nearly two decades later, did a better technical job of choreographing the attack, but contained none of ETERNITY's drama.Audiences responded in droves when FROM HERE TO ETERNITY was released in the summer of 1953, mostly because they could identify with some of the characters depicted. The affair between Warden and Karen starts off as an erotic dalliance, only for the pair to fall deeply in love. Lancaster and Kerr have great chemistry together. As for Clift, his superb performance as Prewitt would be almost as influential as Brando's in ON THE WATERFRONT.Clift also brought out the best in his co-stars. According to Lancaster, he was so nervous in his first scene with Clift that his knees were literally shaking; \"Thank God our scene was shot above the waist\". It made a better actor out of Lancaster -not that he was a slouch beforehand.Sinatra and Clift's boozing binges during production were legendary, and when they weren't painting the town red, Clift helped coach the singer extensively in his dramatic debut. And Donna Reed had never before worked opposite anyone as focused on their craft as Clift -not even Jimmy Stewart -and the experience helped her bring out Alma's loneliness and need to be \"proper\". Reed and Sinatra both won Academy Awards in the supporting categories.In total, FROM HERE TO ETERNITY captured eight Oscars: the aforementioned wins for Reed and Sinatra; adapted screenplay, black & white photography; editing; sound; Fred Zinnemann's excellent direction; and of course the big one, Best Picture. FROM HERE TO ETERNITY is one of my all-time favorites.",

The First Sergeant goes back to work. The cruel, bullying, hot-tempered sergeant of the guard dies in a back-alley fight. The fun-loving drinking buddy continues doing stupid things that get him killed. The vain, lazy captain gets booted out of the Army. All of which gets a big yawn. Worst of all, there is this big buildup with Monty's character: he wants to be a soldier, not just a bugler; he is endlessly harassed because he won't box for the company, but endures; he stands up for himself, but never complains; he earns the respect of the First Sergeant. But then there is no resolution, because he leaves his own plot line to cross over into the drinking buddy/cruel sergeant plot line, resulting in his own pointless death. The First Sergeant laments the loss very briefly, then closes that story with \"Get this body out of here.\" The same could be said for this whole movie.",

Like someone playing alongside Michael Jordan. Lancaster, Clift and Kerr are the real stars. And Donna Reed, like Sinatra, earned a Best Supporting Oscar. Also deserved. The legend about this great film is the Ernest Borgnine was the prime bad guy. That's only partly true. Fine character actor John Dennis (Galovitch) never got the credit he deserved. He was at least as effective as Borgnine. When Clift whips him in a fist fight near the film's climax, I imagine a lot of viewers were gratified. There are no weak spots in Eternity. And screenwriter Daniel Taradash, who just recently died, did a marvelous job of culling down Jones' 1000-plus page novel to a two-hour screenplay. I'd like Dennis to get the credit he deserved before he passes away. In my opinion, he's been unfairly uncredited all these years.",

Meantime there is plenty of Cool-Hand-Luke style psychotorture, Frank Sinatra as a likeable sidekick, an actually pretty good song, copious sloppy drunkenness and, last but not least, the ominous knowledge (on our part) that these guys have no idea what's about to hit them on Dec. 7.My only complaint was that, at times, the dialogue was a bit stagey  (the CO's wife when the Sgt. visits her at home, for example)...but by the end you'll have forgotten all that.

Good gallows humor, might even say plain dark at times. There's jokes made even while they're under attack. Those jokes don't play today, but would 'United 93' offer up something so human? I doubt it. Oh, and when Burt Lancaster and the new kid are walking across the lawn in the beginning of the movie, that shadow on Burt's leg is the sound man's boom.

However, this film leaves you with a feeling inside, it actually makes you imagine what it must have been like during the era it portrayed. You feel as though you know the main characters, and in addition to knowing them, you kind of fall in love with them in a sense and wish you knew them.Throughout the years, Frank Sinatra has been under rated as an actor. However as in \"Manchurian Candidate\", Sinatra shines when given the chance to play a dramatic role. His portrayal of Maggio was both heart felt, yet clever and witty when the time was right. The role of Maggio was made for him, he was born to play it.Additionally, I loved Burt Lancaster in the role of 1st Sergeant Milton Warden. Perhaps the best part about the character Sergeant Warden is that while is has a rather rough exterior, he also had empathy for people without being the slightest bit pathetic.Donna Reed's performance as the beautiful \"Lorene\" just gets better and better throughout the film.When reviewing movie classics, a large part of whether or not I enjoyed the film has to do with whether or not the picture has aged well throughout the years. I am 29 years old and a classic movie buff. My husband is the same age as me and watched From Here to Eternity with me for the first time last night. He was not looking forward to it, but a half hour into the movie he was hooked, and he actually enjoyed it.

This is a film to study and admire the interaction and painful movements of the actors based on the humanistic reactions to life's trials and tribulations.  It seemed to me that when the attack on Pearl Harbor ultimately comes, the characters demonstrate that they had a more difficult time dealing with real life situations and matters of the heart and the military attacks made their emotions seem mechanical and robotic demonstrating that while being a soldier can be taught, its much harder to deal with a non-regimented life.

More sex, more direct language, no flirting with higher ranked militaries. 25 ys between the two adaptions, now its 40ys ago since the TV version, I would say that the morals have not changed much since 79.

No performance, although they were all brilliant, matched his. And I will go as far to say that Monty made this movie. He embodied it. Its one of his best films, and he just takes over it. Prewitt is someone you either love or hate, and it can be both at the same time. The women are also great in the film, especially Donna Reed as the young prostitute who falls in love with Prew. And Lancaster and Sinatra are also wonderful, but like I said before, Monty Clift makes this movie and takes it the whole way through.

It's hard to separate the performances of the various cast members from their roles and the shooting script. Do we think Burt was especially good in this, or did he get the most sympathetic part? As for Clift, I've given up trying to figure out why critics and film historians think he's so noteworthy; I saw him doing the same portrayal in this as he did in Hitchcock's \"I Confess.\"  A lot of the movie revolves around his character but I couldn't see his motivation for undergoing \"the treatment\" at all.  Another \"production code\" flaw is Donna Reed's involvement with him.  I would guess this was developed a lot more in a 900 page book than it was here, but why she did a One Eighty on her life plan for a buck private showing little out of the ordinary escaped me.  Women of any kind were a scarce commodity anywhere near a US military base in Hawaii at that time;  the lines outside Honolulu's brothels on Hotel Street stretched around the block on paydays and the \"New Congress Club\" is a laughably sanitized version of what soldiers and sailors went downtown for.  In accordance with movie-making of the time,  Ernest Borgnine's character gets what's coming to him and December 7th provides a convenient wrapup for the multiple plot threads.

Zinnemann's direction is striking with his realistic depiction of military hazing, but the romance drama stuff is really scarce here. For everyone talking about the amazing beach scene, which is like a minute long lovely romantic feeling, then turns into an argument, From Here to Eternity is pretty focused on how awful military life is at its heart. Zinnemann tried to do too much as you will go from a cute date, to a man getting beat up, then Pearl Harbor is getting bombed. It's really jarring and not emotionally gripping like it should be, honestly. From Here to Eternity has some good acting, but the script has not aged well.\n\nMontgomery Clift is awesome in From Here to Eternity as a tough new recruit, who gets hazed. His nuanced acting alongside Donna Reed feels real and genuine in every moment they are on screen. Burt Lancaster and Deborah Kerr are nice together, but awkwardly stilted with the strangely dated script. Everything romantic feels accusatory.\n\nFrank Sinatra is terrible. He's not funny as the playful sidekick who stands by Montgomery Clift. He doesn't make you laugh or smile as he's just an angry drunk. Ernest Borgnine is scary as the cruel stockade warden and a horrible racist in From Here to Eternity. It's hard to care about Sinatra's character arc when he is so unlikable. His acting is embarrassing and never feels authentic, especially compared Burt Lancaster or Montgomery Clift.\n\nIn all, you could watch it for some nice romantic scenes, but From Here to Eternity is more concerned about social commentary about military protocol.",

I don't think I am spoiling anything by stating that the source material did not look fondly on military hierarchy, and while apparently nowhere near as obscene, the film still manages to convey the same overall theme with multiple characters involved in concurrently running plot lines. The acting was solid all around and although most will immediately picture Lancaster and Kerr on the beach, a scene that apparently took three days to film, I found the performance of Clift and, surprisingly, Sinatra able to create the most feeling. At first I thought Sinatra's character was going to be reduced to a goofy stereotype but, in a role he was only paid $8,000 and had to beg for, 'Ol Blue Eyes may have brought more emotion to this picture than anyone else.",

Prewitt gets bullied for refusing to participate in a boxing tournament, Warden has a secret romance with the captain's wife Karen (Deborah Kerr), and Maggio gets imprisoned for his temperaments and brawls. While it does have iconic scenes, the bar fight, the kissing on the beach, and throwing a lei in the ocean, From Here to Eternity has problems. First, I never believed in Lancaster and Kerr's romance because not only does nothing go in jeopardy, but we also hardly see them together half the time. Second, I resented Lorene's (Donna Reed) confused motivations because at one point she wants to live in a \"proper\" lifestyle, but she gets engaged to Prewitt near the end anyway. However, I enjoyed most of the performances, particularly Sinatra's. Whenever he's on screen, he always steals the movie, with his New York/Italian mannerisms, cool suaveness and violent temperaments.

Watching this movie through a lens of the 1950's one can easily see why it was given so many accolades. The movie pulls the band-aid off of the sanitized and manufactured Ozzie and Harriett way of portraying American life and the American military. Warden has an affair with his commanding officer's wife Karen (Deborah Kerr); Pruett and Maggio often visit the Congress Gentleman's Club, a house of ill repute; Maggio is subjected to ethnic discrimination; Pruett is indefensibly bullied by commanding officers; and there is an immense amount of time that all three men are overly inebriated.\n\nThe affair portrayed by Lancaster and Kerr was often uneven and awkward. While they have some chemistry together, they are almost always portrayed going from an intensity of zero to one hundred in mere seconds. Their relationship seemed incredibly rushed and forced. I was much more drawn in by Pruitt's falling in love and eventual relationship with the Gentleman's Club \"hostess\" (prostitute) Lorene . Donna Reed excels as she inhabits the role of Lorene, a character completely contrary to the type of all-American women which Reed is most associated. In a wonderful bit of editing, the first beach hookup between Warden and Karen is juxtaposed with the first gentlemen's club hookup between Pruett and Lorene. As the music crescendos and the waves crash over the first couple, cut to couple number two as Pruett enjoys a cigarette while Lorene is seen putting her earrings back on. By today's standards it is incredibly chaste, but the sentiment of what was taking place is fully conveyed.\n\nThe two relationships are based entirely on immediate need and as soon as circumstances change and introspection begins, the relationships begin to crumble. Happiness and fairness are not guaranteed to anyone. This movie lays bare the efforts that people will still go to in order to at least try and obtain those outcomes, messy and complicated as it may be to do so. The character of Lorene tells Pruitt that she couldn't commit to a serviceman because she was going to have a proper husband with a proper job, and live a proper life. She holds to the much manufactured image of things that the movie itself works to unveil. As she heads back to the mainland at the movie's finale, one hopes that she might obtain her dream yet one can't help but to admit it's doubtful she ever did.\n\nI'm not sure this film holds up as well as some other older films I've recently seen, but I'm convinced it was certainly worthy of the Best Picture Oscar it received, along with 7 other Oscar wins including Best Director (Fred Zinnermann) Best Supporting Actress (Reed) and Best Supporting Actor (Sinatra).",

It\u2019s not that I was confused, or didn\u2019t follow any of the stories, because I thought they were all told well. In fact, I think most of this stuff comes together at the end to make a good cohesive film. However, when we\u2019re bouncing around getting snippets of each character\u2019s story, I started to feel overloaded with the drama and desired a bit more focus. I do think, now that I see how it all links up in the end, I might enjoy it more on a second watch. This is a well-told story, and I have a feeling the novel might be even better because the author would have more pages to tell each story that the director had to condense into 2 hours of film. The cast of From Here to Eternity is amazing. I was particularly impressed with Montgomery Clift. He brings a lot of heart to the film, and has a challenging part to play. I totally connected with his emotional journey as he resisted the pressure to go back to boxing, even when it meant he would have to endure punishment and ridicule. His choices later in the film all made sense to me, because of this difficult journey. I also thought Frank Sinatra\u2019s subplot opposing Ernest Borgnine was powerful. Surprisingly, the romance between Burt Lancaster and Deborah Kerr that leads to the most famous scene in the film, was probably the least interesting aspect to me. Before going in, I thought the entire movie was going to be about them, and by the end I found their story underwhelming. However, it\u2019s hard to point to one thing that I found bad about From Here to Eternity. It\u2019s a high-quality film, and I think over time it will go up in my estimation.

They're both very intense men, but with a distinctive soft side, and an ability to see past their military duties to recognise a person's true worth. Deborah Kerr & Donna Reed, despite their relatively little screen time, still provide the film with a lot of emotional weight. Frank Sinatra, in an Oscar-winning turn, is easily on of the film's standouts, giving a lot of laughs but also suppling a lot of heart. It might suffer some pacing issues, and the ending feels a little flat, but it deserves to be remembered for a lot more than an illicit kiss on a wave-battered beach. There has been plenty of more intense, more harrowing and more noteworthy war films, but From Here To Eternity is still one that holds a lot of appeal, and shouldn't be overlooked.",

The shadow of war looms over the events of the film throughout and when war finally does break out in the form of the attack on Pearl Harbor you really care about the men who put their lives at risk to defend their military base. This film is so much more than just the iconic Deborah Kerr/Burt Lancaster kiss as it portrays complex but charming romances that are tragically cut short by larger conflicts. The women take center stage at several points in this film and this allows for a movie that appeals to both men and women in how it deals with an admittedly important part of our society. This is the third greatest Best Picture winning war film I have seen yet, behind Schindler's List (1993) and The Hurt Locker (2009), because it's more interested in the lives of the humans behind the conflict than the conflict itself.\n\nSergeant Milton Warden, Burt Lancaster, begins a dangerous affair with the damaged Karen Holmes, Deborah Kerr, who is also the wife of his superior. Meanwhile Private Robert Prewitt, Montgomery Clift, arrives having been recently traumatized by the death of one of his friends as a result of his boxing punch which has caused him not to want to box much to the consternation of his superiors. Prewitt begins a relationship with Lorene, Donna Reed, but he is troubled by the role she plays in her profession as entertainment at a gentlemen's club and his refusal to leave the military and become a civilian as she wants him to causes them to grow apart. Lurking in the background are Prewitt's cantankerous friend Private Angelo Maggio, Frank Sinatra, and Fatso Judson, Ernest Borgnine, but with the advent of Pearl Harbor everybody's lives will be irrevocably changed.\n\nThe romances in the film both work for the same reason as we see the tragedy of two men falling in love with broken women who need love in order to be rebuilt but abandoning these same women for the excitement of war. What begins as a casual, sexy affair becomes a proper, committed relationship for Warden and Karen as her shock admission that her husband was more focused on his affairs than her miscarriage brings them closer together. Their drift apart due to his absolute commitment to his work feels inevitable and yet we root for them to be together because they are both such richly written characters and their undeniable chemistry is beautiful. Prewitt and Lorene also experience a shift as she allows a man into her home and her heart but expects him to offer her the same level of commitment as he continues to make idiotic decisions to prove that he is not a coward in the face of conflict. His abandonment of her so that he could return to the military base made me angry at him for just a moment but the final scene in which the two women lament the loss of their men even as they acknowledge that those men had the wrong priorities.\n\nI was swept up in the passions of these characters because of the writing and the handling of the characters but it was also the actors that brought this story to life so vividly. Reed in particular stands out as she is simply lovely in her role as the intelligent, beautiful but initially defensive Lorene. Little moments such a delightful scene in which Prewitt asks Lorene \"Is this what being married is like?\" and she responds \"It's better\" are where Reed really gets to shine. She earned the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress as she is magnetic whenever she is on screen and even manages to overshadow the great Montgomery Clift at moments. The rest of the cast all do a fantastic job although I would have liked to have seen Joan Crawford's interpretation of the Karen role.\n\nThis deserves to be considered one of the 100 Greatest American Films of all time as it is still peerless in it's ability to show war's effects on the women who love the men who choose to fight. It is far and away better than any of the competition it receives in the Best Picture category and it is one of the few times that the Academy made the obvious correct choice.",

The women in this world are in miserable marriages or at miserable jobs, and the guys are stuck in the same super-masculine patterns: do some boxing, trust me, Pruitt, it'll be good for you (nevermind that he blinded a guy by accident in a fight years before), and make sure to have plenty of booze when it's the nighttime. \n\nEven the setting is deceptive: the beautiful beaches and sweet presence of Hawaii (those shirts!) are masking how if a person cant take being around other a-holes it doesnt change anything.  Through this it makes for a compelling batch of stories; you have Lancaster as a sergeant who falls for the Captains wife (Deborah Kerr in a performance that is so intense at times it nears going into being too much, but she always keeps a scene and her delivery of these lines in check) and the conflict in whether to go for it in the 'after all this' thing; Pruitt (Clift), who this feels like the movie is more about than its top billed star, is filled with guilt and angst and should also be too much to take, but also finds those lines of keeping it compelling and interesting, full of pain and fury and all that, but also not going too far.  \n\nThe only one who may be having 'fun' up to a point is Sinatras Maggio, who becomes the brunt of racist remarks (damn you Ernest Borgnine, whos great in his few scenes by the way and cuts a mean impression), and is the first to drown himself in booze when it becomes clear life is being much too oppresive.  Though one knows how this story is leading up to its eventual conclusion, it feels more like a post war story (and it is by way of it being filmed in 53) while coming before.  A guy like Maggio wouldve faced likely the same sort of bullies and pricks in post war life as pre, but in this world he has no escape from what this BS tough guy male world has to do to people.  Or does it have to?  Yeah, it does. \n\nThere are points where it likely has dated, where the hopes and aspirations for the women especially (or some of them men too) are different than it would be today or even like 20 years after the pre Pearl Harbor days.  What were the options then, one has to ask, and it leads to having to take things on the context when it was made.  What makes it work today from being dated is the power of the performances and that the writing is smart enough to recognize everyone as flawed to varying degrees, and that Zinneman keeps a strong hold on the dramatic tone scene to scene.  If theres anything flawed its minor, like leaving the Lancaster-Kerr relationship to the wayside for a good part of the runtime until returning to that in the third act.\n\nSo if you only expect like the romance of that iconic bit on the beach you may be in for not so much disappointment but a heavier and more empathetic tale of soldiers and women and the problems in trying to be true to feelings when its not possible.  Sure its a melodrama, but so what?  If its done this well its worth embracing to this day, and Sinatra, Clift and Jean Arthur are worth noting for their terrific acting.  \n\nthem reinlistment blues...",

I was given a box set of old movies a long time ago when I was a wee lad, and this movie, alongside The Guns of Navarone and The Bridge on the River Kwai, and upon viewing it, I didn't really like it all that much. Upon watching it for the first time in at least a decade, I want nothing more than to go back in time and punch my younger self in the groin.\nFrom Here to Eternity is a sweeping romantic tale, set against the backdrop of pre-war America. More specifically on the Hawaiian Island of Oahu just before the Japanese attack on December 7th, 1941. Our tale follows two lads: one being a tormented ex boxer and Army bugler, who's commanding officer is making his life a living hell in order to coax him into joining the company boxing team. The other is a veteran sergeant, who is falling in love with his commanding officer's neglected wife. It may sound like a pretty melo dramatic setup (and it is at times), but this movie is surprisingly enthralling and entertaining. The acting from all involved is remarkable, with scenes rife with emotion and intensity. The characters were actually likeable, and I was surprised at just how much I gave a damn about their troubles. The attack scenes, while contained to just one set piece, was also very well done, and surprisingly intense.\nThat being said, I do think the story arc with the love affair between the Sergeant and the Officer's wife overshadowed the tale of the tormented bugler. Don't get me wrong, I was entertained by both. But I just loved watching the dynamic between Burt Lancaster and Deborah Kerr. They were apparently romantically involved during the making of this film, and it really, really shows on screen. Some of the dialogue may be a bit dated, but I found it quite nostalgic.\nFrom Here to Eternity is a great film, and a bonafide classic. I hate myself for not watching it sooner, and it's one of my favourite romances to date.",

I always take in consideration of the limitations of a film's release, but if a film fails to interest me even with that, then my confidence towards my feelings of the film is solid. From Here to Eternity left me disappointed due to its inability to create a dramatic impact in its stories and its lack of resonance for contemporary audiences.\n\nThe film's plot starts itself off focusing on a young soldier's, Robert Prewitt, struggles of being independent in the army, not allowing his superiors to take control of his life and be exploited for political leverage. I found this idea to be fascinating as this was a tale that is empathetic; I think many of its audience, regardless of what generation, can understand the pain that Prewitt goes through. I was disappointed with the film's shift in its story, spending more time on the romantic elements that arises with two of the film's characters, including Prewitt. If this was written with more originality in its storylines and characters or if it was directed with more emotional impact then I wouldn't have mind the film's approach. The film finishes it second act with a disappointment sequence, but its final act started with a scene that gave me chills; it was the scene where Prewitt was playing a trumpet through the megaphone as a tribute. The rest of the final act explored the event of Pearl Harbor, which had me engaged for all of it but once it ended, I was left feeling disappointed with the decision that the writers had with having this important part of history be a bookend that barely scratched the emotional surface of its characters. If this film focused more on that tragic event rather than its romance, then this film would have resonated with me; I think this was the core reason of its poor aging, as it gives us a story that we have all seen before.\n\nAt least the film delivers two strong performances from its leading men, but their female counterparts however felt stagnant and forgettable; there were actually a couple of moments where they were on screen and my focus switched from active and passive.\n\nFrom Here to Eternity did not meet the expectations that its accolades prove it to be and I doubt my feelings towards this would improve in the future.",

            "content": "Man, through \"From Her_ to Eternity\", Nick Cave & the Bad Seeds kind of ruined this neat little title for me. Yeah, yeah, these folks can worry about a possible Japanese invasion, but maybe we should have tightened up for the Aussie invasion of the '80s, because Nick Cave is a little too much experimental post-punk than I'm comfortable with. Shoot, maybe they could have gotten an early start during WWII, because it doesn't seem like these guys are so much concerned about Japanese attacks, as much as they're concerned with bickering with one another and worrying about the women in their lives. This film is good and all, but it isn't much of a war film, which is probably a good thing, because it could be taken as military propaganda enough as it is without cool action and junk. Kids, don't look at this film and think that when you get into the military, you'll get the chance to lounge around a Hawaiian beach, making out with a beautiful woman. Well, you might be able to pull that off if you have Burt Lancaster's physique and grin, or if you looked like Montgomery Clift, or if you could sing like Frank Sinatra. This is one seriously Hollywood army, and there's still no action, which is fine, because this film is still plenty compelling, despite its issues, and its having plenty of time to run into issues.\r\n\r\nRunning not even a whole two hours, this film is by no means terribly long, but like I said, for a military film, it doesn't have much going on, so storytelling often struggles to find material to work with, until it gets to be kind of repetitious, and feels as though it's losing focus the more it spends too much time with one plot layer over the others. The film follows three intertwined, yet still distinct storylines, and each one is thoroughly compelling, but considering that pacing is so uneven, the transitions between each overdrawn layer go convoluted feel relatively sudden. The storytellers tend to fumble all of the layering which, to a certain extent, reflects the ambition which is further emphasized by refreshing dramatic touches that in turn emphasize the lapses in originality, of which there are many, to where a certain predictability often rears its ugly head in amidst surprises. It doesn't help that contrivances are among the tropes hit in the storytelling, for the plots are nothing if not melodramatic, and made all the more disingenuous in feel - despite all of the inspiration - by heavy-handed dialogue and contrived characterization. Through all of the film's grace is subtlety issues, some of which are a little cheesy, and all of which are either lazy or further reflective of an ambition to bloat the kick and structure of this drama, whose value is limited to begin with. I've said it time and again, but this isn't much of a military drama, and by that, I mean that's not a particularly dynamic drama at all, having enough potential to be made into a rewarding final product, but not enough for it to be easy to overlook all of the excess, unevenness, familiarity and melodramatics. The final product's reward value is well-threatened, but ultimately secured, and pretty firmly, partly because it knows how to immerse.\r\n\r\nSomething of an intimate character drama, this film isn't thoroughly exploratory of its Hawaiian setting, but a lot of the film's engagement value thrives on its boasting such a beautiful setting, which is both aesthetically pleasing, - in spite of a lack of color - and tight enough to actually help in complimenting the sense of intimacy which this story would be nothing without. Sure, the intimacy of the story concept minimalizes the scope of this drama of a limited sense of consequence, and is betrayed by some subtlety issues to storytelling, but as I said, each one of the plots in this melodrama is compelling, with human themes regarding men's principles and love that hold a lot of potential for a grace which was ahead of this time in dramatic filmmaking. Daniel Taradash's Oscar-winning screenplay, with its contrivances and other heavy-handed touches, does a degree of injustice to the depth of this film, while also shaking momentum through excess and inconsistencies, but more than anything, it's sharp, with solid dialogue and enough taste to characterization and audacity to the handling of worthy subject matter to carry some genuine heart. Fred Zinnemann brings resonance to this heart, because if momentum is sustained here, then it's through Zinnemann's well-paced scene structuring which draws upon the sharp highlights in scripting in order to sustain entertainment value, and your attention with it, through and through, until finding unexpected subtlety. There are times in which the film is rather moving, but there are few, if any times in which the drama is less than compelling, for no matter how much fumblings in ambition challenge your investment, the inspiration and taste found throughout the film endears about as much as the performers. This is a sizable cast full of talent, and just about every member is, at the very least, sparklingly charismatic, and that especially goes for leading men Burt Lancaster, Montgomery Clift and Frank Sinatra, who also hit their share of dramatic highlights which, especially for the time, are powerful in their defining the vulnerability of the central focuses of this intimate character drama. These leads carry the final product about as assuredly as anyone, or at least highlight the reflections of heart which can be found in most every area of this drama, and although it is hard to completely disregard the shortcomings, they are decidedly overcome.\r\n\r\nOnce eternity is reached, the film takes a touch too long to unevenly unravel a sometimes formulaic, frequently melodramatic and somewhat thin narrative, but engagement value is consistently sustained by the lavish locations, noble subject matter, thoughtful writing, effective direction and strong performances by Burt Lancaster, Montgomery Clift and Frank Sinatra which make Fred Zinnemann's \"From Here to Eternity\" a compelling, intimate portrait on the challenges of soldiers which extent beyond the military.\r\n\r\n3/5 - Good",

There are many good reason in the film to feel for him but there just something for me and clifts performance that doesn't make me feel bad for him. I do however like Burt Lancaster and the ultra competent lothario is a great role for him. I was a little let down by the famous beach make out scene, they only showed them kissing for half a second! Earnest Borgnine who is usually lovable in most films i have seen him in plays a very hateable abusive head of the stockade. I found the two leading ladies very attractive as well (not always the case in some of these older films). The biggest surprised for performance however was Frank Sinatra whom i though was very impressive. I always question when a singer tries to make a transition into acting but he proves in this film he has chops. I really missed him when he leaves about two thirds in. Ultimately this movies survives more on its characters then its story, but i wish it had both.",

            "content": "Since I had not been pleased with any films about Pearl Harbour to date and From Here to Eternity won Frank Sinatra the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, it was a win-win for me to be viewing.\n\nFrom Here to Eternity serves as a war-romance film and comes from the time in history where that was actually still a valid piece of cinema as it is no longer that popular these days with an example being Michael Bay's Pearl Harbour which was enjoyable for how terrible it was, although also for its exceptional action sequences. And so it is easy to kind elements to compare it to both Pearl Harbour and Tora! Tora! Tora!. While Pearl Harbour took forever to get to the action scenes and supplied nothing but melodrama and terrible acting until then and Tora! Tora! Tora! was packed with realistic yet repetitive and dull dialogue, From Here to Eternity is actually more focused on the characters so the fact that the bombing of Pearl Harbour doesn't come in until 100 minutes isn't actually that bothersome at all. From Here to Eternity is actually the best film about Pearl Harbour I have ever seen because it doesn't put too much emphasis on the event and plays it off as one which strikes the characters without expectations and does the same to viewers. By the 100 minute point of the film, From Here to Eternity has made its characters sympathetic and its story compelling which means that when the bombing of Pearl Harbour strikes, the viewers are genuinely worried about the fate of the characters. From Here to Eternity focuses on the small scale of characters but on the large scale of events that cover many of them, which means that it is balanced much of the time. Although this also can be the downfall of From Here to Eternity at times.\nFrom Here to Eternity does suffer from a surplus of characters. There are a lot of interesting characters in From Here to Eternity, but a few too many of them to really keep up with. The story deals with them all both facing issues regarding the military and romantic themes, so it has to constantly deviate back and forth between many characters and all of the experiences that they face. The film doesn't end up tracking them all that easily, and so it can be easy for viewers to end up finding themselves confused by the entire experience. As a whole, From Here to Eternity is a consistently interesting and complex war film, but it can be a little overwhelming at times due to the pure amount of ambition involved.\nBut still, director Fred Zinnemann manages to keep everything mostly intact. Although it is a little much at times, under his direction the film ends up being a powerful visual experience and a well-acted feature which capitalises on the potential of its script and the talents of the actors. \nVisually, From Here to Eternity is full of beautiful scenery and cinematography which captures the big scale of events, the small scale of its effect on the characters and the large scale that the climactic events had on everybody. And everything is edited nicely at a gently pace against the backdrop a good musical score with the only technical flaw being the fact that the sound effects aren't consistent throughout the story. Everything in From Here to Eternity feels thoroughly convincing, so its visual style is top notch.\nBut above all of that is the fact that the cast in From Here to Eternity give it their all and never look back which means that the final result of the film is thoroughly entertaining.\nBurt Lancaster supplies another powerful lead performance. Although he does face a battle of entertainment value with Montgomery Clift and others, he manages to make up for it with another heroic leading performance. His natural charisma makes him a capable foil for From Here to Eternity, and his powerful chemistry with the many surrounding actors make him an entertaining and compelling screen presence. Burt Lancaster is terrific in From Here to Eternity.\nMontgomery Clift projects a sense of shattered innocence in his portrayal of Private Robert E. Lee \"Prew\" Prewitt because he has a combination of both humanity and fearless dedication to his cause which is both his most determined aspect and his downfall. He has a lot of heroic patriotism in him, and it leads him to an excellent performance which is memorable for being both sympathetic as  a romantic character and admirable as a patriotic hero.\nFrank Sinatra's Academy Award winning performance is also terrific. While he doesn't receive as much screen time as you may hope, he gives a performance which is one of the most memorable of his career. His role as Private Angelo Maggio places him firmly in the character and he takes full advantage of the part in a performance which is compelling and dramatic while also a very likable character. Frank Sinatra is a screen stealer in From Here to Eternity, and even up against such a large cast he makes a significant impact in the matter of a limited amount of screen time, and so he is one of the best reasons to see From Here to Eternity.\nDeborah Kerr also makes a firm supporting effort, and Donna Reed's performance has her projecting a lot of powerful emotions in the span of a mere few scenes. \nErnest Borgnine's supporting performance is also a powerful one because his antagonistic nature is very intimidating, and he makes From Here to Eternity a memorable film even further.\n\nSo although From Here to Eternity features a surplus of characters and has a genre which is significantly lesser in popularity today, it is held together by a powerful script which has a lot of deep characters, a versatile cast of Academy Award nominated actors playing them with dead on dedication and the fact that it is genuinely a compelling war film.",

This is a powerful and emotionally charged war drama set before, during and after a pivotal moment during World War 2 when everything changed. It has a brilliant ensemble cast and it's a film which still stands strong today. Set in late 1941 at the Schofield Barracks on the island of Oahu, Hawaii. The film focuses on three soldiers, Private Robert E. Lee Prewitt (Montgomery Clift), who always seems to get picked on by Captain Dana \"Dynamite\" Holmes (Philip Ober). With Prewitt acting out against everyone, First Sergeant Milton Warden (Burt Lancaster) is under pressure to have Prewitt placed under court martial, which he doesn't do. Prewitt is supported by his best friend and fellow army buddy Private Angelo Maggio (Frank Sinatra). Meanwhile, Warden is having an affair with Holmes's wife Karen (Deborah Kerr), while Prewitt falls for Lorene (Donna Reed). It's a complex story, but it does pay off, and the big climax is only a footnote to the drama that the characters all face, the bigger picture seems insignificant compared to their dramas and woes. This was the big Oscar winner of 1953, and unlike other years where the wrong films seem to win, this truly deserved it.",

            "content": "Definitely a classic, if not for anything more than the iconic shot of Burt Lancaster and Deborah Kerr kissing on the beach. Luckily, that's not the big story here. The real story is Montgomery Clift pulling a Cool Hand Luke nearly 15 years before Paul Newman. There are differences yes, but Clift's Army Private Robert E. Lee Prewitt who just wants to be left to do his job and won't give in to the pressures and authority must have inspired some of the Luke character (or Newman at least). Lancaster is strong here as the tough but fair Sgt who runs the base for his Captain, who's busy trying to get a promotion between dates (cheating on his wife). Both Prewitt and Sgt Warden find love, Clift with Donna Reed as a men's club worker (Yes Mrs. George Bailey as a quasi-Hooker); Lancaster with Deborah Kerr's wife of his boss. Some of the best work here is in the small parts; Frank Sinatra single-handedly saved his career with this performance as Prew's pal Maggio, who always wants to have a good time until he runs across the sadistic Stockade officer played by Ernest Borgnine.\nAll this takes place in the time leading up to the bombing of Pearl Harbour, and it is that event which leads the characters to make their stands and meet their fates. The picture won 8 of 13 Oscar nods, including Picture, Director (Fred Zinnemann - High Noon), Screenplay, Cinematography, Supporting Actor for Sinatra and Supporting Actress for Reed. Lancaster, Clift and Kerr were all nominated for Lead Roles as well. Well worth a watch, holds up well, as the story of outsiders and people who aren't really happy with life never get old when done well.",

            "content": "PART OF MY CLASSIC VIEWINGS OF 2014 LIST\n\n\" Well, what am I? I'm a private no-class dogface. The way most civilians look at that, that's two steps up from nothin'.\"\n\nWhen you think of the 1950's, particularly 50's cinema, the majority of the films that come off the bat are films made to appeal to all members of a household. There were groundbreaking films made during this time, like The Ten Commandments, Singin' in the Rain, and The Searchers, but due to the Hay's Code, studios had to be sure that they don't violate some of it's stupid and idiotic restrictions in order to make a \"moral\" film. But the 1950's was also known as a decade where filmmakers decided to be a little sneaky with the code and get away with some of the restrictions, forever weakening its power and leading into more revolutionary works. Some of the first \"adult\" films were made in the 1950's, such as Sunset Boulevard, A Streetcar Named Desire, and On the Waterfront, but none will ever be so remembered and so acclaimed as From Here to Eternity, a film bases on an acclaimed war novel known for its \"explicit\" material that was considered extremely steamy for its time. And the risks certainly paid off, as From Here to Eternity was nominated for 13 Oscars, winning 8 of them, most memorable being Best Picture. While the film is certainly tame in its steamy situations, there's no denying that From Here to Eternity is still a great film.\n\nThe film is about the lives of soldiers stationed in Hawaii in 1941, shortly before the attack on Pearl Harbor, and focuses on these soldiers' problems that they face in the barracks. We have Sergeant Milt Warden (Burt Lancaster), who develops a crush on the wife of his commanding officer (Deborah Kerr). There's Private Robert E. Lee Prewitt (Montgomery Clift), a former boxer who faces insults and taunts from other soldiers for quitting to fight, falls on love with showgirl Lorene (Donna Reed), and communicates well with a bugle. There's also Maggio (Frank Sinatra), who has a hated against stockade sergeant Fatso (Ernest Borgnine), a man that threatens to kill him off if he doesn't obey orders. But things get really heated up when these characters are faced with \"the day that will life in infamy\", the Pearl Harbor attack.\n\nFrom Here to Eternity is forever well-known for it's \"infamous\" love scene between Burt Lancaster and Deborah Kerr on the beach, with waves rolling around them. The story goes that Lancaster and Kerr were actually romantically involved on the set while making this movie, a rumor that makes the scene that more memorable to watch. When the film was first released, reaction to the scene was divided. 50's kids were loving this original scene of romantic passion, while parents of the day were heavily offended that such sexual activity was depicted on screen. I can honestly imagine how the scene would have played out if The Hay's Code was not around and it would have probably caused more controversy in the day. All controversy aside, while the scene is tame nowadays, as we only see them kissing for two seconds, this heavily iconic scene still remains memorable at it was in 1953, and it is the biggest highlight of this great, great movie.\n\nThe thing about From Here to Eternity is that it's well-acted, particularly from its five main stars in the film. The one that surprised me the most was Frank Sinatra as Maggio. I knew he did more dramatic roles in his career, but I didn't know he could play a role this strong. Sinatra did win the Oscar for this film, as Best Supporting Actor, and definitely earned it. So does Donna Reed, who gained the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress as the showgirl. Deborah Kerr, while she's fine in the role, I wished she had a little more screen time than what we ended up getting. The beach scene was not enough for me. The two lead actors, Burt Lancaster and Montgomery Clift, were both nominated for Best Actor in this film. They didn't win, but they were both fantastic in their roles. Burt Lancaster, while he has top billing, is not the true star of the film in my book. That goes to Montgomery Clift, who easily knocks Lancaster's socks off when it comes to flawless acting. Clift is the heart and soul of the picture, perfectly conveying what his character is going through. If anyone deserved to win the Oscar, it would be Clift.\n\nEven more conveying than Clift's performance is the Pearl Harbor attack scene. What's strong about this movie is that while Pearl Harbor plays a huge role in the film, it doesn't scream \"ATTACK\" throughout the movie. The Pearl Harbor scene occurs in the last 20 minutes of the film, and it was well done. It doesn't go into full detail of the casualties lost on that tragic day, but what we got in the end was something that will always be remembered \"from here to eternity\" (pun intended).\n\nWhile the ending was a little weak, and definitely something that could have been better handled, I was really impressed with From Here to Eternity. It's a great, essential film truly because of its strong acting, especially Frank Sinatra, Burt Lancaster, and especially Montgomery Clift. It's a difficult, slow movie to watch, especially those that are younger, but the acting, the wonderful cinematography, and definitely it's iconic, passionate love scene, is definitely worth everybody's time. It's a classic that's not to be missed.",

He does however, strike a friendship with wisecracking Italian Private Angelo Maggio (Frank Sinatra) and falls in love with 'nightclub hostess' Alma (Donna Reed).\nMeanwhile, senior officer Burt Lancaster begins an affair with his superior officers wife (Deborah Kerr) and they deliver one of the most iconic movie kisses of all time (the infamous beach scene).\nAlthough quite wishy-washy in parts, the movie comes alive in scenes with Clift & Sinatra. \nIt's your archetypal Hollywood melodrama with routine flagwaving, but I fully understand why it's deemed a classic. \nTo think that Michael Bay tried to emulate this with Pearl Harbor is quite laughable.",

            "content": "Its power may have waned a little bit since it first came out over 50 years ago, but FROM HERE TO ETERNITY still remains one of the classic war films as well as an interesting look into military life circa 1941. The story follows a handful of characters whose lives all intersect in Hawaii during the months prior to the bombing at Pearl Harbor. You have Montgomery Clift as Pvt. Robert E. Lee Prewitt: a loner with a troubled past, Burt Lancaster as Sgt. Warden: a tough, but understanding NCO, Deborah Kerr as Karen Holmes: the company commander's wife, and Frank Sinatra as Angelo Maggio: a wiry Italian fellow who befriends Prewitt and loves to drink. As was typical for films of the period, there is a romantic/melodramatic element which forms the basis for the story and informs the way we see the characters. This aspect was kind of dated, but it allows the casual viewer a window into these characters' lives the way a straight military picture couldn't have done. The two main romantic narrative threads are between Montgomery Clift and a girl, Loreen/Alma (Donna Reed) who works at a club he frequents, and Burt Lancaster with Deborah Kerr. Both of these couples lament the situation that life has put them in and desire to get away from it all. Montgomery Clift has become the target of cruel treatment based on his decision not to join the company's boxing team, while Donna Reed's character has grown weary of her employment at a gentleman's club where she has to entertain service members. Parallel to that, Burt Lancaster romances the wife of his CO, a philanderer who has lost interest in her. One common element is the desire to return to the States and get married, which would provide the stability that they all want. However, fate has other plans as the bombing at Pearl Harbor throws their somewhat stable world into chaos and the men of the Army must put aside petty differences to fight the bigger enemy. These are rather heady themes to be tackled in a film that could easily have been a fluff piece for the Armed Forces, yet FROM HERE TO ETERNITY never feels like propaganda. The biggest thing on its mind seems to be portraying what happens when something unexpected throws our best-laid plans into disarray. When that happens, the best we can do is to band together and make the best of a bad situation. In the end, our commitment to each other will outlast any temporary plans that we have. Overall, FROM HERE TO ETERNITY does feel \"of its time\" but it's also the only Pearl Harbor film worth watching.",

The book was definitely going to be made into a film and it was only a question of casting to make it a success.\n\nDirector Fred Zinneman had a good intuitive sense about casting here, even against type. The two principal female parts were done against type. Deborah Kerr who made a career of playing respectable women played a captain's wife who's drinking and playing around. Not that husband Philip Ober is letting grass grow under his feet either, but Kerr's latest sexual exploit involves her with the First Sergeant of her husband's company, Burt Lancaster. \n\nDonna Reed, who up to that point was best known for being Mary Bailey in It's A Wonderful Life, plays a prostitute here. A girl from the wrong side of the tracks, jilted by a rich boyfriend stateside, she's in Hawaii to make money and then go home and buy some respectability. She's not looking for romance with any soldiers, but you can't plan these things.\n\nEspecially Montgomery Clift if he comes in your life. It's been argued that this is Clift's greatest role and a case can sure be made for it. His character of Robert E. Lee Pruitt is like so many who still join the army today, from small town America who have no future there and find a home in the Armed Services. What makes Clift unique is that strong sense of individualism he can't control in an organization that does not encourage individuality.\n\nClift and Lancaster are a great study in contrasts and that's what drives From Here to Eternity. Lancaster as Sergeant Milt Warden is the ultimate professional soldier, held in the highest regard by his men. Lancaster is someone who knows how to work the system, you see it in the way he manipulates his captain. Of course he's got to be a manipulator there since he's having an affair with Deborah Kerr. He tries to protect Clift from himself and ultimately fails.\n\nClift has transferred into an infantry company and he was at one time a boxer. But he blinded someone in a fight and quit boxing. Philip Ober who prides himself on having several champions in various weight classes worked to get Clift in his company. Clift upsets his plans by refusing to box so he has the various sergeants give him \"the treatment.\" \n\nClift's best friend in the company is a tough street wise soldier from the big city named Angelo Maggio, played by Frank Sinatra. Sinatra read the book and knew this part was for him. He did everything he had to do to get that part, including working for scale. At the time Sinatra was considered a has been as singer and actor. Sinatra was right on the money in terms of picking a role. His faith in himself and Columbia Pictures and Fred Zinneman's faith in him netted him an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor, one of eight awards won by From Here to Eternity.\n\nBy the way Sinatra credited both Lancaster and Clift in helping him through this film as a dramatic actor. Lancaster and Sinatra didn't inhabit the same Hollywood orbit, but they remained friends for life. The same could not be said for Clift. Allegedly, some five or six years after From Here to Eternity and after Monty Clift's automobile accident while shooting Raintree County, Clift at some party at Sinatra's made a drunken pass at one of Sinatra's retainers. That got him kicked out of Sinatra's circle permanently.\n\nIn fact From Here to Eternity was also the Best Picture of 1953, with Zinneman getting his second Best Director Oscar in a row after the one he took home in 1952 for High Noon. Donna Reed won for Best Supporting Acress. Burt Lancaster and Montgomery Clift were both nominated for Best Actor, but split the vote allowing William Holden to win for Stalag 17. Another great acting job itself. And Kerr was up for Best Actress, but lost to Audrey Hepburn for Roman Holiday.\n\nFrom Here to Eternity is a film loaded with good actors in small roles who got their first notice in this film. Ernest Borgnine, Robert J. Wilkie, Claude Akins, Jack Warden, Mickey Shaughnessy, all play various soldiers and each one is memorable. Especially Borgnine as the vicious sadistic sergeant of the stockade.\n\nTV's Superman was in From Here to Eternity also. George Reeves who was looking to escape the typecasting from Superman has a part as another sergeant who warns Lancaster about Deborah Kerr. He gave a fine performance, but most of it wound up on the cutting room floor. That would have unforeseen tragic consequences.\n\nThis is not any kind of glamorous army. These people are all too real and not very noble. The original novel was toned down quite a bit for the screen. But when the attack on Pearl Harbor comes, the men rise to the occasion, do their jobs in a more than competent manner and led by Burt Lancaster in that company. It's these men who won that war in the Pacific and the one in Europe as well and From Here to Eternity despite the less than noble portrayals of them as individuals is a great tribute to them as a team.",

            "content": "This is another film that I keep looking at the cover of and keep wanting to see it to know what it's about. Here's my review for From Here to Eternity.\n\nPlot: set in 1941, Private Prewitt transfers from the Bugle Corps to a rifle unit at Company \"G\" at Schofield Barracks in Oahu. When captain Holmes hears his reputation as a middleweight boxer, he asks Prewitt to join their team but he refuses stating that he quit boxing. So Holmes tries to make things a living hell for Prewitt until he gives in. Meanwhile, First Sergeant Warden falls in love with Holmes' wife Karen on whom Holmes has been unfaithful to, and Prewitt falls for a woman named Lorene at a gentleman's club called the New Congress Club.\n\nOkay this didn't completely blow me away, but I liked it. The stories were interesting, the characters were enjoyable and were well acted, - Frank Sinatra seems to stand out the most which I would agree with, from his last scene in the film for sure. The general concept of what happens during most of the movie may not have aged well since it's a little familiar, (like I personally can't help but think of Top Fun a little with some parts of this film)  but I think it works out. But personally I think my only real issue is that I don't think the stories completely balance out. I generally say that because I kind of wanted more of Warden and Karen's story. They were already a little interesting in the beginning what with how he's having an affair with her against her husband who's always cheating her, but then you have the beach scene and she talks about what happened during the earlier years of her marriage and I ended up liking her character more. From that I personally wanted more from their story and thought they could've done more. I mean they did eventually but I don't think it paid off as much as I hoped it would. But anyway, I also liked the fighting during the very end. They did a good with that one stunt especially of a guy getting show down by a plane I thought they did a rather impressive job on.\n\nAnd that's my review for From Here to Eternity. The plot may be familiar and some of the stories aren't balanced out, but it still has great characters, very well acted, good action and is altogether an enjoyable film all around.",

The central themes to this movie from what I gathered was fear and love. It is full of masterful cinematography and brilliant acting, making it one of the most memorable films of all time.\n \n\n\nThere are two stories that this film revolves around. The first is Robert E. Lee. Prewitt's (Montgomery Clift), a private in the army who has just been transferred to a new regiment. He is a masterful boxer, but will never fight again after permanently injuring one of his friends whilst sparring. His regiment put him through hell to try to get him to box for them. The second story is about Sergeant Milton Warden (Burt Lancaster) and his love affair with the wife of his commanding officer, Karen (Deborah Kerr). From Here To Eternity isn't the most interesting of story's, but the brilliant acting and cinematography make it extremely entertaining.\n \n\nMontgomery Clift was spectacular in this, particularly in the scene where he plays the bugle for his friend who died. Deborah Kerr and Burt Lancaster had great chemistry, making their story the more interesting of the two. Frank Sinatra was surprisingly fantastic as well. He definitely earned his Oscar for this movie. Donna Reed played the girlfriend of Prewitt, and in one scene blew me away It was the scene where he was leaving her to return to the army.\n \nWhen someone mentions the \"Most Iconic Scenes of All Time,\" 9 times out of 10, the beach scene from 'From Here To Eternity' will be brought up. It is spectacular, there's no denying that. But for me, the best cinematography occurred when Pearl Harbour was getting bombed by the Japanese. It was so suspenseful and beautifully shot. For me, it was the highlight of the film and pushed it into the 'Great Movies' category. The music throughout the movie is lovely too, especially when Prewitt plays his bugle. It gives me chills.\n \nOverall, this is a very entertaining movie. I'd put the cinematography in From Here To Eternity up there with the greatest of all time. It's an almost perfect film that everyone should see.",
