            "review_title": "One of the best films noir ever, Double Indemnity communicates with amazing effectiveness the depths of depravity, greed, lust, and betrayal of the seemingly innocent and beautiful.",
            "content": "This is one of the best films of all time, not necessarily because of its story but because of the acting, direction, cinematography, lighting, and just the way that the story itself was told. At the time the film was released, the idea of revealing who the killer was in the opening scene was virtually unheard of, but it ended up being very effective because it allowed the audience to concentrate more on other elements of the film, which was the goal of Billy Wilder, the director. Instead of trying to figure out who the perpetrator was, there is more emphasis on how the crime was pulled off, what mistakes were made during the murder, who betrayed who, how close Barton Keyes (the insurance investigator) was getting to solving the case, and, probably most importantly, what kind of person Walter Neff is and whether or not sympathy should be felt toward him.\nBarbara Stanwyck, in one of the most remembered performances of her extensive career, represents (with nearly flawless ease) the cold and ruthless manipulator who has no difficulty in ruining other people's lives in various ways (including death, if necessary) in order to get what she wants. Known in the film community as the `femme fatale,' this is someone who uses her sexual prowess, seductiveness, and emotional detachment to drag an unsuspecting person (generally an interested man) into a scheme from which she is expected to benefit heavily and he is most likely headed for destruction. In these types of films, the man often either finds his life in ruins or ends up dead, as is often (but not always) also the case with the fate of the femme fatale. Barbara Stanwyck (as Phyllis Dietrichson, the murderous femme fatale in Double Indemnity) and Fred MacMurray (as Walter Neff, her \u0091victim'), have amazing chemistry on screen. Their attraction is incredibly well portrayed, and the development of their relationship with each other is so convincing that what happens between them almost seems normal. Besides that, their mutually calculated interaction, although it seems at first like it has been rehearsed endlessly and ultimately brought unconvincingly to the screen, is exactly as it was meant to be, because it represents each character's intentions, even very subtly foreshadowing their future betrayals against each other. Phyllis has gone through every word she ever says to Walter in her head. She has practiced what she wants to say when she brings up the idea of life insurance to Walter in the beginning and she knows what she wants to say whenever they interact with each other because she has been planning for quite some time the prospect of murdering her husband in order to collect his fortune. Walter, conversely, methodically makes amorous advances as though this is something that he does regularly, and then ultimately he also plans out his conversations with Phyllis because he begins to suspect her and is sure to tell her only what he wants her to hear. This seemingly stiff dialogue brilliantly represents Phyllis and Walter's precise (and sinister) intentions, and it's quick pace creates a feeling of urgency and restlessness.Probably the most fascinating and entertaining actor in the film, Edward G. Robinson, plays Barton Keyes, Walter's friend and employer at the insurance company where he works. Keyes is a very suspicious man who closely investigates the insurance claims which come into the company, having a striking history of accurately isolating fraudulent claims and throwing them out. His handling of Phyllis's (and Walter's, technically) claim and the way that he gets closer and closer to the truth create a great atmosphere of tension and drama. Double Indemnity is nearly flawless. From the shocking and unexpected beginning to the already known but still surprising end, the audience is held rapt by the excellent performances, the brilliant and imaginative direction, and the flawlessly created atmosphere. This is excellent, excellent filmmaking, and is a classic film that should not be missed.",

            "content": "This is one of the best-liked classic films of all time and I am among that large group of fans as well.Few movies have ever had dialog this entertaining.....at least the conversations between Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray. I think it's a big appeal to this movie, except to younger folks who look at it as \"cheesy.\"I read the book, Double Indemnity written by James Cain, and was surprised that the film's snappy dialog was not in it. This is one of the rare times when the movie was far better than the book. That's not a shock after you find out that literary giant Raymond Chandler and Hall Of Fame director Billy Wilder combined to write the screenplay,For a murder/suspense story, there is very little action, almost none, yet there are no boring lulls. The three main actors - Stanwyck, MacMurray and Edward G. Robinson, are what make this so good.MacMurray's narration is fun to hear as he tells the story in flashback, from the beginning by dictating into an old Dictaphone to his co-worker Robinson. The latter is almost mesmerizing in his performance, the way he delivers his lines. He can even make a speech about something as boring as insurance and still keep you riveted to the screen.Stanwyck was no sex symbol (at least to me) but she looked great here in the most seductive of 1940s clothing and, like Robinson, has a distinctive voice and accent that keeps your attention.This film was the inspiration for the 1980 movie, \"Body Heat,\" starring William Hurt and Kathleen Turner. That, too, was a very, very good movie....but not many films are in the class of this one.",

            "content": "Vintage Noir Film with gritty interpretation , atmospheric settings , crackling dialogue throughout and powerhouse filmmaking . This Billy Wilder's first thriller is one of the finest Noir film ever made . A scheming wife (Barbara Stanwyck) lures an insurance salesman (Fred MacMurray , though Alan Ladd, George Raft, Brian Donlevy, James Cagney, Spencer Tracy, Gregory Peck, and Fredric March were all up for the leading role) into helping murder her husband and then declare it an accident . Both of whom concoct a twisted scheme to collect the benefits of a insurance policy . As the hubby's policy contains a clause that states that if the husband's death caused by a moving train the policy pays double face value . The investigator's boss (Edward G. Robinson) , not knowing his colleague is involved in it , suspects murder and sets out to prove it .This first-rate and entertaining American classic Noir film draws its riveting tale and power from the interaction of finely drawn roles as well as drama , emotion and moody atmosphere . This classic mystery thriller follows James M Cain's book fairly closely otherwise . Twisted film Noir about murder , troubled relationships , treason , dark secrets , including an unforgettable dialog ; being based on the James M Cain's novel , which in turn was based on the true story of Ruth Snyder, the subject of a notorious 1920s murder trial , being screen-written by the prestigious Raymond Chandler and the same Billy Wilder . However , Billy Wilder and Raymond Chandler did not get along well while writing this film's script, a process that was apparently filled with arguments . As Billy Wilder didn't really get on with the famous novelist whose constant drinking irritated the director . It packs a good realization , an original script , haunting atmosphere , intriguing events ; for that reason madness and murder prevail . Fred MacMurray is superb as insurance salesman coerced into murder plot and Barbara Stanwick as predatory and alluring Femme Fatale is magnificent . Here his colleague Edward G Robinson is extraordinary and as cool as ever ; he plays as the astute and stubborn investigator , his scenes with Fred MacMurray are awesome and at their best . But Edward G. Robinson's initial reluctance to sign on largely stemmed from the fact he wasn't keen on being demoted to third lead . Good support cast formed by notorious secondaries such as Porter Hall , Tom Powers , Jean Heather , Byron Barr and Fortunio Bonanova . And Raymond Chandler's cameo , this marks the only film appearance of screenwriter and novelist Raymond Chandler .Exciting as well as complex film , possessing a mysterious and fascinating blend of gripping thriller , serenity , baroque suspense in which especially stands out the portentous performances , evocative cinematography in black and white by John F. Seitz and thrilling musical score by the classic Miklos Rozsa . The motion picture was stunningly directed by the great Billy Wilder , as the American Film Institute ranked this as the #29 Greatest Movie of All Time . The film was nominated for 7 Academy Awards but lost out on the night to Going my way (1944) by Leo McCarey. It got a deep inspiration for other films , it is particularly obvious for \u00a8Body heat\u00a8 by Lawrence Kasdan with William Hurt , Kathleen Turner and Richard Crenna . Remade for TV in 1954 by Buzz Kulik with Frank Lovejoy , Ray Collins and Laraine Day , and 1973 TV remake of the 1940s classic by Jack Smight with Richard Crenna , Samantha Eggar , and Robert Webber .",

            "content": "There are occasional times when all the elements come together to make a great film that will stand the passing of time. \"Double Indemnity\" seems to be an example of this phenomenon.First, there was a great novel by one of America's best mystery writers, James Cain, who created these characters that seem will live forever in our imagination. Then, the lucky break in getting the right man to direct it, Billy Wilder, a man who knew about how to make a classic out of the material that he adapted with great care and elegance with Raymond Chandler, a man who knew about the genre.\"Double Indemnity\" works because it's a story we can relate to. There is a greedy woman trapped in a bad marriage, who sees the opportunity when she encounters an insurance agent who is instantly smitten with her and who has only sex in his mind. The manipulator, Phyllis Dietrichson, doesn't need much to see how Walter desires her. His idea of having her husband sign an insurance policy he knows nothing about, thinking he is doing something else, will prove a fatal flaw in judgment.Mr. Wilder achieves in this film what others try, with disastrous results. The director, who was working under the old Hays Code, shows so much sex in the film with fully clothed actors, yet one feels the heat exuding from the passion Walter Neff feels for Phyllis. He is a man that will throw everything away because he is blinded by the promise of what his life will be once the husband is out of the picture.In life, as well as in fiction, there are small and insignificant things that will derail the best laid plans. First, there i Jackson, the man who shouldn't have been smoking at the rear of the train, contemplating the passing landscape. Then, no one counts in the ability of Barton Keys, the man in the agency who has seen it all! Walter and Phyllis didn't take that into consideration and it will backfire on their plan.We try to make a point to take a look at \"Double Indemnity\" when it shows on cable from time to time. Barbara Stanwyck makes a magnificent Phyllis. There are no false movements in her performance. Phyllis gets under Walter's skin because she knows where her priorities lie and makes good use of them in order to render Walter helpless under her spell.Fred McMurray makes a perfect Walter. He is consumed by his passion and he will do anything because of what he perceives will be the reward for doing the crime. Walter Neff was perhaps Mr. McMurray's best creation. He is completely believable and vulnerable.Edgar G. Robinson, as Barton Keys, makes one of his best performances for the screen. Keys is a man that has seen all the schemes pass by his desk. He is, in a way, Walter's worst nightmare, because working next to Keys, he gets to know how wrong he was in the planning of the crime.The supporting cast is excellent. Porter Hall, Jean Heather, Tom Powers, Richard Gaines, Fortunio Buonanova and John Philliber are perfect.The music score of Miklos Rosza gives the film a texture and a dimension that capitalizes on the action it intends to enhance. Also the music of Cesar Franck and Franz Schubert contribute to the atmosphere of the movie. The great cinematography of John Seitz, who will go on to direct films, is another asset in the movie. Edith Head's costumes are absolutely what a woman like Phyllis would wear right down to her ankle bracelet.This film shows a great man at his best: Billy Wilder!",

Walter Neff's already boarded that long, lonely trolley down the one-way track. Yes indeed, sultry Phyllis appears to be just the ticket he's been looking for. Great noir classic. All in all, Neff should have paid attention to that other member of the oddball triangle. Old man Keyes may be a born cynic, but despite himself, he's a father figure looking for a son to take his place, and warning Neff about the \"Margie's\" of the world. What he doesn't know is that this \"Margie\" definitely doesn't drink out of a bottle. What's more, Neff's already chosen to ride with the flashy crowd, get out of that dumpy apartment, and get into Phyllis's vicious little insurance swindle. As Keyes tellingly remarks, \"You're not smarter than the rest, Walter, just a little taller.\" I like to think that Walter finally realizes his folly in that brilliant final scene, even if it is too late. Still, the film's cynical veneer is misleading. Because beneath all the deceits, betrayals, and ironies, lies a lighted match and one of the odder father-son relationships in Hollywood annals.",

I recorded my copy off TV in 1987 so I can only imagine what a remaster would do for it. With an atmosphere thick enough to cut with a knife it never fails to engross and enchant me, and although it's been dated for 40 years or more still seems relevant and watchable today. TV, answer phones, recordable CD/DVD, memory sticks and the internet have all come between us and yet I can still watch Fred MacMurray speaking into a Dictaphone without a qualm. Who wears a hat in California nowadays? Who buys beer whilst driving! Lift attendants have gone but I can still believe in Charlie working and laughing away in the garage past 11 at night.Woman and man agree to murder woman's husband but on the way to the cemetery they face grilling by insurance company. I think everything has been said before on the IMDb - by those who think it's one of the best films ever made! To those who simply think the main problem is that it's dated I wish you could see the TV commercials that dug into DI back in '87 - what a hoot - and compare. I've just noticed the print TCM UK is showing in 2005 is lip-synced out, very wobbly Rosza music track, fading and ageing fast - worse than my 1987 video tape (maybe logically). They're supposed to be encouraging people to enjoy the classics but they won't do that with such inferior screening copies. Dear TCM UK, this is an impressive iconic film - it deserves a billion dollar remaster authorised by the Library of Congress, not repeatedly trotting out unimpressive cheap worn dupes to fill those 2 hour slots.Everything about DI from the acting, production, direction, and music is superbly dignified and is as \"close to perfection\" as human beings are probably allowed to get with this form of Art - especially with the more limited technology at their disposal in '44. When most films from now are long forgotten and dated DI will still be getting re-runs on TV and art-house cinemas - God and remasters willing - that is the fact of it.Fortunia Bonanova certainly was fortunate to have appeared in bit parts in 2 of the best films ever made - Citizen Kane the other.",

Playing against their dark alliance, it is left to Edward G. Robinson to win the audience over as he struggles to shed light on the insurance fraud and murder.\nThis script should be studied by anyone who plans to write for TV or movies. Note the significant changes Wilder and Chandler made from James Cain's original novel - changes Cain admitted were improvements.\nEspecially worthy of mention is the level of artistry displayed in the final minutes when, after an hour and a half of of bitter nastiness, Wilder gives us just the smallest spoonful of sugar that wraps everything up perfectly. There's almost something criminal when evil is such a treat to watch.",

For dialog alone and Fred MacMurray's voice-overs, this must rank as one of the best Noir films of all time. The words they say are all so carefully chosen and magnificent--the writers really did their work well. And, the acting and direction are excellent as well. About the only reason I don't score it a 10 (and it sure came very close) was that, for Film Noir, there wasn't a whole lot of action or even suspense in the movie--considering you KNOW that MacMurray is making a confession so he isn't going to get away with the murder plot. Still, these are VERY minor complaints--the film is simply great. I suggest after seeing this film you watch an episode of MY THREE SONS and see the two extremes in Fred's work--the absolute apex and the absolute nadir (if you don't know what those words mean, look 'em up yourself, ya mug).",

            "content": "Author James M. Cain virtually created a new genre with his extra-tough, sin-blackened, and sex-drenched novels--and they were so successful with the public that not even 1940s Hollywood could resist. The result was three of the most famous films of that decade: MILDRED PIERCE, THE POSTMAN ALWAYS RINGS TWICE, and DOUBLE INDEMNITY. Although POSTMAN is probably the better film, INDEMNITY is the most famous--possibly due to the story's truly psychotic edge, which is given full life by Barbara Stanwyck in one of her most celebrated performances.Like POSTMAN, INDEMNITY offers the story of a married woman who plots with her lover to murder her husband. Given MacMurray's typically \"good guy\" image, I didn't expect to believe him in the role of Walter Neff in the role of skirt-hungry Walter Neff--but MacMurray's performance is exceptionally good here, and all the more effective because it so completely unexpected. But while MacMurray has most of the screen time, it is really Stanwyck and Edward G. Robinson who dominate the film. Stanwyck is truly memorable here, and gives us a woman who seems at once sexed-up and completely frigid, at once completely natural and absolutely artificial. It is a remarkable and often disturbing effect. Robinson, who endured decades of type-casting, is equally good as the blustery, slightly comic, and absolutely honest insurance man whose job it is to ferret out suspicious claims; it is largely due to his performance, which gives the film a moral center, that we are able to buy into the otherwise off-beat performances that drive the action.This was one of director Billy Wilder's first major hits, and he deserves considerable credit for making the weird elements of the story work as a whole, keeping the film smartly paced, and heaping it up with atmosphere. So influential that its impact would be difficult to over-estimate, DOUBLE INDEMNITY is a touchstone for the entire film noir genre. Recommended.Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer",

Also superb are Miklos Rozsa's wonderfully atmospheric score, the compelling story which sizzles with romance and sexual tension and the truly crackling screenplay.The acting also is impressive. Fred MacMurray overplays slightly, but this is one of the cases when overplaying works, because he is still witty and charming as well.

            "content": "Greetings again from the darkness. \"I wonder if you wonder.\" Every time I hear Walter Neff say those words to Phyllis Dietrichson as their initial encounter concludes, I smile and settle in for another round of Double Indemnity (1944) ... one of my all-time favorites. Though I have seen it many times over the years, I recently saw it for the first time on the big screen ... and from a 35mm print! So much of the subtle filmmaking becomes apparent - the variance of lighting, the intensity of shadows, and the vividness of close-ups. This reinforces my belief that we should never miss an opportunity to view good films in a theatre setting ... just as the director intended.Since this film was released 67 years ago, it's difficult to discuss without noting a key plot point or character reaction. If you haven't seen it and plan to, you might stop reading here. If you would like a little insight, then let's keep going. Billy Wilder (left) directed the film and his place as a Hollywood legend is quite secure. He was nominated for 21 Oscars (Director, Writer, Producer) and had 3 wins. Some of his classics are: The Lost Weekend, Sunset Blvd, Witness for the Prosecution, Some Like it Hot, The Apartment, The Front Page. Many think of Wilder as a comedic filmmaker and he certainly had success in that genre, but if you watch closely, even his comedies have a dark element to them.Double Indemnity is based on the novella by James M Cain, who also wrote Mildred Pierce and The Postman Always Rings Twice. Wilder was a fan of Cain's book, but knew the dialogue wouldn't work well on screen. So together with Raymond Chandler they wrote a screenplay filled with crackling lines and a constant feeling of dread and pending doom. As great as the script is, it is heightened by a wonderful cast that includes Fred MacMurray, Barbara Stanwyck, Edward G Robinson, Porter Hall, Jean Heather, Tom Powers, Richard Gaines and Byron Barr.For me, MacMurray's performance is what brings the words to life and jumps the film to the \"must see\" category. He is playing against two Hollywood heavyweights in Stanwyck and Robinson, but we are somehow sympathetic to this not-so-bright guy who gets played like a fiddle by the villainous, wily woman he lusts after. Even as he is recording his confession, a part of us understands how he got drawn into MURDER! Not just any murder, but one for money and love ... only there is no money, and there is no love.Ms. Stanwyck is perfectly cast as the femme fatale who weaves her web of deceit and destruction. She quickly spots the vulnerability of MacMurray's character and uses her assets just enough to hold the leash tight. It is a testament to her screen presence that she can pull off the sultry siren while sporting a less-than-desirable blonde wig. At the time, the wig was so controversial that the producers compared it to George Washington and wanted it trashed. However, filming was too far along and now it's impossible to imagine her looking any other way. Besides, MacMurray only seems to notice her anklet!Edward G Robinson made a name for himself as a tough-guy actor ... cop and mobster all rolled into one. Here he plays the insurance investigator with a sixth-sense for fraudulent claims. He is a hard-nosed, dedicated employee who takes his responsibility very seriously and has no sympathy for those who cheat his cherished system. He has a soft spot for co-worker MacMurray, even though he is one of the back-slapping salesmen he so loathes. Their relationship in the film is one of respect and about as close as two professional men could be, given the era. When Robinson goes off on his rant about suicide research, he is a joy to behold. This guy could flat chew scenery.In addition to the infamous wig, you might also notice that MacMurray is wearing a wedding band throughout the film, even though his character is clearly a single man. Wilder and MacMurray stated many times over the years that was simply a mistake and not \"caught\" until post-production. Expect a chuckle when MacMurray, as the narrator, enviously describes a Spanish style Los Angeles home as costing $30,000 ... probably less than the property taxes would be on that house today. The film originally was to end with MacMurray in the Gas Chamber and Robinson looking on (inset), but this was deemed inappropriate. One last little nugget: early in the film, MacMurray walks out of Robinson's office and past a man sitting on a hallway chair reading a paperback book. That man? Raymond Chandler, in his only on screen appearance.The film is often described as quintessential Film Noir. Another prime example of Film Noir would be The Big Sleep (1946), based on a Raymond Chandler novel, directed by Howard Hawks, and starring Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall. While Film Noir might not be an easily definable term, there are certain elements that must be present. Lighting is key. Shadows must be prevalent. Some type of detective story is usually at the center, and we typically get some poor schlub of a guy being yanked around by the femme fatale. The right \"mood\" is essential ... as a viewer we know things are headed down the wrong path, but we just can't save the characters from their own poor choices. But neither can we look away. That helpless feeling is a strong indicator that you just watched a terrific Film Noir.",

            "content": "Billy Wilder's cynical self came to public attention in this classic noir film about a luckless insurance salesman and one coldhearted dame. Double Indemnity skirted the very edges of Code morality and it took years before someone brought James M. Cain's novel to the screen.According to a book on Billy Wilder the casting of Barbara Stanwyck was a must for Phyllis Dietrichson, otherwise the film might never have been made. Barbara Stanwyck was that rarest of players, one who could be good and convincing in all kinds of parts. Look at the films she got her four Oscar nominations besides Double Indemnity, Stella Dallas, Ball of Fire, and Sorry Wrong Number. Not one of those is similar to any one of the others and Stanwyck was acclaimed in all of them.Fortunately for Wilder and for Paramount's budget, their leading man was right on the lot. Fred MacMurray who has been playing comedic foils for folks like Carole Lombard, Claudette Colbert, etc. up to that time, made the most of playing the feckless Walter Neff who gets sucked into a homicidal scheme through passion.Double Indemnity is a landmark film in that it's two leads are really rotten people. Barbara Stanwyck has a husband in Tom Powers she can't stand and would like to bump him off for an insurance settlement and MacMurray's the insurance salesman she beguiles into her plot. Funny thing is that when the mechanics of the murder plot are discussed and formulated, the ideas are all MacMurray's. Billy Wilder made two other films similar to Double Indemnity where a weak protagonist gets caught up in a filthy scheme. In Sunset Boulevard William Holden plays the gigolo way to well and can't break from unto pain of death. And Kirk Douglas's scheme about exploiting the tragedy of a man trapped in a cave brings him down all the way in Ace in the Hole. I'd be hard pressed to say which of the three men was worse.The man who brings them down is Edward G. Robinson, the claims investigator in the insurance office where MacMurray works. Robinson is gradually putting the whole thing together and Wilder is at his best with the scenes of Robinson explaining the progress of his investigation to MacMurray with Fred trying to stay one step ahead.Robinson doesn't usually get enough praise for Double Indemnity. He's got a little man, Hercule Poirot has those little grey cells. Either way both are up to the challenge of solving what looks like a perfect crime. Lot's of Agatha Christie's Belgian sleuth in James M. Cain's Barton Keyes.Wilder for the one and only time in his career worked with another great mystery writer in Raymond Chandler on the script. It was not a pleasant experience for either. Chandler complained about the working conditions of Hollywood and Wilder complained about Chandler's dissipation. Both were probably right.Among the supporting cast look for a nice performance by Porter Hall who turns out not to be as valuable witness as Robinson originally thought. The man from Medford may not lie, but he's not above a little chiseling.Double Indemnity is one eternal classic it will be studied and dissected by film students for centuries.",

            "content": "What many call the ultimate film noir, the murder mystery that is spoiled at the start, setting the stage for a retelling by our protagonist of the perfect crime, is unraveled before our eyes. Billy Wilder's Double Indemnity revolves around an insurance fraud murder that appears foolproof until the seams start to tear. Walter Neff, the top salesman two months in a row, falls in love with the young wife of an oilman, a woman looking for a way to leave her troubled marriage. Who better to get away with the perfect crime then a man that sees false claims avenged everyday? Their tracks must be covered and their guilt assuaged. However, being as our first scene shows Walter confessing to everything, we know the well-laid plans were unsuccessful. The trick to the film becomes how it all went down, how the puzzle pieces fell into place, and the power of a conscience, eating away at you until you can't stand the pressure any longer.It is not giving away anything to say that the two complete the task of killing Mr. Dietrichson, a businessman with a temper. The deed is orchestrated to look like he fell off a train, a venue for accidental death that comes with a special double indemnity clause, one that pays twice the cost of his recently purchased insurance of $50,000. That money is the impetus that pushes Neff over the top to help his new mistress. Phyllis Dietrichson is the damsel in distress, the nurse of her husband's first wife that was na\u00efve and heartbroken for her boss after his loss. She says it compelled her to stay with him in a union that never held any love. The chance arrival of Neff not only opens her eyes to the possibility of a clean break without any strings and actually some cash to boot, but also to a man she can spend time and possibly settle down with. It is a strange coincidence that the Dietrichson's auto insurance was allowed to lapse, creating a house call, and a happy accident that the man called to visit was one as immoral as Walter. Right from the start he flirts and makes advances towards the woman he knows is married to his client. It's not until the end that you start to consider whether none of it was by chance at all, but instead carefully planned out and manipulated from the first second.Neff is played by Fred MacMurray\u0097a perfect fit for the role of a shady salesman, unafraid to get his hands dirty. The confidence and swagger allow us to believe he can win over the girl as easily as he does. He is the kind of guy that can fool the world into thinking he is on the level, a man of intelligence and pride. His boss, Barton Keyes and he have a very close relationship, one based on mutual respect and admiration. Neff has them all fooled into believing he is a man of character, one Keyes would personally vouch for, and his initial balk at the offer to help kill Dietrichson shows that maybe he is. Maybe there is some semblance of humanity behind the quick-witted banter and devious smile, a moral compass that won't allow him to cross the line. But greed and lust can tempt even a saint, let alone a guy like Neff, and it doesn't take long for him to begin the blueprints for what will be the perfect crime; one that not even Keyes and his keen lie detector can spot. It is that question of virtue that will ultimately undo him, though, as the strong stomach he thought he had might not be indestructible.The story revolves around MacMurray and as a result he is on screen almost the entire time. He is our narrator and our entrance point into the proceedings. However, it is not a role that we necessarily relate to, nor even begin to feel sorry for to hope he gets away with the crime. Instead, knowing about his confession from the beginning, we sit down to watch his hubris shred his world to pieces. Each person is a cog to the tale at hand; it is the plotting of the film that takes center stage and top billing. The pieces are moved and we follow them through the twists and turns and revelations that change our preconceptions of each. No one is truly as they seem and they all have an ulterior motive just below the surface, propelling their actions and attempts for survival whether the other does or not. Our two criminals are selfish at heart, but until you watch the entire journey, you won't know just how much.While the acting is definitely dated and a product of its time, it doesn't mean that it's not good. Barbara Stanwyck plays MacMurray's partner-in-crime Phyllis with equal panache. She holds her own in every situation, whether with her sharp tongue in some very funny back and forths or in her steely disposition when things get rough, it's a part that needs to be strong and is. Barton Keyes is the role that sticks with you, though. Edward G. Robinson is fantastic as the cocky claims agent, self-proclaimed as never being wrong when his gut says something isn't right. He delivers some of the best lines with such deadpan seriousness that you laugh even harder. The ego, cynicism, and attitude all add up to a man you have to respect, because under the tough exterior lies a man with heart. His dynamic with MacMurray is an interesting one, especially when seen through to the end. While they aren't completely fleshed out, each character is a detailed piece to the intricate web of deceit on display. Surrogates for the story to be shown to the audience, we watch them not for who they are, but for what they will do.",

It's true it was hard to take him seriously.A new Cadillac driving around the rail road tracks might attract some notice especially in 1939 (the year this is supposed to take place).Also you have to suspend disbelief that Mc Murray would be so smitten by Stanwyck he would attempt anything like this. She is not especially at 37 (or any age!) the most attractive woman in the world. The blond wig? I guess was supposed to make her look ?? maybe cheap or tainted. She can carry any role though plouging through it like a bulldozer.But these are so minor. I loved the movie watch it and read the other reviews.RECOMMEND HIGHLY",

Together they hatch a scheme to forge a life insurance policy on Phyllis' husband and then bump him off. The plan seems perfect, but once the deed is done Walter's nerves start to fail him and a cunning fraud investigator at his office begins to dig a little too close to the truth ...Billy Wilder's career was just a bit too acclaimed and strewn with accolades for me, but this classic adult film noir is deserving of all the praise it receives. The script, by Wilder and Raymond Chandler, is a dazzling adaptation of James M. Cain's pulp fiction classic. The murder sequence is both exhilarating in its detail and chilling in its realism - these are not gangsters or psychopaths, but ordinary people who do something monstrous borne out of lust and greed. Both MacMurray and Stanwyck (despite a silly blonde wig) give career-best performances which are charming, dazzling, amusing and chilling, all at the same time. Stanwyck is the ultimate cold-hearted femme-fatale (just pipping Lana Turner and Rita Hayworth in my opinion), and right from the moment she first appears (dressed only in a bath-towel), she eats up the screen. MacMurray is brilliant as Neff; a sap, but not a fool, who learns all too late he doesn't have what it takes to be a killer, and that women are never quite what they seem. Both are surpassed however by old pro Robinson as the wily claims investigator, who can smell a phoney setup a mile away. Robinson is amazing; a man for whom facts and statistics are never wrong and rule human nature, at least when it comes to money - a sad but profound truth. Equally good is the extremely dark photography by John Seitz (see also Sullivan's Travels, This Gun For Hire, Invaders From Mars and many others), with daring foreground shadows (Neff looking out his apartment window), stunning use of closeups (the big one of Phyllis while the dirty deed is being done) and many rule-breaking moments (when the husband is talking and signing the forms the focus should be on him, but it's on Phyllis). Best of all is Chandler's ricochet dialogue, which revs up the frisson and tumbles crookedly out of the actors. There are too many classy lines to mention, but my favourite is when Phyllis says, \"I wonder if I know what you mean.\", and Walter hits back with, \"I wonder if you wonder.\". Although movie adaptations of Dashiel Hammett's books kick-started this genre (The Thin Man, The Glass Key, The Maltese Falcon), this is the pivotal Hays-Code-ignoring lurid murder potboiler of the forties, followed by such greats as The Postman Always Rings Twice, Deadly Is The Female/Gun Crazy and D.O.A. (and later Blood Simple and Red Rock West). This is a stylish, extremely well acted movie of a great book, and a real treat for all fans of classic crime fiction.",

            "content": "Spoilers herein.Filmviewing is like most things in life: there are a few predefined roles among which it is convenient to pick. Once you define who you are in the world of cinema, it determines a lot of what you think about what you have just experienced. One of these roles is the type who by watching a film becomes part of its original audience, or rather a stylized nostalgic notion of what that audience was. Thus the film is a mere trigger, not necessarily important itself. There seem to be lots of these, people who consider this film as not only enjoyable, but the apogee of film noir, which itself is (in this view) the most movie-like of movies. Noir, romances and musicals attract these folks, as do legendary celebrities.You may be one of these types, but I am not. I expect the film to transport me to its own world, not the world of original viewers. As a noir classic, it fails for me. I do think the dictaphone framing is very effective, and the thumblighting of the matches. Also of historical note is the then odd perspective on the detective form: at the beginning you know who did it. You soon learn why. How isn't very interesting. The way the detective gets the scent is purely conventional, but the focus on the hapless perpetrator was relatively novel in its time. The game is one of following this hapless goof through his ensnarement in forces beyond his control. His strong (and we learn misplaced) cockiness, apparent through the aggressive banter is the stylistic spice that is supposed to carry the notion.But that device is pretty thin stuff. And except for the dictaphone bits, the dialog and acting are poor by conventional standards. Stanwyck isn't seductive or particularly deep. I fail to see how the lighting could be considered masterful, when so many other noir masters are around. `Touch of Evil' is excessive, but that's the point with noir -- at least noir that works today.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 4: Has some interesting elements.",

The film's imagery is filled with shadows and low lighting, accompanied by a tense, brooding music score. Stanwyck spins her web of ensnarement like a black widow with her victim seemingly unaware of the danger that enfolds him. MacMurray provides the narrative of the film which is told in flashback and delivers a cryptic account of the events in a confession to a boss who trusted him completely.

            "content": "Double Indemnity is based on a novel by James Cain adapted to the screen by great novelist Raymond Chandler, who made here his most important contribution to the cinema history in his career, though somehow matched by following screenwriting work for 1946 Howard Hawks' classic The Big Sleep, and Billy Wilder, who previously worked as a screen writer for Ernest Lubitsch and had been already nominated three times for Academy Awards in the process before making Double Indemnity, which nevertheless played the key role in establishing him as one of the best writer-directors in Hollywood, and giving him his fourth Oscar nomination as a writer and his first one as a director.Double Indemnity was the third feature Wilder directed after 1942 The Major and the Minor and 1943 Five Graves to Cairo, but it was definitely the first film, his primary American tragedy where the author for the first time revealed his black and somehow hopelessly pessimistic view of the American society and of the human society in general, blackishly desecrated in the film simply by populating it with exceptionally sordid characters, who independently of being a victim or victimized, of being the protagonists or just simple supporters are never really able to transcend the utterly low and devilish motivations in theirs as a consequence sordidly painful lives and reach such a state where the viewer might get relieved by considering one of them as a positive element. Instead the characters' lives shown in a continuous noir flashback of Fred MacMurray's not-a-confession are driven from the start to the very end by an utter greed in a form of double and not only indemnities with consequential and inherent to it risks and fears in a rather unsure world of insurance.An insurance salesman Walter Neff (Fred MacMurray), a man with `no visible scars', starts to lose his already shaky dominance over his mind's yearnings when glimpses on a horizon a possibility of becoming a recipient of a monetary fortune along with no less seductive desire from a part of unhappily married and as devilishly beautiful as resourceful in pursuing her zany in its deadliness schemes, an ultimate femme fatale blond Phyllis (marvellously portrayed by Barbara Stanwyck).Initially apparent as a romantic, the relationship gradually mutates into double confrontation of the two fears of the two characters in their greedy and ambitious pursuits, a conflict which at one point apparently results in a sort of humanization of Phyllis' character, appearing hiding the eyes of her soul behind the sun glasses, a humanization which is let to happen by her only to accentuate later her unchangeably fatal nature.The double confrontation gradually evolves into a triple one when the threatening presence on the scene of no less and probably more resourceful character of Barton Keyes (Edward G. Robinson) becomes more and more evident, as a result of his continuous and obsessive investigation conducted with different but nor less ambitious motives. A motives which find its ultimate revelation in a most touching, but finally most hypocritical scene of declaration of love (I love you - I love you too) between Walter Neff and Barton Keyes in the end, exactly reflecting the same nature of previous interactions between Walter and Phyllis, where such moments with the very words used, such as the supreme word of loving affection - Baby lowered to an unthinkable extent, only were a mere preparation to struck another blow in yet another outburst of hate caused by a new misfortunate complication in carrying out so well devised and apparently perfect plan.\nPermeated right from the start to the very end with the flavour of unstoppable fatality in an extent that a few other film-noirs achieved, accentuated by the wonderful music score by Miklos Rozsa, Double Indemnity's story is motored by the money like in nearly all of Billy Wilder films. But in this case all the misery produced by it as evident as never before resulting in utter corruption of already corrupted characters and their descent into a such a deep abyss of human misery as probably never before or after in a Hollywood film history, an abyss with no exit, with omnipresent hypocrisy, with no place for sincere human feelings of love, friendship or affection, an abyss to where the characters descent under the monotonous tune of Miklos Rozsa's score, which serves as a reflection of their monotonously hypocrite and ultimately doubly doomed lives. 10/10",

            "content": "Double Indemnity is considered by many to be the first movie in the noir genre, a category of films that often feature female characters who are likely to endanger the lives of men they get into relationships with. I don't really think it's true that this is the absolute first noir ever made, since Two Seconds starring Edward G Robinson was released back in the 30s and featured many of the things we associate with noir today. That's not to say Double Indemnity is unoriginal. It definitely has enough of an interesting and dangerous storyline to hold the viewer's attention constantly. The movie stars Fred MacMurray, Barbara Stanwyck, and Edward Robinson in a smaller role. Even when he's not featured as prominently as the other actors, he manages to be one of the most enjoyable parts of the movie. The story is told as a flashback, which means it returns to where it started by the time the film is over. Walter Neff (MacMurray), is a man in the insurance business, and is trying to sell car insurance to people by walking into their houses and making a pitch. One day, he comes across Mr. Dietrichson and his wife, Phyllis (Stanwyck). Everything appears to go well, until sometime later when Phyllis makes some comments regarding her husband's life insurance without him knowing. This convinces Walter that she is trying to murder him, but not just that. Walter eventually becomes involved and comes up with a scheme that will invoke a \"double indemnity\" clause, which states the life insurance company will cough up more money to Barbara as compensation for Mr. Dietrichson's death. The problem is, both her and Walter have to make it look like an accident or it won't be worth it. Later on, Walter hides in the back of Phyllis' car when she is driving her husband someplace, and he kills him. Walter then pretends to be Mr. Dietrichson by using crutches to board a train and then jump off when nobody is looking, making it look like a suicide. The spot he jumps off at has Barbara waiting for him, and they promptly drag Mr. Dietrichson's real body into place. Despite the scheme just being carried out very recently, it's already causing commotion at Walter's workplace. His boss believes Dietrichson killed himself, but Keyes (Robinson) is not so sure. He ultimately comes to the conclusion that Phyllis is at least partially guilty of something, and his reasoning for this is the fact she has been seeing another man behind her husband's back. Keyes can't prove this, but it would make his whole theory come together. Meanwhile, Lola (Mr. Dietrichson's daughter) is understandably distraught by the loss of her father and starts to become a thorn in Walter's side as well. She tells him how her mother died in the care of a negligent nurse who actually turned out to be Phyllis. Because of this, she is absolutely convinced Phyllis had a hand in killing her father. With both Lola and Keyes searching left and right for clues about Phyllis being a murderer, Walter decides it's time to lay low and cuts off communications with her for a while. He's not even allowed to call her since Keyes may have sabotaged the phones. Things get worse for Walter when Keyes calls him to his office one day to meet the same exact person who saw him jump off the train the night he pretended to commit suicide, although the witness doesn't recognize him. Once cleared of suspicion, Walter goes to Phyllis' house to tell her they are through. He also says he knows she is seeing another man behind his back. Phyllis shoots him, but Walter survives and feigns attraction toward her, allowing him to shoot her as they hug each other. Back at his office, Walter starts talking into a dictaphone (which is how the movie begins), and Keyes shows up to call the police on him. This is a great movie. The plot is not very complex once you realize it's essentially about Phyllis trying to get money from the death of her husband, but there's so many twists throughout that it seems complicated. Unexpected turns in the story are one of the things that define noir movies, and there's a lot of that on offer here. The great music composed by the Hungarian Miklos Rozsa is one of the best aspects of this film, since it is very dramatic and fitting for the constant conspiring Double Indemnity has. The dialogue is smartly written and the cast of characters are memorable, mainly since there are not many of them. Fred MacMurray plays Walter very well, accurately depicting his frustration (and excitement) as he is drawn deeper and deeper into an illegal scheme with his female acquaintance. Barbara Stanwyck as Phyllis acts as both a friend and later a rival to Walter, the latter becoming more visible as the film goes on. At first, she looks up to him as a beacon of hope who is capable of liberating her from her bleak life with an abusive husband. Later on, Walter claims his boss knows too much about their scheme and must abandon it, making her incandescent with rage. You can't forget Robinson either. Even though he's a lesser character in this movie, he appears consistently throughout many of its scenes. He's the one that takes the initiative when it comes to proving Phyllis caused the death of her husband to collect insurance money. Perfect writing, great characters, an interesting story, fitting and dramatic music, and all released to audiences before noir was really a genre. There are many reasons why Double Indemnity can be called one of the best noirs ever made, but these are the ones I chose.",

Robinson) does not buy the version and suspects that Phyllis has murdered her husband with the help of another man.In my opinion, Billy Wilder was the greatest director of Hollywood ever, directing many masterpieces including \"Double Indemnity\" among them. This is the second time that I see this magnificent film-noir, now on DVD recently released in Brazil (the first time was in the cable television, since this masterpiece has never been released on VHS in my country). The story and screenplay are stunning, disclosing a sordid story of lust, love, greed and betrayal. Fred MacMurray, Barbara Stanwick and Edward G. Robinson have magnificent performances. The cinematography is simply spectacular, with an awesome use of lights and shadows and the music score completes one of the best movies Hollywood has ever produced. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): \"Pacto de Sangue\" (\"Pact of Blood\")",

            "content": "\"The Maltese Falcon\" is generally considered to be the very first film noir, but Billy Wilder's \"Double Indemnity\" is the first GREAT noir. With actors that perfectly understood Wilder's penchant for black as tar humour, this film is as seedy, dark and many times funny as they come. Barbara Stanwyck is a knockout as the classic femme fatale, complete with cheap blonde wig and ankle bracelets. Fred MacMurray makes a terrific dope, his silly machimso preventing him from realizing that Stanwyck is one step ahead of him through the entire film. And Edward G. Robinson shines as usual in a small but important role.For me, this film breaks new ground in the hard-boiled/detective/murder mystery genre. I believe it was a bit of a flop when it came out, but that's easy to understand. Films that in retrospect prove themselves to be cutting edge are frequently dismissed at the time of their release. \"Double Indemnity\" doesn't have the look of other studio films of its period, not even other gritty detective films of its period. The lighting is stark and grimy; you can almost see every speck of dust in the shafts of light slanting in through the windows. Wilder gets the feel of a corrupt L.A. just right. But even more than its look, the film is years ahead of its time in its moral tone. Not only do the characters in this film not find redemption, they appear to be unredeemable. Each shows him/herself to be colder and more cynical than the other, and there's a \"Bonnie and Clyde\"-like inevitability to their eventual fates.Simply sensational. And watch for the list of \"supposin'\"s MacMurray and Stanwyck throw back and forth at each other in one scene. It's hilarious and perfect, and those who've seen the film will know exactly what I'm talking about.Grade: A+",

            "content": "James M. Cain's 'Double Indemnity' is one greatest crime stories ever written. It's not even novel length, only 80 pages or so, but close to perfect. I approached the movie version with some trepidation. I was aware that it was regarded as a film noir classic, and Billy Wilder is a great director, but I was put off by the casting of Fred MacMurray and Barbara Stanwyck in the lead roles. I grew up watching endless re-runs of 'My Three Sons' on TV so MacMurray was the last person I could imagine to play tough guy insurance salesman Walter Neff, and Stanwyck is one golden age actress I've never warmed to, and I don't think she was anywhere near as seductive enough to play Phyllis. However I needn't have worried, both actors are excellent, and screen legend Edward G. Robinson steals every scene he is in. A few things were changed from Cain's original novella by Wilder and collaborator Raymond Chandler, especially the ending, which is nowhere near as dark and pessimistic as the book version, but I have no complaints, as a movie it is close to perfect. 'Double Indemnity' is without doubt one of the best crime movies I've ever seen, up there with 'Rififi', 'Out Of The Past', 'The Killing', and a handful of others. Highly recommended.",

            "review_title": "Collusion with Angora",
            "content": "In 1943, director of the film, \"Double Indemnity\", Billy Wilder, was painstakingly determined to complete a motion picture about this compelling novel written by James M. Cain. Cain is known for other great novels such as \"Mildred Pierce\" and \"The Postman Always Rings Twice\". In the process of creating this major motion picture, several actors, including George Raft and Alan Ladd, turned down the job as the sinister leading male role in this movie. Finally, the part was offered to squeaky clean, Fred MacMurray, this appointment is literally, out of character for MacMurray! Barbara Stanwyck received the honor for the lead female role in \"Double Indemnity\", and Edward G Robinson was given the third billing as a star in this picture. This post of third billing was something that had not happened to Edward G Robinson since his prior acting days before \"Little Caeser\", which was made in 1931. Robinson capitulated to a third billing spot because he had a great admiration for the concept that the film \"Double Indemnity\" so intricately purported! The whole genre to \"Double Indemnity\" was set up flawlessly, as it orchestrated a deliberately contradictory dynamic. Behind the sunny pleasantry of Los Angeles, there lurked a deep rooted and conniving chicanery amidst a couple of masterminds who began implementing a horribly dark aspect of human behavior. The film, \"Double Indemnity\" manifested the rough exterior that the United Staes was besieged with because of their involvement in World War II. The American movie goer had become a little less naive since the advent of WWII, and, this reflected itself accordingly with regards to the type of movie they wanted to see. The film noir captivated the American public, and, now, the movie industry encompassed a myriad of wry depictions that were germane to the pejorative side of an individual. This dubiously sensationalistic technique by the motion picture industry was perceived as intriguing by the newly enlightened movie audience of the early 1940's!! The film \"Double Indemnity\" epitomizes the entire film noir pique, right alongside with the uncanny masterpiece \"Maltese Falcon\". \"Double Indemnity\" did not win for best picture in 1944, that year, the Academy Award was given to \"Going My Way\". As we all know, there are times when life simply does not make any sense, especially since a prominent Philadelphia critic rated \"Going My Way\" the worst Academy Award winning film in the whole history of the American cinema! \"Double Indemnity\" is considered to be Billy Wilder's best directing effort! The next year, Billy Wilder's directorial ability was totally vindicated, as he received his rightfully deserved acclaim with the film, \"The Lost Weekend\", which won for best picture in 1945. Billy Wilder received the Academy Award for best director that year as well. The film, \"Double Indemnity\" is truly remarkable!! The itemized and avaricious intensity to this movie was something that had not been depicted in films before the movie \"Double Indemnity\" was made. This film's wiles of malice and deceit were not expedited with a derivative and visceral disposition, rather, these antics were carried off with a dedicated fervor and paramount gratification. Fred MacMurray's character was perpetually afflicted with a relentless angst that infiltrated an acrimonious reveille to him about the primary repercussions of personal greed! His character, Walter Neff, endured a narrative agony which perpetuated a compulsive pontification about how people really are, as opposed to the way they are suppose to be! Barbara Stanwyck established her formidable status as a revolutionary femme-fatal in the Hollywood world of movies, with her performance in \"Double Indemnity\". Charismatically charming while wearing her diverse onslaught of angora sweaters, her beauty and allure became a necessary ingredient to the making of this film! The wig that Barbara Stanwyck wore for this movie, signified the overall mendacity to her heinously lethal and obsessive persona!! Stanwyck's intellectual ambiguity to this role was attributed to her overtly callous set of pecuniary priorities! Edward G. Robinson's character was the perennial voice of reason. Robinson was the legal eagle who would ultimately prevail in his tenacious quest to resolve all of these dubiously manufactured and felonious escapades! The final scene with MacMurray and Stanwyck was an all-time noir classic. This last scene with MacMurray and Stanwyck was one of the best scenes of any movie whatsoever, definitely head to head with the extraordinary last scene of the movie \"The Killing\". A respected production company ranks this ending the sixth best ending of any and all movies ever produced! The dramatic ending to \"Double Indemnity\" was rated right above \"Casablanca\" and right below \"City Lights\". The heightened glamor to the final scene for MacMurray and Stanwyck exuded a zenith within the realm of the classic film noir mystique. The emphatic, yet subtle, overtone to the song \"Tangerine\" playing in the background, became a melodic element to this final scene which was conducive to a sexually sedate form of apocalyptic doom and despair! Throughout the entire duration of this movie, Fred MacMurray and Barbara Stanwyck were always seducing each other with salacious innuendos! This ending wound up emulating a philosophical perspective used by writers of ancient Greek tragedies! Filming a movie in black and white is primarily advantageous to the quality of a film, as it obviates any disorientation to the impact of the characters' emotions!! AFI (AMERICAN FILM INSTITUTE) ranks \"Double Indemnity\" the 29th best film out of the top 100 American movies ever made! This website ranks \"Double Indemnity\" 53rd out of the top 250 films ever produced. Last, but certainly not least, America's Writer's Guild East, ranks \"Double Indemnity\" the 26th best written script ever in the history of American films!! The director, Billy Wilder, does a tremendous job with consummating the aggregate megalomania and rancor to this movie. The acting was sensational. \"Double Indemnity\" was up for seven Academy Awards in 1944! Without question! \"Double Indemnity\" is one of the greatest films ever created... FIVE STARS... PERFECT TEN!!!!",

            "review_title": "A Brilliantly Written Classic",
            "content": "\"Double Indemnity\" is a great movie with many great attributes but foremost among these must be its scintillating screenplay which combines wit, intelligence, razor sharp remarks and double entendres in such an effective way that, as well as being immensely entertaining, it also contributes strongly to driving the pace of the story. The quick fire dialogue and superb repartee are so engaging that they command the attention of the audience right from the start and also provide added impetus to all the action that follows. Billy Wilder and Raymond Chandler collaborated in adapting James M Cain's story for the movie and the end result was nothing short of brilliant and was understandably nominated for the Academy Award for Best Writing, Screenplay in 1945.The characters featured in this evil tale are very memorable and in the case of the two main protagonists are also very immoral. Walter Neff (Fred MacMurray) is a fast talking insurance salesman who goes to visit a client and in his absence meets his wife Phyllis Dietrichson (Barbara Stanwyck). Their first encounter during which Dietrichson appears dressed only in a bath towel, leads to some flirting and their relationship develops further when Dietrichson eventually convinces Neff to take part in a scheme to sell her husband an accident policy (unknown to Mr Dietrichson) and then to murder him so that the couple can collect the insurance money and enjoy a future together.Neff advises that the policy will pay out double if the fatal accident occurs on a train and so, when Mr Dietrichson is due to go on a business trip, arrangements are made for him to travel by train. Neff carries out the murder and dressed like Mr Dietrichson (complete with crutches) takes his place on the train journey before the couple place the body on the tracks to give the impression that Mr Dietrichson died as the result of an accidental fall from the observation car of the train.After having carried out their plan successfully, the events that follow conspire to introduce a series of complications which lead to the couple losing their trust in each other and also to the movie's dramatic conclusion.Fred MacMurray is perfect in his role as the very self assured Neff who's corrupted by lust and a greed for wealth. His portrayal of someone who thinks he knows all the angles but whose confidence is gradually eroded as things start to go wrong is very convincing and Barbara Stanwyck is also excellent as the cold, manipulative seductress who is utterly ruthless and seemingly devoid of any human feelings. Edward G Robinson appears in the role of Barton Keyes, a claims investigator who works for the same firm as Neff. Barton is very experienced and incredibly good at his job and possesses a strong instinct which enables him to sense immediately if a claim is likely to be fraudulent. He and Neff enjoy a longstanding friendship which involves a good deal of warmth and mutual respect. Robinson's performance is outstanding as he delivers some super-fast speeches and conveys the nature of his character's idiosyncrasies with great panache.In typical film noir style, the story is told in flashback with Neff's narration providing a particularly matter-of-fact account of what happened. When he says \"I killed him for money and for a woman. I didn't get the money and I didn't get the woman\", there's an inherent poignancy in his words but the delivery is completely lacking in any sentimentality or self pity. The same can be said for his remark that \"we did it so that we could be together, but it's tearing us apart\".\"Double Indemnity\" is a dark thriller which became the prototype for many later movies which told similar stories but rarely with the same style and impact as the original. Billy Wilder's direction is superb and especially successful in contributing to the high levels of suspense that are generated at various junctures throughout the action. This is a film of rare quality and one that, because of its subject matter, will undoubtedly continue to be a source of great entertainment and fascination for movie lovers for many years to come.",

            "content": "As this classic film noir begins protagonist Walter Neff returns to the insurance office he works at; it is late at night and he is clearly injured. He sits down and starts to record a confession; he starts by saying that he had helped a woman kill her husband for the insurance money. The action then flashes back and we see the events from the moment of his first meeting with femme fatale Phyllis Dietrichson when he flirts with her while visiting to remind her that her husband's car insurance needs renewing. On their second meeting she brings up the idea of taking out accident insurance without her husband knowing\u0085 he knows she is talking about murder and walks out but inevitably they meet again and start to plan how they could do it. Walter decides it must be done on a train as a clause in the policy doubles the payout\u0085 of course with that sort of payout the company will investigate very closely and Walter's friend Barton Keyes always figures out what happened.This year may mark the seventieth anniversary of Double Indemnity's release but it does not feel dated. The opening scene lays out what is going to happen but even though we know Mr Dietrichson will be killed and that Keyes will suspect the wrong man it is still tense from start to finish. Fred MacMurray put in a nicely understated performance as Neff; a surprisingly likable character given that we know what he is going to do. Barbara Stanwyck was great as Mrs Dietrichson; a less pleasant character but even she is initially sympathetic initially. The third of the main cast Edward G. Robinson is a lot of fun at Barton Keyes; possibly the only good main character. Director Billy Wilder does a great job bringing the story to the screen; the atmosphere is great. Overall I thought this was a great film; any fan of classic cinema is sure to love it.",

            "content": "Double Indemnity is one of the most famous film noir classics of all time, but I absolutely hate the beginning! Fred MacMurray, bleeding and panting, stumbles into his office and turns on a recorder. He starts his confession, and then the film goes back in time to relive his story as he tells it. I've never liked movies that go back in time because I've never been able to forget the beginning that has pretty much ruined the ending. It was in the back of my mind that Fred MacMurray will do something terrible and get very badly wounded-so the suspense of the flashback was killed for me.While there's nothing wrong with Fred MacMurray's or Edward G. Robinson's performances, Barbara Stanwyck was terribly miscast. I think she's a fantastic actress in many different roles, but an irresistible femme fatale is not one of them. Lana Turner, yes, or Linda Darnell, but Barbara Stanwyck just doesn't pull off sexy in this movie as she did in other films like Clash by Night. Plus, her haircut in this film is bad enough to turn any man away, not attract them! I don't know why those ridiculous bangs were ever popular. However, if you've never seen this classic and you like femme fatales, corny voice-over narration, and stupid men who are easily swayed to the dark side by a pair of legs, you should probably watch Double Indemnity to see where it all began.",

Shot in low-key black and white, a crooked hero, a scheming femme fatale, great-looking bars of shadows and lights from the venetian blinds, good (if not always very good) performances and a marvelously overripe show by Edward G. Robinson coming up with a face-reddening tirade in front of his boss before grabbing a glass of water out of the guy's hand and saying politely, \"You mind if I have this?\" This is one of those films that is better than the novel it's based on. James M. Caine seemed to have even less time for flowery prose than Hammet or Hemingway. \"She did this. Then she did that. Then she looked there.\" Could he have sent the ms. To his publishers as an unusually long telegraph?The ending is an improvement over the novel as well. Instead of committing joint suicide the lovers deliberately double-cross and murder one another, which is more in keeping with their previously established characters. It probably is more congruent with the director's sentiments too. Fred MacMurray, the Illinois sax player, was given a good deal of credit for his performance, as dramatic as it is and as remote from his usual type, but it doesn't stand up that well. He's competent. But when he wants to project an emotion he does so like a hunting dog, some kind of setter, aiming at it bluntly. In his conversations with Keyes, whenever Keyes seems to be catching on to something, MacMurray stands sort of crabwise and looks out of the corners of his eyes, as if trying to alert the audience to the fact that, \"I am now concerned and a little suspicious.\" Barbara Stanwyck comes as close as she can to a sex bomb, which has never been very close, except perhaps in \"Ball of Fire,\" and the puffy blonde wig and tight sweaters don't help very much. Tom Powers, as the unpleasant husband, has a face that suggests he spent some time in the ring. Jean Heather is pretty in a corn-fed kind of way but doesn't light up the screen.Actually, the most interesting character in the film is Nino Zachetti. He provokes unusual reactions in others. He's a real loser. Flunked out of USC pre-med, waits on tables, treats his girl like dirt, insults people on first meeting them, conspires with Phyllis against Lola and Walter while evidently enjoying her favors, and probably is unkind to small animals. Yet Lola's love for him endures. And Walter muses about Nino, \"Maybe he's not as bad as he seems.\" I suspect the real tragedy takes place after Walter and Phyllis are dead and the movie ends. I see a marriage taking place, after which Lola becomes a bored, unhappy drudge and Nino Zachetti turns into a coarse, alcoholic wife abuser who spends all his time brooding over revenge fantasies that somehow revolve around USC Medical School.",

Stanwyck is hardly ever helpless. She plays the quintessential femme-fatale, as she seduces insurance salesman Fred MacMurray into her web and entices him to kill for her. The target is her husband. That's all you really need to know.

Many people will invest a lot of time in Billy Wilder's stylized technique of movie-making and his attention of each minute detail and the incredible dialogue and script, co-written by Raymand Chandler, and perhaps Fred MacMurray's best performance on screen, but while all this is true and all these factors come together to make a perfect film. One of the biggest factors is Edward's contribution to this film. The words on the page burst forth, when Edward says them. His tirades about death statistics bring life and breath to the film in contrast to the other two, who are somberly serious and only thinking about how to get out their problems alive! The balance of \"hammy\" Edward and his outbursts conveying joy, revelation, frustration and feeling about his job and his \"little man\" and \"Papa,\" solving each mystery, along with the walking dead characters make for a mesmerizing movie experience. I have praised the always professional and exceptional Stanwyck before in other reviews. To go on any further with anything would be redundant; this is Billy Wilder and his cast's finest hour.",

            "content": "Spoilers hereinDouble Indemnity is another piece of classic film noir with all the classic elements of mystery, plotting, femme fatales and snappy dialogue. I just finished watching it and I have to say it's possibly the best I've seen.Not only is it a beautifully and craftily worked noir story but also a complex fable about greed and revenge, remorse and regret. From the moment it starts you know it's going to hit you, and it certainly does.Fred MacMurray plays insurance salesman Walter Neff, who relates the story to us by leaving a memo for his claims manager Keyes, played by Edward G Robinson. His intermittent voiceovers take the guise not only of the narrator but also of Neff's conscience as he retells the story of his involvement in the murder of his client Dietrichson after he plotted with Dietrichson's wife. They thought it would be the perfect murder, but as Keyes so rightly points out, no murder is perfect. It comes undone sooner or later, and when there's two people involved, usually sooner. Particularly in this case as Mrs Dietrichson and Neff begin to plot against each other. It becomes less about claiming the insurance money and more about which one, if either, gets away with the murder.As you can tell from my clearly blithering attempt to ruin the plot, it's a fantastic film. You come away from it and you want to ruin the ending for someone else because it's just so exciting. Billy Wilder directs with absolute precision, he blends perfectly the romance, frequent suspense, and dramatic irony dispersed throughout the film in absolute drones. The fact that Neff is present in all but one of the scenes in the film is a constant reminder of the irony of the story, the fact that he is involved on all sides and in all facets of the plot.Barbara Stanwyck also plays one of the best femme fatales I've ever seen on screen, it's not only a masterful performance but a masterful character in itself. The success of this film owes a lot to both her performance and the way the script works her in. Fred MacMurray is occasionally overly winsome at the start of the film, however, he definitely pulls his performance together at the end and it is not enough to detract entirely from the overall effect.A crafty, enjoyable and suspenseful film noir filled with anti-heroes, mystery, morals, and just good all-round entertainment. Not quite perfect but about as close as it can come. ****1/2 / *****",

            "content": "This is Billy Wilder's masterpiece. Though \"Sunset Boulevard\" is a great movie, it has a few script holes that \"Double Indemnity\" does not have. For example, in \"Double Indemnity,\" Walter Neff admits at the beginning of the movie that he has killed a man. He does this by dictating into a machine. He then proceeds to tell how it happened. This could very likely take place in the real world. In \"Sunset boulevard\" a corpse is floating in a pool; the corpse begins through narration to tell how it ended up dead. This is a major flaw since dead people don't tell tales.The only other film noir thriller that even comes close to capturing the essence of the genre is \"Murder, My Sweet.\" The lines in that movie are almost as clever and memorable as the lines in \"Double Indemnity.\" Interesting that the two were released the same year (1944), one based on a James M. Cain novel, the other on a Raymond Chandler novel. There are so many catchy lines in \"Double Indemnity\" that aid the viewer in understanding the inner workings and machinations of the characters that they fill almost the entire film. IMDb provides the best lines under \"quotes.\" My favorite because it so defines the relationship between Neff and his boss Barton Keyes is toward the end when Neff stands before Keyes totally exposed. Neff states,\"Know why you couldn't figure this one, Keyes? I'll tell ya. 'Cause the guy you were looking for was too close. Right across the desk from ya.\" Keyes knowingly replies, \"Closer than that, Walter.\" The father, son relationship of the two men is now broken forever and the tragedy of the severed bond is apparent.Everyone involved in this movie both before the camera and behind the camera give their inspired all to make this film one of the greatest in cinema history. True, it may rightfully be classified film noir, but the total picture transcends labeling. It is so much more than just the best film noir movie. The three leads could be no better. They play their parts perfectly. The much underrated Fred MacMurray who was so often relegated to minor features was a gifted actor. He stays on top of it all and truly equals the inspired performances of Barbara Stanwyck, the ultimate femme fatale, and Edward G. Robinson in his best role ever. Edward G. Robinson plays the penultimate insurance actuary. He knows the statistics inside and out. He can recognize a false claim almost immediately. Neff knew this but he let another part of his body rather than his brain do his thinking for him. He is completely blinded by love and lust. And what a name given him by Wilder, Walter Neff, so common it compares with the name Willy Loman for some of the same reasons. He is too weak to withstand the wily maneuvering of this cold, callous yet greedy woman, who knows how to shake that thing. He is doomed from the start. In the end everyone loses, even Keyes. He will never be the same man again. He cannot dismiss Neff the way he dismissed all the other frauds and fakes. A part of himself has been removed permanently.",

            "content": "From the first time he sees that ankle bracelet, Walter Neff (Fred MacMurray) is a doomed man. As Phyllis Dietrichson (Barbara Stanwyck) descends her California home's spiral staircase, we are as enraptured as Neff. And it takes little time to figure out that being enraptured by this femme fatale is a very dangerous position to find oneself in. Is it accidental that the bracelet is worn around her ankle, as opposed to the more traditional wrist? Is it accidental that the sunlight streaming through the windows cast shadows not unlike bars across the living room? I suspect it's about as accidental as Mr. Dietrichson (Tom Powers) eventually ending up dead along the railroad tracks. We must remember that Billy Wilder is doing more than evoking noir here, he's inventing it. And how brave he is! Beginning the film by all but divulging the ending is hardly the route most directors choose to go when directing a thriller. But as he's well aware, the audience doesn't care half as much about where they end up as they do about the thrill of the ride it takes to get them there. The structure of the film is familiar to anyone who has seen \"Body Heat,\" or any other knockoff. \"Double Indemnity\" is the original however, and it's intricate plot revels in its complexities nearly as much as Walter and Phyllis do in their convoluted plot to dispose of an unwanted husband. The audience learns only a minimum about the relationship between Mr. and Mrs. Dietrichson, but we easily surmise that their union was not out of love. If the marriage was one of convenience, than the murder certainly is. It seems unlikely Phyllis is after the freedom to continue her heady tryst with Walter, and even the money provided by the double indemnity clause of Mr. Dietrichson's life insurance policy seems more like a bonus than a motivation. In other words, Phyllis just wants her husband dead. And Neff obliges. Several times while watching \"Double Indemnity,\" I felt my pulse physically quicken. These scenes were most notably the ones in which it looked as though Walter and Phyllis' trolley car had finally reached the end of its line, and discovery of their crime was inevitable. The scene where Phyllis is forced to hide behind a door, knowing that incrimination awaits if the person on the other side sees her, is unrelenting in its suspense. After all, we want this reprehensible act to go off without a hitch every bit as much as they do. That is the sign of a good film. It also stands to reason, seeing as how we were there when the elaborate scheme was being plotted. That makes us accessories. And if they get caught, God help us, so do we.",

            "content": "Double Indemnity begins with a car speeding on a dark, rainy night.  This begins the classic film noir plot.  Billy Wilder directs a steamy and grabbing film.  Billy Wilder pulls this film together with an awesome cast, perfect lighting and an amusing script.  Fred MacMurray plays Walter Neff, an unsuspecting insurance salesman.  He is unsuspecting in the sense that he is unaware of what the \u0091femme fatale' is going to put him up to.  Barbara Stanwyck plays the \u0091femme fatale', Phyllis Dietrichson, a manipulative housewife who will stop at nothing to get what she wants.The film begins in present day giving insight into Walter's current plight. Walter Neff gives the voice over as the plot unfolds.  It starts in the present time allowing the audience to know what crime has happened without the interesting details to support it.  This is an interesting twist to the common film noir plot.  Knowing the crime at hand keeps the audience hungry for those details.  Walter is the victim of the beautiful woman who manipulates him into pulling off a murderous insurance fraud scam.  Walter is an impeccable insurance salesman and Phyllis, in some ways, forces him into providing her with what she needs.  Phyllis is the typical \u0091femme fatale' who has no problem in using others to get what she wants.Throughout the film Walter is completely enamored by Phyllis.  Walter could have coined the pet name \u0091baby' with his fondness towards Phyllis by calling her that throughout the film.  He is easily distracted by her beauty and evil charm.   He seems to be entranced by Phyllis's ankle bracelet, so much that he mentions it numerous times.  This allows the audience to feel the sexual tension between the two.  Phyllis, on the other hand, shows the audience that she can use and abuse anyone who gets in her way.  While believably attracted to Walter, Phyllis keeps him hopping to fulfill her needs.  She pulls him in and handles him like a puppet.  She is the epitome of the film noir genre's \u0091femme fatale'.Barton Keyes, played by Edward G. Robinson, is Walter's co-worker and friend at the insurance company where he works.  Barton closely investigates all insurance claims that come across his desk.  While at one time Walter assuredly agreed with this practice, once Barton starts to unravel the mystery behind Mrs. Dietrichson's insurance claim, we begin to see just how nervous and paranoid Walter is.  Walter then begins to see Phyllis in a whole new light.  Barton plays the integral part by piecing together details that are thrown around throughout the film.  This keeps the tension high for the filmgoer.  These details are pieced together perfectly through to the end.Double Indemnity has the perfect plot with the perfect cast.  Walter and Phyllis' attraction are tasty and the crime is wonderfully puzzling. Double Indemnity is the true film noir giant.",

            "content": "Billy Wilder's earlier vintage work, DOUBLE INDEMNITY is an unapologetically thrilling film- noir, without any fluffy fillers, this morally shocking murder tale has justified itself as a textbook exemplar of how cinema is able to be a heavyweight platform to narrate a story, apart from all those auxiliary foils (both visually and sonically), the marrow here is a neat but impeccable script (by Wilder and Raymond Chandler).The impending tragedy has been explicitly unraveled since the very beginning, the storyline starts as a flash-back, our protagonist, Walter Neff (Fred MacMurray), suffering from a bullet wound in his shoulder, has stated that he neither got the money nor the woman after executed a ruthless murder, then the film jumps to the overture to delve into the details of Walter's fated encounter with Phyllis Dietrichson (a gracefully confident Barbara Stanwyck to portray a standard femme-fatale character), as an insurance rep, Walter is smitten with her and assists her to murder her wealthy husband so as to get the so-called \"double indemnity\" insurance compensation. The murder scheme certainly is not the most difficult part, the real challenge is after the evil conduct, in one hand, Walter's super-acute superior Keyes (a bona- fide scene-stealer Edward G. Robinson) who gradually detects the real motive after the presuming accident death; on the other hand, the more devilish past of Phyllis suggests that there is an even bigger conspiracy is under the way.One could never argue that the script is prodigiously witty and most notably is Keyes' eloquence in harnessing his professional intuition (\"the little man inside\") to find out the loophole behind any ostensibly qualified insurance cases. It's quite unimaginable that Robinson had been snubbed for a supporting acting nomination while the film has acquired 7, including BEST PICTURE, DIRECTOR and LEADING ACTRESS (without win though); while MacMurray, had been eluded by the Academy throughout his wholesome career, potentially had delivered his best work in depicting an ambiguous figure with all he had; Stanwyck's role is a tad feeble due to her not-too-copious presence but she is just marvelous to watch with each gesture and expression entangled with her own breed of complexity, but the final convolution of her heartlessness-turns-soft tactic is a self-conscious compromise, woman falls prey of a man's world is just an illusionary chimera, which has been haunting us until this moment and will thrive on and on.",

There's not an ounce of superfluous material anywhere in this tightly plotted film classic about a wealthy middle-aged woman named Phyllis Dietrichson (Barbara Stanwyck) and an insurance salesman named Walter Neff (Fred MacMurray). The two of them conspire to kill Dietrichson's heavily insured husband, to cheat the insurance company out of a fortune. \"Double Indemnity\" is my all-time favorite noir film.The film's entertainment derives, in part, from the fact that we, as viewers, get to peek into their murderous scheme, and then watch both of them squirm, when their scheme starts to unravel. An undercurrent of paranoia permeates the plot, as the two incessantly look over their shoulders, as it were, to see if anyone has picked up on their plans or actions. And there are plenty of plot twists and turns. The dialogue is brisk, decisive, and memorable. Walter Neff gives one of my favorite lines: \"How could I have known that murder could sometimes smell like honeysuckle?\"The film's excellent structure is organized around Neff's confessional, spoken into a Dictaphone and directed at his insurance company boss, Barton Keyes, played by the inimitable Edward G. Robinson. Much of the story is then told in a series of flashbacks from Neff's POV, as he narrates his liaison with Dietrichson.The film's terrific B&W cinematography, with its use of lighting texture and shadows, adds to the dark mood, and to an overall feeling of danger and deception. The visuals neatly correspond to the inner lives of the two main characters. The film's direction and casting are perfect. All of the acting is top notch. And the score is edgy, erotic, and at times appropriately menacing.There are a few minor plot holes. But who cares? The concept, story, characters, structure, and dialogue are so cinematically strong that they overwhelm any slight defects. And with topnotch film direction, casting, acting, cinematography, editing, and score, the result is a powerhouse film that will entertain viewers for at least the next ten thousand years.",

            "content": "Double Indemnity was made during an innovative and challenging time for American Cinema; it was a film noir telling a story of sex, murder and deceit, all things that were definite no-no's in the eyes of the notorious Motion Picture Production Code: the legislation barring Hollywood from exploring 'undesirable ideas' that could influence the masses. Thankfully, Billy Wilder took this story and ran with it, making a classic in the process and it wasn't tainted by the 'Code' either.Double Indemnity is like a grim yet gorgeous black-and-white painting in motion: It's a story exploring Los Angeles in the 1930s showing that deceit and morality are abundant even in the picaresque world of Hollywood. It's a purely done morality play that shows sex, murder and other bad temptations one would have when trying to start an affair without repercussions. It's got great staging, punchy dialogue and the sets are superbly designed and well-lit that really makes the film noir vibe of the film really pop!Walter's monologues don't feel like pointless exposition, but more like 'songs of thought' that compliment what's going on in the film. It's a well done cautionary tale that's endured for so long because it's one of those 'brainy' films that knew how to fully exploit its characters and world without making anything feel redundant.Double Indemnity gets 5/5 stars.",

            "content": "The classic \"Double Indemnity\" is one of the greatest of all \"film noir\" movies, and it has everything you could ask for: great acting, interesting characters, an imaginative plot, and lots of tension.  Put all this under the direction of the incomparable Billy Wilder, and it's one of the best films of all time.The three lead actors all give terrific performances.  Fred MacMurray is at the center of everything, as an insurance salesman tempted in more than one way by an alluring customer (Barbara Stanwyck).  MacMurray's character is torn between what Stanwyck offers, and his close relationship with his company's claims manager, played by Edward G. Robinson.  MacMurray is excellent in portraying his struggle between his desire to grab the illicit pleasures offered by Stanwyck, and his deep admiration for Robinson as a person and as an example.  Stanwyck in turn is perfect in her role as a woman who uses everything she has to get what she wants.  Robinson's performance may be the best of all in bringing his character to life - a straight-arrow, perceptive and diligent worker who also comes across as a thoroughly enjoyable character.The three leads are so good that the film gets away with some occasionally dated (overly \"hard-boiled\") dialogue in some of the voice-overs and confrontation scenes.  The actors were in such good form, though, that they were able to make any line sound pretty good.The rest of the cast all have much smaller parts, but they all fulfill their functions well, especially Porter Hall in one of his many fine character roles, and Richard Gaines, who is perfect as a clueless insurance company executive.Wilder uses his skilled touch to complete the atmosphere of intrigue and suspense.  The overall result is a great film noir whose characters and tensions are as alive today as they were in the 40's.  It is worth watching over and over.",

            "content": "Wilder's astute direction, a cracking tale of murder and deception taken from James M Cain's pulpy novel, an appropriately dark atmosphere, and the lethal combination of Stanwyck/MacMurray and Robinson in support combine for a stunning film noir.MacMurray gives possibly the best performance (definitely the most well-known) of his career as the insurance representative Walter Neff, a weak-chinned chump who lets himself get talked into a murder-for-insurance scheme by the duplicitous double-crossing dame Phyllis Dietrichson (Barbara Stanwyck), who's not very fond of her older hubby at all.Stanwyck's femme fatale performance is pure dynamite. She's fake and trashy yet alluring with her tart blonde hair (Stanwyck wore a wig), sweetly seductive voice and mesmerizing (to Neff, anyway) anklet. This girl's motives are purely selfish, covered by a pretence of romance, and she is apt to quickly change her line of attack to get what she wants. One moment, Stanwyck is \"crying softly\" on MacMurray's shoulder like a lost little lamb- the next, she is spitting venom like an angry cobra.'Double Indemnity' possesses an amazing script filled with plenty of juicy, hard-bitten dialogue and double entendres. Stanwyck and MacMurray's interactions always have a smoky sexy undercurrent punctuated by cracking one-liners.MacMurray's protagonist provides the voice-over so common to the noir genre. It is one of the best you'll hear, with MacMurray narrating the circumstances of his own downfall with a resigned, yet smooth manner. Great use of lighting and shadows- this film has amazing visual style; it looks foreboding.Robinson is a great in a supporting role as claims manager Keyes, who, after the couple commit their crime (knocking off Barbara's old hubby), quickly gets wise that his death was no accident. It was murder- and Keyes is determined to snuff out the criminal. He suspects Stanwyck from the start, but is oblivious to Neff's involvement. Here, with Robinson and MacMurray's characters, we have possibly the first open declaration of love between two males in the cinema. When Keyes finds out about Neff's involvement, there is no vicious air between the two men. Instead, a kind of hurt, disappointed sadness.One thing I found really nice amidst the dark deeds was Neff's relationship with Dietrichson's daughter, Lola (Jean Heather). As his world is crashing down around him, Walter finds some sort of ironic comfort with the distraught young girl, whose mother and father have both died under suspicious circumstances (Hello, Phyllis) along with her boyfriend being suspected in her father's murder. Ironic indeed, as Walter was one of the perpetrators of her pain. But one feels that their relationship has an underlying purity to it, so we accept it. She is the girl Neff should have taken up with in the first place. After all, Neff is our resident \"poor sucker\". It's that black-hearted witch Phyllis who we have to blame.Or is it? Neff could have backed out of the plan at any time, he was just weak and caught in the clutches of a powerful woman in control. Stanwyck merely activated MacMurray's long-held desire to crook the system. Phyllis does redeem herself to a degree near the film's conclusion, but it's too late for both lovers.The original of a type of crime flick that has been copied relentlessly over the years, 'Double Indemnity' is definitely one of the best, tightest noirs I've had pleasure to view .",

            "content": "Double Indemnity (1944)Double Crossing True LoveThe are a million reasons to love this movie and a million people who have already said what they are: tight filming, great plot, fabulous acting, and the beginning of a new, truly American genre of movies: the film noir.This isn't the first crime film with noir qualities, but it has two key ingredients: a man with a morally sound core led astray, and a woman (the femme-fatale) leading him astray. I suppose you could interpret this in sexist ways, or as an extension of Adam and Eve dynamics into our century. Not that Adam killed Eve in the end, as far as we know.As an example of classic, early noir this is notable for coming before the war had ended, and it lacks the most common thread of the man coming from some unknown past (life as a G.I. or just life somewhere unspecified), but in a way Fred MacMurray's main character, who leads the whole film, is comparably adrift. Maybe he represents that man left home during wartime, feeling out of place for the simple reason of not being over there, somewhere. And maybe living in a separate morality.MacMurray is cast perfectly, even if he was a second choice by director Billy Wilder. His bumbling intelligence, his compromised morality, his giving in so easily (if easily is the word after the murder) all make sense, and they might not with a Mitchum type of stronger character. Even his inner morality, and his ability to say \"I love you\" at the end, to the character who he clear does love, are convincing. And a movie with this many fast twists has to be convincing as much as it is dramatic. Barbara Stanwyck? Cold and deceptive at her best, making Mrs. Dietrichson truly horrid. But highest kudos goes to the insurance investigator, the third main character, Edward G. Robinson. The screen bristles and bursts whenever he comes on, and he seems overdoing it and yet not a bit overacting. It's just a scintillating performance. John F. Seitz is brilliant behind the camera (proven here, absolutely, but also in Sunset Blvd and many other films, see the listings for the late 1940s for the classics). Music, editing, and most of all, smart, snappy direction make the film tight and truly great. The only small thing that might hold it back from that top edge of the most moving films is some weird sense of skimming the surface of all these emotions and conflicts. They are issues of plot more than character. Yes, we hear Neff with the voice-over recasting the events from his plaintive and regretful tone, and that works brilliantly. But Stanwyck, especially, comes across as simply cold. We never quite feel why she's the way she is, we just accept it. The daughter strangely makes more sense than the mother, though her role, and her impact on the film, are both small. Finally, relating all of this together, I don't ever buy into their passionate love--of course hers is fake all along, but Neff is supposed to throw everything away for the Mrs. Dietrichson, and we swallow that, too, without tasting why.But quibbles, quibbles. One measure, for me, of a great movie is if I can watch it again even when I know the plot. And this one I can, I did, and you should.",

In comedy he made the excellent \"Some Like It Hot\" and \"Irma la Douce\"; he also made the romantic \"Sabrina\"; \"Sunset Boulevard\", \"The Apartment\" and \"The Lost Week-End\" were his contributions to drama; \"Stalag 17\" is a war film; \"Witness for the Prosecution\" is a great mystery thriller; all memorable products in the history of Hollywood.With \"Double Indemnity\" he obtained what is probably the ultimate Film Noir. There's not much to add about this extraordinary movie to what I\u00a8ve red here in other comments. Just that I never was a fan of Fred MacMurray and yet I have to admit he does a very good job in this one (perhaps his best ever along with his treacherous and false navy officer in \"The Caine Mutiny\").Billy Wilder was indeed a very talented man as a movie maker and also had an undeniable skill for recognizing a good story when it came his way. One of the great directors ever, no doubt.",

            "content": "*Possible Spoilers!* Released in 1944 - Double Indemnity's story of vicious betrayal may be somewhat flawed and inconsistent - And, its 3 principal actors may have been miscast (especially Barbara Stanwyck as the deceitfully wicked femme fatale in a really cheap-looking wig) - But, overall, it's quite easy to see why this vintage, Hollywood Crime/Drama is considered to be a true \"classic\" of 1940s Film Noir.Containing plenty of loaded dialog, shadowy settings and frequent flashes of well-timed tension, Double Indemnity's story of murder and deception comes together quite nicely like that of a master jigsaw puzzle where all of the scattered pieces of its plot-line eventually become one.Even though I view Double Indemnity as essentially a \"Chick Flick\", its story is told (chiefly in long flashbacks) by a man who was directly involved in this double-crossing crime-of-passion that went seriously haywire.Fred MacMurray plays Walter Neff, an over-confident, yet naively gullible insurance salesman, who, thinking that he's got it all figured out, gets played for an all-time sucker when the seductive, well-to-do Mrs. Dietrichson snares him into a diabolical plot to kill her husband in order to collect $100,000 through the double indemnity clause in his life insurance policy.Needless to say, once Neff gets himself completely tangled up in a web of establishing alibis (while setting the wheels of the \"perfect\" crime into motion), things literally begin to come apart at the seams once he inadvertently learns about the treacherous activities (both past and present) of the calculating and conniving Mrs. Dietrichson.Filmed in glossy b&w, Double Indemnity's story was co-written by the famed crime-novelist, Raymond Chandler. It was directed by Billy Wilder, known for such other notable films as - Sunset Boulevard, Stalag 17, The Seven Year Itch, and Some Like It Hot.",

Since the movie was made by Hollywood, one could reasonably expect the movie to be intellectually shallow, poorly acted, contain an insipid love story, and be altogether entirely forgettable. In other words, another potboiler. But as much as I wanted to, I couldn't find anything wrong with this movie! This movie is terrific! Fred MacMurray (the gentleman from My Three Sons) plays one of the great heels in Hollywood motion picture history. Barbara Stanwyck ( who was from Brooklyn, New York) is at her sinister best. But the real star is Edward G. Robinson. His performance as the the insurance actuary Walter Neff is incredible. How many movies are there that portrays an office bureaucrat as a hero? That is what makes this movie so unique. This movie is a tribute to all the office workers of the world who push the papers, compile the facts, analyze the information and keep things going. Maybe if NASA had listened to their Walter Neffs, the 1986 Challenger disaster would have been averted. Who knows? But after watching this movie, one thing is certain: respect your office workers because someday they may save your life ... and your business.",

The acting is in top form from all of the players.  The cinematography is crisp, and beautiful.  The sound is nice and clear, and the direction is arguably some of Wilder's best.  However, the real star is the screenplay.  First off, it was taken from excellent source material.  James Cain is always great for a story where nobody wins out.  Check out The Postman Always Rings Twice for an example.  But it is Chandler who I think really put this one on the map. Chandler has a way with dialogue that makes it all ring in your ears.  The lines are smooth, and the characters always say something that makes me wish I could be that clever and smooth in everyday situations.  Chandler knows dialogue, Chandler knows LA, and Chandler knows how to deliver a story. Check out any of his novels, and you will see this.

They flirt a little, but when she starts inquiring about taking out a life insurance policy on hubby without him knowing about it, MacMurray gives her the brush-off; no matter, she looks him up in the phone book and winds up on his doorstep! Canny, clever murder-plot concocted by director Billy Wilder and Raymond Chandler, via James M. Cain's novel \"Three of a Kind\". Cain, who also penned \"The Postman Always Rings Twice\" (which this plot has a faint trace of), masterfully knew how to create sultry, no-nonsense broads who get what they want, and Wilder's handling of Barbara Stanwyck in this role is sensational. MacMurray, on the other hand, always looks about to blanch, and his character (savvy on customer relations) falls prey to Stanwyck mighty quickly. As Fred's boss, Edward G. Robinson does well with a sketchy character, though his wordy summations and 'intuitions' are just plot contrivances, pushing this story along to its inevitable conclusion. \"Double Indemnity\" is not without flaws, and has become overrated in the previous two decades, though it is ripe with scintillating, low-life dialogue and does build suspense even though we all know where these characters are headed--to the cemetery! *** from ****",

            "content": "\"Double Indemnity\" is a 1944 film directed by Billy Wilder, and it's a classic. The plot has been around forever - a beautiful woman seduces a man because she wants him to help kill her husband. What Wilder does with it demonstrates his mastery.Wilder's genius starts with the casting of Fred MacMurray, Everyman if there ever was one, as Walter, an insurance man. A boring profession and what appears to be an ordinary, albeit attractive man who is also a good salesman. Barbara Stanwyck is Phyllis, the femme fatale. Blonde with a beautiful figure, an icy, challenging manner, and a seductive voice. Edward G. Robinson is Keyes, the insurance investigator and good friend of Walter's. Dogged yet warm as he follows clues to what he believes is a murder and not an accident.There's nothing tender about the MacMurray-Stanwyck love affair, and Stanwyck delivers her lines in a cold, calculating way - the same way she does the love scenes. Walter comes off as fresh at first - what salesman would flirt with a married woman as obviously as he does - but he probably realizes when Phyllis appears wrapped in a towel that she probably wants him to. There's nothing spontaneous about Phyllis asking about life insurance for her husband; it's been on her mind since Walter showed up to renew the car insurance. The minute she says she doesn't want her husband to know about it, Walter knows what she's up to. Though their plan is brilliant, Keyes is smarter than they realize.I love the way it's introduced into the plot that Phyllis was the first Mrs. Diedrickson's nurse and that Lola, Phyllis' stepdaughter, suspects Phyllis hurried her mother's death along. I also love Walter's cold feet as he becomes interested in Lola - but it's too late.\"Double Indemnity\" can only be described as compelling - it's not action-packed but there isn't a wasted or slow second. Stanwyck, who could be a very likable actress, plays a real conniver, and she does so brilliantly. MacMurray gives a relaxed performance - he's actually perfect casting, as one can see how easily he gets sucked into Phyllis' plan. Edward G. Robinson is the film's anchor as Keyes, who is like a father to Walter but also a man who takes his job very seriously. He's determined to get to the truth of the case, and every word he says is like chalk on a blackboard to the guilty Walter.Wilder's brilliant direction and pacing shows in every frame, and the surprise ending is the icing on the cake. A great noir, a dream cast, a great director, Hollywood at its very best.",

            "content": "There have been, to date, a whopping 350 user reviews of this classic and much imitated \"film noir\" production, so I am tempted to critique at least some of these many attempts at analysis rather than the film itself, but I won't. The achievement of a film to inspire so much of an impassioned response from viewers speaks for itself.If the script is \"silly and laughable\", as one recent reviewer seriously contends, then the laugh is on the reviewer because some of the dialogue was written deliberately to be comical in places, especially when lines begin with the word \"suppose...\" or when they repeat the term \"straight down the line\". To the contrary, I found the script, written by the director himself and Raymond Chandler, to be very snappy, especially when it was so adeptly brought to life by three of the best actors of their time, Stanwyck, Robinson, and MacMurray, in no special order. I especially enjoyed Mr. Robinson's pontificating soliloquies that boasted of his character's extensive knowledge of the risks of the insurance business. Who else but EGR could have succeeded as well in this amusing exercise, and so far beyond the gangster profile that he has established so indelibly in our minds? Beyond his familiar \"well tailored, sophisticated thug\" image, the fact is that Mr. Robinson, who viewed himself more as a stage actor than a film star, excelled in every movie role that he ever tackled, gangster or otherwise. I could list them all here, but I won't.As much as I enjoyed the three wonderful lead actors, I also appreciated all of the meticulous details of the director, Billy Wilder, including minor but memorable characters such as the talkative elevator man (\"They wouldn't sell me a policy...\"), Netty, the Dietrichsons' disheveled maid (\"They keep the liquor closet locked up,\" and who could blame Netty for needing an occasional nip while employed by this miserable pair? ), Mr. Jackson, the witness (\"I'm a Medford Man--Medford, Oregon, that is!\"), and Nino Zachetti, the angry young man who bitterly resents how he has been cheated by society but walks away without appreciating just how lucky a fellow he actually is. Even the scenes in the food market allowed us an authentic glimpse of everyday life in wartime 1944 Los Angeles, revealing, among other tidbits, that farina packages haven't changed very much in 74 years.The film unfolds as a series of flashbacks with periodic breaks in \"present time\", including the beginning and the end. As Barton Keyes (Robinson) suggests at one point, the film itself is very neatly \"wrapped up in tissue paper...pink ribbons on it.\" Unlike many other movies of its \"noir\" genre, it is relatively easy to follow without distracting us with unnecessarily convoluted plots that we don't have to struggle to understand in the first place.Neff's questionable character is revealed from the start as he has no qualms about destroying a marriage and a family until Lola, Dietrichson's daughter, pops up to challenge his conscience. His fatherly relationship with Lola and then his compassionate assistance to Zachetti, her boyfriend, demonstrates that Neff isn't completely morally depraved as much as he is weak in the face of temptation. Regardless of how disagreeable Dietrichson, his victim, is, Neff can't redeem himself from his crime by being nice to Lola and Zachetti. It is not an even exchange. This exercise in portraying a morally flawed but repentant weakling is refined by the actor a decade later in MacMurray's role of Lt. Tom Keefer in \"The Caine Mutiny\". Then, six years later, MacMurray takes immorality to a new level in \"The Apartment\"' as the shamelessly dishonest Jeff Sheldrake, who is totally void of introspection. For those who only know MacMurray as the understanding father in the television series \"My Three Sons\", you ain't seen nothin' yet!Although I was fully absorbed in the action, Neff's ability under extraordinary pressure to get Jackson out of the observation car just in the nick of time seemed improbable to me. Didn't he and Phyllis consider the possibility that a possible witness would be there who was unwilling or even incapable of leaving on time? And wouldn't the coroner have established early that Dietrichson was the victim of strangulation rather than an accidental death? I'll leave it to you to decide. And, furthermore, did Phyllis actually undergo a \"change of heart\" just before she was able to fire a second shot? Should it make a difference to us by then? I think not. Nothing could ever redeem this babe--or that wig.",

It's testament to Fred MacMurray's acting ability that his character continues to hold the audience's sympathies despite his murderous behaviour, while Edward G. Robinson brings warmth and humour as his boss. The real star, of course, is the script, written by Billy Wilder and Raymond Chandler, which screams quality throughout.

            "content": "This film hits the screen like a well trained Olympic runner with comfortable shoes who can feel the gold around his neck before his heels are even in the blocks.  It's what they call `film noir,' because from the opening frames you know that the guy doing the talking is looking at a no-win situation, that he's going to lose and lose big.  Oh, sure, he knows it now; everything you're about to see has already happened, his goose has already been cooked, and now he's going to tell you about it, let you in on what went down, how it went south and why.  He'll even give you the heads up on the irony of the whole thing right out of the chute, how like our Olympic runner he could feel the gold in his hand before the ink on the insurance paper was even dry-- yeah, that's right it was an insurance scam, see, and a good one too-- all the bases were covered and checked for chinks, but in the end-- and here's where the irony comes in-- in the end, he didn't get the money and he didn't even get the girl who put the whole thing in motion.`Double Indemnity,' a classic `noir' thriller in anybody's book, was directed by Billy Wilder, a guy who knows all the ins and outs, ups and downs and double shuffles of the business better than a short jockey on a tall horse.  He's the `go to' guy in a game like this, because he knows all the angles, he knows the lingo and more than that, he has the insights to make it play out like it was the real deal; this guy knows what makes people tick, what motivates them and it's an ace up his sleeve that he plays like a trump card when the chips are down or even if a stack or two looks like they're about to go over.  He knows the whole layout, from top to bottom and side to side because he wrote the script along with another guy you might have heard about, Raymond Chandler, another member of the club who just happens to know his way around the block and back again.  This is a guy who doesn't need a road map to tell him which way to go; he's the guy who `invented' the map.  And when a couple of the boys like Wilder and Chandler get together to make it up and put it down, it's as good as in the can, especially when they're getting the skinny in the first place from James M. Cain, who it just so happens wrote the novel this movie's based on.  Besides which, they got the names Fred MacMurray and Barbara Stanwyck down on the dotted lines, the ones that count, the ones that say they're the ones who are the stars of the picture, see?  Let's face it, that's like having Ruth, Mantle and Mays in the outfield at the same time with Sandy Koufax on the mound and Don Drysdale warming up behind him in the bull pen.  The opposition might as well climb back on the bus and take the long ride on the short pier, because Wilder's team already has the big `W' next to their name in the box score.Like I said before, and I'm going to say it again because if there's one thing I've learned during my time on the planet it's that sometimes people just don't listen, or maybe there's some things they just don't want to hear.  But like I was saying, this story's about an insurance scam, a dirty deal that all starts when Mr. Walter Neff (MacMurray), a salesman with a head a couple of sizes too big for his hat, makes a house call and runs into a dame, and not just any dame; her name is Phyllis Dietrichson (Stanwyck), a woman with the kind of beauty that stops traffic, turns heads and makes monkeys out of guys like Neff, guys that think they got it knocked when all the time they're standing in quicksand and don't even know it till they're in up to their ears and gasping for that last breath.  But that's the name of the game; Neff isn't the first guy to find his tiller on the wrong side of the mule because of a pretty face, moist lips and the sweet smell of perfume that sells it all like the siren's song, and he won't be the last to have the deal closed by promises of something that never will be and never has been, though it's victims are heaped along the side of the carefree highway like mounds of bark dust just waiting to be spread or lost in the wind.Maybe that's not a pretty picture, but everything can't be a glossy print on Kodak paper, and you can take that to the bank because history's full of stories like this.  Let's face it, Monet didn't have good eyesight, Van Gogh was down an ear and neither Mona nor her sister Lisa knew how to smile.  And when a pair like Walter and Phyllis get together to cook a stew, there's always a Barton Keyes (Edward G. Robinson) waiting in the wings for them to screw up, take a wrong step or flash a tell that attracts a guy with a nose for fraud like a metal rod drawing lightening.It takes some real `pros' to play the game at this level, and that's Wilder's team all right; but he needed some support to win this big, and he got it from the likes of Porter Hall (Mr. Jackson), Jean Heather (Lola), Tom Powers (Mr. Dietrichson) and Byron Barr (Nino).  This film will give you the kind of ride a Six Flags park could only dream of, and that's what makes `Double Indemnity' one you're going to remember like a first kiss on a warm night in summer.  10/10.",

I finally got my chance with \"Double Indemnity,\" which helped establish the genre as we know it. The expected elements are all here: Shadow-filled black-and-white cinematography. An ordinary man (Walter Neff, played by Fred MacMurray) who becomes an amoral criminal under the influence of a femme fatale (Phyllis Dietrichson, played by Barbara Stanwyck). Abundant cynicism, pessimism, and fatalism. Tough, stylized dialogue, including voice-over narration with a kind of hard-edged poetry to it.However, because in the 21st century we see film noir parodies more frequently than the real thing, we've been conditioned to laugh at some of the excesses of the genre--especially this sort of narration. Thus, lines like \"How could I know that murder could sometimes smell like honeysuckle?\" or \"I got to thinking about what cemeteries are for--they're for putting dead people in!\" strike us as much funnier than they were probably intended to be. Instead of helping create a dark, gritty atmosphere, they actually jolt us out of the movie by prompting our scoffing laughter.In short, \"Double Indemnity\" does a great job of establishing the rules of the world in which the story takes place, but we now have trouble accepting that world on its own terms. And I do believe that this movie was intended to have some humor to it--but of the grimly ironic kind, not the \"isn't this a little ridiculous?\" humor we find in it today.Still, there is much to admire about \"Double Indemnity.\" It has a very strong plot--simply but elegantly constructed, and even though its general outlines get revealed within the first five minutes, the movie always remains interesting. The relationship between Walter and Phyllis is intriguingly ambiguous--it's not clear whether they are motivated by lust, greed, or something else entirely. (Roger Ebert's Great Movies essay has some noteworthy theories about this, and made me realize that this ambiguity is an asset, not a flaw.) Most impressive and unexpected is the character of insurance-claims investigator Barton Keyes (Edward G. Robinson). Though Keyes functions like a detective, his role doesn't indulge in any \"film-noir detective\" clich\u00e9s. Instead, he's the most real-seeming person in the movie: rumpled, gruff, blustering, detail-obsessed, highly conscientious, and very funny. And gradually, the film reveals that the relationship between Walter and Keyes is even more complex and interesting than that between Walter and Phyllis.\"Double Indemnity\" will always be watched because of its role in establishing the conventions of film noir, but more importantly, it's still an entertaining movie--even if, sixty years later, it's sometimes entertaining for reasons the filmmakers never intended.",

            "content": "If there is a keyword I would describe Double Indemnity, its dialogue. Exposition is a very tricky line to cross; when done poorly it can come off as immensely frustrating but when done right it can be music to the ears, leaving me dying to hear more like I'm watching an engrossing documentary. Throughout Double Indemnity with the use of narration, Fred MacMurray will explain what's clearly appearing in the frame but as nobody does narration quite like Billy Wilder. Instead of making Double Indemnity coming off as a movie which feels the need to dumb down and explain everything to the viewer, this expositional narration comes off a poetry, enhancing any scene in the film. Even with hearing noir dialogue parodied countless times, it doesn't affect my enjoyment of the movie.I've generally never thought much of Fred MacMurray as an actor; he strikes me as serviceable but never an enigmatic screen presence. His role as Walter Neff in Double Indemnity is the one major exception in his career. This casting against type may be my favourite one-hit wonder performance ever; his uttering of the words \"Baby\" and \"Hello Keyes\" never gets old. When I first watched Double Indemnity I assumed MacMurray must have been an icon of film noir, turns out he was anything but. Barbara Stanwyck was a sexual siren in a number of her films, I'm not aware of what Stanwyck's ideological or moral beliefs where but a number of her films are some of most sexually suggestive old Hollywood films I've seen. There is her pre-code work such as Baby Face but in the postcode era, she appeared in the code breakers Ball of Fire, The Lady Eve and yes, Double Indemnity. In her introduction scene as Phyllis Dietrichson, she is dressed in a titillating manner with her legs crossed while wearing a skirt, almost expecting her to pull off a Sharon Stone in Basic Instinct. Culminating this trio of actors at some of their greatest work is Edward G. Robinson as Barton Keyes, the claims expert. When watching his performance I don't feel like I'm watching someone playing a claims expert, I feel like I'm watching an actual claims expert. Double Indemnity offers an intriguing insight into the profession of the insurance salesman but like being a lawyer, I'm sure this is one job which Hollywood makes out to be more exciting than it actually is.Like a number of films in the noir genre, the ending is revealed at the beginning of the movie, leaving me not wanting to know how the film ends but rather how the story and characters got to that point and boy, am I dying to know. For an example of one of the film's suspenseful scenes, take the moment in which Phyllis arrives at Walter's apartment to discover Keyes is also there. All within a single frame Phyllis is hiding behind the door with Walter trying to prop it open and Keyes in the background. When Keyes walks towards the door and there is a bump in the music score, it's moments like these which get the blood rushing, yet they look so deceptively simple.Why do Phyllis and Walter agree that honking a car horn three times a signal when that would easily draw attention? When a plot hole or nonsensical moment (Or Barbara Stanwyck's wig) doesn't bother me in the slightest, it's a testament to how great a movie is: not affecting the movie's heart racing, tearing the leather of the sofa's armrest levels of suspense from start to finish. Why are so many people dismissive of old movies? Because they are corny and cheesy? Few other movies pose such an aurora of cool as Double Indemnity, baby!",

He soon finds himself (initially resistant) in the middle of a murder plot. As is the case with film noire, he becomes her lap dog, thinking that he is somehow going to earn her love. We don't need much imagination to know that things aren't always as they seem. The strong women of Hollywood had more of the femme fatale in them in those days, even the leading ladies who normally played desirable parts. Think Bette Davis or other minxes who got their own ways. MacMurray and Stanwyck cook up a plot to get some insurance money in a double indemnity situation, where the right kind of situation results in double the money. Sometimes the characters are so full of themselves that they can't see the forest for the trees. What does Fred offer this lady; is she so bent on giving him what she wants. This is a classic film with great characters, dark moody sets and music, and a really cool plot. MacMurray does all the dirty work and we have this tale laid out after he is shot. The camera is in its glory, even today.",

            "content": "Some cinematic matches seem made in heaven, no matter how discordant they may prove on Earth. Such was unquestionably the case with legendary writer/director Billy Wilder and author Raymond Chandler, when paired up to craft a film adaptation of a dark, seedy novel by James M. Caine, dealing with such rich cinematic potential as deception, double-crossing and murder. While the feuding between Wilder and Chandler was legendary, each despising each other's methods and taking any possible opportunity to ridicule each other, their cinematic concoction, Double Indemnity, was even more legendary. One of the most pitch perfect noir thrillers of all time, each component of the film fits together seamlessly to create a flawless slice of dark movie magic which has lost none of its atmospheric punch and poignancy when viewed in a contemporary setting, over sixty years later. Double Indemnity proves unlike any other films of its time, as the film's tension is extracted not from the question of whether or not the lurid scheme of the central characters will succeed, but instead through the sickly knowledge that they are fated not to, inviting the viewer to watch the whole sordid affair unfold, to see each piece fit disastrously into place. From the opening titles, the film positively drips with fatalism between MacMurray's grim voice-over to the sublime noir lighting, all creating a pitch perfect mood of unease and despair. The masterful technical work is matched by the perfectly honed screenplay by Wilder and Chandler, delivering an engrossing treatise on greed, lust and their abilities to ensnare and corrupt while cleverly mixing cynical introspection with snappy banter and the kind of exquisitely stylized lines filmmakers simply could not pull off now (see the dynamic, thinly veiled \"speeding ticket\" sexual innuendo exchange between Stanwyck and MacMurray). The idea of walking an audience through the planning and execution of a murder was a virtually unprecedented one, but the ingenious daring of Wilder and Chandler does not stop there. Not only does the film empathize with the murderers, Dietrichson for personal gain and Neff as much to shake up the prescribed order of things as his sordid infatuation with her, but also demonstrates how exhilarating and, crucially, entertaining the act of killing could be. Bathing the viewer in a seedy world of secret encounters, lurid sexual acts and casual violence played up as darkly fascinating as opposed to downright immoral, Wilder and Chandler choose to side with characters who ordinarily would have filled the roles of cinematic villains, with the lawful figure Keyes instead played almost as grotesque antagonist, blithely subscribing to a system revolving around asphyxiating order fated to collapse. Though evil is eventually punished, not only is it seemingly predisposed to overcome good, the film seems to silently state, but it is more interesting anyway - a pitch black, endlessly captivating moral stance which has lost not a shred of potency. The casting of lead character Walter Neff carries a similar parallel story of infamy to the film itself; a series of successful stars passing on the role, concerned about the implications of humanising an unrepentant killer. The final casting choice, perennial nice guy Fred MacMurray playing decidedly against type proved simply brilliant, as MacMurray inhabits the role like a cool leather glove, his fast talking salesman veneer carefully concealing a deadness in his eyes, a forever looming darkness barely veiled. MacMurray accomplishes the truly laudable feat of taking a downright unsavoury character yet still retaining the audiences' sympathies despite each unethical act, perfectly essaying the moral crux of the film. Of course, the simply stunning performance by Barbara Stanwyck as one of the most memorable femme fatale figures of the era proves a lurid highlight, as Stanwyck arguably steals the show with her searing, sultry yet devious intensity, far too charismatic and cunning to ever be reduced to a simple object of desire. The two powerhouse leads are well supported by character actor Edward G. Robinson giving a deliciously repellent performance as an order obsessive insurance agent increasingly suspicious of the insurance scam presented to him.Despite the hefty competition, there can be little doubt that Double Indemnity marks its place as one of the most emotionally gruelling and captivating film noirs of its time, and arguably in the history of the industry. Each flawless element of the film melds together to create a truly mesmerizing work just as grimly entertaining as it is technically laudable. For any in search of a taut, hard hitting piece of staunch film-making, few films would prove more fitting than Double Indemnity. -10/10",

            "content": "Murder is never perfect, no matter how calculated it is, and the insurance supervisor knows that the trolley won't stop for the wife and co-conspirator of a dead man until it reaches the cemetery. \"Straight down the line\", cool blonde Barbara Stanwyck and insurance salesman Fred MacMurray keep reminding each other, from the time they begin the plot over an accident policy which pays double on certain death claims. Stanwyck is a cool cat and her past here is explored just like some other great future screen sociopaths, Glenn Close in \"Fatal Attraction\" and Kathy Bates in \"Misery\", here revealed by the dead man's daughter (Heather Angel). The rather tacky blonde wig Stanwyck wears has been the subject of much ridicule (even worn by Steve Martin in the film noir spoof \"Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid\"), although it serves a certain purpose in establishing her character. MacMurray isn't some dumb sap naively pulled into her scheme. He's established as pretty amoral himself, making an obvious pass at her at the minute they meet. In one of his greatest performances, Edward G. Robinson is a brilliant super-sleuth, uncovering the truth with such calculating wit, his \"little man\" revealing to him everything he needs to figure out the truth, yet not at first aware of all of it, simply using his gut instinct to bit by bit figure out what's going on.MacMurray and Stanwyck, in the second of four appearances on film together, are a great team, delivering the dialog with fire and passion, eating each other alive as their scheme threatens to be revealed, yet not willing to call it quits. The \"Suppose\" dialog dominates their first meeting and it is just the beginning of a truly engrossing screenplay that is directed with perfection by Billy Wilder, a master at riveting his audiences with outstanding melodramas like this (and later \"Sunset Boulevard\"), as well as making them laugh hysterically with some of the greatest comedies of all time.One of the greatest mistakes of Oscar history was the ignoring of Fred MacMurray in the category of Best Actor, as well as a supporting nomination for Robinson, even though Barry Fitzgerald was nominated in both categories for the same film performance. Stanwyck certainly was worthy of the award, yet in the mid 1940's, voters were presumed to be scared of giving a film villainess (one of the deadliest) an Oscar. Stanwyck shares one scene with Robinson who would end up on crutches (like her husband here) when playing her husband a decade later in an entertaining western, \"The Violent Men\", where she is just as deadly as she is here. It should be noted that in the scenes where Stanwyck meets MacMurray in the grocery store, she still looks rather suspicious as she maneuvers around the same counters, and surprisingly didn't attract attention as a possible shop-lifter. It is also a shame that the original intended ending (with MacMurray heading to the gas chamber) ended up being eliminated from the final print.",

            "review_title": "\"Double Indemnity\" has all the makings of a great film",
            "content": "There are many ideas out there on what constitutes a great film. Many would say a great film\u2014in other words, art\u2014is not necessarily an entertainment piece, but a movie which makes comments about life and pushes the audience to do some thinking even when the screening has ended. Personally, I've never stood with the idea that all great films are merely absorbing and never entertaining. That silly idea that films are intellectual stimulants and movies are just trash pumped up in a way that comes across as giddy. Although I do agree that many great films probe the audience to think, one of my solutions is this: when I finish the screening, I sit there afterward and tell myself that there was nothing else I would have rather done in those two hours. That sensation swelled me when I finished watching \"Double Indemnity\" for the first time about a year ago, and it has returned with me every time I have seen it since.This marvelous film-noir, directed by Billy Wilder, shoves a dagger into the idea that art cannot be entertaining, only observable. Now \"Double Indemnity\" does not make its central plot\u2014a salesman co-opting with an unhappy housewife to murder her husband for a $100,000 insurance clause\u2014into something exciting\u2014something people might want to try out at home. In fact, as the movie progresses toward its third act and the two murderers start to lose their grip on what's happening, it poignantly resolves the seemingly tired idea that crime doesn't pay. But there is a certain level of joy to be had from this film. Most of it comes from the brilliant performance of Edward G. Robinson as a comically brilliant claims manager on to the big scheme, and the rest of it comes from the way director Billy Wilder brings tremendous energy out of a leisurely paced story.As much as I've enjoyed his lighthearted performances, I had always felt that Fred MacMurray was capable of putting darker edges on himself. \"Double Indemnity\" does not give him the coldblooded meanness I always felt he could play effectively, but it brings him somewhat close to that level. A man who is more clever and intelligent than he appears (not just a dumb salesman, although he does allow femme fatale Barbara Stanwyck to manipulate him), not afraid to undergo any task he puts before himself. But what is also brilliant about MacMurray's performance is the way he gets us the care. That is tricky. The character is a murderer; he planned it out; he arranged it. The movie does not condone his crime, even though his victim is hardly the world's nicest guy. And yet the audience follows MacMurray's story with a certain affection for him, and by the end, much to our shock, we actually sort of wish that he might be allowed to dodge the authorities. Or at least escape the gas chamber. The screenplay by Billy Wilder and novelist Raymond Chandler provides the motivation, the dialogue, and the drama, but MacMurray rounds it off with an easygoing, effortless shine of a performance. I do not know of Fred MacMurray was the sort of actor who took methods and concentration to a deep level, but he was one of those talents who made good acting look easy.I give MacMurray special attention, for I feel even the film's greatest admirers have more or less taken his work for granted. I do not by any mean wish to demean Barbara Stanywck's performance. She, too, is excellent. I'll go even further and say this is one of the best villains ever put on-screen. At one point, she looks up at MacMurray, we see the white in her eyes as she smiles, and shivers always run down my spine. I do not begrudge her, it is just that everybody mentions her character first of all when discussing the acting of \"Double Indemnity.\" The movie's got three great performances, and the third goes to Edward G. Robinson, once again, as that eccentric claims manager. Robinson provides most of the movie's bits of comic relief, such as when he stands up to his own boss during a claims dispute, sides with the victim, and goes on a rant about \"six volumes of suicide\" and \"suicide by poisons, subdivided by types of poison\" and so forth. Robinson is the straight-shooter of the story, and his dynamic with the MacMurray character is a very fascinating sort of friendship. MacMurray even says \"I love you, too.\" Today, we might take that as some sort of homoerotic subtext. Ignoring the fact that that was utterly forbidden in 1944 films, \"Double Indemnity\" plays it as a strong friendship. So as the movie progresses, the audience again starts to feel empathy, this time for how Robinson might react when he finds out his best salesman is a murderer.\"Double Indemnity\" has all the makings of a great film. The photography is rich and wonderful (the Venetian blinds are used at their ultimate here), and Miklos Rozsa's string-dominate music score is more than something that just plays in the background like an out-of-tune jukebox. The film has a snappy motif theme that repeats at just the right moments and never wears out its welcome. And Billy Wilder, the director, always finds the right decisions on how to shoot a scene and when. When to keep his camera locked for a long stretch of time and when to cut away. The screenplay sure paces itself well, but Wilder was the one who had to figure out how to keep things interesting. And he did with flying colors.Here is another test for a great film. Watching a movie that you know is great with friends or relatives, and not only relishing in the fact that you love the movie, but when you can tell your associates are loving it too.",

            "content": "A 'double indemnity' is a clause on an insurance policy that pays out double under certain circumstances. In the case of this stylish noir from director Billy Wilder, it's on the accident insurance taken out by Phyllis Dietrichson (Barbara Stanwyck) for her unaware husband, the lady cashing in big should her old man die on a train. With the help of obliging insurance salesman Walter Neff (Fred MacMurray), Phyllis does away with her hubbie, but her plans to collect $100k go awry when claims investigator Barton Keyes (Edward G. Robinson) becomes involved.I'm no expert on film noir, having merely dipped my toes into the murky world of murder, mystery, deceit, intrigue and betrayal, but Double Indemnity has surely got to be the gold standard of the genre. The screenplay, co-written by Wilder and Raymond Chandler, is brimming with sexual tension, atmosphere, and snappy dialogue. The three central performances are superb - a classic femme fatale in the form of Stanwyck, MacMurray as the fast-talking schmo who lets a good looking dame twist him round her little finger, and Robinson as the relentless, analytical fly-in-the-ointment. Wilder directs with his usual aplomb and the black and white cinematography is excellent.While the viewer might guess that things are going to go badly from the outset (after all, there is no such thing as the perfect murder), a large part of the enjoyment is in seeing how Phyllis and Walter act under pressure, desperately trying to find a way out as their carefully considered plans slowly crumble. The formula worked so well that it was used again for the steamy '80s neo-noir Body Heat, starring scheming seductress Kathleen Turner, but as much as I enjoy seeing Turner all hot and sweaty, Double Indemnity's coolness gives it the edge.",

            "content": "Woody Allen once called \"Double Indemnity\" the finest American movie ever made. That may be going out on a limb a bit, but then again Allen is more than a film-maker. He is a historian, a listener, a writer and a supreme judge of movies. While I am not going to agree that this is the finest movie ever produced in the U.S., I am still going to say that this is easily one of the very best films ever conceived and executed through the history of motion pictures. An insurance man (Fred MacMurray) goes to renew an automobile policy for the ridiculously wealthy Tom Powers. Instead of finding his man though he meets Powers' super-wicked and highly sexual wife (Barbara Stanwyck, in an unforgettable Oscar-nominated part). They flirt immediately. There is something more than friendship there and a crazed affair starts. Stanwyck, a master manipulator tells sob stories to MacMurray about her abusive husband (embellishing quite a bit in the process). MacMurray, only having eyes for Stanwyck, comes up with a plan with her to have Powers killed so they can collect the insurance via the titled policy. Naturally though Stanwyck does not think near as much of the relationship as MacMurray does and the duo must constantly dodge pesky insurance investigator Edward G. Robinson (in one of his finer roles) and Stanwyck's suspicious step-daughter (Jean Heather). All told through intense flashbacks by MacMurray, \"Double Indemnity\" is quite possibly co-writer/director (Oscar-nominated in both categories) Billy Wilder's finest contribution to the cinema. As time passes, many film scholars confuse this as one of Alfred Hitchcock's productions. Looking back, this is a very odd movie for Wilder (considering latter triumphs with movies like \"Sunset Boulevard\", \"Stalag 17\", \"Some Like It Hot\" and \"The Apartment\"). However Wilder would continue a similar trend immediately following this in 1945 with the Best Picture Oscar-winning \"The Lost Weekend\", an intense character-study of one man's (Ray Milland) bout with alcoholism. \"Double Indemnity\" has nothing wrong with it. I cannot think of one negative throughout the film. I never found Stanwyck very attractive, but she has a way about her that makes her deceptively sexy here. MacMurray, one of those actors who never got any credit, does probably his best work ever in this one and Robinson is his usual dominant, scene-stealing self. Wickedly brilliant, fun to watch, dramatic, darkly comical, superbly written and flawlessly directed, \"Double Indemnity\" is one of those movies that should be embraced by all fans of the national and international cinema. 5 stars out of 5.",

She's had thoughts of bumping off her husband (Tom Powers), and he is able to put ideas into her head of how to murder the man and profit from it. It would seem to be the perfect crime, and it does go off without a hitch, but there's just one problem. Walter has a colleague named Barton Keyes (a grandiose Edward G. Robinson), who has a talent for smelling a rat when it comes to insurance claims.The cast simply couldn't be better in this quintessential example of the entire film noir genre. Certainly the story (script by director Billy Wilder and author Raymond Chandler, based on the novel by James M. Cain) offers a now classic scenario that's been re-used many times since. The film is definitely dialogue heavy, but when the dialogue is this sharp, one can't really complain. Robinson, in particular, has a field day with his lines and he's able to get them out in a fast, breathless way. MacMurray is solid as a man who finds it increasingly hard to keep his cool, and is certainly no angel, given how readily he finds himself eager to pull off this scam. Still, he's absolutely no match for Stanwyck, who is one of the all time great \"femme fatales\" to be found in this genre. She's utterly conniving and knows how to turn on the heat to get what she wants. The three stars receive capable support from Porter Hall as a key witness, Powers as the murder victim, Jean Heather as his daughter, Byron Barr as her surly suitor, Richard Gaines as the boss at the insurance agency, and Fortunio Bonanova in a bit near the beginning as a luckless truck driver. (Chandler himself has a Hitchcock type role as a man reading a book outside Keyes' office.)Craftily plotted, atmospheric, and quite witty, this hallmark of film noir deserves to be seen by any lover of Old Hollywood cinema.10 out of 10.",

            "content": "Walter Neff is an insurance salesman for Pacific All Risk Insurance Company. He falls for Phyllis Dietrichson, the wife of a client of his, and is drawn into a plan to kill Mr. Dietrichson and pocket the insurance money. Between the two of them they come up with the perfect murder, so good it not only looks like an accident, but ensures that the insurance pays out double the usual sum insured - double indemnity. Between them and the money stands Barton Keyes, Pacific Insurance's Head of Claims. Experienced, wily and possessing a sixth sense for claims fraud he is a formidable adversary...Brilliant crime drama - a film-noir classic. Written by Raymond Chandler book and directed by master-director Billy Wilder, this is great on so many levels: the clever plot (especially the murder plan, which is so good you almost want them to succeed); the snappy, often funny, dialogue and the excellent, engaging performances. Moreover, there's a smoothness and coolness about this, a hallmark of film noir.Only things missing from making this one of the greatest movies of all times is a good twist and possibly less predictability. The use of flashbacks to tell the story sort of gives away the direction the plot is taking.Good work by Fred MacMurray as Neff, Barbara Stanwyck as Phyllis and Edward G Robinson as Keyes. In hindsight, Humphrey Bogart would have made a better Neff, but then you could say that about any 1940s role requiring a cool, tough, smooth-talking, wise-cracking male lead. Fred MacMurray does well and doesn't really put a foot wrong, but I kept thinking \"Imagine Bogie in the role...\".Barbara Stanwyck got a well-deserved Best Leading Actress Oscar nomination for playing Phyllis.The film itself garnered seven Oscar nominations but no wins, losing out on Best Picture to Going My Way, the so-so musical starring Bing Crosby. Billy Wilder got his first Best Director nomination and fourth writing nomination for Double Indemnity. He would have to wait for his next movie, The Lost Weekend, for his first win.",

            "content": "Double Indemnity is directed by Billy Wilder and Wilder co-adapts the screenplay with Raymond Chandler from the novella written by James M. Cain. It stars Fred MacMurray, Barbara Stanwyck and Edward G. Robinson. Music is by Miklos Rozsa and cinematography by John F. Seitz.For a film lover such as myself it feels redundant writing a review for Double Indemnity, because quite simply there's nothing to say that hasn't been said already. The esteem it is held in is justified, it's a razor sharp noir across the board and can be put up as one of the classic noir era pictures that got lovers of the form interested in the first place.Based around the infamous Snyder/Gray case of 1927, Wilder and Chandler fill the story with a sinister cynicism that is palpable in the extreme. With a script positively pumped with hard boiled dialogue, a simple case of murder becomes so much more, a labyrinth of devious cunning and foolishness, with a trio of top performances crowning this topper.Technically via aural and visual work the story gains extra spice. Rosza provides a score that frays the nerves, imbuing the sense of doom and edginess required for plotting. Seitz excels, the photography a trademark for noir, heavy shadows, abrupt camera angles and menacing shards of light come to the fore.And to top it all off, it gets away with so much, a real censorship baiter. The story takes a journey to the dark side of morality, and the makers, bless them for they know what they do, gleefully tease the production code to give film noir fans a reason to rejoice.Quintessential stuff. 10/10",

            "content": "DOUBLE INDEMNITY is a movie in which the atmosphere, suspense and power of dialogue break new ground. The story is basically a cold, even in scenes of heated fake passion. Murder is mutual pleasure and greatest passion. Insurance salesman who embarks on a dangerous game of love with a femme fatale who persuades him to murder. The truth is quite the marketing savvy. Fiction is all too appropriate. Psychological game and fear of the truth is perhaps the most realistic described.Deception is the key word.The film is an example of the genre. The story is strong and interesting. The dialogues are so rich that it is simply cut into the memory. The script is special, and I think it's just one of the great elements in this film.Women incapable of emotion and love. Man created for the perfect crime. Maybe the other way around. Romance is certainly not convincing. I have a feeling that the main characters are poisoned with psychological tendencies and perfect moments. Love and money are only intermediaries. I've already stated what the real pleasure.Fred MacMurray as Walter Neff, his performance is very good. Narration through flashbacks is somewhat uncertain. I think he works too freely in the film. Such a person rarely falls under the charms of some beauty. He is capable of killing and planned murder. The stillness of his body is amazing. Changes in the tension, excitement or disappointment they feel in his voice. Barbara Stanwyck as Phyllis Dietrichson was really great. Phyllis is not a happy woman, nor ever can be. The destruction of everything around her mode of existence. What has led to such an emotional state? Here's a little characterization. Stanwyck is blonde !? I am unlike most positively surprised. Yes, ankles are sexy but still .... Edward G. Robinson as Barton Keyes acts a bit unreal. As it is always one step ahead. I'd copied dedication to his work. Difficult and irritable character with specific humor.Intriguing, brilliant and at times disturbing crime game. I'm thrilled.",

The Ending that was shot and in the can was trashed and a new one Filmed.

So, for example, if your husband is insured for $50,000 accidental death and he dies on or falling off a train (the probability of which is extremely low), the payout is double i.e. $100,000.Walter Neff, an insurance salesman, is the lead role in this director Billy Wilder's finest film. The femme fatale is Mrs. Phyllis Dietrichson and the insurance investigator is the wily Barton Keyes. The three central roles are played by Fred MacMurray, Barbara Stanwyck and Edward G. Robinson. The film has a great visual style (starting from the opening credits of a man on crutches to the intelligent usage of the dictaphone as a narrative device) and Robinson constantly needing a light with dialogue (written by a reportedly drunk Raymond Chandler) as good as that Out of the Past or Maltese Falcon. The score is a classic.I thought MacMurray was fine in this role but I do wonder what a Bogart or Robert Mitchum or even a lesser Kirk Douglas or Edmund O'Brien would have done with. Apparently Wilder thought that the wig Stanwyck wore was a mistake but he was already one month into shooting and it was too late. She does seem kind of silly in it!

            "content": "Returning to his office late one night, insurance salesman Walter Neff picks up his tape recorder and begins to record a message to his boss Barton Keyes. The message is a confession of a crime that Walter has committed and starts the day he made a casual sales call to businessman Dietrichson. It was here where Neff first met the beautiful and playful Mrs Phyllis Dietrichson and started to flirt with her. When she invites him back another day to sign papers he goes like a dog on heat but recoils when she floats the idea that he help her take out a hefty accident policy without his knowledge. However Phyllis is very persuasive and soon he decides to not only help sign her husband up but help to kill him in such a way that she will gain the maximum money but not arouse the suspicion of the insurance investigators.Not a name that I really associate with noir or tough drama, this Billy Wilder film was a real joy to watch as it delivers a noir story with plenty of sharp dialogue and tough acting. The story sees Neff being seduced by Phyllis and getting drawn into \"the perfect crime\" which quickly turns sour once his boss Keyes starts sniffing around it. It works on several levels, not the least of which is the sexual power that the audience sees shifting in the early stages. At the start it appears that Neff has all the power as he flirtatiously circles Phyllis, however soon his panting is soon turned on him but the script does well to keep him from knowing it and instead has him continue thinking he has the power. It is a genre staple but it works well here and the characters, although cookie-cutter, are good. Following genre lines, the film builds up to the crime before seeing it crumble and, although we know the rough outcome due to the narrator-structuring it is still engaging as it develops and we follow Neff as he gets in over his head.Wilder's direction is solid and he uses shadow really well, easily moving the action away from the sharp daylight where we first see Neff and Phyllis meet. Wilder's script is beefed up by Chandler and together they have produced plenty of tough but convincing dialogue which gives the film a real hard edge to it and befits the genre. The cast also fit the genre well. MacMurray is hardly the most emotive man in the world but he is perfect here as a tough nut who falls in due to desire. He works well with Stanwyck who is good as the femme fatale even if she didn't totally convince me all the time. That said she was playful and manipulative most of the time, which is what the character needed. Robinson steals his scenes with a colourful and lively performance that contrast well with the darker scenes.Overall this is a classic piece of noir with all the genre staples accounted for and done really well. Easily engaging and enjoyable with fine direction and solid performances and well worth a watch for those familiar or unfamiliar with the genre.",

            "review_title": "Great DVD Treatment of One of Billy Wilder's Greatest Films!",
            "content": "The super deluxe 2-disc DVD edition of the 1944 film noir classic DOUBLE INDEMNITY (DI) rocks! Director/co-screenwriter Billy Wilder's flair with suspense and black humor works so perfectly with James M. Cain's novel about adulterous lovers plotting to murder the woman's husband and scam the man's insurance company, that it even improves on the book (which I read years ago). The dark tone and scandalous subject matter freaked out Hollywood so much that it took 9 years to get DI from the printed page to the big screen. Fred MacMurray was the only leading man in Hollywood with the guts to take the role of insurance salesman-turned-murderer Walter Neff, though even MacMurray needed convincing at first. None of the other in-demand male stars of the period wanted Barbara Stanwyck's conniving, money-loving, hubby-offing temptress Phyllis Dietrichson to make a chump out of him on screen. Their loss! (I'd first seen MacMurray when I was a kid. Back then, he was best known to my generation as a Disney movie star and the lovable dad of TV's MY THREE SONS, so it was quite a revelation to me when I saw him playing underhanded types in DI, THE APARTMENT, and THE CAINE MUTINY. MacMurray had more range than he got credit for!) MacMurray and Stanwyck are dynamite in this, one of the most gleefully, unapologetically black-hearted films noir ever made. Their dialogue, especially in the first half of the movie, contains many of my fave movie lines of all time (if I start quoting them all, I'll pretty much be transcribing most of the script). The chemistry between Stanwyck and MacMurray blazes like the Chicago Fire as the wily, spellbinding Phyllis draws Walter into her web. As Richard Schickel points out in one of the DVD's 2 excellent audio commentaries, Stanwyck's Phyllis is always reacting in the moment, so you never can tell whether she means a word she says, making her all the more fascinating. What cynical Sam Spade says to the equally slippery Brigid O'Shaughnessy in THE MALTESE FALCON could also apply to the quicksilver Phyllis: she's good, awful good! Edward G. Robinson is DI's crabby yet kind-hearted Voice of Reason in his portrayal of Barton Keyes, the Pacific All-Risk Insurance Company's ace Claims Manager. As Keyes, Robinson is irresistible, with his zeal for detail, the \"little man\" in his gut giving him indigestion every time an insurance claim seems fishy, and his gruff affection for Walter. Heck, at times, there's more tenderness between Walter and Keyes than there is between Walter and Phyllis! :-) IMO, the biggest crime in DI was the failure to nominate either of the male leads for an Oscar, especially scene-stealing Robinson, though the Academy was smart enough not to overlook the mesmerizing Stanwyck. (For that matter, Robinson was never nominated for an Oscar for any of his superb performances. He was eventually given one of those special career Oscars, or as we like to call them, the \"Yikes, He's So Old He Could Croak Any Minute and He Still Hasn't Gotten An Oscar? *D-OH!*\" award. :-) DI boasts plenty of wonderful character bits, too -- really, there isn't a bum performance in the bunch! Our household's DI faves include Fortunio Bonanova as Garlopis, whose phony claim Keyes chews to bits \"like a slice of rare roast beef;\" and Porter Hall as Jackson from Medford, Oregon, the jovial train traveler who innocently throws a wrench into the murder plot when he turns up on the train's Observation Car while Walter pretends to be Phyllis' injured, crutch-bound hubby. (Speaking of the crutches, is the opening credit sequence with the silhouetted, fedora'd figure on crutches one of the coolest credit sequences of all time, or what?). Any fans of THE THING FROM ANOTHER WORLD who might be reading this shouldn't blink when Walter lets Lola (Jean Heather) into his office at one point, or you'll miss Douglas Spencer (with hair!) as Walter's associate, Lou Schwartz, coming out at the same time.If you love the movie (and why wouldn't you? :-), you'll go gaga over the nifty commentary tracks and extras. Among other things, we learn about the censorship issues in bringing Cain's juicy, lurid tales to the big screen. For example, there were several European film versions of THE POSTMAN ALWAYS RINGS TWICE (including Luchino Visconti's OSSESSIONE, which works very well in its down-to-earth way and recently turned up on Turner Classic Movies) before Hollywood brought it to the big screen with John Garfield and Lana Turner in 1946. We're also told about how the different writing/working styles of Wilder and Raymond Chandler (who was hired to help adapt the story when Cain was under contract elsewhere and Wilder's then-collaborator Charles Brackett nixed the dark material) turned the experience into a collaboration made in hell. For the record, I wouldn't be surprised if Chandler was mostly to blame, since there are similar stories about him being just as tough to work with during Alfred Hitchcock's 1951 screen adaptation of Patricia Highsmith's STRANGERS ON A TRAIN. Hitch eventually brought in Ben Hecht's assistant Czenzi Ormonde to finish/polish the script when Chandler took a hike. Disc 2 contains the 1973 TV movie remake of DOUBLE INDEMNITY, which is worth watching if only to appreciate how much better the original is! This DVD set belongs in your collection!",

But for me, it's the only thing that detracts from her otherwise solid performance. Problem is the wig makes her look like the phony she turns out to be--and Fred MacMurray, an insurance man who's been around the block a few times, should have known better. If he doesn't know people, who does??Whatever the flaws are in this film, they're more than compensated for by the clever photography, the Miklos Rozsa score, the witty screenplay and the three central performances of Edw. G. Robinson, Fred MacMurray and Barbara Stanwyck--each one playing off each other brilliantly.And who says the ending isn't resolved? It certainly is--with MacMurray waiting for the ambulance and puffing on a cigarette lit by Robinson and some classic lines of dialog...like Robinson admitting that MacMurray was more than just the man who sat at a nearby desk. \"I love you too,\" is MacMurray's closing line.Fascinating film noir that would have been even better without Stanwyck's decision to use that tacky blonde wig.",

Sure, he does some verbal moralizing to Neff along the way, never guessing that he is talking to one of the perpetrators, but it is just a coincidence.The dialogue is as sharp as a knife, and MacMurray and Stanwyck, this unlikely pair of conspirators, are the absolute best at delivering dialogue with wicked incisiveness. The plot is very simple, but is so intense that it can never find the blanket of infinity which devours it. Neff (MacMurray) knows Dietrichson (Stanwyck) is up to no good and is a deviant of the highest degree. He dislikes her, certainly does not trust her, but he is entangled by her magnetism and potent sexuality. He is a fly caught in her web. He has much opportunity to escape from this nightmare, before the deed is done, but never does.Eddie Muller hosted this on Turner Classic Movies' Noir Alley the other night, and I thought he could not bring anything new to a film I've seen a hundred times, yet he did. He raises the question - Why DID Neff, when he believed he was dying, go back to the insurance office in the middle of the night and confess everything to Keyes via a dictaphone, when his destination was Mexico? Was it an act of contrition, as the production code might want us to believe, or was it an act of bravado, perhaps wanting his boss to know that he was the smarter egg after all, and not being sure he would live to tell it to him in person?

This is what I like mostly about this type of movies. Characterers change throughout the movie and the plot thickens fast. It's really a movie that gets better by the minute and besides also features plenty of nice twists and developments. A real fine constructed movie.It's of course also being made great by it's atmosphere, that I don't consider typically film-noir like, cinematography and directing by Billy Wilder, who handled a lot of different genres successfully throughout his career, film-noir being just one of them. He also helped to write the screenplay for this movie. His directing and writing both earned him an Oscar nomination for this movie. The movie got nominated for a total of 7 Oscar's, including best picture but it won none however. Nevertheless the movie has grown out to be more of a classic than the movies that did won an Oscar over \"Double Indemnity\" that year.Fred MacMurray isn't really the best known actor but he suits his role in this movie just fine. He really fits in well within the genre. I wasn't too happy about Barbara Stanwyck though, who has played far better roles throughout her career. She also looked quite ridicules with her blond wig. Ironically enough she still got nominated for an Oscar for her role in this movie. It was great to see Edward G. Robinson in this.

It's the same author, and they aren't identical. They are also both somewhat reminiscent of Macbeth. Other than that I did not find myself falling in love with these leads(as I did in the Garfield/Turner one), I really cannot complain about this film(and I won't even attempt to argue against the immense chemistry that this duo has; they light the screen on fire). I have not seen a lot of Wilder's work, but I thoroughly enjoyed Some Like It Hot, as well. This is a classic piece of noir, and ought to get a viewing by every fan of such. The brilliant dialog and narration is full of metaphors, plays on words(and the like) and every line is carefully phrased, with several utterly unforgettable exchanges. Editing and cinematography are excellent. The lighting and use of shadows... incredible. This does an amazing job of building suspense and tension. The plot is well-written, and the twists are impeccable. Every acting performance is spot-on. The characters are credible and well-developed, and the women are allowed strong-willed moments. MacMurray is rather cool. There is a little racism and sexism(on account of when it was made), some innuendo and brief mild and not graphic violence in this.

Stanwick has what it takes to make her character look sexually dangerous and desirable. Niff has the ways and traits to make his character look like a stylish fool. But as far as acting is concerned, both are surpassed by the wonderful Edward G. Robinson, who is extraordinary delivering lines faster than MacMurray can say \"shut up, baby\".This sort of cinema will never age. It will always find a point of relation to today's society. And when it's directed in such a beautiful way, it's little wonder that the noir is so loved and remembered. The mise sn scene is beautiful. MacMurray's and Stanwyck's character are never really portrayed close. Even when they kiss, they are always shot at an awkward angle. When they are in the same frame, Wilder always makes sure that there's something in the way, whether it's a mother and a child in a supermarket, or a fish tank in the study room of the man whose murder is being secretly plotted. This murder plot reaches its height of tension when MacMurray lures Stanwyck's husband to sign a life insurance, as he thinks he is signing an ordinary car one. He is in fact signing his life away.As in too many noirs, though, it pitfalls into the use of voice over. That is forgiven because from the start we know that he is telling Edward G. Robinson the story, speaking into the voice recorder, confessing his crime of passion. It is a film of which we know the ending already. In fact, one of the most interesting things about the film is the way we observe the main character, and the way that we back him up sometimes, only to change our minds other times. Almost every scene is necessary to make up our minds, when really the only good guy is Robinson in the whole movie.WATCH FOR THE MOMENT - When the murder plot is put in act, from the arrival to the station, to when the car won't start...",

            "content": "The premier \"film noir\" entr\u00e9e, DOUBLE INDEMNITY stands as the model for the genre. Told entirely in flashback, it is the grim, yet seductive story of a life insurance agent who falls for a treacherously sultry married woman plotting to do her husband in for the payoff. DOUBLE INDEMNITY is nothing less than a requirement for anyone who asks, \"What is film noir?\" For all the ingredients are present: the cold-hearted criminal plot, the adulterous romance, the step-by-step implementing of the deed, the anxiety-ridden moments as a steadfast mind zeroes in on the guilty parties, and the inevitability of the final justice---all filmed in grim black and white.Did Fred MacMurray ever have a greater moment in his acting career playing Walter Neff, the Los Angeles insurance agent knocked out by a bored housewife who ropes him into her diabolical web? Did Barbara Stanwyck ever really overcome the powerful persona of Mrs. Dietrichson, the calculating murderess standing at the top of the stairs in a bath towel? And could there have been a better screen writer for DOUBLE INDEMNITY than the assiduous Raymond Chandler (THE BIG SLEEP, FAREWELL, MY LOVELY, THE LONG GOODBYE), who remains the unequaled master of the Los Angeles detective genre? Not to be outdone, Edward G. Robinson turns in a yeoman's performance as Keyes, MacMurray's boss. Keyes is a walking encyclopedia of fraudulent insurance claims and is nearly infallible in his ability to sniff out the rotten stench of not-so-accidental death. In one memorable scene, Keyes reduces his own superior to pulp as he lectures him that \"no one ever committed suicide by throwing themselves off a train moving at 5 miles per hour.\" He cites the statistics of death by poisoning, drowning, lightning strikes, and electrocution straight off the top of his head. At what point Keyes becomes suspicious of Neff is never quite clear; but he is certainly suspicious of Stanwyck from the start--and Neff had taken Stanwyck's life insurance policy just before her husband supposedly went off the caboose.One certain proof that a detective drama is succeeding is the identification the audience has with the villains. A cold-blooded murder has been committed, yet we somehow squirm nervously for the perpetrators hoping their plot succeeds. The epitome of this identification occurs in the scene after Neff impersonates Dietrichson on the train. MacMurray races back to the car where Stanwyck awaits and the car engine stalls. He tries to turn it over again and again. We actually want the car to start! The only soft spot that exists in this sensationally crafted Ramond Chandler script is MacMurray's character transformation. He simply evolves from cavalier life insurance salesman to murderer far too soon after falling for Stanwyck. Moreover, Neff's seemingly air-tight plot to erase Dietrichson materializes a bit too quickly and precisely in his mind. What is central is that in the end it isn't Neff's boss Keyes who throws the light on the murder--it's the adulterous relationship between MacMurray and Stanwyck itself. No one other than the plotters themselves was needed to undo the evil, for the villainous collaboration contained the seeds for its own destruction. In the end, the lovers turn on one another and the twisted relationship destroys both of them. DOUBLE INDEMNITY is simply one of Hollywood's movie detective classics. And anyone who fails to include DOUBLE INDEMNITY in an all-time list of greats knows very little about films.Dennis Caracciolo",

            "review_title": "The finest of a fine genre...",
            "content": "A regular reviewer would get into the heavy details of the plot of Billy Wilder's `Double Indemnity', but I wont, because I feel that a film like this should be viewed by someone who knows practically nothing of the plot, so every scene can be a surprise.  What I will say about the plot, just so you have an idea if you don't already know, is that insurance salesman Neff (Fred MacMurray) and his client Phyllis (Barbara Stanwyck) have a criminal plot to carry out, and claims man Keyes (Edward G. Robinson) is onto them.The movie is a Film-Noir, a terrific B&W genre that died out, I guess, in the early sixties.  Sure, Noirs are still being made today, but those ones are more of a homage to the classic Film-Noirs of the thirties, forties and fifties.  `Double Indemnity' was released in 1944, when Film-Noir was at its prime, with releases like `The Maltese Falcon' right behind it and `The Third Man' just ahead.  To me, `Double Indemnity' is the greatest.It's hard to differentiate Noirs from the regular crime or mystery movies of the past, but I think Roger Ebert said it best in his review for `Out of the Past': `The noir hero is doomed before the story begins -- by fate, rotten luck, or his own flawed character. Crime movies sometimes show good men who go bad. The noir hero is never good, just kidding himself, living in ignorance of his dark side until events demonstrate it to him.'  That character in `Double Indemnity' is Neff, a man who thinks he's carrying out Phyllis' plan because of his love for the woman, but indeed is not.  He likes the plan, he likes doing it, just for the sake of carrying out the evil deed.Phyllis shares his love for the dark, and the evil scheme is the basis of their relationship.  They are never seen talking about anything but the plan, they don't want to, instead of being in love with each other they're in evil with each other.And then there's Keyes, a man who's life has been consumed by his profession so much so that he once dumped his fianc\u00e9e because he found out about some sketchy business from her past, he says.  But he is a great man, strong willed and smarter than any other man working at his firm, including his boss.  When his boss asks the wrong question he flares into a huge speech about why the question is ludicrous, and why the boss is unfit for his profession.  Sure, he's rambling, but he has the right to, he's the cleverest claims man you'll ever find.So the better part of the movie is about Neff avoiding and out-maneuvering Keyes, a situation which generates such heated suspense, on account of both the actors and Billy Wilder's expert direction and script (co-written by Raymond Chandler).  MacMurray is perfect as the everyman with a dark side, using his     pan expression and voice as an advantage.  Some say Bogart would've been more suited with the role, but Neff is the kind of character that would look and sound tired all the time, just like MacMurray.  Stanwyck shows delicious darkness in an Oscar-nominated role, there's a scene where her face gradually turns from tearful regret to     y evil that sent chills down my spine.And, of course, there is Edward G. Robinson, in a stellar performance, stealing every scene he is in from under Mac Murray (or whomever's) feet. The role is played with such skill and focus that personally I think it's a travesty he wasn't nominated for an Oscar for it.`Double Indemnity' is the best Film-Noir, a template for perfection, 9/10.",

I have previously noted that Barbara Stanwyck seems a little lacking in this department, despite the odd alluring glance. But it is Fred MacMurray I noticed on this viewing rather unconvincing. Then it occurred to me that we are so used to thinking of Stanwyck's character (maybe even her) as being rather cold and calculating, that we do not notice the similar position of MacMurray. He even says at some point (to himself probably) that he is keen to see if he can beat his own company, more specifically his rather close chum, here played immaculately by Edward G Robinson. Even though this is all told in flashback and much of it in voice over, it is hard to criticise a frame of this remarkable movie of greed, power and deceit. Even though the origin is a Cain short story, Billy Wilder and more significantly, Raymond Chandler have crafted the script and the combination of talents managed to produce a sharp and witty dialogue driven film that can be watched so many times.",

Could he interest her in some Accident Insurance? What if they split the claim? Hubby is so heartless and cold...could he help at all? It's easy for us in front of the big HDTV screen to mock Walter but the truth of the matter is, emotion and passion rule the day at times.Fred MacMurray is spot on as the hapless insurance salesman caught between his otherworldly clairvoyant boss Barton Keyes, the sultry Phyllis Dietrichson and his own principles. Phyllis' husband is murdered in a plan so intricate that it should, nay will, fool the claims investigators. That is, until the big boss considers it fishy and Barton gnaws at the case's inconsistencies like a rat on a piece of rotten flesh. Eventually Neff confronts Phyllis, who has had enough and tries to dispose of him (as she has her husband's ex-wife, told through her daughter) and her statement that she is utterly empty inside before succumbing to gunshot wounds in a close quarters fight with Neff is chilling, to say the least.Simply can't say enough about this one folks.

            "content": "\"Double Indemnity\" begins with its central character dictating a confession, which means that it is not a \"whodunit\" in the traditional sense, but rather a film which concentrates on the execution of the crime and the motives behind it. (This would be a common device today but was unusual in the 1940s). The central figure is Walter Neff, an insurance salesman and a law-abiding citizen until he meets Phyllis Dietrichson, a young housewife, when he calls on her about her motor insurance. Phyllis is trapped in a loveless marriage to an older man, and sees in the handsome bachelor Neff a chance to break free. The two begin an affair and hatch an ingenious plot to sell life insurance to Phyllis's husband and then to murder him for the money. They decide to make the death look like a railway accident because of a \"double indemnity\" clause in the contract which means that the normal $50,000 payout will double to $100,000 in the case of certain categories of accidental death.The film was made in the film noir style, much used for American crime films in the forties and fifties. \"Noir\", of course, is French for \"black\", and these films were generally black in two senses, the physical and the moral. All were made in black and white (the genre came to an end in the sixties when it became standard practice to make films in colour) and were characterised by the use of dark, gloomy or night-time settings, often with striking lighting effects comparable to chiaroscuro in painting. Morally, these films often reflected a dark view of humanity, and in this respect \"Double Indemnity\" is one of the darkest of all. A noir hero such as Humphrey Bogart's Philip Marlowe from \"The Big Sleep\" may be a cynic on the surface, but beneath that surface he actually has a deep concern for honour and decency. \"Double Indemnity\", however, does not have a hero, only in Neff an anti-hero, an individual who is at the centre of the film (and who in this case acts as narrator), but who is deeply unsympathetic, indeed a criminal. Neff narrates his story in a similar laconic, world-weary tone to that used by Bogart's heroes, but lacks their inner decency, being totally ruthless and self-seeking. Phyllis is similarly lacking in moral scruples; indeed, the two have no loyalty even to one another.The nearest thing to a hero in this film is Barton Keyes, a colleague of Neff's in the insurance company. It is Keyes's dogged persistence in investigating Mr Dietrichson's death (the police do not regard it as suspicious) that finally results in the downfall of the evildoers, but even he is not a really sympathetic character. He is obsessive about his job, the sort of man who today would be referred to as a nerd or an anorak. He can, and does, quote from memory the latest statistics on various methods used to commit suicide. He has a particularly cynical view of human nature, automatically suspecting all insurance claims of being fraudulent. His interest in the Dietrichson case arises less from a desire to see justice done than from a desire to ensure that his firm's money is not paid out in settlement of a false claim.Unlike some films in the genre, the plot is not excessively complex. Fred MacMurray- not an actor with whose work I was particularly familiar, although he was later to give an excellent performance in \"The Caine Mutiny\"- is good as Neff, but the two best performances come from Barbara Stanwyck as the seductive femme fatale Phyllis and Edward G. Robinson as Keyes. Billy Wilder acted as both scriptwriter and director, and in both capacities his contributions are first class. The dialogue is crisp and holds the attention well, often displaying a sardonic wit. The action is never less than gripping, with some notably tense sequences such as where the car fails to start immediately after the murder and the one where Phyllis is hiding behind the door. Although Neff and Phyllis are such unsympathetic characters, we hope that, in the short term at least, they will get away with it because we want to see just how far their plan will go before they are discovered. This is not only one of the darkest of films noirs but also, in my opinion, one of the best, with very high standards of acting, writing and directing.",

            "content": "Shady figures, bad business, dubious dealings, ill tidings, and an uncontrolled, widening downward spiral - yep, this is film noir, alright. There comes a point after watching so many movies that the instant deadly attraction between a man and a woman appearing on-screen, just because they are Man and Woman, feels hopelessly contrived, but that's rather standard, too, for both the genre and the medium at large. The post hoc framing, providing narration to one degree or another that often directly addresses someone; the shadow and/or calculated lighting; the smart, snappy dialogue: whether one wishes to see this as a progenitor of the style, or just a preeminent example, there's no arguing that 'Double indemnity' is a classic. But that's just for starters.No matter any similarities, no matter how well made each is, from one picture to the next there may be different aspects that stand out as being strongest of all. Rest assured that this is sharp in every way - Billy Wilder's direction, John Seitz's cinematography, the production design and art direction, Mikl\u00f3s R\u00f3zsa's score, and more. The narrative is dark, and wonderfully compelling, as a tale of murderous conspiracy - not to mention quite clever in its details, a quality shared by the exquisite scene writing. Something as small as a car engine turning over is given vibrant new life thanks to Wilder's direction, and the adapted screenplay he wrote with Raymond Chandler. Yet for as excellent as all these varied parts are, still there are two other bits that leap out at me as being best of all.One of these is that smart and snappy dialogue, written with exceptional, resonant intelligence. The dialogue is so colorful in and of itself, and goes such a long way in carrying the plot, that not least in light of the narration, the feature rather comes across as a story that could be told even just as a table reading, or a radio play. Bright and resplendent, every word rings out with stark clarity no matter how swiftly the lines are delivered. And speaking of delivery, the other most noteworthy facet of 'Double indemnity,' to me, are the performances. Not the characters, not the connections between characters and the resulting dynamics, but the performances alone. The delivery of every line is unexpectedly potent, a credit to the skills of the cast that just their voices could do so much to elevate the film. Add in their facial expressions, body language, and general comportment, and the effect is a display of tremendous skill from Fred MacMurray, Barbara Stanwyck, Edward G. Robinson, Jean Heather, Richard Gaines, and others in still smaller parts. Between the acting and the dialogue, all the rest of the movie that is executed so finely nonetheless almost becomes extraneous.Call me jaded and cynical if you will, but when the movie first begins it feels common and ordinary - well done by all means, but not necessarily remarkable in any way. As the plot thickens, however, and that reliable noir spiral becomes ever more unwieldy for its characters, the value of all parts becomes resoundingly clear. Like a train gaining momentum, the title is increasingly rich and flavorful as it moves along, until engagement that started out as perfunctory takes us to the edge of our seat and keeps our eyes glued. I had high expectations based on what is of course a sterling and nigh legendary reputation, and I'm so very, very pleased that the feature takes the long view and bides its time to gather strength. Many great works of cinema have been produced over the years, and many great noir flicks specifically - yet there's ultimately no doubt in my mind that this is one of the very best instances of the latter, if not also the former at large. When all is said and done, 'Double indemnity' isn't just a classic, it's an absolute must-see. Wherever and however one must go about watching this, everyone needs to see it at least once. Highest recommendation!",

The ending is literally hellish and obviously influenced writers like Jim Thompson.The film, on the other hand, discards this to play up a love story between Edward G. Robinson and Fred MacMurray. Their mutual respect at the beginning of the film has turned into sad affection by the end, when Robinson lights MacMurray's cigarette, Fred says, \"...It was right across the desk from you,\" Ed answers, \"Closer than that, Walter,\" and Fred replies, \"I love you, too.\" Tellingly, the exchange doesn't seem gay, just the expression of feelings between two men.

The dialogue is sharper than a buzz-saw, particularly the first encounter between McMurray and Stanwyck where you can almost see the flames crackling into life between them while Wilder's direction keeps up the suspense from first to last and yet is never unnecessarily hurried.As to which is the better movie between this and \"Postman\" it's the difference between a twenty and two tens.

            "content": "Directed by Billy Wilder in 1944, \"Double Indemnity\" set the standards of film-noir, inaugurated by Huston's \"Maltese Falcon\", a genre that captures the pessimism of post-war America and within which \"Double Indemnity\" is not only a masterpiece but also a reference, always imitated, but never equaled. \"Double Indemnity\" is a tale of greed and lust, incarnated by one of the most controversial movie couples: the insurance salesman Walter Neff (with two 'F' like in Philadelphia) played by the handsome and everyday looking Fred McMurray, and the flirtatious housewife Phyllis Dietrichson, Barbara Stanwyck, both sensually dangerous and dangerously sensual. Together, they mastermind the perfect crime: killing Mr. Dietrichson and disguising it as an accidental jump from a train, to guarantee the 'double indemnity' in the life insurance, the clause that doubles the payoff for an unusual accident. Based on a 1935 novel from James M. Cain, the story was inspired by the case of Ruth Snyder, the woman executed in Sing Sing prison in 1928 for a similar crime. But it couldn't make its way to Hollywood, the Hayes Code Cerberus judged the material too sordid as the way it glamorized crime would negatively influence younger viewers. But one decade later, Billy Wilder bought the rights granted his film would never convey the idea that crime pays. And to a certain extent, the Hays Code restrictions elevated the film by privileging the atmosphere, the relationships and the tension, instead of action, the subtlety of sexual innuendo and double entendre instead of explicit dialogs. The brilliant 'speed limit' exchange is one of its greatest illustrations.Indeed, the film was voted #38 in AFI's Top 100 Thrillers, yet it opens with a wounded Neff coming to his workplace by night and talking to a Dictaphone. Neff addresses a confession to his colleague and friend Keyes (Edward G. Robinson): \"I killed him \u0085 for money and for a woman\", he adds: \"I didn't get the money. And I didn't get the woman\". We know who committed the murder and we know the plan failed. What's left for the suspense? Well, the point is that the story contemplates the motives of the characters, the feelings lying beneath their actions. Why a man like Neff would associate with a woman like Phyllis? This question is crucial because it sets the most important characteristics of the 'femme fatale' figure.And Phyllis Dietrichson, #8 villain of AFI's Top 50, is the quintessential femme fatale: a cheap broad using her luscious charms to lure a man into deadly actions. Neff comes to her house, expecting her husband for a car insurance renewal. She appears at the top of the stairs holding a bath-towel around her torso, throwing lust and temptation at Neff's face. It's one of the most legendary screen character's entrances because it establishes the character's personality in one iconic shot. At the second meeting, she climbs down the stairs with an ankle-bracelet, high-heeled shoes, like a viper determined to attract Neff to her nest. Neff understands what she's into when she asks if he can buy a life insurance without telling her husband. He leaves the house, but it's too late, he's already obsessed.\"Double Indemnity\" centers on Neff's tragic choices. Wilder makes it clear that the passion was consummated. But it's not love, not yet anyway: Phyllis hates her husband more than she loves Neff. Their passion rises below society's morality, and both despise its mediocrity. The Dietrichson's house is vast and luxurious, but the cinematographer used aluminum dust to create an impression of total carelessness. Phyliss is tired of her monotonous life, and Neff would probably love to break his routine. Why do they commit a crime together? In fact, it's because they found themselves together that they could do it. Phyliis catalyzed Neff's lowest instincts. She's indeed a great 'femme fatale' (also with two 'F') \"Double Indemnity\" is not about a crime, but human motives, not quite money, not quite lust but pure reverse existentialism. And Robinson admirably carries the psychological aspect of the film as Barton Keyes, the claims adjuster capable of detecting the phony claims. He's a living encyclopedia when it comes to statistics and his 'little man' never failed him. Only a man like him could have tried to figure the motives with this scientific accuracy, not an average detective. Keyes has a fondness on Neff, and it's reciprocal, their exchanges are punctuated with the film's only running gag: Neff giving Keyes a providential match to light his cigar, he eventually retorts to an insult by a tender \"Yeah, I love you, too\". Yet, Neff fears that his demise might come from his friend, the iconic venetian blinds' shadow on Neff's face almost feel like prison bars. How Robinson and McMurray didn't get nominated is beyond me. The film lost all its Oscar nominations for \"Going my Way\", more feel-good and less cynical I guess.But it's not a cynical film, it's about people tired of their own society's standards: marriage, fidelity, honesty, all hypocritical: Mr. Dietrichson hates his wife, his daughter Lola lies to him and people are just the lousy bunch of consumers. It's significant that Phyliss and Neff regularly meet in a supermarket, an 'un-film-noir' place illustrating the world they try to escape from, but can't because they're trapped and Neff knows it. And as Keyes predicts, it ends up in an exchange of bullets. Phyllis dies, and Neff, wounded, confesses. He couldn't escape his condition, he couldn't even escape from his office and reach the elevator, he collapses, agonizing in front of Keyes.Keyes lights his last cigarette, the last as a free man, a deserved one. because if him and Phyllis were both villains, within his own confession, Neff found a bit of redemption.",

It was interesting to watch their so called perfect scheme unfurl bit by bit, especially in regards to how the characters reacted to this. The only thing that I wish is that I had gotten a little more invested in the romance and the characters themselves.

Not unexpected of course when you take into account that it was co-written by Raymond Chandler and Billy Wilder who also directed. Are we talking PEDIGREE here or what. I have a self-imposed rule that I only comment on films that I've seen recently by which I mean within hours or at most days of posting a comment. With new films this isn't a problem but like most serious film buffs I've seen thousands of movies but many several years ago which disqualifies me - according to my self-imposed rule - from commenting on them until they show up on TV or video/DVD which this one just has. I've probably seen it a good half dozen times but the last time was a good half dozen years ago before I was active on this site but nevertheless despite the fact that there is nothing new to say I still want to add my voice to the other raves assembled here. Like all movies you begin with the script and this is a triple-distilled gem; in terms of vivid narrative plus low-key dialogue they don't come any better than Ray Chandler and this entry finds him right on top of his game. Wilder wasn't exactly a slouch either if anyone asks you witness the dozens of films he wrote WITHOUT Chandler but together the two writers came up with a masterpiece. Throw in some first-rate acting from the three leads and supporting players, on-the-money camera-work, a standout score and we're talking Movie Hall of Fame and Top Ten WITHIN that Hall of Fame.

            "content": "I have seen this film before, but tonight I saw a remastered version in theater as part of TCM's series. I felt that the quality of sound was uneven, but otherwise it was very satisfying.Like Billy Wilder's \"Sunset Boulevard\", most of the action is related via flashback. Fred McMurray plays an insurance salesman, Walter Neff, who dictates the story into a machine for his claims manager, Barton Keyes (Edward G. Robinson). The story revolves around Neff's relationship with a client's wife, Phyllis Dietrichson (Barbara Stanwyck)--a shady lady who is unhappy in her marriage.This film is considered one of the best examples of film noir and is routinely on best films lists. The B&W photography certainly supports that claim and it is an excellent film, but it has a shortfall.Fred McMurray was generally regarded as a film good guy. Wilder convinced him that he could play Neff, an unsavory character. He was right, of course, and he would do it again for Wilder in the film \"The Apartment\". But the tough-guy lingo that comes from McMurray's lips, especially in the early part of the film, seems out of place--not because it's McMurray saying it, but because his character is an insurance salesman. Such Chandleresque dialogue feels natural coming from Bogart's private dick in \"The Maltese Falcon\" or from John Garfield's drifter in \"The Postman Always Rings Twice\", but not here.We might also ask if Barbara Stanwyck is convincing as a woman who could drive Neff to obsession or moral abandon. Perhaps, but it's debatable. I don't think there would be a debate if the actress was Lana Turner (\"Postman\") or Kathleen Turner (\"Body Heat\").It is interesting they way Wilder gets the viewer to identify with Neff. When there are threats to Neff's nefarious plan, the viewer feels his anxiety. That adds to the film's feeling of suspense, even though the viewer has an idea where the story is going.Edward G. Robinson is brilliant as the corporate crime solver with a nose for fraud. He is the moral compass of the film. In this film, Wilder provides a glimpse of the genius that would produce so many masterpieces to come.",

Double Indemnity was one of those films that I had heard of, but I didn't plan on watching it until AMC Rewind, a film pod-cast hosted by Jon Schnepp and Alicia Malone, brought the film up. I cant believe it took me this long to see the film. It's not only one of the best film-noir's I have seen, but one of the best crime dramas ever made. It's ability to tell a story in which we think we know the entire plot and then unravel in a completely unexpected way was pure brilliance.Fred MacMurray and Barbara Stanwyck play an insurance agent and a fed up wife respectively. Phyllis, played by Stanwyck, convinces Walter, played by MacMurray, to set up a murder in order to ensure Phyllis of compensation. Only Walter truly believes that he can create the perfect murder without being caught and ride off into the sunset with Phyllis, whom he only just met. It's narrated by Walter through flashbacks so that we know from the get-go that he admits everything to his co-worker Barton Keyes. You would think that a murder set up by an insurance agent sounds silly, but Walter meticulously crafts this case. Just as Billy Wilder crafts this masterpiece. Except that when the case unravels, the film doesn't, it elevates. There have been some great murder movies, including particular mysteries involving trains. I can think of Strangers on a Train, The Lady Vanishes, and North by Northwest right off the top of my head, and that's just classic films. There's just something involving trans that makes a story stranger than usual.Knowing what film-noirs consist of I wasn't sold on Phyllis, but I was still pleasantly surprised with the outcome of her character. Each scene is just as suspenseful as the last so it creates a plot that's impossible to predict. Sure, the way the detectives/insurance agents find out about the set up was a bit far-fetched. Considering the police should have been suspicious of the autopsy, but that's a minor detail. The point is, Double Indemnity is a masterpiece of a film, and I highly recommend it to anyone, baby.+True suspense +Meticulously crafted +Wilder's direction +Train mysteries -Farfetched moments 9.2/10",

I've never been a huge fan of Fred MacMurray, but his 'nice guy' persona is used to sheer advantage by Wilder, and he end up both doing his finest work for Wilder (here and in 'The Apartment') and being the ultimate noir male protagonist. Interestingly, one of my favourite actors, Edward G. Robinson, thought so much of the script that he opted out of his demand of never doing a supporting role. Many people admire Wilder the director, but as a writer (or co-writer) he's just as cinematically important and influential.Like any other film of his, at least that I've had the pleasure to see, it's worth a purchase and re-watches.

            "content": "So very rarely do you get such a film that withstands the test of time without being too innovative. Films such as Citizen Kane, Casablanca and 2001: A Space Odyssey are all fantastic examples of what film can be and how a single film of however long can innovate, entertain and spellbind at the same time but something so simple and so straightforward as Double Indemnity can also prove to be of equal quality.Double Indemnity is not a film that is particularly visual, it's not a film that relies on standout performances or lines of dialogue that you hear quoted and see spoofed in other films years later; but where the genius and I must emphasise 'genius' lies is in its camera control and emphases on character and plot. The way the camera is used as an actual 'tool' rather than something to just point and shoot, the way the character of Phyllis (Stanwyck) is glamorised but at the same time presented in a dangerous way and of course, the break-neck pace in which the film moves along all culminate in a film experience that is truly entertaining and that gives us an education; not only in film but in morality.I mentioned the script has no standout lines but the way the characters communicate to one another is funny and so realistic, it's like being in the rooms with them. The way Walter (MacMurray) talks to his work colleague Barton (Robinson) about the case once its been carried out is not only fascinating because we know the truth but also just merely entertaining. There is no \"Here's looking at you kid\" or \"Open the pod bay doors\" but instead a series of humorous lines, witty put downs and amusing anecdotes; my favourite being when Walter's talking about insurance to a semi naked Phyllis and he states that he'd hate the household not to be \"fully covered\". I also liked the way the narration puts you in the film \u0096 Walter describes just about everything he does and everywhere he goes. He tells us what he's feeling and even what he smells: Honeysuckle in the air, last nights party cigars in the hosting room. We find out how he feels as we centre around him; I ask you: how many films are there that attach us to a character so much that we feel what he's feeling because he's telling us what it's actually like? Once all the classic flirting between Walter and Phyllis as well as the now iconic way in which she is glamorised through the camera as it moves with her, focuses on certain body parts and has her wear what it is she chooses to wear, the film beds down into the actual act of crime in sets up so well. The tension and atmosphere during the second third and beyond is tense enough but when little things pop up such as the injuring of Phyllis' husband's leg as well as suspicions in the office scene that includes a company chief suspecting foul play whilst Walter and Phyllis herself stand and sit waiting the outcome is brilliant as it's unpredictable. Barton's persistence in the office scene just involving Walter is fantastic as is when he turns up at Walter's flat when we are all expecting Phyllis any moment.Few other films get more and more intense as the plot carries on \u0096 it's like the scene of the crime as the detective tries to find clues only the scene is one massive world of evidence, witnesses, murder and suspects and the twist is that our protagonist is the guy who's got to pray nobody cracks the case. As an example of film noir, Double Indemnity is as good as it gets; as an example of story telling Double Indemnity is again, as good as it gets. In fact whatever things Double Indemnity does do in a minor and unspectacular fashion, it still manages to pull off as either mere entertainment or as tension wrought twists of the knife.",

The seedy environs of 1930s Los Angeles combine with Stanwyck's ability to practically breathe sexiness to make a perfect movie. Probably the most interesting role goes to Edward G.

I've been used to seeing him play gangsters, and here he's the character who just might throw a wrench into the main characters' plan.One of the most effective scenes is when Stanwyck's character first appears and then descends the staircase.

            "content": "\"Double Indemnity\" in a modern context seems remarkably unoriginal. An unhappy but wealthy housewife and her insurance salesman lover plot to scam and murder her husband to collect $100,000 on a double indemnity clause in his life insurance. But the film is a darkly lit, chain-smoking bona-fide film noir thriller, an execution of incredible suspense and style with dialog and narration that you just don't hear in film anymore. It's unflinchingly nostalgic, like an ageless perfume -- often mimicked, but still distinct. The structure of the story offers more of its originality. It opens with the main character, insurance salesman Walter Neff (Fred MacMurray), confessing a murder into the voice recording cylinder of his boss. It's a murder mystery told in hindsight, flaunting its mastery by managing to be suspenseful in Neff's retelling despite having revealed the end result. Though it takes awhile to get rolling, the film has you hooked and dying to know how it all went down.Neff's narrative gives the film its noir tone. Previously a romantic comedy actor, MacMurray absolutely nails the persona and voice of \"it was a dark and stormy night.\" His ability to light matches with one hand is a party trick that even today's ardent opposers of secondhand smoke would kill to know. His transition from slick, smooth-talking salesman to paranoid killer is the film's strongest plot arc.Billy Wilder writes and directs a film that flows surprisingly well. It's very clear what's going on and each scene takes time to set itself up and set a specific mood that he echoes with lighting. Scenes in front of windows or in doorways are a favorite of his in the film.\"Double Indemnity\" is one of the earliest examples of movies depicting the downfall of the small-time criminal who can't easily look past or forgive his/her own actions. 65 years later, this message has been diluted by many more films that echo it in more complex and intriguing ways. If you don't absolutely love this film, you probably love a film that borrows at least some element from this richly rooted classic.",

It's tough stuff, and it's an amazing film.Essentially we have an insurance salesman here getting embroiled in a sticky situation with a beautiful blonde femme fatale. It goes awry, needless to say, with Eddie G Robinson pulling the strings as an amazing support character, he gives one of his best performances here in my opinion, although the two leads have such magnetic screen presence not one scene in the film drags.If you like this, I recommend Earnest Hemmingway's The Killers, another classic.But this is the daddy, Double Indemnity is well worth they hype.",

            "content": "The mystery of Billy Wilder's seminal noir, the exceedingly brilliant trick that preserves even now as the silent, invisible motor for the story, is what the two main characters in actual fact feel about each other. They swagger from beginning to end the practice of a drum-tight murder scheme with dangerous figures of speech and chilly flirting, but they never give the certain impression that they actually care about one another to any particular degree, neither do they evoke such a concrete desire for the insurance money.Wilder dug out the rapport between MacMurray and Robinson. To give a sample of the plot is easy, but it is better to see this film without reading too much about it, because really it is the shade that makes it enticing. A crafty scheme. Though why? Stanwyck certainly has a motive, though it is seems like the inclination to murder occurs no more than because MacMurray comes in by sheer chance. The usual understanding of the essential customs of its plot are that the man is weak to a subtly dominant woman. But he's detached, indifferent, thick-skinned, curt. He always refers to her with nicknames that make her sound like she's a product he likes to buy. And this brand name of his? She's cold as ice, but later she says she cares more about their being together than the money. If they both seem driven by greed, then that is why they plot to kill her husband, but I am not quite convinced of that. And if they ever have a passion for or attraction to each other, it appears as if more like pretension, or like they are deceiving each other into thinking that way, because either way, that tension dwindles later on. Both are infatuated not so much by the crime as by the adventure of perpetrating it with the other someone. The motives we assume throughout are simulations.When it all boils down, they are film noir caricatures with not much mental or emotional profundity or individuality, and that is the intent. Wilder said that the director can never flaunt his style in any technical sense because it would distract from the story. So, in essence, he wisely believes that a director must hide. Pertaining to Double Indemnity, Wilder's sense of remaining hidden is ahead of the film's time, audience, its story and its characters. I would give anything to travel back in time to witness first-hand Wilder directing MacMurray and Stanwyck on the set. What could he have possibly said? He isn't concerned with the same issues the characters are, but rather what happens to them subsequent to what they consider so central.More actual feeling is focused in a different place. It has to do with MacMurray's worry of being found out, and the way he feels about his boss, Edward G. Robinson, who robs every scene blind, plays the claims adjuster as an idealistic maverick who skates the edge of the dress code when he wants to loosen up, treats his office like his own personal den at home, chain smokes, and sees MacMurray as his prot\u00e9g\u00e9. He plays a paternal role for him. He's also constantly thinking thinking thinking, and sooner or later he figures things out, setting in motion moments of uneasy apprehension in us, the audience.Double Indemnity was one of the earlier films noir. The photography by visually facilitated the noir style of sharp-edged shade and silhouettes, peculiar points of view and lonesome urban surroundings. But Wilder may have achieved a timelessness with this movie through some of the sneakiest, most cunning directing ever. I don't believe that many people see the story the way he saw it, but he told it the way he saw it, in a manner that appeared to meet the natural presumptions of the audience. Subsequent noir may have borrowed from its visual style, but its narrative style remains more intact than even the most bewildering in film history.",

            "content": "This is such a deeply cynical film. The two main characters never seem to mean anything they ever say, especially to each other. They're both awful, awful people who kill a man and try to take a big insurance payoff. It also forged an entire genre of film, establishing its tone, archetypes, and visual style that would be mimicked for decades. It's such an imminently watchable film.One of the more interesting parts of the film is the fact that the male protagonist, Walter Neff, isn't a cop, private detective, or government agent. He's an insurance salesman. He goes out to see to a client of his who has let his car insurance lapse (which was apparently an optional thing back in the 40s), and meets the man's wife, Phyllis, who's a complete sexpot. The two have an immediate attraction, but it's thin. It's more of a primal lust than anything approaching love, even though the very next time they meet, after having bandied about ideas of killing the husband to collect the insurance, they start professing their love for each other.But the love isn't backed by any actual emotion. They only begin to profess this love when the idea of working together to collect a payday from the husband's death. The romance feels phony, but that's the point. There's no depth to the romance because they are using each other.Up against the couple is the great Edward G. Robinson as Barton Keyes, the fraud investigator at the insurance company. His introductory scene, before the pair begin their plotting, shows his method through an interview with someone who had made a claim against his insurance policy. Keyes just had a bad feeling about the facts of the case, and he pursued them. He outlines what he found and he turns the claimant from an assured man to a broken one who can barely find his way out the door.The criminal pair follow through on their plot, killing the husband but making an extra gambit to fulfill the double indemnity clause of the policy. The company will pay double if the husband dies in a certain set of circumstances, one of which is falling off of a moving train. So, they strangle him away from the train, Neff plays the husband's part in going on the train, jumps off the back, and they leave the husband's body behind to be found later.Keyes is initially on their side, insisting that the death was accidental in opposition to the insurance company's owner, but some details begin to gnaw at him and Keyes can't let go. That suspicion is the penny on the tracks that completely derails the train that carry the murderous pair, Neff and Phyllis. Based on what comes after, though, they were going to derail anyway. The two aren't tied together by anything emotionally genuine. It's only their desire for the money from the murder that kept them together at all, but once the act is completed and before they ever get the money, they can't stay as one.Their romance was phony, so Phyllis is already moving away from Neff while Neff is prone to suspect Phyllis of turning on him. Just the mere suspicion of her having an affair with another man, her step-daughter's boyfriend Nino, is enough to turn him against her.This purely cynical exercise and the derailment of the train of greed is so wonderfully done. The characters are vivid and alive. Their opponent in Keyes is marvelously intelligent and knows his job well enough when to insert himself and when to let things play out. The movie is dripping with visual style, and the melodramatic score works as a great counterbalance to the faux emotion playing out on screen. It's such a great exercise in entertainment with a twisty plot, great characters, and just plain fun. At only his third movie, Billy Wilder had made a great film and an American classic.",

            "content": "Paramount Studio's 1944 release Double Indemnity is one of the best examples of true-to-form film noir. The plot of the film is straightforward. Fueled by greed, a wife decides to take out an insurance policy on her unsuspecting husband, with plans of murdering him for the proceeds. The policy contains a double indemnity clause, which will pay twice the policy amount in the event of death by accident. To make her plan succeed, she enlists the help of an accomplice to help murder her spouse and make it seem accidental.Adapted from a novel by James M. Cain, Double Indemnity is loosely based on the real-life Snyder-Gray murder case of 1927, in which a New York housewife persuaded her young lover to commit murder. The woman had taken out a double indemnity life insurance policy on her husband without his knowledge. The murder succeeded but the killers were caught and executed the following year. Just as actual events influenced the making of this film, Double Indemnity has influenced numerous movies based on the same premise, the most notable of which are 1946's The Postman Always Rings Twice and 1981's Body Heat.The film stars Fred MacMurray as Walter Neff, a fast-talking insurance salesman, attempting to pull the perfect fraud job. It is Fred MacMurray who is narratting the film. Of course he didn't start out with that idea - it all stated when he met, and immediately fell for, Phyllis Dietrichson (Barbara Stanwyck). From there the tale she spins of her unhappy marriage, complicated by a tempestuous relationship with stepdaughter Lola, takes him on the slippery slope to crime. With his extensive knowledge of the insurance business, nothing can stop Walter from covering his tracks ingeniously\u0085 except the analytical skills of his friend, the fraud investigator Barton Keyes.Frequently told in flashbacks, this movie is utterly compelling from the word go. It's interesting to ponder whether this film could have had the same impact if it had been shot in colour - but I don't think so. The filming is spot on, the camera angles, use of shadow and perspectives on the actors all add to the tension of the film. The screen does sometimes get so dark as to be impossible to tell what's going on in a couple of scenes, but this is done deliberately so as to add to the suspense.The film is very wordy, as so many films of the era were and the dialogue is often brilliant. Billy Wilder's direction is another part of the key to this film's being in the IMDb Top 250 Movies of All Time list and also features in the Top 50 among the IMDb Film Noir list in fact at # 3 when I last saw it. There are moments of humour to lighten the mood and scenes of compelling drama / intrigue / emotion. With the excellent acting, awesome script and breathtaking art direction / cinematography it makes one of the best films of all time in a lot of peoples' list - including mine.In case you didn't know (I didn't), the term \"Double Indemnity\" refers to an insurance clause where a double payment is handed out if someone whose life is insured dies in an unusual manner. Theoretically of course the chances of this happening are remote, meaning little danger of them ever having to pay it out\u0085 and cases when someone has died in this manner shortly after taking out a life insurance policy would automatically be viewed as suspicious. The way Walter covers his tracks, and the way Barton uncovers them, are quite brilliant and show (to a layman at least) a deep knowledge of the insurance business.Double Indemnity was nominated for no less that seven Oscars; sadly it didn't win a single one. But from 1944, it's popularity has increased year after year and when you talk of noir movies DOuble Indemnity instantly come to ones mind.",

Things go smoothly until Walter's boss at the insurance company, Keyes (Edward G Robinson), gets involved and follows his hunch concerning foul play.The main bulk of the story is told in flashback. There is tension, suspense, a good cast and many good scenes. A particular favourite of mine is when Neff is relaxing in his car drinking a pint of beer at the wheel - those were the days! The cast are good with Edward G Robinson and Barbara Stanwyck stealing the show. Stanwyck plays deception very well, eg, the scene where she is called to an interview after the death of her husband and more than holds her own when challenged about the circumstances. She also has a few things up her sleeve including a twist at the end. MacMurray is good in the lead role - it's a shame he was given some daft dialogue, though, which is surprising given that Billy Wilder did the writing. His use of the word \"baby\" at the end of almost every thing he says to Stanwyck is extremely cheesy. Maybe this was \"hep\" talk in those days but today it sounds crass and is laughable.The film is a good length with twists that reveal themselves gradually throughout the film right until the end.",

            "content": "What makes \"Doubled Indemnity\" more sinister and ultimately more disturbing than other movies of its type are the movies' characters, or better said the \"station\" of the characters. Unlike other noir classics such as \"Public Enemy\", \"Detour\", and \"The Postman Always Rings Twice\", the characters of DI are not half-forgotten lowlifes crawling in the gutter of society. Fred MacMurray and Barbara Stanwyck are upright respectable people. MacMurray is an insurance agent, and Stanwyck, who is married to a rich businessman, lives among the Los Angeles upper-crust. I can't remember if her house is supposed to be in Beverly Hills, but it is in one of the more exclusive areas of LA.These two characters do not engage in their illicit activities for reasons of pure survival as in \"Postman\" or \"Detour\". Their motivation is far more complex and terrifying. They are bored with their present situations. MacMurray realizes that as an insurance agent, he is on a permanent plateau financially. He will probably never exceed what money he has already made. Stanwyck, despite being the wife of a wealthy man, finds her life dull, without excitement, without sex. MacMurray wants greater financial power. She wants greater sexual power and freedom. When the two meet, they sense a strange chemistry in which each can gain something from the other. MacMurray can gain wealth and higher standing from Stanwyck. Stanwyck can gain freedom with the help of MacMurray. And the means to these ends is an insurance policy. Stanwyck holds the policy but MacMurray understands certain implications about the policy that is not even known to Stanwyck. From this very simple seed, an insurance agent, his client, and an insurance policy, grows crime, betrayal, and murder. And yet these characters are people you might have met in town in 1944. Typical upstanding citizens. And yet what lurks inside them seems at first hideous and evil. And yet, strangely familiar... The characters of DI represent the darker sides that we all have within us. Every hetero male has moments when he might covet the beautiful wife of a wealthy neighbor or acquaintance and wished for a moment that he could take the other man's place. And isn't there something deep inside some hetero married females who wish they could extract themselves from their marriage without losing their wealth? Certainly, the actions that lead to the undoing of MacMurray and Stanwyck may be grotesque on the surface. But deeper inside, the motivations behind their behavior represent something that is inside many of us. We identify with these characters while the morale of society says we should not.",

            "content": "The crackling, whip-smart dialogue provided by master film auteur Billy Wilder and supreme crime novelist Raymond Chandler is what makes this 1944 film noir such a timeless classic, certainly among the very best of the genre. Considering this was just the third film he directed, Wilder is already at the top of his game here in this adaptation of a James Cain novella about a sleazy hotshot insurance man named Walter Neff, who is out to renew an auto insurance claim with a wealthy oil driller named Dietrichson. The man isn't home but his lethally cool wife Phyllis is, and the sexual combustion between them is palpable from the moment they meet. Told in flashback, the story unfolds constant layers of duplicity by stupid, morally bankrupt people - which is why this film is so much fun to watch, simply because the behavior is twisted in a rather exaggerated manner that makes you cringe and laugh at the same time.It certainly helps that Wilder cast three actors who turn in exemplary performances. In an about-face from his usually genial roles, Fred MacMurray is surprisingly effective as a man weakened by his passions and seeking salvation far too late. It's easily his best screen work at least until Wilder cast him as the immoral, adulterous office boss in another classic, \"The Apartment\", sixteen years later. Calculating and seductive in a cheap blond wig and a provocative anklet, Barbara Stanwyck personifies the hard-boiled dame with a brilliant turn as Phyllis. She is the role model for all femme fatales that came after her - including Kathleen Turner's star-making turn in \"Body Heat\" nearly forty years later. Walter and Phyllis claim to be in love, so much so that they plot to kill her husband for the insurance. But there is no love between these two - just reciprocal contempt. She's just a conquest to him, and he's a pawn to her. What's more, their plan is ridiculous. Neff breaks her husband's neck, and then they plant him on the railroad tracks to imply he fell off the back of a 15 mile per hour train after taking out a policy that pays double for a death on a train. As the most decent person of an unseemly lot, Edward G. Robinson portrays Barton Keyes, a wily insurance investigator who likes Walter in spite of himself and the revelations about him. It all ends the way you would expect but in such a darkly humorous way that it's enjoyable just to see how.",

And then the flashback begins and we spend the rest of the film seeing how it is we got to that ending we already know. It would seem that under these circumstances there may not be much drama or tension in the film but that could not be further from the truth. We may know the film's ultimate destination but the journey never fails to be compelling. It is fascinating to watch this classic film noir story unfold. It is a film which will hold your attention throughout.Fred MacMurray has the lead role in the film, that of insurance salesman Walter Neff, an ordinary man who will find himself entangled in an extraordinarily complex murder plot. The drama begins when Walter meets Phyllis Dietrichson, a woman quite eager to see her husband meet an untimely demise. A demise which will prove to be quite lucrative for Phyllis if only she can manage to take out a life insurance policy on her husband without his knowledge. Here of course is where our insurance salesman enters the picture and the plot will very quickly be put into motion.Barbara Stanwyck plays Phyllis in what would come to be one of film's most famous femme fatale roles. While Walter initially is not at all interested in murder he certainly is interested in Phyllis and it does not take long for her to entangle Walter in her web. The fact it takes her so little time to convince a man she doesn't even know to murder her husband does strain credulity a bit. One moment Walter meets Phyllis and seemingly a moment later he's willing to kill for her. It is very obvious who the stronger of the two characters is. Phyllis is cold and ruthless and apparently has her ways of convincing a weaker man to do her bidding. Since this is a film produced in 1944 we're not going to see explicitly what those ways may be but you can hazard a good guess. Walter never stood a chance.The story always captivates and it is fascinating to see the seemingly perfect murder plot play out. But the movie does have some flaws. Much of the dialogue seems clipped and forced. MacMurray is the biggest offender in this regard, so often speaking in a tone which seems completely unnatural. His insistence on referring to Phyllis as \"Baby\" every time he speaks to her wears thin quickly. It's as if Walter is trying real hard to be the cold, hard tough guy but it never convinces. He's no match for Phyllis. In fact while MacMurray is obviously playing the key figure it is Edward G. Robinson in a supporting role as insurance company investigator Barton Keyes who really shines. Watching Keyes try to unravel the plot, the plot we already know inside and out, is great fun and Robinson does an excellent job with his role, creating a truly memorable character. And of course Stanwyck is excellent as well. MacMurray's OK, just not up to the level of his co-stars, which is exacerbated by the fact that it is he who narrates the story throughout the film-long flashback.All in all, director Billy Wilder did a magnificent job creating a wonderfully atmospheric thriller. The look and feel of the film are perfect, adding to the great tension. The fact there is so much tension and drama even though we pretty much already know what's going to happen is remarkable. Yes at times the film seems a little dated, most especially with its dialogue. But there is no denying the film is very well done. It's not a perfect film by any means but it is one which rightly will stand the test of time.",

            "content": "Since the dawn of the studio era, there had always been producer-directors \u2013 accomplished filmmakers adept at handling both the creative and business end of things. Extremely rare in those days was the writer-director, but in the early 1940s a handful of them started to emerge. Orson Welles, Preston Sturges, Joseph L. Mankiewicz, and Billy Wilder, writer-director of Double Indemnity.Of course, Wilder didn't write alone, but then few writers did anyway. Double Indemnity is co-scripted with novelist Raymond Chandler. However, while Chandler may have had the gift for prose I feel Wilder in particular helped to bring a new understanding of how writing could work for the screen. Instrumental here is the use of voice-over narration. Rather than burden the picture with too many words or spoon-feed plot points to the audience, it actually smooths over a lot of bumps in the narrative which would otherwise have to be done with potentially awkward dialogue. For example, two characters are introduced with the words \"On the piano were pictures of Dietrichson and Lola, his daughter from his first marriage\". A simple, effective and unobtrusive bit of exposition. Having to shoehorn that piece of information into a conversation between two characters would be clunky to say the least.This fills an important gap in cinematic technique that had been looming since the end of the silent era. They say a picture is worth a thousand words, but sometimes the reverse is true. In a silent movie you could throw in a title card saying something like \"This is Nathan Butts, owner of the second-largest shipping company in Massachusetts\", followed by a shot of Mr Butts in person. Come the talkies, you could still have the shot but had to get the accompanying information across in other ways. This isn't to say the voice-over narration is the only way, or that it is always the more effective \u2013 even in the earliest sound features there was some great use of inventive dialogue and visual cues \u2013 but it is certainly an important string in any screenwriter's bow.However Double Indemnity is not merely a deluge of word-based exposition. There is plenty going on here visually, and I'm not just talking about that eerie cinematography, wonderful though it is. Wilder may have been relatively new to the job but he was already shaping up to be a fine director. He's not afraid to keep the camera on one character while another is speaking, focusing us on reactions and motivations. A great example is the long-drawn out close-up of Barbara Stanwyck while her husband is murdered in the seat beside her. He also places things in the frame that look incidental but are no doubt deliberate, and seem to be speaking out to us. In the first supermarket meet-up, look at how prominent he makes those tins of baby food, with the child's eyes looking innocently out over the scene. Juxtaposed with a frank discussion of murder it adds to the creepy guilt-ridden feel that we the audience will no doubt be sharing.And Wilder was from the off a great director of actors, and shrewd at casting. MacFred is not generally a mark of quality on any picture. It's not that he's bad, he is just incredibly bland. In Double Indemnity though his blandness becomes like a kind of blank slate. He's a believable everyman, but not in a charismatic, likable way as, say, Jimmy Stewart. The way he tries to mute his body language and avoid eye-contact \u2013 just as people really do when they have a guilty secret \u2013 is highly effective, and he would not work so well in the part if he were this engaging, watchable character. Barbara Stanwyck on the other hand is the very model of icy indifference. She does not need to show guilt because her character does not have the morals of Neff. But what she does need to do is lie a lot, and Stanwyck is acting well enough that there are palpable but not overstated difference in the tone of her performance when she is fibbing and when she is being sincere. Cold-heartedness has never appeared so complex. Finally Edward G. Robinson provides a lively counterpoint to MacFred, always talking with his hands as well as his mouth. He also secures the note of poignancy in the final scene, and really deserved at least a nomination for Best Supporting Actor.Although Wilder's career of director as well as writer began a little after those of Orson Welles and Preston Sturges, and certainly Welles is now the more lauded figure, Wilder probably did far more for the medium than any other writer-director. It was his professionalism, his ability to work as part of the studio team and has full understanding of what cinema could do that placed him so far ahead of his peers.",

I cannot get enough of SUNSET BOULEVARD (1950), truly a one-of-a-kind film, that seems to get richer with each passing year. LOST WEEKEND (1945) also holds up very well to this day-and-age, but few of his other films did. But this campy piece of murder, double-crossing and intrige by Wilder, I never cared for. The set-up? $50,000. Insurance policy. Double crossing. Adultery. Murder. Und so weiter, und so weiter... the usual noir ingredients. Watching this sixty years later, with Fred MacMurray and Barbara Stanwyck strutting their way through the now utterly familiar noir plot line, whispering seductive lines too each other, it's non-too-exciting anymore. Probably a victim of its own success, but anyone getting excited over the plot hasn't lived the last sixty years, so what is it that's still appealing? The dialog? Stanwyck? Edward G. Robinson? I never understood what the appeal of Barbara Stanwyck was. In THE LADY EVE (1941) I positively loathed her brooding persona, she had zero sex appeal. She just annoys the hell out of me, I can't help it. There's also something about MacMurray's continuous voice-over makes that makes me fall asleep each time I see this. It probably has something to do with the timbre in his voice. I never even managed to watch this in one stretch. Camera Obscura --- 4/10",

When I think of this film, I think of Proverbs 5:3-5 For the lips of a strange woman drop as an honeycomb, and her mouth is smoother than oil.

            "content": "\"Double Indemnity\" is today regarded as one of the paramount examples of film noir. The movie's source was the short novel of the same name by renowned crime author James M. Cain. In it, a dissatisfied wife schemes with an insurance salesman to murder her husband and split the proceeds. However, the crime that seemed perfect in the planning stages ends up imperfect in the execution.The stars of the film give it most of its flavour. Fred MacMurray contributed a suitably cynical performance in the male lead while Barbara Stanwyck smolders as the film's requisite femme fatale. Though Stanwyck nabbed the film's only Oscar nomination in the acting categories I think that third-billed Edward G. Robinson actually delivered the film's best performance. In any case, the acting is in good hands with these three individuals on board.Fortunately for them, they were working from a crackerjack script by Billy Wilder & Raymond Chandler. While some of the dialogue struck me as hard-boiled to the point of caricature I think that these guys did a good job of translating Cain's novel to the screen. They may have had to lose a bit of Cain's intricate plotting but they made up for it by adding some interesting touches of their own.Two of the film's key Oscar nominations resulted from Billy Wilder's direction and the moody cinematography of John Seitz. The cinematography in particular would be much imitated in later films. The score by Mikl\u00f3s R\u00f3zsa was also Oscar-nominated, though I didn't find it as impressive as the visuals.In the end, \"Double Indemnity\" is a fine film though I can't help but think that it's a little over-rated. The way it's venerated by critics you'd think that Wilder & company invented film noir out of whole cloth. There were indeed precedents, though this film perhaps proved to be the most influential in the end. By all means, see the movie but don't expect something that's on quite the same level as Wilder's masterpieces \"Sunset Blvd.\" & \"Some Like it Hot\".",

That street is usually a dingy urban alley or a dank sidestreet, but in Billy Wilder's Double Indemnity, it was a deceptively quiet suburban avenue. \"Down these mean streets a man must go who is not himself necessarily mean,\" wrote novelist Raymond Chandler, and as a screenwriter, he joined Wilder in sending one Walter Neff, insurance investigator, down the crookedest of these dead end lanes of the spirit.The streets of Los Angeles are busier and deadlier than they were in Chandler's heyday. Yet Chandler's disquieting, existential take on the City of Angels transcends fashions in both transportation and crime. Those mean streets remain mean, and mementos of Double Indemnity can still be seen all over the city. The Hollywood Bowl where Walter and Lola Dietrichson meet; Walter's apartment at the Ch\u00e2teau Marmont; the Glendale train station where the \"perfect crime\" begins... And the \"death house\" of Double Indemnity, where Phyllis and Walter meet, plot murder, and where their strange love finally reaches its apocalypse, still stands, secluded and quiet, high in the Hollywood Hills, at 6301 Quebec Street, in Los Angeles. Exteriors were shot there, and sets were modeled after the inside of the house. The house seems to rear up in the summer twilight, remembering the night fifty years ago when a cruel woman brought her husband out to a big LaSalle sedan idling in the garage, with a killer in the back seat. The house's silent, stuccoed cloisters look gloomily down on Quebec Street, while Walter Neff's disembodied footfalls echo off the asphalt.",

            "content": "At one point late in the film, Walter Neff (Fred MacMurray) utters a line that could have been used to describe the movie, a 'crazy story with a crazy twist to it'. \"Double Indemnity\" is hugely successful despite the fact that it reveals the killer at the very beginning of the story. The suspense comes from the intertwining webs that Neff and Phyllis Dietrichson (Barbara Stanwyck) spin for each other while they're spinning out of control. With it's casting, the film was one of the first to effectively subvert the idea of who could be a murderer, even if ultimately, they didn't get away with it.Fortunately, director Billy Wilder finally managed to convince the movie's principals to take part in the project. MacMurray, Stanwyck and Edward G. Robinson all initially turned it down, none of them wanted to do it. Not surprising for the first two, they would be seriously cast against type and didn't want to portray murderers on screen for what it might do to their careers. In Robinson's case, he was reluctant to take a supporting role, but his better judgment won out, convincing himself that it would be better to take parts with substance at this point in his career rather than take a starring role in a film of no consequence. Good decision.It's Robinson in fact that keeps the film's tension mounting with his unique 'man inside' observations of the crime at the center of the story. Escalating Mr. Dietrichson's (Tom Powers) demise from accident to suicide to murder would have been a stretch for anyone had it not been for Barton Keyes' (Robinson) deliberate method and cunning to smoke out the mystery. Even though he might have mis-stepped by fingering Zachetti, there was enough of a pause after stating \"They'll be digging their own graves\" when he takes a long look at Neff off screen to tempt the viewer into thinking that he in fact might suspect Neff as the killer. It would have been interesting to see the film go in that direction.By the time it was over, I couldn't help thinking that here was one mystery thriller that would have done justice to Alfred Hitchcock's repertoire; it even had a train. Aside from the murder and the cunning cross and double cross of Stanwyck's character, I was probably most intrigued by the thirty thousand dollar price tag Neff put on the Dietrichson home. Now that would have been some investment.",

It may not be the best one, but it's up there and the reason, in this critic's opinion, belongs to MacMurray. He is so good in every scene, whether he is flirting, murdering, or simply narrating, he convinces you all the way and makes you wish that he hadn't made the mistake of going to the Dietrichson house that sunny afternoon. Stanwyck is devilish as the femme fatale and Edward G. Robinson is so smooth as a fast-talking, intelligent insurance claims adjuster who lets nothing get in his way from solving a mysterious case.

Either way, I found this film pretty shallow to watch, though it was engaging at some parts, it otherwise felt like it was stalling along. (Also, my view probably reflects the generation I'm born in)I am pretty annoyed by Walter's narration. The film is narrated by him as he recounts the events of the past few weeks. I think I feel annoyed by his narration because his voice sounds so matter of fact and emotionless that it makes me not want to listen to him. MacMurray's acting too is quite static, matching well with his voice to produce a static and emotionless character. Stanwyck isn't much better, but does show that there is a little more depth to her character than is perceived. Robinson and Heather as supporting actors do their part well enough.The character of Phyllis, being the main female character in the film, can also be perceived as the film being misogynistic. First, she is introduced by objectification of her legs, and becoming the source of romantic interest to Walter. Then, she is depicted as the damsel in distress, needing to be saved from her terrible marriage. Then by the end she is seen as this chaotic, destructive woman. All of which are stereotypes of femininity, with the last seen as a punishment to women who resist the patriarchal order.The use of camera work and lighting plays a crucial part in the film, and does give the sense of Expressionism. With the dark matter at hand and dark mise-en-scene, it adds to the mood of the theme. However the editing style, to me, makes the film quite hectic and all over the place. It jumps from the present to the past without a strong coherent flow, and that is probably why I lost interest in the film. I imagined the film to be over multiple times until it eventually did end.However, the script was pretty engaging, with the conversations between Walter and Phyllis pretty entertaining. The flirtations between them are blatantly obvious and the metaphors used are a little cringe-worthy, but which made it fun to laugh at.Read more movie reviews at: championangels.wordpress.com",

            "review_title": "Double Indemnity review",
            "content": "Directed by Billy Wilder in 1944, Double Indemnity is the quintessential film noir. Based on the novel by James M Cain, the film follows insurance salesman Walter Neff (Fred MacMurray) who finds himself seduced by the wife of one of his wealthier clients; the beautiful, but cunning Phyllis Dietrichson (Barbra Stanwyck). Phyllis is the classic femme fatale; she perpetuates an innocent facade, but beneath this she is a master manipulator, and she convinces Walter to assist her in murdering her husband. The pair conspire to portray Mr Dietrichson's death as an accident in order to receive a hefty insurance payout, which will be doubled if Dietrichson dies in what is considered to be a rare or unusual way, such as by a collision with a train. Walter's insurance experience enables him to plot the murder seamlessly, but his boss, Barton Keyes (Edward G Robinson), has a knack for sniffing out bogus claims, and it is not long before he starts to have suspicions about the death of Mr Dietrichson.Double Indemnity is a visually stunning film that uses all of the stylistic choices associated with film noir; the high contrast black and white, the oblique camera angles, and the shadowy light filtering through the horizontal blinds. As soon as the film opened with the image of a man's silhouette hobbling through the mist on crotches, I was hooked. I personally adore this style, and the time period in which these films are set; where the men wear hats and trench coats, and the women look sleek and elegant in gowns that reveal only a little bit of flesh. These films are glamorous and sophisticated, and conjure up a sense of nostalgia; a longing for a time that most of us alive today have never experienced.Barbra Stanwyck is killer in this film. She may not be a traditional beauty, but she smolders on the screen. She has such a powerful presence that she conveys with utmost subtlety, and as a viewer you are drawn to her in every scene. Fred MacMurray delivers an adequate performance; he is convincing and satisfying as Walter Neff, but he is never outstanding. Edward G Robinson, on the other hand, is charming and amusing as Walter's eccentric, slightly caricatured boss.The film is extremely dialogue reliant, but this never becomes tiresome as the exchanges between the characters are so witty, and are often layered with sexual innuendo, particularly between Walter and Phyllis. Additionally, the pace of the film is quite slow, which again leads to an assumption that the film would consequently drag, however, this pace works perfectly in creating suspense. Billy Wilder emulates Hitchcock in many suspenseful scenes throughout Double Indemnity, most notably in the climatic showdown between Phyllis and Walter, and also the scene at the train tracks.Mikl\u00f3s R\u00f3zsa's original score is probably my least favourite part of the film as it is quite jarring and often draws attention to itself, rather than simply supporting the visuals. Personally, I don't believe that the score suits the rest of the film in terms of style, however, it does assist in supporting suspense.The term \"film noir\" wasn't coined until two years after Double Indemnity was released. French film critic Nino Frank is credited with the term, but at the time the American film industry did not accept \"film noir\" as an official genre. Whether it is a genre, a style or a movement is still debated today. Frank was able to recognise this trend in American films due to the fact that the second World War caused a delay in the release of these films in France, and they all hit French screens at around the same time. Frank noticed that most of these films involved the solving a crime, employed a melancholy voice over, and tended to have a pessimistic vibe.Double Indemnity was certainly not the first film noir to be made; many films dating more than a decade prior have been later classified as film noir, however, the success of Double Indemnity among critics and audiences alike at the time of its release has caused it to receive the greatest recognition as the most identifiable film noir.",

            "review_title": "The quintessential film noir !!!",
            "content": "Along with maybe John Huston's 'The Maltese Falcon', Billy Wilder's 'Double Indemnity' is considered by a majority of critics and audience to be the film that pioneered the rise of the film movement that later came to be termed as Film Noir. 'Double Indemnity' has all the tropes and clich\u00e9s that became an integral part of the subsequent films of the aforementioned genre. It has the shady and morally crooked characters, the voice-over narration, the seductive and vicious femme fatale, a gloomy look and cinematography which involves a constant attention to the use of shadows and darkness. No one can ever deny how influential a film 'Double Indemnity' is. One has to only see the number of remakes and rip- offs that have been made of it to grasp its legacy.For me, the greatest part of the film are the characters. There are no flawless characters in the film. Everyone is shady. Yes, Phyllis is the femme fatale who initiates the journey towards the dark side. But watching the film, I have always thought that Walter was not completely upright from a moral standpoint when he entered the Dietrichson mansion. Of course his sexual attraction towards Phyllis was the factor that was responsible for his initial interest in her, but I don't think that was the major reason why he decided to devise the plan and commit the murder. I think there was always a hidden urge in him to use his know-how of the insurance business and manipulate the rules and the system to his benefit just like the analogy of the roulette conductor who ends up wanting to rob the house which was mentioned in the narration. He always had this darkness in him, but the chance encounter with Phyllis actually brings that darkness out. Billy Wilder had a dark and cynical side to him, however even in his dark films, he always used to throw in some humanism which is apparent in this film too. We find that although Phyllis is a 'gold digger' and a master manipulator, but Wilder's representation of Phyllis' cranky, husband who doesn't care about his wife's future does provide some justification for her motives. Walter also gets humanised through his great friendship with Keyes. As a matter of fact Wilder himself stated that the relationship between Walter and Keyes was the only love story in the entire film. The way both Walter and Phyllis meet their respective ends in the film also humanises them.The film is directed with meticulous precision. The film uses exaggerated shadows and darkness reminiscent of German expressionist cinema but in a meaningful way in the context of the plot to visually portray the darkness that lurks inside the central characters. The cinematographer uses Venetian blinds expertly to give the illusion of a prison that Wilder wanted. In a way, 'Double Indemnity' uses the plot structure similar to another Wilder film 'Sunset Boulevard' where a man enters a big mansion and meets a woman who ends up making his life a prison. In 'Sunset Boulevard' the mansion itself becomes the prison, while in 'Double Indemnity', the prison is more figurative. Barbara Stanwyck is fantastic as Phyllis. She expresses a lot through her eyes and effortlessly shifts from innocent to seductive throughout the film. It is very difficult to play a character who remains a mystery for the viewer as well as the other characters in the film and she does it very well. Fred MacMurray expertly plays a man who thinks he has everything figured out while the viewer knows that this is just his overconfidence. It is fascinating to see his facial expressions change from one of confidence to one of extreme paranoia over the course of the plot. Edward G. Robinson puts in a dynamic performance as Keyes. His character is cynical and unsentimental, but his scenes with MacMurray are probably the most humane in the whole film and these scenes exude a sense of mutual respect which lacks in the scenes with Phyllis and Walter.The screenplay written by Wilder and Raymond Chandler keeps the film moving at a brisk pace. What makes the film a little less effective in my eyes now after all these years is the lack of a gradual rise in the sexual tension between the two characters. I think this was well executed in Kasdan's 'Body Heat' which was a remake. I thought the relationship felt slightly rushed, but of course the strict censorship of the 1940s also plays a role in this. Another aspect is that the plot of the film has been reused on so many occasions that it no longer has the same impact that it once had. This is not a blot on the film, but that's the honest thought that I had watching it in 2016.'Double Indemnity' certainly deserves its recognition and acclaim as the film that led to the rise of Film Noir. It is well acted and brilliantly directed. But unfortunately due to the umpteen number of remakes and similar films that have appeared subsequently, the impact of the basic plot of the film might feel a bit diluted at this day and age.",

            "content": "The plan is devious, but a simple one. In an effort to rid herself of her allegedly abusive ex-husband, a woman strikes up a romance with an insurance salesman who just happens upon her doorstep with some auto insurance renewals. Since it's not enough to get out of her marriage without financial security, she enlists the salesman to not only commit fraud by having the cuckolded husband sign a life insurance policy with a double indemnity clause without any knowledge of doing so, but also to help her bump off her husband by making it look like an accident. Unfortunately, paranoia and conscience tends to get in the way in situations like these, and even something that seems to be a \"perfect murder\" can go sour, fast. This is the plot of Billy Wilder's celebrated 1944 noir masterpiece, \"Double Indemnity\", in which Phyllis Dietrichson (Stanwyck) and Walter Neff (MacMurray) find themselves embroiled in a situation that at the time, seemed like a good one, until they end up way over their heads; mainly due to their lack of trust in each other. Rounding out the cast is Edward G. Robinson, who plays Barton Keyes, Walter's friend and co-worker at the insurance company, a man who is on the trail of the murder plot due to his position as the manager of claims.\"Double Indemnity\" has been hailed as one of the best, if not the best, of the film noir genre. It is such a dark film, both in plot and aesthetically, that it is sometimes easy to forget that Billy Wilder didn't just direct romantic comedies like \"Some Like it Hot\", \"The Seven Year Itch\" and \"Sabrina\". Particularly in his earlier filmography, we see wonderful dark films mixed in with the fanciful, like this one and \"The Lost Weekend\". Dimly lit, with wonderful shadows and people hiding behind dark glasses and behind doors and corners, \"Double Indemnity\", while not the first film in the noir genre, certainly is one that defines it. Wilder's direction is brilliant, particularly the machine-gun pacing of both the action and the dialogue. The screenplay in particular is inspired, as the rapid-fire dialogue between characters is spewed as fast as one can process it. Lines like, \"Do I laugh now, or wait until it gets funny?\" or \"How could I have known that murder could sometimes smell like honeysuckle?\" or my personal favorite exchange between Phyllis and Walter: Phyllis: \"I wonder if I know what you mean?\" Walter: \"I wonder if you wonder\" are so deliciously classic that it's difficult not to enjoy every one of them.I cannot picture any other actors in their roles than MacMurray, Stanwyck and Robinson. Stanwyck, at this point a legend in cinema already, had previously worked with Wilder on the screwball comedy \"Ball of Fire\" with Gary Cooper, but despite their comedic history, Wilder had the foresight to cast her. Fred MacMurray is so typecast as Steve Douglas in the television show \"My Three Sons\" and as the \"Absent-Minded Professor\" in a series of Disney films, that no matter how prepared one is to see him in this film, personally I can't help but chuckle the first time he is on screen. His casting was certainly inspired though; a quick glance through his filmography does not show any kind of break out role prior to this one. The heat between the two of them is very present, but more importantly, they are able to convey the more subtle emotions of paranoia and fear of one another with one single glance. Edward G. Robinson, always a great actor, is superb as Keyes. One thing that he has always managed to do, despite (or maybe because of) his less than matin\u00e9e-idol looks, is to play a strong character that still comes across as emotional and human. Even after he eventually figures out that his prot\u00e9g\u00e9e may not be what he thought he was, he still exhibits an almost fatherly concern for Walter.Personally, of all the many films I have seen in the film noir genre, \"Double Indemnity\" is not my favorite; Otto Preminger's \"Laura\", released the same year, is superior, in my opinion. However, the beauty of \"Double Indemnity\" is that it is so thoroughly compelling, so entertaining and so well made that despite its miniscule shortcomings (like Stanwyck's terrible wig) it is a film that, although it is one of several hundred films of its kind, it contains the mainstream appeal to define the genre. If somehow you have not seen this film - maybe you've been under a rock, perhaps you see a black and white film and instead of it creating a Pavlovian response of salivating like it does for me, you run screaming \u0096 whatever the reason, check it out; you're missing a great film. 8/10 --Shelly",

Robinson) to nail would-be fraudsters, rather than close liaison work with the LAPD. As this story progresses, you may not be able to help shouting at the screen, \"where are the fingerprints?!; where is the video-surveillance footage?!; who has cell phone pictures?; where is the fiber evidence?!; why haven't they sent the victim's clothes to \"trace\" to check for DNA evidence?!; why haven't they ordered a psychological autopsy?; why hasn't the \"grieving widow\" been hooked up to a lie detector machine yet?!; etc.; etc.;\"--and then you'll probably realize the picture is black and white because this is all taking place in the 1930s. (Then you might start wondering why EVERYONE wasn't rubbed out for their insurance benefit back then, since this sort of crime looks so much easier to get away with than it would be today.) The bottom line is this movie, as scripted, cast, and directed, is riveting (and probably would be if it were set in 1848).

Does anybody really care about the policy? that it pays out double in certain circumstances? or do we just want to open a window to get some fresh air after it's over?\nRobinson is just about perfect as the investigator with a little man inside him; Stanwyck, despite an ugly wig, delivers her lines with a silky and vicious smoothness that's very effective; Macmurray looks the part--we believe he could be a decent guy at heart who gets lost in a woman's treachery--but delivers his lines too fast, no doubt at Wilder's request.",

            "content": "Film noir is often both mystery and tragedy intertwined as a single genre. It was a one of a kind film experience, one that has remained an undeniable classic for some time. Though elements of film noir have been duplicated from time to time in modern films, such as Sin City and the animated film Batman: Mask of the Phantasm, the original films are simply a band apart. Film noir most specifically represented a time of change in American history. At a time when World War II was awakening people to the horrors men were capable of, and the perfect picture was that of that of the suburban family, film noir was almost a shadow cast by those things. The genre was an exposure of the blackness of the human soul. Housewives and insurance salesman, ordinary people that committed heinous crimes for the hunger of sex and money, not uncommonly both. Not to mention due to the censorship code being in full effect, the writers and filmmakers had to be subtle about their subject, and what it lead to was sharp characterization that didn't use just words. All of these aspects come together to form the mise en scene of Double Indemnity.Consider the cast: Fred MacMurray as Walter Neff was a promising choice from the start. After all, prior to this role MacMurray had done light-hearted comedies, and the same went for after the role. The character of Walter Neff was obviously a lot darker than anything he'd portrayed before in his career, and to audiences it must of seemed very cold and unfamiliar to see him play the part as well as he did. The audience first meets MacMurray's character Neff as a confident and cool salesman, completely in control of his little world, till that is he meets the character of Phyllis Dietrichson, played by the luscious Barbara Stanwyck.Stanwyck is the temptress, a model example of the film noir femme fatale. Of course one of the fundamental key components of the film is the relationship between Stanwyck's character and MacMurray's. Right when they first meet, a low angle shot reveals to him a smooth-skinned angel, eyes glistening and all. We see him on the other hand from a low angle, before anyone even realizing that the cinematography is establishing the nature of their relations. The femme fatale was many things, a seductress, a siren, but to be more exact one might say bluntly a wolf in sheep's clothing.Edward G. Robinson is more of a character actor this time around, playing Robert Keyes. He is not only a friend of Neff, but he is the incorruptible 'detective' of the film. Even though he's just a claims man, it is made evidently clear he's somewhat of a protagonist. I use the word somewhat because throughout the film he inadvertently puts heat on MacMurray, saying \"A claims man is a surgeon. That desk is an operating table, and the pencils are scalpels and bone chisels\". It is subtly symbolized that the occupation is a breeding ground of human treachery, for when Keyes refers to the claims themselves that he receives every day, he remarks \"they're packed with drama; with twisted hopes and crooked dreams.\" Another powerful film noir component is the nature of the story. While ach one obviously varies, at the root of all film noir is the temptation of money and so-called love, full of people who will literally kill for those things. The nature of the screenplay captures the dark side of the human nature perfectly. Notice how Barbara Stanwyck creates the mood of vulnerability, using it to deceive Walter. He at first seems to be weary, but he shot of their first kiss already sets up his inability to resist. The low key lighting helps to enhance this dark mood. Foolish Walter eventually does take the vile deed upon himself to orchestrate, and composer Mikl\u00f3s R\u00f3zsa adds a dark cue as he takes on the sinful task.The consistent hard lightning returns as Neff walks down the street, and tells the audience \"It was the walk of a dead man.\" The film opens up with his character confessing, so already it is known who has committed the crime, and yet as the climax draws closer more and more of the plan begins to fall thru, and one can feel a sense of disaster ahead.A combination of hard and low-key lightning adds greatly to the film, all of it used to heighten the character's emotions. Coupled with MacMurray's cynical narration, the effect is quite devastating. Remember the brightly lit outdoors of the peaceful suburb neighborhood in the opening scenes, where we even see innocent children running and playing. Once Walter enters the house, however, he finds himself in a gloomy otherworld, one from which he will not be able to escape. The ever present Venetians blinds cast prison bars on Walter in many scenes. This fusion of lightning and subtle symmetry set up the doomed aura surrounding Walter.Note the tight framing at first with the two 'lovers', but by half-way thru the film much looser framing is used as the two's trust diminishes with every exposed lie. It is in their final moments together the spacing becomes tighter for one last moment of intimacy. The final scene between the two is both a landmark for its music, or lack there of, and its visuals. There in that near blackness we see the glimmer of a gun. When the music stops as the curtains are shut, the only source of light in the room now gone, we hear the crack of the first gun shot.Double Indemnity is a classic by all means, the genesis of film noir.",

            "content": "Double Indemnity is the crown jewel of the entire film noir cycle, its black sapphire.  The project started with the fervid plotting and prose of James M. Cain's shocker (one of his three novels, including Mildred Pierce and The Postman Always Rings Twice, which supplied material for three key films of the 1940s).  Director Billy Wilder and the formidable Raymond Chandler (taking a well-remunerated break from his Philip Marlowe books) labored unhappily only to give birth to a hard and glittering masterpiece of a screenplay. Wilder then filmed it with breathtaking panache.  The story's brew of adultery, murder and duplicity was a slap in the face to wartime audiences, content with supping upon optimistic, sentimental cinematic fare. Barbara Stanwyck abandoned women's weepers and screwball romps to don an anklet and create Phyllis Dietrichson, the coldest and deadliest of the cycle's femmes fatales;  she delivers an unforgettable, sensational performance, never surpassed even by her later outings as Martha Ivers, Thelma Jordon and Mae Doyle D'Amato (in Clash by Night).  As intrepid insurance investigator Barton Keyes, Edward G. Robinson is at his wry and crafty best, serving to puncture the unrelievedly heavy and suffocating textures of the film.  The surprise is amiable, dull Fred MacMurray who is just perfect as the way-out-of-his-depth bachelor whose downfall is thinking with his zipper.  Double Indemnity is one film noir whose vision is not compromised by parsimonious budgets, a recycled and warmed-over script, sub-par casting or by-the-numbers direction; for once, everything works right, and the upshot is one of the greatest, if darkest, movies ever made in America.",

Now this is a film that is based on insurance and how an insurance clause of \"Double Indemnity\" can be used for getting someone killed. Billy Wilder unveils his genius again by keeping it believable and yet so emphatically thrilling till the last minute. We know well in the beginning that it's about murder. 20 minutes in the film, we also know that is the murder of a man, whom the wife is cheating on. Now, this turns on into somewhat unexpected as the plan goes a bit berserk with the protagonist unable to understand the woman's character. He thought both are in for it, but actually he is being used by the woman. So someone is killed and someone has to be the culprit, now who is it and how is it all done. It's all point blank and detailed to the extent of planning a murder in a very detailed manner, until its blown up. How did Billy Wilder make all of this and from a story of James Cain is just extremely poignant. It's so very relevant even today, that so many people are conspiring against each other, there are suicides and murders more than ever before and all for money, damn.Now, coming to movie it's great in terms of characters, screenplay and the lighting and production design. Acting is top notch as is always in most of Billy Wilder's movies. And above all, we have the captain Billy who is responsible for the way this film was made and he must be applauded in every sense. Just look at that scene in the beginning where Neff interprets the intentions of Phyliis is where you understand that everything is right in this film. From lighting to dialogues, all of them have added in creating the atmosphere that is for sure thrilling and suspense.This is noir film and has an open ending with us leaving to think what could have happened to Walter Neff. It's 4/5 for a film that's a must see. Just love Billy Wilder more and more as I keep getting back to his films.",

After watching it again last week I'd have to agree with many reviewers that the film is still good but is now badly dated, notwithstanding the revolutionary villain/hero narrator technique, as many other noir films of that decade are, while others (Maltese Falcon,Out of the Past, Big Sleep, Mildred Pierce, Lady from Shanghai, The Killers, just to name a few) have not faded as bad. Wilder's 1945 \"The Lost Weekend\" in particular is as harrowing and relevant today as it was in 1945, and deservedly won the Oscar for Best Picture. Stanwyck, who I found very sexy in other movies (Ball of Fire, e.g) doesn't do a thing for me in this film, not the least because of the ridiculous blonde wig or whatever she had on her head. The scenes in the supermarket and in the back of the train where MacMurray never faces the stranger who offers to get a pack of cigarettes, are very clumsily done. The side stories of the daughter and her boyfriend also don't help. The ending, however, is still very effective today,as are many scenes, most of them involving Edward G. Robinson, who's excellent. Also, the music by Miklos Rosza, who would score many of Wilder's films, is memorable.",

            "content": "Double Indemnity, first showed to me a few years back in a film class (naturally), struck me in certain ways, and then the more I thought about it afterward even more-so. I watched it again very soon after, and of course agreed with the teacher that it was the \"textbook film-noir\", practically defining the 'average Joe' male lead, the 'femme fatale, and the usages of very specific lighting in almost all of the key night scenes (outdoor and in). But through a lot of the hype surrounding the picture, it would be one thing if it had all of these qualities and then ended up being not too interesting. As it turns out not only is it that, it's also a great hoot of a story, with tongue at times placed so much in cheek the real seriousness and grit of the picture gets lost in the attitude. I can imagine Billy Wilder, after his many strained writing sessions with the master Raymond Chandler, reading the script and wondering 'should a movie from the point of view of the criminals pulling multiple crimes be this amusing'? At the time, perhaps, it was nothing but hard-to-the-bone thrilling stuff, with Fred MacMurray's tough, though of course clever, dialog, and the sultry Barbara Stanwyck (and lest not forget Edward G. Robinson, who's presence in the film is enough to garner it attention right away). But with time maybe the film has even grown more appealing in a way; I know that, for example, the narration in some parts was such a direct influence for the Naked Gun movies that it almost becomes funny in and of itself. But all through this its just a solid story, from Cain's novel, pumped to cinematic life and given enough vigor to last long enough to be written about as one of the all-time classics of cinema in general, not just American. It also contains the one time a man says to another man \"I love you, too\" and it's so humorous and keenly cool that its almost endearing.",

The plot is about an insurance salesman (Fred Mac Murray) who got lured (which was quite easy due to his greed) into insurance fraud. The story was simple he taught, all he had to do was kill the lady he so desires husband and make it look like an accident, while tricking him to sign an accident insurance policy where everything goes to his lady friend, so he will get the girl and with her comes the money. The movie is best put using the word nice, and a classic as it has come to be. Double Indemnity is beautiful and captivating, based on a 1943 novel of the same name by James M. Cain. This movie was the height of film noir in the 40s spring out many copycat B movies from other producers.The screenplay is penned down by Billy Wilder, who also directed the movie, and from the way the movie drove you just have to appreciate the work of the screen writer, I while watching I was so eager to know if they will get away with it or not. Fred MacMurray narrated and starred in the movie, although the movie was a huge critical success and was nominated for seven Academy Awards but did not win any. Billy Wilder's writing and directing of this movie is a masterpiece worth treasuring and a work of art worth owning.The movie and the book's idea is based on the Double indemnity clause provided in life insurance or accident policy whereby the insurance company agrees to pay the stated multiple (double) of the face amount in the contract in the case of death caused by accidental means.The movie was a box office success making over 5 times its production cost, and the cinematography used \"venetian blind\" lighting which became popular in later film noirs. Double Indemnity was well received by the American Film Institute, in AFI's 100 Years\u0085100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition) it was rated 29th; it also got other American Film Institute recognitions. This movie is wonderful, so if you have not seen or heard about the movie now you have so go see it.www.lagsreviews.com",

            "content": "\"I show this movie in a class so I have watched it a LOT, which may account for my focus on details. To start, it is worth noting that this is a great movie. The three leads are amazing; Billy Wilder's direction is moody and clear, and is always telling the story implicitly, without relying on dialog or action (check out how Phyllis sits in a chair when she first meets Walter); and Raymond Chandlers dialog is practically poetry. All of this adds up to what may be the most accessible example of Film Noir, although that is not to suggest that this is lacking any Film Noir cred - this is the real deal.For me, there is an interesting dynamic at the center of the classic Film Noir plot. These plots are often told in flashback, by a weak male protagonist who is manipulated by a femme fatale. The connoisseurs tell us that he is a victim of a temptress or of fate, or both. What they seem to ignore is the potential for an unreliable narrator. Why should we believe these woe-is-me tales? Couldn't the protagonist simply be in denial?Here, the plot is supposedly a dark love triangle: the charmless Walter, the lewd Phyllis, and her cruel husband, who needs to be murdered. If you see this, you're looking at the wrong triangle. It's not even clear that Walter remembers Phyllis' name, let only being so smitten with her that he'd murder her husband. This is the story of Walter using Phyllis to impress the only person he loves, Barton Keyes, with a perfect, undetectable murder. This is why Walter isn't making for the border as the movie begins. He's returning to Keyes' office to confess and to take credit for his gift.\"",

            "content": "I cannot say enough good things about this film, it is perfect as far as movies go, it stands up perfectly after more than 60 years! This was the film that convinced me that older or \"classic\" films were not only watchable, but most of the best movies ever made were made decades ago. I remember watching this film on TV for the first time, years ago, and I could not stop watching it. It made no sense to me, the film was old, black and white, and they talked funny, yet I sat there stunned by it's brilliance. Looking back on it now, it makes sense that I enjoyed it so much (and still do) the story and acting are great, the direction and dialogue, although dated is excellent. The direction of the masterful Billy Wilder truly makes this film explode with taut, sexy, and dangerous energy. Fred MacMurray is surprisingly excellent as the insurance salesman, Walter Neff. He makes a house call to one of his customers, only to find him not at home. However what he does find is the dangerous and sexy Phyllis Dietrichson, played by Barbara Stanwyck. They fall for one another and hatch a plot that involves murder and insurance fraud. However when all is not as it seems Walter wants out, he suspects he may be just another sucker that is being used by the temptress Mrs. Dietrichson. However as Walter finds out, and as his friend and enemy Barton Keyes,(Edward G. Robinson) tells him, \"committing murder is not like taking a trolley ride together where they can get off at different stops. They're stuck with each other and they've got to ride all the way to the end of the line and it's a one-way trip and the last stop is the cemetery.\" Walter tries to get off of that trolley but soon realizes that Keyes warning was prophetic.There are many suspenseful twists and turns that I will not divulge here, cause I want everyone who watches this film for the first time, to enjoy it as I did. However I will say that this is an excellent film, the very definition of film-noir. Wilder tells an amazing story in a very suspenseful manner, and the script and acting are very intelligent. This film crackles along with suspense, intrigue and romance. And it is a perfect time capsule of the period in which film-noir was born and achieved it's great success.

But everything goes wrong.Next to \"Out of the Past\" this is one of the best film noirs ever. The script is smart, the dialogue sharp, it moves quickly and is beautifully directed by Billy Wilder. However it's the acting that puts this over. MacMurray (who's mostly known for his wholesome Disney films) is just great as Neff. Stanwyck is perfect as the femme fatale. You can see her covering up the evil in herself. Edward G. Robinson plays Neff's boss Barton Keyes. He has the best dialogue and presents it in a very fast, hard-hitting way. Basically there's nothing wrong with this film except for one minor detail. MacMurray is supposed to be single but he's always wearing a wedding band!

            "content": "While a bewigged Barbara Stanwyck makes an unforgettable femme fatale in director Billy Wilder's hardboiled murder/mystery \"Double Indemnity,\" Fred MacMurray making an equally persuasive patsy. A cigar-smoking Edward G. Robinson of \"Little Caesar\" is just as effective when they aren't on screen as the hero's superior of sorts. Robinson qualifies as the chief adversity because our hero and heroine are the conspirators in the murder case. Legendary whodunit novelist Raymond Chandler of Philip Marlowe fame adapted James Cain's gritty account about a murder most foul. The dialogue is juicy stuff with a pervasive sense of irony. Basically, a well-heeled insurance agent, Pacific Risk Insurance Agent Walter Neff (Fred MacMurray of \"The Apartment\"), and the glamorous young wife of a recent widower plot the death of her husband. Phyllis Dietrichson wants to do away with her husband because he cries foul each time she drops his money on her wardrobe. The indignant husband cannot understand why a woman in California would need a hat. Phyllis confides her lack of marital bliss in Walter during one of his visits at the Dietrichson residence and utters nothing positive about her husband and his daughter from his previous marriage. Matters get out of hand when Walter sells Phyllis a double indemnity policy on her husband without his knowledge. Walter fools him into signing what is a copy of his auto policy. The sizzling romance between the two premeditated killers and Stanwyck's rampant sexuality make \"Double Indemnity\" a memorable movie. Our misguided hero knows that he wants this devious dame from the moment he spots her anklet as she trots down the stairs. The only thing contrived about this outstanding epic is the way that Walter's apartment door opens out into the corridor instead of vice-versa. The door opening the wrong way is key to a scene when Phyllis tries to visit Walter after they have murdered her husband. Barton Keyes (Edward G. Robinson) makes an unexpected appearance at Walter's apartment after Phyllis has told Walter that she is sneaking over to see him. Despite its flashback conceit with Walter Neff recording his murderous exploits on Keyes' Dictaphone, \"Double Indemnity\" is a slick, calculated thriller. Incredibly, nobody noticed until post-production that MacMurray was still wearing his wedding band. The character of Walter Neff is a single man who lives alone by himself. Wilder stages the death of the husband while the killers are transporting the husband to the train depot. Neff has concealed himself behind the front seat and waits patiently for the moment to throttle Mr. Dietrichson. When he kills the husband, Wilder keeps the camera aimed on the impassive Phyllis. \"Double Indemnity\" has several chilling moments. People turn up at the worst time imaginable when the killers show up at the train depot. Wilder plays things pretty seriously except for some of the smart aleck dialogue and a scene in the insurance owner's office when he makes a buffoon out of himself. Predictably, things unravel for everybody at the end. Cain was a popular crime novelist when \"Double Indemnity\" came out. He wrote what later became the Joan Crawford masterpiece \"Mildred Pierce.\" He also penned the steamy, sordid novel \"The Postman Always Rings Twice.\" All three are exceptional films, and \"The Postman Always Rings Twice\" is the best. Nevertheless, if you haven't seen \"Double Indemnity, you've missed a classic.",

            "content": "Film-noir went through its greatest blossoms in the late 1940's but already during the years of World War II it crystallized to its final dynamic form -- and this finest form of film-noir is represented by Billy Wilder's Double Indemnity (1944). In the film, the dark variant found its true form: people were dissatisfied and unheroic. Double Indemnity, and just almost every noir after it, was characterized by sadistic and brutal cultural behavior or; the complete lack of behavior. In this interpretation a clear difference was made to more romantic noirs, such as Howard Hawks' The Big Sleep (1946). The genre is both unlimited and connected; it is hard to draw the line between dark films and films that are \"film-noir\" but crime is a thing that unites them all -- it is a necessity of some kind -- it is a prism through which we can observe life as it is, ahead of all the illusions.Double Indemnity starts with a wounded insurance salesman Walter Neff (Fred MacMurray) walking up to his partner Barton Keys' (Edward G. Robinson) office. He has got a confession to make: we enter a flashback which equals most of the film. He was seduced by a beautiful woman into cheating his insurance company in order to get a double indemnity for the woman's husband's death. But soon their love turned into hatred. Film-noir can mean an attitude, series of films, sub-genre or a mode, and just like other genres -- western and gangster-film for instance -- it uses the same milieus over and over again: night clubs, hotel rooms, apartments, police stations, offices, docks, run-down and luxury restaurants, rural houses that are about to collapse, boxing rings and railway stations. In a typical film-noir story there is a desperate man who gets seduced by a dangerous woman. But in Double Indemnity there is also another reason for the protagonist's action: the temptation to try one's luck, to try if you could succeed in a perfect crime which is probably the reason why Alfred Hitchcock loved the film so much.The directors who created film-noir came from Europe. In M (1931) Fritz Lang developed the atmosphere for film-noir with its strong contrasts and expressionistic imagery. Since the people who created the genre were from Europe, the influences obviously came from their colony: French pessimism (Duvivier), German expressionism and European surrealism. To this colorful group the director of Double Indemnity Billy Wilder also belongs to. He came to Hollywood from Austria-Hungary also in the 1930's. These filmmakers were creating a world where the latitude of man was limited; the chance of individual freedom was impossible and unreachable. The best cinematographers achieved to combine expressionism with realism, in this limited milieu, to light actual sites by aesthetic styling.Fatality, guile and cheating were always part of the thematics of film-noir and in Double Indemnity nothing is what it first appears to be and each first impression bluffs: Keys' ex-girlfriend who he was going to marry turned out to be manic depressive and Phyllis first seemed to be truly worried for her husband. Then Phyllis and Walter cheated Mr. Dietrichson into signing the life insurance but Phyllis was actually cheating Walter all along. Their love had now turned into hatred. After the picture started to get clearer for Walter, he decided to double-cross Phyllis but what he didn't guess was that Phyllis knew that he knew that she was a double-crosser. They both tried to cheat each other but neither succeed in it. The whole world double-crosses and acts.The aesthetics of film-noir is often tied around big cities like New York and Los Angeles, and its visual world has its own icons too: dark and narrow alleys, rainy streets, wet and moist surfaces, images of water, mirrors, shiny steel, the dim lighting of the milieus. And through visual aesthetics and first-person narrative Double Indemnity reached poetry of summer nights: the Californian hills and mountains, strolling roads, old chateaus, dusty and rainy suburban blocks.The \"poetic-like\" first-person narrative and flashbacks are also a big part of film-noir. Especially after Double Indemnity which, as said, was the culmination of the genre's dynamic form. Through Walter's monologue, his confession, the story gets a deterministic twist: like it was all fate, and everything we observe are constantly related to Walter's subjective truth. For its time the story is set in the year 1938 -- just like the original novel by James M. Cain -- loose from the year 1944 and WWII, to the age of recession; to its psychology and financial awareness. It gives an inner explanation why Walter is desperate and does what he does.The confessions of a murderer waiting for his death, relay a picture of life as lead by fate or chance to judgment. Only when Walter has to face death he is ready to confess, and sees life as it is -- just like Camus' Mersault. As mentioned, through this the film gets a deterministic twist, but the ending also indicates to Hollywood's censorship: crime must always have its punishment. But this juvenile message is relayed to us ironically: the violators of law and morality have to redeem their sins, in the double-crossing world.Billy Wilder always liked to criticize just about everything, from communism to capitalism, and from militarism to pacifism. Just like Some Like It Hot (1958) so does Double Indemnity brush the subject of the American dream. But unlike in Some Like It Hot, it's not about the different versions of the dream and the mad profusion of it but about its true naivety. In Double Indemnity the American dream is seen as a juvenile way to get satisfaction, at any price. If the film is for its themes purely about Americanism, guile, existence, anxiety and the double-crossing world, its thesis is this: when fear enters the game, love suddenly turns into hatred.",

This movie is a crystallization of silver screen perfection, a rare event where every little thing aligns to bestow the lucky viewers with what can only be described as breathtaking art.The performances in this movie are superb. In a script riddled with hardboiled dialog and outlandish implausibilities, everyone hits the right note, and makes the endeavor compelling. Stanwyck is at her most seductive and powerful, and Edward G. Robinson gives the movie the perfect moral ground.But the best performance has to be given to Fred MacMurray who turns the clich\u00e9d role of a man seduced by a woman into something more than the sleaze bag he should be. He becomes a character you're invested in, a man who is shaken from his complacent life and thoroughly destroyed by the demons he creates. And through this all, through murder in its many incarnations, you still can't help feel for the man. The character of Walter Neff, in so many words, takes on a life of its own thanks to MacMurray, and keeps the audience compelled no matter what sins he commits. The tics and libido exuded add to his charm and make him deservedly one of the most iconic characters of all time.A lot of this credit must be given to Billy Wilder, my personal favorite director and a man whose films can all be completely different but possess enough tics to be instantly recognizable. The beauty of his shots and the set up of the script blend perfectly, creating a universe that is tangible and complex.If you have not seen this movie, please do.",

The third film in Hollywood by Billy Wilder that he co-wrote with Raymond Chandler who brought the hard boiled dialogue to this thriller. This film made Wilder's name.Fred MacMurray is the insurance salesman who falls for the femme fatale with the anklet, Barbara Stanwyck. Fatally wounded he tells his tale in flashback, confessing to a Dictaphone so the company's investigator, Edward G Robinson will know that the guy across the desk was the murderer.Stanwyck was the nurse who might have bumped off the first wife and then married widower, an oil tycoon. Now bored or just wants to be on her own with the wealth, she wants to get rid off the husband. MacMurray is smitten enough to help her do the deed. The proceeds of the accidental death insurance policy she has just taken out is I guess just a bonus. Once the husband is dead he realises that he is a dead man walking.This is a cleverly constructed thriller. It really is a relationship between MacMurray, Robinson and Stanwyck. At the end it is Robinson he lets down.MacMurray is the every-man, the insurance salesman good at his job but bored and wants to runaway with a hot woman. Stanwyck is the cold, icy one. You know she is using MacMurray, he is just a sap to her. The film belongs to Edward G Robinson, the bloodhound who knows all the tricks in the books and he has volumes of them on his shelving.",

Is this a good example? Hell yeah.The concept is deliciously simple. Walter Neff (Fred MacMurray) is persuaded into helping the femme fatale Phyllis Dietrichson (Barbara Stanwyck), kill off her husband in order to claim the insurance policy she takes out for him. The title of the movie stems from the clause they can double their claim, if Mr. Dietrichson dies in a particular manner. The plot then unfolds as they plan the murder, and the fallout that will - being film-noir - result. There's a lot of mention of the great chemistry between the two leads - Walter and Phyllis - and that's certainly true. Nice little performances for both of them (which got Barbara nominated for an Oscar). And the others - particular Keyes (Edward G. Robinson) as the man set out to investigate Phyllis' unusual insurance claim - are equally good. All round great cast helps add a lot to the movie.It's the script tho' that really bangs home the movie's classic status. It's very sharp - some of Keyes lines for example are hilarious black comedy. The execution of the plan is meticulous and smart - the sort of attention to detail we see in this movie is so rarely exhibited in recent times. There's fine direction all the way that help create the exact mood of the moment - whether its the worry of Neff, his isolation, or Phyllis' conniving chatter. It's no wonder that it got nominated for a bunch of Oscars, including Best Picture and, since it was a deserving winner in its year, it's no wonder the Academy didn't give it the prize....A sharp and engaging drama, with fine performances throughout, I can't but recommend \"Double Indemnity\". It mightn't be for all of the MTV-generation, who want quick visuals, but for anyone with an ability to immerse themselves into the movie, this should be seen. 8.3/10.",

            "content": "In order to begin a story with the ending and still maintain suspense throughout the movie a film-maker needs to be quite sure of his skills to capture the attention of his audience. Director/writer Billy Wilder, assisted by established novelist Raymond Chandler with the screenplay, knows how to do it. He presents his film noir entirely in flashbacks, narrated in atmospheric voice-overs leading eventually to what we've already seen in the introduction. And despite the fact that we know where it's all heading we're still glued to our seats. New at the time and often copied ever since, but rarely done that well.Central point is the mutual plan of an insurance rep and the wife of a rich husband to commit the perfect crime and literally get away with murder. Said salesman Walter Neff (Fred McMurray) not only commits the crime, but is also supposed to investigate it along with insurance inspector and friend Barton Keyes (Edward G. Robinson). Reluctantly but inevitably he stumbles into his own demise, which he is unfortunate to experience from either side of the law. What makes this dark existential dilemma so exciting is not so much what happens but how it is presented to the viewer and how the components fit together to form a supreme whole. Thanks primarily to an amazing script and aided by Wilder's flawless direction that leaves nothing to desire for a film noir devotee the film indeed lives up to the expectations of its promise and has since become an invaluable reference. Aside from McMurray and the terrific Robinson there's also Barbara Stanwyck playing the ensnaring femme fatale, and all of them deliver sharp dialog. Add to that high-contrast black and white cinematography, effective lighting, multiple Oscars winner Mikl\u00f3s R\u00f3zsa's score - all the best ingredients for a touchstone of film noir experience, complete with fatality drive.

The only flaw I personally see in this film is the fact that Neff starts to fall for the immature stepdaughter, who is so daffy she already has a boyfriend that treats her like dirt. Phyllis's husband is also not the kind of guy that garners your compassion, even when they kill him. Although they don't show how Neff actually kills the husband from the backseat, or talk about it, it seem plausible that Neff broke his neck. After all, a knife wound would rule out the possibility of an accident, and there was no gun shot. I grew up in Glendale, Ca. and several scenes in this film were shot in the the same town in the 40's. Not everything has changed all that much geographically. I love old movies that show LA as it was. The obvious father/son relationship between Neff and Edward G. Robinson makes it so much more exciting. It's amazing that Robinson's character, who is so quick to feel the \"little man\" in his stomach when anything is wrong, would fail to notice the character flaws in Neff, even before the murder. I guess Phyllis just brought out the underlying dormant evil that was always in Neff. But her evil was never dormant, up until the moment when Neff has a gun at her chest and she tells him she couldn't pull the trigger on her own gun again to finish him off. Too late now, \"lady\"...",

Walter Neff is so tortured by his secrets and unraveling deception that the confession he gives feels almost like therapy.The depiction of two people involved in something illicit is one of the best I have seen. It is very much from the one perspective, but it's very plausible how the relationship develops through lust, infatuation, exhilaration, anxiety, paranoia and repulsion. There could just as well be no murder and the couple be simply involved in an affair and the arc of their relationship would be just as effective. Watching the movie I felt up to my neck in it just as much as Neff.Most of the dialogue is very sharp and darkly humorous. The initial banter between Neff and Mrs Dietrichson is some of the best I've heard, whilst pretty much everything that comes from Keyes is solid gold.Moments of suspense are plentiful and what makes it all the more impressive is that I was so immersed in some moments I forgot I was seeing part of a retrospect narrative.If you appreciate striking, high contrast, shadowy, suggestive, cinematography that tells a visual story, this has plenty. There is one fantastic shot where Mrs Dietrichson sits in deep focus in the background, framed between her husband and lover, as the two men agree an insurance contract. This and many others present wonderfully memorable imagery throughout the film. Never has the striking of a match and lighting of a cigarette been so poignant.Most performances are excellent, with Fred McMurray a solid lead who I believed had both the strength and weaknesses his character displayed. Barbara Stanwyck is phenomenally convincing as a sultry femme fatale, fully capable of winding a man round her little finger with the merest of facial expressions combined with a subtle reveal of an anklet. Edward G Robinson electrifies every scene with his energy, charisma and star presence. Some of the other performances are not as enjoyable, but that's only a minor flaw in an almost perfect picture.For me it's a 9.5/10 but I like to round upwards.",

Hell, the film itself hardly cares about them! We learn the score from the get-go, when Walter recites his confession into a Dictaphone: \"I killed him for money and for a woman. I didn't get the money, and I didn't get the woman.\" So much for last-act revelations! But that's fine: any loss of suspense is more than compensated for by the thrills we encounter on the twisting road to his demise.The film then goes into a flashback. When Walter turns up at the Dietrichson home to discuss the renewal on Mr. Dietrichson's auto insurance, he takes an immediate shine to the coquettish, anklet-wearing Phyllis. The chillingly amoral Phyllis, motivated by little more than boredom, makes no secret about her loveless marriage to an older man, and how much she'd like to see her husband get insured heavily - and then die. Walter, having fallen in love hook, line, and sinker, tells Phyllis that that if the husband has an accidental-death insurance policy with a double-indemnity clause, Phyllis (and, by extension, Walter) stands to get some serious coin and since he knows the business inside and out, he can stage a foolproof murder. All seems to be going according to plan, until the salesman's shrewd boss Barton Keyes (Edward G. Robinson, in a wonderful rat-a-tat performance) begins to smell a scam. As the screws tighten on Walter, he starts to realize just how devious Phyllis can be and over the next hour and a half, we are irresistibly drawn into the drama that ensnares them all.Film noir is the most intoxicating of Hollywood cocktails, and none is more potent than Double Indemnity. Billy Wilder breaks the rules of filmmaking with breathtaking confidence and is all the more satisfying for it. It has all the hallmarks of film noir \u2013 it's a moody, pessimistic crime story with strong overtones of spiritual bankruptcy and moral cynicism. Like the best of film noir, it sizzles with crackling, sardonic dialogue (watching Neff and Phyllis interact belies the twisted beauty of the film), veiled lust, overtones of impending doom and a seductively devious femme fatale. And the brooding look of the film is magnificent \u2013 the City of Angels, haunted throughout by human weakness and greed, somehow appearing dark even when the sun's shining.Double Indemnity is a splendidly chilling noir about murder, immorality, lust, and greed - both a starkly realistic and a carefully stylized masterpiece of murder!",

There is one thing about t.v. that sometimes makes me a little sad -- that it diminishes the reputation of serious actors that (usually later in their careers) turn to television. That can certainly be said for Fred MacMurray, who could do a great job in films as diverse as \"The Egg And I\", \"The Miracle Of The Bells\", \"The Caine Mutiny\", and this film. Comedy, melodrama, war, and film noir -- all done quite nicely. Because of \"My 3 Sons\", MacMurray's reputation suffered, and many have forgotten that at one point he was one of the highest paid and most popular actors on the wide screen.This is an excellent film for a couple of reasons. If you don't know the plot in advance, you still know the murdering couple is going to trip up somehow, and the trick is guessing how. And this film does keep you guessing for quite a long while...and that's the suspense of the film. MacMurray, as I indicated, is excellent here, as is Barbara Stanwyck...and this was quite a departure for her...cheap blonde and all. But a sometimes unsung hero of the film is Edward G. Robinson, whose role really is critical to the picture. Taking third billing, this was a step down for him, but one in which he earned significant praise.It's difficult to find much to criticize here. Of course, with today's crime detection, this plot really wouldn't work. But it's nice to savor a very fine crime film of yesteryear. Highly recommended.",

But as good as Huston's film was, DOUBLE INDEMNITY is noir honed and fine tuned to its ultimate expression: hard-boiled, sexual but cold, and usually featuring a cast in which it is hard to tell the scoundrels from the good guys.The story, taken from a novel by James M Cain, is typical noir fare. Walter Neff (Fred MacMurray), an insurance salesman, is sent to call one day on a man named Dietrichson regarding renewal of his car insurance. At the house, Walter also meets Dietrichson's wife Phyllis (Barbara Stanwyck), a crudely made up bottle blond sporting a too-tight skirt and sweater and an anklet to draw attention to her legs.Despite the fact that Phyllis practically has the word \"SLUT\" tattooed on her forehead (or perhaps because of it), Walter falls for the dame, and she cons him into a scheme to sell her husband a life insurance policy, and then murder him, making it look like an accident to double the payoff (hence the title).They carry out their plan practically under the nose of Walter's best friend, insurance analyst Barton Keyes (Edward G Robinson), a man who smokes cheap cigars but never seems to have the matches to light them. Robinson is wonderful in a rare departure from his gangster persona; a good deal of what comes out of Keyes's mouth can be considered comic relief, but it isn't long before it begins to dawn on Walter that his best friend will turn out to be his nemesis.Wilder was a real actors' director. Fred MacMurray, a modestly attractive man whose acting abilities were seldom really stretched, is not only given an actor's field day in this role, but Wilder actually makes him a sex symbol. No mean feat for the actor whose most memorable role would be the father on TV's \"My Three Sons\" some two decades later.As for Stanwyck, all I can say is WOW! Far be it from me to take away Ingrid Bergman's Oscar for GASLIGHT, but as good as Bergman was, Stanwyck is sensational here. Stanwyck was always one of the most versatile actors of her day, and she could literally play anything, but I've always enjoyed her when she plays the bitch. And Phyllis Dietrichson is as cold-hearted and mercenary a bitch as you can ask for. Not even Bette Davis's amoral murderess Leslie Crosbie in THE LETTER packs quite the wallop that Stanwyck does here.The \"love story\" between Walter and Phyllis is basically about sex and money; true to the noir form, it is a cold sexuality, though the script by Wilder and Raymond Chandler is about as hot and heavy as any movie could get during the years of the Production Code; in fact the sexual tension between Stanwyck and MacMurray is so thick that after the film ends you might feel the need for a cigarette and a shower.This is one brilliant film: tersely written, sensationally acted by the entire cast, and directed to cinematic perfection by one of the best auteurs in the business.This is one of those movies they mean when they say \"They don't make movies like that anymore.\" And more's the pity. It is sensational, exciting, sexy, and you will definitely want to see it more than once.",

It was directed by Michael Curtiz of \"Casablanca\" fame.I've watched \"King Creole\" many times over the years and count it among my favorite films, it's certainly my favorite Elvis movie and as I understand it, it was also Elvis' favorite film of all the ones he made. I can't watch a film noir without giving credit to the movie which first interested me in the genre to begin with, \"King Creole\".Because I like \"King Creole\" so much, I decided I'd like to see some other films in the same noir genre, so after I discovered \"Double Indemnity\" was available instant stream on Netflix, I thought I'd give it a go and I'm glad I did! I can clearly understand why so many people consider this movie a classic. It is! Don't let the fact the film was made in 1944 fool you. It's not \"too old\" to watch...not by a long shot. In fact, I found the movie more suspenseful and entertaining than just about everything that's being released nowadays.The actors turn in great performances, particularly Fred MacMurray and Barbara Stanwyck. The story is great, but how it's told is even better...in true to form noir styling. I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed this movie and if you give it a chance, I think you'll like it, too! Like I said before, don't let the age of the movie fool you...It still packs plenty of punch! I hold no reservations in recommending this movie. Check it out, I think you'll be glad you did!",

I've seen this movie countless times.The film begins from the end, and takes you through the journey of how they got there. A rather unique way considering other movies of the 1940s, then again, film noir was itself a brand new mode of film making.Barbara Stanwyck was the perfect blend of beauty and danger that made her the perfect femme fa-tale. Who can forget her entrance, posed a top the stairway, clothed in only a towel. As Walter Neff is hooked by her, you are as well, and you are along for the trolley ride, as Edward G. Robinson points out.The way The Neff character plans his alibi is beyond genius, and it also shows that this rather mild mannered looking man himself has a dark side. The plan is perfect, even to the viewer. Though you know how it's all going to turn out, you still expect them both to get away with murder. You even applaud Neff's protection of the young daughter, who's now lost both her mother and father. While Neff's explanation is that he is seeing if she'll tell about her mothers action the night before her father's death, by the end, you see that his act of kindness towards the young girl was genuine.Enter Edward G. Robinson, who became my all time favorite actor after I saw this. Robinson, himself many times the ruthless film villain, is on the other side now. He's hunting down the killers as he tries to save the insurance company from paying the double indemnity clause. Robinson talks about his \"little man\" likes he's an actual person, and who believe Robinson when he talks about him.The climax is exciting without being action packed. It presents the last bit of drama, as a one man is forced to turn his best friend over for the crimes he's done. That is the hidden drama in this tale.The movie is one of the best, bar none, and is one of the quiet films never mentioned in the same breath as CasleBlanca, Maltese Falcon, or Pride of the Yankees. Maybe it should be.",

            "content": "An early Billy Wilder film where a jaded insurance salesman, Walter Neff (Fred MacMurray), ends up becoming smitten with Phyllis Dietrichson (Barbara Stanwyck), a trophy wife to an oil businessman. Together they start to plan the murder of her husband in order to collect a sizable sum from the insurance they railroad him into signing. The only real threat to their plan being Neff's immediate supervisor, claims adjuster Barton Keyes (Edward G. Robinson).A very shocking movie for its time. In fact various people had been trying to make this movie for years, but the early 20th century censorship would not allow two criminals as the main characters. By today's standards the movie is of course relatively tame, but even today it would be odd to see the two leads planning the coldblooded murder of an innocent man. At the very least the victim would be shown to be a total monster in order for the murderers to earn our sympathy.The film has not aged with total dignity. The romance between Walter and Phyllis starts out of nowhere, the locations don't vary much and can feel a bit stiff, the dialogues feel rehearsed, even during their most heated moments, and the plot is relatively straightforward. Then again, at least for me, that's part of the charm.And the film does have some really good things in it as well. I like the framing story and the acting is superb all across the board. I especially liked Robinson's Barton Keyes. What a character, what a performance. Robinson is most well-known for his tough gangster characters during the golden age of Hollywood and some of that has slipped in here as well.One of the very first film noir films with its characters archetypes, crime-filled plot and its heavy shadows, both literal and figurative. A great watch for all fans of the genre.",

The plot is excellent and logical from start to finish: An insurance agent (Fred MacMurray in one of his best roles) teams up with a femme fatal (played by Barbara Stanwyck) to murder her husband and cash in on the insurance premium. The plan looks flawless but of course there is one snag that the two have overlooked and that the agent's older colleague (Edward G. Robinson) notices - with fatal results. All the characters are multi-layered and interesting. MacMurray plays the hard-boiled man of action who thinks of everything, but is in fact a smarmy weakling; Barbara Stanwyck initially seems to be no more than an unloved wife - as lonesome as she is lovely - but over time turns out to be as cold-blooded as she is ruthless. Robinson is a kind of father figure for McMurray. It is evident that McMurray admires his acumen as an insurance man with a nose for attempts to commit fraud, and it seems likely he develops the murder plan with the idea in the back of his mind to impress his older colleague. The acting is excellent and the dialogue unsurpassed. From today, this is one of my favourite films.",

            "content": "Billy Wilder's first bonafide masterpiece was this gripping film noir from 1944. DOUBLE INDEMNITY was adapted from James M Cain's second most famous novel -the first was \"The Postman Always Rings Twice\"- which in turn was inspired by the real-life case of Ruth Snyder, a woman convicted and executed along with her lover for murderous her husband for the insurance. Wilder always had a co-writer to help out with the screenplay, and in the case of DOUBLE INDEMNITY, he teamed up with one of Cain's peers in the mystery genre: Raymond Chandler.To the casual reader, authors of hard-boiled detective fiction conjure up the image of a man standing at 6\"4' who drinks his whiskey straight while a cigarette dangles from his mouth as he bangs away at the typewriter. Wilder's first impression of Chandler was that he looked more like an accountant than an ex-Pinkerton cop -which Dashiell Hammett was. One trait Chandler had in common with the stereotypical great novelist was the heavy drinking. Almost from day one, he and Wilder clashed, with the alcoholic writer eventually quitting, leaving the director to finish the script on his own.All three leads were somewhat apprehensive about joining the production. Fred MacMurray was known as a light, likeable leading man, and the part of the murderous Walter Neff was a risky departure for him. With great reluctance, he accepted the challenge, and he would later tell a reporter that Neff was the best role he ever had. Barbara Stanwyck also had the jitters over playing the cold-blooded Phyllis Dietrichson, but was finally convinced when Wilder challenged her fears by asking \"Are you an actress or a mouse?\".Edward G Robinson's trepidation had little to do with the risky subject matter; after all he became a star in gangster movies. His concern had to do the size of his part. Since breaking out in LITTLE CAESAR, Robinson spent the next fifteen years as a leading character actor, and Barton Keyes was a supporting character. But Wilder presented him with such a terrific, well-written role that it was impossible to turn down.DOUBLE INDEMNITY begins with Walter Neff speeding through the Los Angeles streets in the wee hours of the morning to the Pacific All-Risk insurance firm where he works. Bleeding from a bullet injury to his shoulder, Neff sits at his desk and starts confessing into his Dictaphone, a precursor to the tape recorder.",

            "review_title": "Among Wilder's best, among film noir best. With amazing acting, writing and direction. An absolute classic.",
            "content": "Based on \"the other\" novel by James M Cain, Double Indemnity is one of the quintessential classics of film noir, made precisely in the year of great classics of film noir: Laura, Woman in the window, Double indemnity, three great film noir as different as they are complementary.To adapt and film this story, Wilder had the best of the best. As always, he signed a script in collaboration, but not with his usual partner Charles Brackett, but with Raymond Chandler; he had the highest paid actress and the highest paid actor of the moment, and with one of the greatest supporting actors (earning as much as the main ones). He had cinematography by John F. Setz (with whom he would collaborate on his best films for Paramount); and music by the highly renowned composer Mikl\u00f3s R\u00f3zsa (who would work for Hitchcock on Spellbound the following year).Double Indemnity, of the three great classics of 1944 film noir, as is logical due to its origin, is the closest to the type of crime novel. It does not have the dreamlike and threatening atmosphere of Woman in the window, nor the elegant and obsessive emotional plot of Laura, but it is the one that most directly integrates the disenchanted world of corruption, which will be so characteristic of the genre, on a day-to-day basis of American society.Double indemnity also shows the fascinating and sinister side of vulgarity, embodied in Barbara Stanwyck's shocking blonde wig (as opposed to Joan Bennet's glamorous femme fatale in Woman in the Window). It is that blonde wig, like the ankle bracelet, the great characterization trait of an attractive character in its striking vulgarity, above having to accommodate to established behaviors or aesthetics. Next to him, the stereotypical beauty of Jean Heather, whose paleness does not live up to the name of Lola Dietrichson, is completely nondescript.Regarding the novel, the film incorporates a curious flashback structure and an initial use of voiceover highly praised by the writer James M. Cain, which from the beginning introduces a character of tragic inexorability into the plot. Here the narrator is a dying man, a few years later Wilder will be even more ironic and extreme and he will be a corpse (Sunset boulevard). But more importantly, here our anchorage with the story, through whom we see it, with whom we identify is a criminal, and a criminal without palliatives and without extenuating conditions.The story is a revision of The Postman always rings twice, but much seedier and dirtier. Here the murderers lack the romantic appeal of the film with Lana Turner and John Garfield (another great classic that would be made only 2 years later). We have Walter Neff, an insurance salesman, who one day meets Phyllis Dietrichson, the extravagantly beautiful and dissatisfied wife of a wealthy industrialist, in one of those mansions in a wealthy city of Los Angeles. There is an immediate recognition of each other's abilities, criminal abilities as well as amatory ones. Walter seems like he's been waiting his whole life to meet not only the girl, but also the opportunity to really put his theorical experience in crime and embezzlement to good use. The woman convinces Walter of her husband's cruelty, of the impossibility of living like this, but it is clear that she is convincing him because Fred wants to be convinced. Walter deep down cares little about murdering the husband, he wants the combination of girl and money that comes his way. Phyllis is presented with the chance to manipulate a man who doesn't even have to be manipulated into committing the murder she wants.Here, unlike The Postman Always Rings Twice, the love relationship between Walter and Phyllis repels and terrifies us, because both are nothing more than two cold and calculating murderers (who more, who less). But even so, we are on their side; inevitably suspense is built because we don't want them to be found out. Thus the tension of that wonderful scene of Edward G. Robinson (as the investigator for the insurance company, the only really positive role in the film) and Fred MacMurray talking in the corridor of his home, while Robinson waits for the elevator, and Barbara Stanwyck who has come to visit Fred believing him alone, hiding behind the wide open door (the door that opens in the opposite direction), is generated because we are obviously afraid that Robinson will discover the relationship between them.It is a cinema from a time when, despite the Hays Code, ambiguity counted, where the viewer could face the ethical dilemma of identifying with definitely non-positive characters, and who have not been softened (no crimes of passion, or alienations momentary or permanent etc...), and reject them at the same time. All that was required is that each culprit at the end of the film receive their punishment.The film features three unforgettable performances: MacMurray, Stanwyck and Robinson. Few actresses are as intelligent, honest and versatile as Barbara Stanwyck, here in one of her greatest roles. At all times she shows how the character dominates the situation, even sitting in the corner of a sofa where she does not occupy even half of it. The same can be said of Robinson, the quintessential gangster was at the same time one of the actors with the greatest ability to impregnate his characters with humanity, and conveys all the intelligence, enthusiasm, and ultimately the disappointment of the character. MacMurray, for his part, showed great courage in facing a role that required abandoning the ground he dominated, that of representing the honest and healthy average American. He was the perfect choice for the role and Wilder knew it.The film is full of unforgettable scenes in addition to the one already mentioned: the first conversation between MacMurray and Standwyck, the meetings at the supermarket (plotting the murder between jars of baby food), the final duel...Wilder would say that it was his best film, for a reason.",

Ray has mentioned somewhere that American directors have had a huge influence on him especially John Ford and Billy Wilder. I bet Double Indemnity is a huge part of that inspiration. Double Indemnity is one of the best noirs I have ever seen. It is almost a perfect movie - Technically brilliant having a great director and supported by a great cast. The movie name refers to a double indemnity clause that comes with accident insurance policies where the insurance company has to pay double the amount to the customer in case of an accidental death. I guess the plot is clear now. The movie consists of love, betrayal, murder, suspense and above all insurance. The movie never looses it's grip over the viewer since it is a constant cat and mouse game shifting from one spectrum to another instantly. On the acting front, Fred MacMurray plays the smooth talking insurance salesman perfectly. I wonder why he did not got the fame his other contemporaries got. He had a great screen presence and was a fine actor. Barbara Stanwyck plays the manipulative, gold-digging seductress perfectly. She stole the show for me. A special mention to Edward G. Robinson who in my opinion is one of the most under-rated actors of the golden era just because he played supporting roles more often. When he is in the frame, he manages to steal the show most often than not - He did it in 'Key Largo' stealing the show from Bogart, he does the same here. Overall, a must watch movie for noir fans of the golden age of Hollywood.Rating : 9/10",

There are also spoilers with the review from ElMaruecan82 (\"A masterpiece of pure reverse existentialism ...\", ElMaruecan82 from France, 4 August 2012), but the review mentions the true story that James Cain's novel is based on.*** \"Double Indemnity\" (1944, Billy Wilder\ufeff) is justifiably considered among the best of Film Noir\ufeff. It is excellent curriculum for aspiring writers, directors and actors. It also features two of the greatest characters in cinema history.James M. Cain\ufeff wrote the 1935 novel, basing the story on a real crime (i.e., Ruth Syder, executed in Sing Sing on 1928). It actually took nine years to bring Cain's gripping story to the silver screen. While not the first film with a female villain, \"Indemnity\" apparently languished because of the overreaching Hays Code, as well as the reluctance of other film stars to portray the criminal romantic leads. (The Hays Code prohibited movies from being made that would potentially glorify crime and/or suggest it as a career choice. Movie morality is almost completely the opposite today. Also, it is worth noting that Billy Wilder brought Raymond Chandler\ufeff to help with the adaptation, and the two did not get along.) Fred MacMurray\ufeff's Walter Neff, a successful insurance salesman for Pacific All Risk, is the central figure in this murder and insurance fraud caper. As the film's narrator, he confesses to the killing in the opening scene. Through flashbacks we learn that Neff has been plotting to kill a businessman for a big insurance settlement and to continue his relationship with Phyliss, the victim's wife. (How he could ever believe he can still see Phyliss after the crime is committed is best left unexplored.) Neff is trying to remain in control of his relationship with Phyliss while crossing wits with the dogged, formidable claims investigator Barton Keyes. Neff's love for both connects the audience with him emotionally.Phyliss is portrayed charismatically by Barbara Stanwyck\ufeff (37 at the year of release and wearing a blonde-wig.) Stanwyck's sultry Phyliss is an inspiration to actresses who have been told they are too mature to portray a romantic lead. Stanwyck never surrenders a scene while simultaneously making the actors around her look good. Meanwhile, Edward G. Robinson\ufeff takes Keyes to the stratosphere. Robinson has multiple one-take monologues laden with insurance terminology that he delivers with show-stopping skill. While both are supporting players, the Robinson-Stanwyck duo are cinematic lightning. MacMurray also turns in a career-best performance and is very good with his confessional monologue. (BTW, almost everyone in the film smokes rapaciously.) I enjoy the foreshadowing in the narrative. Once example is with the conclusion. While trying not to spoil it, it contains a (now much-imitated) merger between murder and sex that was racy for its time. (In other words, the film's climax has its own climax, if you get my drift.) When watching the conclusion, recall that earlier in the story Phyliss is having trouble starting their getaway car. Neff lends a hand, turning the ignition key slowly. The tension that the engine turning over is released for both, as if sexually. This is not the only early scene which comments upon (and hints at) the conclusion. (Here's an unrelated question: Has any other film caper had a principal character with as much of a foot fetish as Walter has?) As the director, Billy Wilder employs negative space very effectively. For example, Keyes often discusses the \"little man\" inside him that enables him to see through the smokescreen of an insurance claim. The little guy that Keyes refers to can be seen as the boxer who is the subject of several paintings hanging on the wall of Neff's bachelor pad. The painted fighter is ready-to-rumble, and is particularly visible when Phyliss and Walter are worried about Keyes. In addition, Wilder handles the crowd-pleasing, conspirator-hiding-behind-the-hallway door moment with great skill. (Too bad Wilder didn't stay with film noir. This is what he was born to do.) Cinephiles should see \"Double Indemnity\" every time it arrives in a revival theater. Make sure you mind your crutches when arriving by open-air passenger car on a train.",

            "content": "One reason I wanted to see this film was because it was directed and written by Oscar nominated Billy Wilder (Some Like It Hot), another reason is because it is a film noir, and Femme Fetale (aka attractive woman seducing men), and it becomes a crime partnership or something) film, and many people have recommended it. Basically smooth talking insurance agent Walter Neff (Fred MacMurray) is confessing his story to his best and suspecting friend, detective Barton Keyes (Little Caesar's Edward G. Robinson). Walter met attractive Phyllis Dietrichson (Oscar nominated Barbara Stanwyck) calling to renew the automobile policy for her husband, Mr. Dietrichson (Tom Powers). The pair become very close, and eventually they plot to kill the husband, who is tricked into signing a double indemnity accident policy (i.e. Phyllis gets cash if he dies), and they kill him to look like an accident. Barton doesn't believe it was an accident, and links the murder to Phyllis, and never to his best friend. Walter meanwhile believes Phyllis has dumped him for a younger man, and he ends up stabbing her in the end. Also starring Porter Hall as Mr. Jackson, Jean Heather as Lola Dietrichson and Byron Barr as Nino Zachetti. I can see why the critics gave it five stars, and it is definitely not one to miss, and Stanwyck's character is a true bitch, but it is one of those classics I don't want to see much, but it is very good. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Cinematography, Best Music for Mikl\u00f3s R\u00f3zsa, Best Sound, Best Writing, Screenplay and Best Picture. Phyllis Dietrichson was number 8 on 100 Years, 100 Heroes & Villains, the film was number 84 on 100 Years, 100 Passions, it was number 24 on 100 Years, 100 Thrills, and it was number 38 on 100 Years, 100 Movies.

Because the guy you were looking for was too close -- right across the desk from you.\" \"Closer than that, Walter.\" Amazing. God, do I love black and white films. Easily one of the finest film noirs ever made.Barbara Stanwyck & Fred MacMurray star here as the duo who find themselves entwined in a plot to kill Stanwyck's character's husband, who had signed a double indemnity clause.The thing that I love about film noirs the most is that they portray how the world really works. Every person is on the take. Everyone is capable of murder.... Even that guy down the road who sells Insurance.There are so many things I love about this film... But I think my favorite scenes are the one's involving Walter Neff's (MacMurray) fear of discovery, and his feelings for his friend Barton Keyes ( Edward G. Robinson), who plays the Insurance investigator who just won't go away.... and who always listens to his gut or as he describes it \"the little man who lives in my stomach.\" The acting is really astonishing-Stanwyck's ice-cold Phyllis is who all femmes fatales are compared to. As far as I am concerned, that look of satisfaction on her face when her husband is murdered is one of the greatest scenes ever.That first initial chat between Phyllis & Walter is better than some current films that have just been released and eaten up.Then there is MacMurray, a strange choice for the role considering his body of work..and yet a big stroke of genius. A part of doom, and he carries it off. That line he had \"I couldn't hear my footsteps. It was the walk of a dead man\" is just so haunting.Love the narration on his part as well.",

Fred MacMurray... not the first choice or the most obvious, but he turns in the best performance of his entire career in this one. Much has been said about Barbara Stanwyck's much hated cheap blonde wig but I saw it as a young man and thought nothing about it until I starting reading these things about it. Still doesn't bother me at all. Edward G. is perfectly cast as the brainy hero-guy who is also MacMurray's workaholic boss.\n I must say I have grown to appreciate Billy Wilders films much more in the last few years with the release of his works being released on blu ray format. His witty/satirist writing still holds up decades later and should be studied by writing students. The cinematography is in glorious B&W and uses for the most part real L.A. locations which I have always found better anyway. I always hated that well-lit stage set look that early films seem to have. \nThis is a MUST for any serious film buff or even the average film goer who likes well crafted suspense.",

Turns out while trying to sell car insurance, Phillis Dietrichson (Barbara Stanwyck) becomes interested in accident insurance and sure enough soon the two are trying to knock off her husband. Walter thinks he has the perfect crime planned but his boss Barton Keyes (Edward G. Robinson) starts to see some flaws.Billy Wilder's DOUBLE INDEMNITY is often called the greatest film noir ever made and I'm not going to argue that or try to rank them since there's been so many terrific ones made. There's no question that the film is a true classic and manages to work on so many levels that you really can't help but fall for the romance, the suspense and the plot twists no matter how many times you've seen the film. Everything from the camera work to the lighting to the music score are flawless but what makes this film work so well are the direction, the performances and of course the screenplay.Wilder directs his and Raymond Chandler's screenplay with a fiery passion that just jumps off the screen. What's so remarkable about the screenplay is the terrific dialogue, which contains so much back-and-forth that you can't help but smile and wonder how long it took to write such lines. Just take a look at the sequence where Walter and Phyllis first meet. Look at the dialogue being shot off when they discuss the insurance plans. Heck, take a look at Robinson's speech whenever he's debating his boss about what really happened. The screenplay works in a terrific murder plot, wonderful dialogue and of course the twists that work flawlessly.The performances are certainly a major reason for the film being so great with both MacMurray and Stanwyck doing some of the greatest work of their careers. Stanwyck is so wonderful during the scenes where she's talking about her abuse and she manages to make you, the viewer, and MacMurray believe everything she's saying. Then that coldness that starts to show is priceless. MacMurray is perfectly believable as the normal guy who finds himself in over his head and constantly trying to out- thinking people who are a lot smart than himself. Robinson, one of the greatest actors in history and one who never gets enough attention, is flawless in his fast-talking role.DOUBLE INDEMNITY is without question one of the best noirs ever made and it constantly gets better with time.",

Robinson to take a supporting role. This was Oscar's first big mistake. Not only did Robinson not win an Academy Award, he was not even nominated. (They gave it to Barry Fitgerald playing himself in \"Going My Way\" -- one of the worst calls in Oscar history.) Fred McMurray, who gave one of his two greatest performances as Walter Neff ( the other was for his role as a womanizing heel in another Billy Wilder masterpiece, \"The Apartment\") was also completely overlooked. He also had to be convinced to take a role against type. Barbara Stanwyck as the ultimate femme fatale, was at least nominated but passed over for the forth and final time. Wilder talked Stanwyck into the role of this most unsavory woman by saying, \"Are you an actress or a mouse?\"Music, sets, and B&W cinematography were sheer perfection. The L.

John Seitz makes great use of his camera, blending shadow and light to perfectly examine the motives of the characters and the movie's mood. Based on a James Cain novel, this film was forced to change its ending as it was deemed too graphic for 1940's viewers.

Or is he really just chasing an easy $50,000? Or, maybe, as a pavement pounder, does he want to stick it to the man?Phyllis reveals much about herself when she laments having to \"sit and smile\" at breakfast with her rich husband every day. She made Neff feel special, too. \"I was thinking about that dame upstairs and the way she looked at me,\" he says into the dictophone. \"I wanted to see her again up close, without that silly staircase between us.\"It isn't long before Neff admits, \"I was a sucker,\" and sets out to mercilessly stop the depredations of Phyllis. In his death throes, he dreams of an escape to Mexico.Like the desperate Neff sucking on a last cigarette, civilization was fighting to save itself when this film emerged in 1944.

It's the blind purpose of alienating other people just for the sake of sacrificing for one person. Manipulation, lust, ignorance. 'Double Indemnity' is all these things that play a part in blindly \"falling in love\" with someone, without knowing that person is acting purely on lustful desires. Once the movie begins and we are introduced to our main character, we are already aware things have taken a bad turn, but we just don't know how bad. All we know is that things are not looking good as our character is about to begin his confession.We cannot help, but feel pity for Neff, but I think we can all agree that this was a lot of stupidity on his part for not using his brain to investigate things further before he went in too deep. This is an engrossing story and as the story unfolds, many layers of the mystery begin to peel off, unveiling one shocking revelation after the next. With each twist and turn, we can feel our insides twisting more and more as the big picture starts to show revealing the disturbing truth.This has everything I love about the film noir genre. From the witty dialogue delivered to its dark tone, its just all in all, a well thought out plot that is bound to cast a spell on its viewer and hold her or his attention until the end. It did for me, and I'll never forget the impact of its story.",

            "content": "Only those who understand the core beauty of film noir can appreciate what a fine masterpiece \"Double Indemnity\" is. I'm glad I'm one of those who appreciate that beauty. There are few movies or works of art that I consider greater than this film.There are facets of this movie that I find difficult to explain, though.The first is the terrible murder plot, and what role it plays in the emotion stirred by this film. Do we humans have a heinous dark side aroused by the very idea of cold blooded murder? I don't think so (at least not most of us). My best explanation is the huge contrast we see transpire in Walter Neff as he crosses from normal caring insurance man into killer under the influence of Phyllis Dietrichson. Although rare, this is something we know can exist in reality in everyday life in some human beings. The rare chance to watch that metamorphosis occur in a normal real-life setting provides a morbid fascination to us. Billy Wilder depicts it masterfully on screen, but it seems that a powerful and fascinating story is truly an important element for a great film, even for film noir, even for a genius director.Another facet that I find difficult to explain is the casting and sets. Obviously the choice of actors was a significant element in this film's success, as was their appearance (such as Stanwyck's blonde wig), and the scene settings. The appearance and settings, of course, were by Billy Wilder's design, but whether the actual casting was more accident than design is something I often wonder about. Fate has often played an important role in many of our classics. Regarding visual effects, film experts point out Wilder's use of venetian blind wall shadows, which add greatly to the noir realism. Another visual effect might be the tall ceilings in the home and offices. I'm not much in psychology, but I sometimes wonder if this doesn't give the Dietrichson home a castle-like impression of wealth, another contrast effect. We all know it's much more shocking when people of wealth and influence commit crimes than when average Joe's like me do. The tall ceilings in the Pacific All Risk offices make me think of old buildings, and in my amateur analysis I wonder if this doesn't add a nostalgic appeal to the film today. But maybe I'm wrong. Some of the office building scenes are actually quite modern.Finally, I must mention that New York Times' Bosley Crowther was one of the few critics to give Double Indemnity a negative review in 1944. Two years later Crowther gave the film \"The Postman Always Rings Twice\", a good review. Postman is a fine film, but it doesn't hold a candle to Double Indemnity; just further proof of my claim that Crowther wasn't much of a critic. Some people wouldn't know a good movie if it fell on them.",

            "content": "Double Indemnity is about the idea that the loss of morality destroys everything. It demonstrates this idea by a man who gets on the slippery slope of adultery that ends with a double murder. In the process, he loses his career, friend, a woman who really loved him and ultimately his life.The main plot of the story is the external one: to get away with the perfect murder in order to be with the woman he loves. This plot ends in failure. Suspicion ruins his love and he commits another murder to hide the first. His suspicion is proved to be misplaced as his lover refuses to kill him before he kills her. In the end, he is caught, confesses and dies from his wounds.But we already knew that he doesn't get away since the movie starts with his confession and the whole thing takes place in a flashback that catches up to the present.If the movie ended where it began, it would have been a simple morality play about how the slippery slope of the loss of morality (that started with some innocent flirting) can quickly spiral out of control and take everything with it. But our hero chooses to redeem himself at the end. He realizes he has lost everything and chooses to confess. He also choose to put two young lovers who have broken up because of mutual distrust back on track to be reunited. This minor plot line of Lola and her boyfriend's love is crucial to the hero's redemption.Double Indemnity is a very tight story. Each character plays roles on multiple plot lines and each scene provides turning points of expanding stakes and meaning. It absolutely proves the idea that even a small loss of morality will lead to the ultimate destruction.My Story Chart of the movie is at storycharts.ca.",

Special effects have improved since The Birds. I found Some Like It Hot to be so-so, and Citizen Kane is overly melodramatic. It's tough but with the passage of time some films just fade.But not Double Indemnity! I was so shocked to see Fred MacMurray, the guy who'd played campy roles like in The Absent Minded Professor and My Three Sons (TV) do something so serious. There's little action but it's definitely a thriller. The pressure is constant throughout. I have no idea how they do it, I guess it is the story and the acting. The narrative keeps us constantly informed of how close to the edge our protagonist is.Who should see this film:-- Everyone with an interest in classics or thrillers-- People like me who find most classics slow-paced or too arty. This one's safe, really timeless! And see Breakdown, too, which is similar in its relentless tension.I'll give Double Indemnity a stands-the-test-of-time 9 out of 10.

EG Robinson shines as the insurance investigator but it is MacMurray who steals the movie. One has no trouble in believing him in the role of an opportunistic killer.

            "content": "Often times, if you want a good mystery, you have to go back to the 40's and 50's, rightfully known as The Golden Age of Hollywood. In today's world, which is filled with talentless tabloid kings and queens posing as actors, studios that are too afraid to do anything new, and directors who overdo camera tricks to adapt the story for the most inattentive viewer, good movies, especially thrillers, are hard to find. If you want a good thriller, then see \"Double Indemnity.\"The film is told in flashback, with a wounded man confessing to his crime. That man is Walter Neff (Fred MacMurray), an insurance salesman who falls for a put-upon housewife named Phyllis Dietrichson (Barbara Stanwyck). Together, they plan to kill Phyllis's husband (Tom Powers) and collect on a huge insurance claim. But as perfect as their plan seems to be, thing's don't go the way they thought they would.The acting is outstanding all around. I was surprised to learn from Robert Osborne's intro that Fred MacMurray was known for his romantic comedies. MacMurray is outstanding; he's perfect in a noir thriller (even rivaling, if not besting, Humphrey Bogart). Barbara Stanwyck is brilliant as the femme fatale, Phyllis Dietrichson. Actually, calling her that isn't exactly true. For the most part, she's just as nervous and desperate as Walter is, although there is more to her than Walter initially realizes. It's amazing that Stanwyck, who was by all accounts a kind and gentle person off-screen, could pull off a role like this. Edward G. Morrow nearly didn't accept the role because after recently securing leads, he didn't want to give the impression that his career was on the downturn by taking a supporting role. It's a good thing that he took it, because Morrow is pitch-perfect in the role of Barton Keyes, Walter's boss. Actually, after watching him in \"Key Largo,\" I didn't think I'd be able to buy him as a sympathetic character. but Morrow pulls it off. When Walter says that Barton is a gruff man with a heart, we can really see it. Able support comes from Jean Heather, as Phyllis's step-daughter, Lola and Byron Barr, as Nino Zarchetti, Lola's boyfriend.During the period of the Hays Code, most of what happens had to be done through words, not action. Therefore, it might be a little disconcerting for viewers who are not used to films from this period to find that Walter and Phyllis fall for each other without sex of any kind, and only through words. Stanwyck and MacMurray pull it off, however.It helps that the script is a masterpiece of story construction, with dialogue that occasionally borders on brilliant. There's a fair bit of humor early on, particularly a scene between Walter and Phyllis that is a conversation about speeding tickets that serves as a series of sexual innuendos. The scene is quite clever and funny, though it does not inhibit the suspense that builds potently for the rest of the film. The story is highly inventive, with plenty of twists and turns, none of which are expected.This was the third Oscar nomination for writing that Billy Wilder received, but it was the first time his skills behind the camera were so honored (he didn't win either for this film, but the very next year he took home statues for both co-writing and directing \"The Lost Weekend\"). It's not hard to understand why he was nominated for both for \"Double Indemnity.\" The film is told with the hand of a master. It's rarely confusing (the ending is slightly so), and Wilder's sleight of hand is so subtle that the twists are impossible to see coming. And the tension is constant and unceasing.If you want to see a good murder mystery with great acting and actual suspense, check out one of the best Golden Oldies, \"Double Indemnity.\"",

Granted, this was made in the 40's so some turns of phrase seem a bit pompous or outdated, but lines fly and follow each other with a remarkable fluidity, without any downs. As for the rest, the movie comprises every characteristic of the film noir genre whether on the form or content, from lighting to the voice-over or the typical characters. The plot is implacable but some elements are not very credible, like the emerging romance for example. The Machiavellian scheme and the investigation that follows it lack suspense, tension, and the outcome turns out to be a bit disappointing because it's rather telegraphed although it perfectly concludes this noir which probably remains Wilder's most iconic.",

The only believable character I found was that of Lola, the victim's daughter. Edward G. Robinson was great, thus I felt that the part was written for him. Now the part of the casual observer on the train from Oregon seemed to be terribly stereotyped, and the racist overtones as with Mr. Galopus and the \"colored woman who comes in twice a week\" didn't excite me either, but I guess that was what it was like in those days.Now for the clipped part. The dialogue seemed very quick and unnatural. It sounded like everyone was reading from the script while they were acting. This may have something to do with Wilder's penchant for \"tight\" scripts, especially in his early films. I must say that he improved later on in such films as \"Sunset Boulevard.\" I did enjoy the scenes of Los Angeles in the 1940's though. It's a period piece to be admired.",

I liked Double Indemnity, but I'm bias because I love noir films. The lightning in this film wasn't quite as high contrast as I enjoy, while there was obvious separation of light and dark, it wasn't as extreme as some other films thus the tension wasn't quite there in some of the crucial scenes. I won't say that there isn't any contrasting lighting, just not as extreme as I tend to like from my noir films. This is to be expected however with this being an early noir films that inspired latter films I prefer. I'm sure that the content of this film was considered to be incredibly taboo at the time, but for modern audiences it's fairly tame.

Snappy quick-witted dialog, a tumultuous introduction that forces the viewer right into the thick of the plot and action that often starts at the very end before recounting the story (as here), a femme fatale lead character along with a cynical blas\u00e9 male lead who often switches between effective line delivery and narration in the background (as here), and a plot that is complex involving different parties that appreciates a psychological intrigue and insight into the protagonists' minds and motivations, the actors always top drawer with their individual performance and presence onscreen offering strong guarantee for the whole ride.The thing about this one is as often the dialog is too dense and too prolific imposing a solicitation of utter focus and attention from the viewer for the entire show and where it's interesting and effective in many parts, it's just too much effort for little reward: the actors just spew out a ton of lines with incredible cadence and this contributes to a feeling of prolonged length. Also strongly adding to the effect of distorted time, like the film is too long for its own good is how it runs out of puff at just about 30 minutes before the end. All of the wit and plot strong points and crux of the film are dispensed through the first hour plus, and just when the momentum appears to be at a peak the film aggressively maintains a suspended effort of keeping that high note going on, and on, where it feels artificially kept alive and can't seem to make itself as interesting as the first two thirds. There's a natural rhythm and momentum for any film but these crime film-noirs especially and the intrigue needs to be carefully conducted and evenly spread over whichever period of time. It just feels dead and drags on at the end here, the last half hour rather painful and with little reward as there's a strong feeling of inevitability that something fairly predictable and just about how we'd imagine it is about to happen, the film strips its own self of any element of surprise and spontaneity and denies its viewer a punchy ending which is disappointing after demanding such focus from the audience. Finally, there's also the fact this sort of film relies on details fulfilling the requirements of the plot and there's a dominant feeling of predictability and convenience to key characters with their resolving of the plot. This remains a top film-noir for what it is and lots of good work was also put into it, however there's no excuse for throwing off the pace and having a film end on a lackluster note, if you're the film-maker it's your number one duty.6.5/10.",

            "content": "'Double Indemnity (1944)' is evocative of a time that probably never really existed, one in which men called women \"baby\" instead of their name and in which women made men putty in their hands just by showing them an anklet. With its thick, hard-boiled narration and its suave, morally dubious characters, the picture exudes the kind of palpable atmosphere that only true film-noir can. It's moody yet playful, with a brilliantly penned screenplay that provides a quip for every situation. A steady mix of non-linear storytelling, ambiguous motives, dense black-and-white cinematography and now archetypal characters marks this as one of the prime examples of its genre. As such, it holds up incredibly well. It's intriguing, engaging and, most importantly, entertaining. Don't miss out on this one, baby. 8/10",

Not throughout the whole thing, in day time shots, but it was still there. But it did seem like that whole stereotypical noir feeling with the narrating by the main character. I feel like parodies of film noir in todays culture base everything off a movie like this one. A cool sounding guy sitting at his desk, telling you how it all went down.

In it's favour, it's nicely paced with some sharp wise-cracking dialogue, and Edward G. Robinson is fun in a supporting role. Against that, it rather leads its audience by the nose, with a voice-over telling where it would have been better to simply show. This puts a distance between us and the film, which doesn't spoil the tricksy plotting but which does rather kill the movie's emotional dimension.

The entire plot takes place during the flashback; this makes for a really cool POV.This film is a black and white film but most of the \"white tones\" appear to be grey. Everything also seems to have a matted look to it. Overall the movie was very dark and hard to watch. Also, the sound was very poor. The dialogue was very quiet yet the music was very loud. I had to turn my television up very loud just to hear them talk. I also liked how throughout the film there is a voice over effect which, since it is told in a flashback, makes it seem like it is more of this thoughts that we are hearing.I think the love story behind the plan is kind of corny. I personally think that she sees a man who is crazy for her and is able to help her get the money, so she just takes advantage of him. To me the love story is not real and takes a backseat. The end is perfect when she claims she has really fallen in love with him, when she can't shoot him a second time, and he just shoots her. I love/ think that the manipulative characteristic really worked for Mrs. Dietrichson. Even though she was in on the plan that killed her husband she was still able to play the \"poor widow\" card and make the detectives feel bad when accusing her. Overall this film was very good.",

            "review_title": "Would Two More Murders Make Sense?",
            "content": "Walter Neff is an insurance salesman who conspires with Phyllis Dietrichson to murder her husband and collect on an accident policy. Walter is good friends with Barton Keyes, an investigator with the same company who has an uncanny ability to spot a phony claim. As a result, Walter knows all the angles and he and Phyllis almost manage to commit the perfect crime.The coroner rules it to be an accident, and so the police do not bother to investigate any further. But the insurance company is on the hook for the $100,000, and so Keyes starts looking into the matter, especially after he gets one of his hunches. Suspecting that Mr. Dietrichson was murdered, Keyes realizes it would be easier to murder him before he got on the train, which is what happened, rather than kill him on the train. That means that Phyllis must have had a male accomplice to pretend to be her husband. He starts having her house watched. As a result, Walter and Phyllis have to stop seeing each other until the investigation is over. Phyllis's stepdaughter, Lola, had a boyfriend, Nino Zachetti, but they broke up, and soon he and Phyllis start having an affair. Keyes concludes that Nino is the accomplice in the murder and calls off the surveillance. He tells Walter he is going to reject the claim, daring her to take it to court.What follows from this point on seems to make no sense. Walter goes over to Phyllis's house intending to strangle her, and she slips a pistol under the cushion so that she can murder him. Let us consider the situation from Phyllis's point of view. Unless we assume she is psychic, she does not know of Walter's plans to kill her. So, what does she hope to gain by killing Walter? The police have already dropped the case, but if Walter is murdered, the police will not only investigate his death, but it might make them reconsider her husband's death as well, since Walter sold her the policy. Furthermore, shooting Walter in her house will not only get blood all over the place, but she will then have to dispose of the body. What is she going to do, cut him up in the bathtub like the guy in \"Rear Window\" (1954), and then make several trips to the city dump with the body parts in a suitcase?The prudent thing for her to do is to just sue the insurance company. If she wins, she can give Walter his cut and all will be well. If she does suspect Walter wants to kill her, then she should simply refuse to let him come over to her house. After all, he is not going to gun her down on Main Street. Therefore, it makes no sense for her to shoot Walter.Now let us look at it from Walter's point of view. By this point, Walter has obviously given up on getting his share of the money, because she cannot very well collect and split with him if she is dead. So, what does he hope to gain by killing Phyllis? All Keyes knows is that Phyllis has been seeing Nino, which means she has been having an affair with a younger man. Big deal. He says he has investigated Nino's movements on the night of the murder, and they cannot be accounted for. We later find out from Lola that he broke a date with her the night of the murder, claiming he was home sick. But that is not exactly evidence that he committed a murder. In any event, we know that Nino did not do it, so he is not likely to get tripped up in a cross examination in court, as Keyes seems to think. With nothing more to go on, Keyes has little chance of successfully denying Phyllis's claim in court, and it certainly would not be enough for the police to reopen the case. Walter should just quit having anything to do with Phyllis.But let us assume that beyond all reason, Walter is afraid that enough would come out in the civil suit that would lead the police to reopen the investigation into the death of Phyllis's husband, and make them to suspect not Nino, but Walter. In that case, Walter should simply turn in his resignation at the insurance company and go to Mexico for a while. If Phyllis's lawsuit does not lead to a new police investigation in which he becomes a suspect, he can always return to the United States later; if it does lead to a new investigation and he does become a suspect, he can continue to hide out in Mexico. But his killing her will definitely cause the police to investigate. Walter's plan is that Nino will be blamed for Phyllis's murder. But Nino might have an alibi for that night. As it turns out, Nino was coming to see Phyllis just as Walter was leaving the house, but Walter could not know Nino was going to do that. Walter tells Phyllis, just before he kills her, that he knows Nino will be coming to see her in fifteen minutes with the cops right behind him, because it has been all set up. Now, how would he know that? Furthermore, Nino would have no motive for murdering her. If anything, the police might end up suspecting Walter. Therefore, it makes no sense for Walter to murder Phyllis.However, it is reasonable to assume that two people who have committed a murder and are afraid of getting caught might not be thinking clearly. Each one might suppose that killing the other one would make them safe, because then there would be no accomplice to testify against them. So, their behavior might make sense on an emotional level.",

            "content": "(There are Spoilers) Prefusely Bleeding from a gunshot wound insurance salesman Walter Neff, Fred MacMurray, instead of getting immediate medical attention drives to the Pacific All Risk Building in downtown L.A. After staggering into his office Walter sits down and pops a blank cylinder into his dicta-phone and spills his guts out about what a fool he was over a woman who in the end painted Walter into a corner that if he survives his wounds he'll end up facing either life in prison or the California gas chamber.Walter at first wasn't all that impressed with Phillis Dietrichson, Barbara Stanwyck,when two months earlier he showed up at her home to renew her husbands, Tom Powers, auto insurance. Phillis started to probe Walter about insuring Mr. Dietrichson for as much as $50,000.00 without him even knowing about it. Walter started to smell a rat, or murder, on Phillis' part and told her to take a hike; if only he would have let it end then and there. The poor man didn't realize just how cold blooded and manipulative Phillis was and in the end Walter's mistake would cost him very dearly.With Phillis showing up at Walter's apartment and giving him a long cock and bull story about how she loves him and what a rat her husband is. It didn't take long for him to take the bait and fall right in line with her. Walter gets Mr. Dietrichson insured for $50,000.00 with a double indemnity clause, making it a grand total of $100,000.00, if Mr. Dietrichson gets killed in an accident.Mr. Dietrichson for his part is easily fooled by both Walter and Phillis into signing the policy thinking that it's to insure his car not is life.The two would-be murders, Walter & Phillis, wait for the right time to get Mr. Deitrichson alone and finish him off making it look accidental. That time comes when he suffers a broken leg at his job in the oil fields. Planning to drive to Palo Alto for a get-together with fellow oil executives Mr. Dietrichson is forced to take the train and it's on the train where Walter and Phillis plan for him to have a fatal accident. That's after they murder Mr. Dietrichson beforehand and then have Walter impersonate him. Everything goes like clockwork with Mr. Dietrichson murdered, by Walter, in route to the train station and then later dumped on the tracks. Walter in a leg cast, and wearing the same clothes that Mr. Dieterichson was wearing, puts on a show on the train trying to convince everybody on it that he was Phillis's husband. It's only after Mr. Dieterichson's death that things started unraveling for the two schemers. This unraveling would lead to Walter finally getting wise to Phillis in what she really had planned for him as well as her step-daughter Lola, Jane Heather, and Lola's boyfriend as well as Phillis' lover Nino Zachetti (Byron Barr) but by then it was too late.Walters best friend and insurance investigator at Pacific All Risk Barton Keys, Edward G. Robinson, who at first bought the story of Mr. Deitrichson's accidentally death started to look deep into the matter. The \"little man\" inside his gut, who was never wrong in all the time he investigated claims, wouldn't let Keyes rest and that lead Keyes, like a determined bull-dog, to keep the Dietrichson case open until he finally broke it.Keyes for his part had no idea that Walter had anything to do with Mr. Dietrichson's death, or murder, being that Walter covered his tracks so well. Keyes felt certain that it was Nino in concert with Phillis that did her old man in. Walter started to get very guilt-ridden over Nino being set up,unknowingly, by Keyes to take the the rap for a crime that he committed. At the same time Walter felt guilty in sweet and innocent Lola, who had nothing but hatred and contempt for her step-mother, taking him into her confidence after he ,not Nino, brutally and cold-blooded murdered her dad!Thinking that he's home free with Nino and Phillis about to be arrested and charged with the murder of Mr. Dietrichson Walter foolishly, or was it his guilty conscience, confronted Phillis at her house that evening only to have himself blasted by Phillis. Phillis for the first time in the movie, showing that she was really in love with Walter can't bring herself to finish him off with a second and fatal shot which turned out to be a fatal mistake on Phillis' part.It's now after 400:AM and Keyes shows up at Walter's office with the police and ambulance not far behind. Walter trying to get a head start from the police in order to cross the US/Mexican border falls right on his face before he can even reach the elevator. It's then when we, and Walter, begin to realize that Keyes may well have known that Walter was the one, not Nino, who together with Phillis tried to pull off the perfect crime. Because Keyes was so close to Walter, much closer then even Walter realized, he didn't have the heart and mind to suspect and have him arrested for murder. It was Walter himself who solved his friends Keyes very pressing and emotional problem by implicating, with his voluntarily taped or recored confession, himself!",

            "content": "Establishing the genre of film-noir in cinema, catapulting Billy Wilder into the big leagues of Hollywood filmmakers & expertly sustaining its foreboding ambiance throughout its runtime, Double Indemnity is one of the brightest works of Wilder's career which, in spite of revealing its finale to the viewers in its opening moments, manages to carve out its own moments of suspense.Based on James M. Cain's 1943 novella of the same name, Double Indemnity tells the story of an experienced insurance salesman who starts an affair with the seductive wife of one of his clients & devises a scheme to murder his client in a manner that invokes the double indemnity clause of his insurance plan. Trouble begins when his boss begins to suspect a foul play in the cleverly-executed accident.Co-written & directed by Billy Wilder, Double Indemnity is the first masterpiece of his career & marks the beginning of a legendary filmmaking journey that would later go down as one of cinema's finest. The film opens with what's supposed to be its closing moment & is then narrated by our protagonist, eventually coming full circle over the course of its runtime. And Raymond Chandler's contribution to the script cannot be understated.While the story alone lays down the groundwork for what a film-noir is supposed to be like, the technical aspects still introduce a number of innovations that would later be associated with this particular genre only. Cinematography makes terrific use of light & camera, Editing skilfully paces the whole plot throughout its 107 minutes of runtime & never lets the mystery fizzle out while the background score continues to elevate the suspenseful moments.Coming to the performances, the cast comprises of Fred MacMurray, Barbara Stanwyck & Edward G. Robinson, all of whom chip in with sensational performances. MacMurray plays Walter Neff; the insurance salesman, & is quite convincing in the given role, Stanwyck plays the femme-fatale Phyllis Dietrichson amazingly well too but for me, it's Robinson who really steals the show as Neff's boss Barton Keyes and moments between him n MacMurray are easily my favourites.On an overall scale, even though Wilder followed Double Indemnity with many more quality films, it still ranks amongst the most memorable & top-rated works of his illustrious career. Influential & unforgettable for its contribution to cinema, still hailed by many film lovers as the quintessential film-noir and effortlessly sustaining its thrills & nail-biting tension despite giving away the ending within the first few minutes, Double Indemnity is a brilliantly plotted, superbly executed & cleverly narrated cinema that comes strongly recommended.",

Before even getting into the form of the film, the content is just great. The woman in this film (Phyllis) is a classic woman figure in a film noir film in the sense that she is not who she appears to be. She comes off as an average woman but secretly wants her husband dead. The plot is very eery and dark with Phyllis being the center of evil. This film utilizes many other aspects of the overall film noir genre. Low key lighting is seen throughout the film as well as oppressive music which gives the pessimistic feel which is seen in many other film noir films. Even the costumes the characters wear help with its overall feel. The men are seen wearing gangster type suits while the women are well dressed in dresses. This film is significant because of its influence on other films. In other words, this film helped set the standard for future film noir films.",

Shadows played a big role in portraying a character, hard shadows for intense characters and soft shadows for more lax characters. The mes-en-scene, or feel of the movie, was interesting.

Everything about this film was amazing, from the beautiful shots that made up this movie, to the acting, and plot. The way the movie was played out was excellent as well, because the audience already knows a lot of the story right from the beginning, giving the audience time to focus on other things such as the black and white shots and wonderful acting throughout the rest of the movie. The plot of this movie also moved right along during this movie that was shy of two hours. A viewer would not guess this movie was almost two hours long because viewers get drawn in immediately.",

But none of the greatness in this film could have been achieved without the three best aspects: 1) John Seitz's stunning cinematography. No other film-noir has managed to contrast black and white so vividly as to capture the perfect mood of the story and characters. Because of this technical achievement, the viewer can't take his eyes of the screen.2) Barbara Stanwyck's beautiful performance. Only until Gloria Swanson in Sunset Blvd. has there been such a mesmerizing femme fatale. She underplays every line and fills it with innocence, seduction, despair, desperation, and love. She IS Phyllis Dietrichson.3) Billy Wilder's unforgettable script. A story that nowadays would seem simple turns in great dialogue, plot twists, and a narrative structure that keeps you on the edge of your seat right from the start. The characters do exactly what they're supposed to do and the script shows you exactly how and why.Other great aspects include the direction, the settings, the music, and the great performances by Robinson and MacMurray.",

            "content": "Double Indemnity is the particularly effective thriller and apparent cornerstone of the film noir genre that tells the tale of Walter Neff; an insurance salesman that finds himself plotting and staging the death of a client for his black widow wife. To someone like me, a child of the future where toilet paper sometimes doesn't have rolls in it anymore and plastic bags are illegal in California, the plot seemed sort of cookie-cutter, but now that I've found out that was just because this is the film that made this cookie cutter that other cookie baking bakers have been using to cut their own femme fatale shaped cookies with I've become a staunch admirer of this film and the legacy it left for the people of the future that have developed the technology to use our toilet paper rolls for paper bags to carry our groceries in.I started watching Double Indemnity under the jaded pretext that any 'thrills' it contained wouldn't have the same effect on me that they would've had on a moviegoer from 1944. It's what I've had to do whenever I've watched an older horror film, so I guess I started thinking proper, nail-biting tension was something that hadn't quite been discovered by film yet. After so much apathy you can imagine my joyous surprise when this film ended up being able to hold its own against the better contemporary thrillers I had grown up with. I was completely ecstatic when I realized the film was actually bringing me to the edge of my seat, and the scene where Keyes almost finds Phyllis in Walter's apartment actually made me get out of my chair and pace around the room while I watched. For me, the champion of this movie was Edward G. Robinson as Keyes. Where Walter Neff was bland, monotoned, and same-faced; Barton Keyes was a sharp, quick-witted bloodhound and Robinson gave him all the disarming charisma he needed to set up every major antagonatory force in the film and single-handedly unravel Neff's plot in a way that seemed completely plausible. The film may have had its problems, but Keyes didn't, this guy was gold.Double Indemnity is a movie deserving of multiple viewings. Not because of a complex plot, but because it's a fun movie with pacing so good I feel like it understayed its welcome. At 107 minutes, I wouldn't say it felt rushed, but I definitely wish there was more.",

            "review_title": "The Kabbalistic Four Viewers",
            "content": "Well, this is great and not in the way usually publicized. The second viewing unlocked for me. Of course! it's a film that begins with a storyteller phoning it in.Okay, so it's pretty great for all the obvious reasons; deceit and counter-deceit, sizzling chemistry between the players, sex all in the promise, crushing shadows everywhere. The rundown of traditional noir elements. It's The Maltese Falcon spinned in a different way, but more on that in a while.Now, like Huston, Wilder was a writer first, a talented one, and the film was usually finished on the page, then gears were brought around to illustrate a world. The story goes that Wilder was a big womanizer, and this made Raymond Chandler - co-writer on this - very uncomfortable.So one fundamental attribute that makes this so enjoyable is getting to note sex behind doors, for instance the cut from Phyllis in Walter's home crying on his shoulder to the shot, on the same couch, of Walter sprawled and enjoying a smoke while Phyllis looks a little flushed.The noir meat of the thing is so iconic it really warrants little mention. This type of film happens because the man desires, often some sort of investigator, and so a man tasked with watching, observing coldly and without emotion. Desire bends clear sight of the world and he finds himself embroiled in all kinds of mischief that transforms the visible reality. But see, the night is all in the mind, because desired that way.Now Falcon, arguably the first epochal film noir, was also about a man tasked with seeing clearly into a web of deceit, the catch was that no one including the viewer was really sure whether he does or not, the plot being a puzzle, because he strutted around like an actor blustering his way into the plot with a show he puts or stories he makes up on the spot. It was a joy to watch because nearly every one else was in on it, riffing together and enjoying the show. It was never about the bird, rather in turns weaving a story about it and commenting on how ridiculous.This is something else. Unlike Spade, none of the main participants is really master of his fate or the story. What sets them apart, is that only two are responsible for the story and the others about watching and commenting.The first is easy to spot. Neff and Phyllis go to work on setting up a plot that will anticipate the scrutiny of the man tasked with solving them. Keyes is our surrogate viewer, standing in for an audience experienced in this type of film. Of course we're seeing both ways, and spend most of the time waiting for this on-screen viewer to catch up.The other half of this equation is what is really marvellous. There is more than one viewer, at least four that I could count.Each of these four viewers is a distinct type of cinematic viewer. All four know something is wrong with the story. All four lack definitive proof. The company boss imagines a plot but imagines it wrong and really sets the case back. The daughter has seen a crucial bit that neither we nor the storymakers have, but has poor reasoning skills and confesses it to the wrong man - Neff of course takes her on a ride with another story. Keyes has superb reasoning skills and has really nailed the plot by the end but is thrown off by emotion that his partner of 11 years is the missing link.The fourth is the man with the cigar who was on the back of the train, the 'observation platform'. He has not seen a face but can plainly trust his eye to guide him. Not being embroiled in narratives, having a clear mind on the case, he is free to call things the way he saw them - the man was of so and so height, age, build..This makes for a superb essay on different modes of viewing, with imagination at the bottom and leading up to a true perception into the nature of things, past attachments and emotion-narratives of the mind. Put another way, every time you watch something and your imagination wanders, you get it wrong. Every time you watch with attachment, you also get it wrong. The only way is seeing-only.It makes for a perfect Buddhist parable. Wilder being Jewish, I am inclined to think that the more fitting connection is kabbalistic and mapping to the Four Worlds.Something to meditate upon.Noir Meter: 4/4 - pitch black",

Barbara Stanwyck, on the other hand, was used to playing femme fatales.This film was darker than an amusement park horror house. A man murders the husband of the woman he wants and an insurance adjuster (Robinson) comes in to find out exactly what happened. There are many twists and turns along the way.

Barbara Stanwyck has an accent and a voice that can mesmerize and the way her and Fred MacMurray were speaking to each other was interesting and exciting and really kept the attention of the audience. The photography was also amazing in this film. There were very dramatic lights and shadows that subtly resembled German expressionism. It contrasted greatly with the bright sunny weather on the outside with the gloomy dark lighting in the insides telling a story that anyone is capable of murder no matter what they look like on the outside. Apparently John F. Seitz used a technique called \"venetian blind\" which gave the lighting a look as if the characters were trapped behind prison bars. All in all the photography was very good with its dramatic shadows and gloomy/ scary appearance. And of course the plot was very good. Barbara had Fred wrapped around her finger throughout the whole thing and when he finally snapped out of his twitterpated comatose that's when things started to take a turn for the interesting. When Fred finally saw through all of Barbara's deceiving and evil plots his love for her vanished and he was determined to stop her whatever it took. The ending really did it for me because it felt as if justice had finally been served for the young deceiving mistress who was fooling Fred from the beginning.",

I really liked how they told who the murder was in the opening scenes. Sometimes that can backfire on you because it can ruin the suspense later in the movie.

We meet our hero McMurray when he starts a recording of his confession, leading to a flashback so dark you need a torch to navigate it (see, the kind of dialogue is catching).McMurray, for me, is not the best choice for this kind of material.

Along with these characteristics they way the movie is film, for example low key light that causes a lot of shadows and angular camera shots. Double Indemnity has a lot of great scenes that really tell you a lot about the characters with out having to say anything, and just let the way it is edited to give you the information. One scene that is a good example of this when Phyllis and Walter first meet, Phyllis is on a balcony looking out and the camera angle is low to high, because Walter is looking up at her. Having the camera angle from low to high gives us the impression that Phyllis is in powered and we are already clued in on who will be the dominant one in the duo. Another great example of this is the scene where Phyllis is driving her husband. We already know Walter is in the back seat waiting to murder her husband, and when he does start to strangle him the camera cuts away and shows us a close up of Phyllis instead. Her face has a shadow covering parts of it and she slowly begins to smirk. This shot is powerful and very telling on the kind of awful women Phyllis is. One last example of good editing in Double Indemnity is a scene towards the end, when Walter's boss begins to understand what he has been up to. His boss shows up at his apartment when Phyllis is there, so she ends up hiding behind his door and his boss is standing in the doorway. All that is separating the two from each other is the door, this causes a lot of tension and anxiety for the viewer. The shot is also very interesting in the fact that it has all three characters in this one frame, and it is a symbol for Walter's inner struggle, he literally has Phyllis on one side, and his boss and old life on the other. This movie is a suspenseful wonderfully film movie with really interesting editing, definitely one for film noir fans.",

It has a lot to do with the performances: Fred MacMurray cast against type as Walter Neff, the insurance salesperson drawn into a web of intrigue, contrasted with Barbara Stanwyce, at once so alluring yet remarkably expressionless as she puts her plans into practice. And there is Edward G; Robinson as the fast-talking investigator, outwardly friendly yet with a mind like a steel trap. Billy Wilder's film is perfectly structured around a series of close-ups: the characters' expressions are perpetually put under the microscope so that every change in emotion is signaled to us. There is also the light, with the bars of the windows shining on MacMurray's face, emphasizing some kind of imprisonment; and Miklos Rozsa's haunting music, with its central motifs signifying doom. Yet perhaps this movie's greatest asset is its script: the story of how Wilder and Chandler's collaboration went through several problematic stages is a legendary one, but the end result is a taunt, literate piece of work, allowing the characters full rein to express themselves. MacMurray's voice-over leads us into the story, while emphasizing his guilty feelings for what he has done. There are also several humorous exchanges between MacMurray and Robinson; despite what he has done, it's clear that Robinson's investigator has a lasting respect for Neff as a person. There is also a running leitmotif throughout the film, as Neff keeps lighting the investigator's cigar with a match; the tables are only turned at the end, when the wounded Neff takes out a blood-stained cigarette and the investigator lights it for him. DOUBLE INDEMNITY is one of those films to watch again and again, not only because of the subtleties of structure and performance, but simply because it's a really good piece of work.",

No, I'm not talking about \"flawed hero\" and \"femme fatales\", those are everyday.  I'm referring to narrative perspective.  In this movie's case, it died by the mid-80s.  By then, the neo-noir caught up with it and left it in the dust.This is your only spoiler warning...I saw this again over the weekend for the first time in many years.  First I saw it as a high school freshman, then as a junior in college.  In neither instance was I impressed by what I saw.Stanwyck has no sex appeal and it isn't because of that atrocious wig.  Even Angela Lansbury in 'Manchurian' emits more emotion than this.  In the case of shallow noir like this, the idea lives or dies on our acceptance of this character.  I am repulsed and not by any degree of acting.I have a theory that movies acquired the right to be heard in stages.  The Marx Brothers made dialog interesting.  The 60s--Bernstein and Morricone in particular--changed music from pompous garbage like this to something attuned to the image.  Finally, the 70s made the effects and miscellaneous sound elements worth hearing (no, 'Star Wars' isn't part of my \"sonic elite\").  In other words, watching this muted is beneficial to your health.Lastly, the script falls in the hands of the actors.  MacMurray and Stanwyck are self-aware (complete with Stanwyck practicing her acting with Fred after the murder), but they take this hokum too seriously.  Only Robinson plays this by constantly winking at us.  He'd learned enough in the decade since 'Caesar'.  He's the Sherlock Holmes of the story, running the second narrative rather than being the focus.  I guess it's the novel \"inside-out\" aspect that made this unique in its day.  In its day.Watch this with 'Wizard of Oz' to see when concepts die.  Then watch 'Bill & Ted 2' with 'Return to Oz' to see where revitalization comes at the expense of one's soul.Final Analysis = = Cinematic Dud",

The story is very effective the way it starts out basically at the end of the movie with the confession and having Neff narrating the story was a great idea and I can see now how it influences other filmmakers later because of how good it worked in this type of story. The characters are also great and Phyllis works really well, you start out liking Neff and Phyllis's relationship but towards the end she's the least liked character and the film does a great job developing them. Overall, Double Indemnity has a great story and characters that keep you sucked in this noir classic and gets an 8/10.",

The difference between a film noir and a caper flick is that in a caper flick what commands our attention is the details of the crime; in a film noir, things don't get interesting until after the crime.Here in Double Indemnity two rotten people conspire to commit murder. \"We're both rotten,\" she says. \"You're a little more rotten,\" he replies. Not that it matters, which of them is worse. It is their fundamental character that moves them to plan the crime, and energizes them to go through with it. And, it is their lack of character which proves their undoing.The murder weighs on them as the investigation proceeds, and they live in fear of being found out. Not only are they being trailed by a canny insurance investigator, who slowly unravels the crime, but they cannot be together for fear of arousing suspicion. And, suspicion is exactly what gets aroused. Walter and Phyllis begin to suspect each other, begin to conspire to implicate each other, creating a different kind of insurance policy, one that would allow each to escape from the plot they had hatched, leaving the other to take the fall. Here .. here is where Double Indemnity earns its reputation as a masterpiece: we see the emotional consequences of a deed so terrible, neither guilty party can live with it, and we live inside their heads and hearts as their well-laid plans and dreams for happiness turn to dust at their feet. I don't remember any movie where the tormented inner psyche of two persons is more clearly seen than here.Finally, in the piece de resistance we learn just what Walter and Phyllis are really capable of in the best scene of the movie at the Dietrichson home, where Walter goes to tell Phyllis he's leaving. We see their fear, deceit, distrust, anxiety, and pain all come to the surface and explode in what is the ultimate solution in every noir predicament: gunfire. It's difficult in some respects to talk about this movie, because it is so tightly plotted. Unlike many noir masterpieces, like Out of the Past, for example, all the complex plot points tie together into a cohesive whole. I'm tempted to want to summarize those points, to show why Phyllis and Walter became so frightened, but watching their schemes come undone a point at a time is what creates this movie's tension, and it's something that should be experienced, not analyzed.I should close with a footnote about Barbara Stanwyck. She wears a wig throughout this picture that some think looks terrible. Billy Wilder himself said it looked terrible. Some people think she didn't have the looks to pull off a role as an alluring, manipulative femme fatale. She sold me. To take another quote from a completely different context: she had me at hello. I had no problem believing that men would kill for this woman.If you're reading this and have never seen Double Indemnity, see it and marvel at its many superiorities to movies of today. It is a masterpiece, and a solid 9 out of 10.",

A lot of film techniques and plot devices have been used (poorly many times) in every movie seen. So the plot twists were not a huge surprise and the deviousness of the situations is not as shocking as it would have been if I grew up in that error. But besides all of that anyone can tell this is an outstanding movie and anyone that appreciates good dialog will love this movie. This movies has some of the quickest and sharp dialog that I have ever heard and was delivered in a way one just does not see anymore. I watched this with my room mate and he commented on how he would never kill for this girl, but I think an idea like that is lost through the ages and he cannot feel the electric draw of Phyllis's character as much as we might have if we grew up in a different generation. Besides that we have a performance with so many nuances that it is hard to catch them all. I think one of my favorite aspects of the character the female lead is she was able to outwit a very smooth talking salesmen who outwits people for a living with a blink of the eye at the very beginning with the dialog about speeding. If that does indicate that she is dangerous than I don't know does. But it is so quick that one may not realize that is the biggest clue that she can outwit all of them. The best part about Walter's character is that he is able to kill her at the end without a blink of the eye and he turns out to be just as evil as her in a way. As she opens up her heart to him he just shoots her. It is brilliant. No one gets the girl and there is not happy ending, but it is very satisfying to watch. The thing I would like to say about the director is that this is probably the best paced movie I have ever seen. It is extremely quick and only lets you breathe for a second and that is only when Walter gets to breathe. Consider there is so little action and it is mostly dialog this is quite a feat to pace it so well. I am glad I have seen this movie and would enjoy multiple viewings.

Always keeping his mask, doing exactly what was needed all the way to keep suspicion out of his way. I know I would never have suspected Walter, the man who light matches with nothing but his fingers.But then you have Keyes. The genius with the incredible eye for details. Walter had him fooled for quite some time, but Keyes got closer and closer, and it was just a matter of time before it would all fall apart. And so it did.I won't spoil any more of this of the story, all I can say is that this is film-noir good as anything; it has the atmosphere, the characters, the thrill and so many clever twists in an excellent story. It is exciting, cool, smart and it doesn't let you go before the end. This leaves you wanting more at the end. (And when you do, try \"The Apartment\" with Fred MacMurray as the villain.

            "content": "There are discontinuities in quality, yet DOUBLE \u0085 is fundamentally even, homogeneous\u0097music, photography, performances. Some scenes (between MacMurray and Stanwyck) are bad; but the film's defining quality remains. By its mere and physical beauty, by its atmosphere, music, cast, cinematography, DOUBLE \u0085 belongs naturally to any top 10 of _noirs. Some scenes could have been better written, and better played. But the sardonic, hallucinatory presentation of evil and decomposing, the caustic, merciless look at the emptiness, are marvelously served by Wilder's talent. Wilder's means are inferior to those of Hitchcock or the great cruel Italians or Bu\u00f1uel; yet they are considerable nonetheless and there is something deeply satisfying in his best movies. He was not an author; but he was better than most of the other Hollywoodian craftsmen. DOUBLE \u0085 is trash turned into a small but imposing work of art. It has energy, drive, atmosphere; it lacks finesse; it is conventional and exhibits an impersonal ready\u0097made cheap fatalism. The characters are unlikable\u0097except for Robinson's ,which is more interesting and even intriguing, and original, than likable. Yesterday I was curious if DOUBLE \u0085,a thriller of the quadruple interest of being a MacMurray, a Stanwyck, a Robinson movie, and a film by Wilder, can also be seen as a love movie, as the film of a passion. DOUBLE \u0085 is a hallmark example of style over content. It is able to show more than it really has what. There are good scenes\u0097those not directly involving the MacMurray/Stanwyck couple as a lovers couple. The heinousness of the murder is Shakespeareian, in the sense that most things of worth are spontaneously Shakespeareian. MacMurray is as good as Mrs. Stanwyck\u0097i.e., very. Robinson is the best\u0097but then again, he was one of the best ever. The attraction supposedly torrid scenes do not work (in the sense that Nicholson made his scenes with Mrs. Lange work indeed). The two actors play, or seem to play other things that those in the script. When I have first seen DOUBLE \u0085,I was mainly impressed with its brutal content, the gloomy unnerving world, the fatalism and hopelessness ,the savageness of the events and the schematic nature of the psychologies\u0097the quality of the portrayal of evil; and also with the unusually good performances. Seen for a second time, DOUBLE \u0085 showed the clumsiness and impropriety of some scenes, its failure as a love movie, the lack of passion\u0097in a word, the multiple flaws. (The films IS, succeeds in being what it sets itself up to be. My objection is with the trend, the general notion of the _noirs.) On the other hand, and in a strange keeping with these\u0097the artistry, the visual qualities\u0097the wonderfully somber score. There is a touch of surreal weirdness\u0097on a par with the feverish, hallucinatory nature of MacMurray's report. The small (as dimensions and as length of the role as well) Robinson\u0097a larger than life actor. His role is a small jewel. DOUBLE \u0085 is also hugely atmospheric and suspenseful, and, seen as artistry, extremely palatable. Mrs. Stanwyck was too good for her role. (Her role is comparatively poorly written.)The world-view of all such _noirs, with their overstated popular fatalism and proletarian moralist drives and anger, is schematic and phony. They cherish a poor notion of the life and human relation\u0097undoubtedly covered in reality, but not humanly relevant. This deprives the artistic representation of a true style, poetry and elegance. In the best hands (Rudolph Mat\u00e9), this world-view is only a pretext. The fatalism can be disguised, or even downplayed or replaced my more relevant contents (such as in Welles' movies). The noir plays on this ambivalence :of being simultaneously a highly stylized (visually, psychologically) genre, highly artificial, and also of pretending to disclose the truest face of the reality and life. Its lack of axiology, in human terms, it's his most serious flaw. It pretends that there is nothing in life beside the facts shown. Or, this is patently untrue. It is a form of naturalism, nihilism, materialism and expressionism. It excludes frontally the meanings of the life. It bows down, though it pretends the contrary, to some hideous divinities of the fate. The sardonic and somehow amused, clinical and cynical featuring of the evil in DOUBLE \u0085 is less convincing than the one displayed by Hitchcock\u0097and surely inferior to the varieties seen in some Italian films. Here in DOUBLE \u0085 the evil is finally conventional and indicative of a somewhat provincial understanding. This is the main issue with these movies\u0097the rudimentary and bestial psychology, the fundamentally uninteresting characters. They are not only schematic\u0097they are also deliberately base and low, frightfully insipid. Their failure is given into their very notion. They are as simple and narrow as requested by the script. The _noirs indulge in a world-view that restricts the possibilities. They remain genre flicks.",

            "content": "Double Indemnity is quite possibly my favorite film noir, although Strangers on a Train and The Maltese Falcon are both up there. Double Indemnity stars Fred MacMurray as Walter Neff, an insurance salesman who partners up with Phyllis Dietrichson, a wife who wants to murder her husband and make some money while she's at it. Phyllis is played masterfully by Barbara Stanwyck, who rightfully earned an academy award nomination for the role. The film's script is air tight and to the point, clocking in at about 111 minutes. It was directed by the great Billy Wilder, and written by both Wilder and Raymond Chandler. The movie is narrated to us by Neff, who is confessing the events of the film to a tape recorder, which he plans for a friend to find.\nSPOILERS START HERE\nThis film is perfect. It's perfectly written, directed, acted, and scored. What more could you want? The main motivation behind Neff's actions in the film is simple. He loves Phyllis, and he thinks he knows enough about his business to get away with it. But, as is illustrated to us by basically every Alfred Hitchcock film, no murder is perfect. The dynamic between Neff, and the man who eventually catches him Barton Keyes, a particularly talented insurance claim investigator played by Edward G. Robinson, is fascinating. Their mentor-and-apprentice relationship makes it all the more heartbreaking when Neff is eventually caught. But, like I said, the film is about Walter and Phyllis. As the film goes by, we eventually realize that Phyllis is more than just the battered wife that she seems. Phyllis' character completely changes once Neff has murdered her husband for her. We actually get to see the moment her facade lets up. Interestingly, in this murder movie, we don't see the murder. Wilder instead chooses to focus on a part of the film that's more important than the murder that drives it. While Neff is breaking Mr. Dietrichson's neck, all we see is a close up of Phyllis' face, and how it changes from clear worry, to a devilish smirk once she hears the neck snap. She knows that her manipulation has prevailed, and that Neff has no way out of her web now that he's done the dirty work. Post murder, the movie takes place almost entirely in the background. Character's start to trust each other less and less, until eventually they start plotting against each other and into their graves. During tense scenes, the shots are blocked so that we always see every character and how they're reacting, even if they don't necessarily see each other, which is a masterwork on Wilder's part. It allows us to truly experience the tenseness of these scenes without them being influenced by a single character's point of view. The only other directors I've seen use blocking this well are Akira Kurosawa and John Carpenter. Well, it's getting late (it's 1:18 am) and I have to start my next movie soon, so that's all.",

Thinking that he could get away with it because he knows all the tricks in the book he devised a special plan for an insurance scam. Blinded by love he implicated himself in many ways to make the plan work. And he also became quite greedy as he aimed for the \"double indemnity clause\" to extract the most money possible. But in the end it all came to shambles as he realized that Mr. Keyes was far more clever (and perceptive) than he initially assumed. It didn't help much that his accomplice wasn't quite the person that he thought she was. As the movie progresses towards the finale his relationship with Phyllis is starting to corrode. What I found interesting was the way in which the movie was shot. The movie starts out with Walter rushing into Mr. Keyes office to record a voice memo. He seemed visibly distraught and appeared to be bleeding out of a gunshot wound in his left shoulder. This hasty beginning automatically arouses the interest of the viewer. What happened?; we find ourselves asking. And as Walter begins to record the voice memo we get to see the story as he recollects it. Throughout the movie he's narrating his own actions by means of that voice memo and as the story ends we finally arrive at the present moment; the story comes full circle so to speak. Storytelling-wise that's really clever.I also really enjoyed the dialogues in the first half of the movie. They were very witty and had character.

Sunset Boulevard (1950); Stalag 17 (1953); Some Like It Hot (1959); The Apartment (1960) come to mind. Note the range: a psychological mystery, a prisoners of war movie, a comedy with song and dance, and a \"sophisticated\" comedy. He could make any kind of film. He had a knack for getting the best out of the players and he never forgot his audience.Double Indemnity is no exception. Fred MacMurray stars as Walter Neff, a morally-compromised insurance salesman who just couldn't resist the opportunity to outsmart the insurance business, and he was never better. Most people remember him from more light-hearted fare, e.g., The Shaggy Dog (1959); The Absent-Minded Professor (1961); and perhaps especially The Egg and I (1947) with Claudette Colbert. Barbara Stanwyck, whose career spanned six decades, was also excellent as the sociopathic Phyllis Dietrickson. Edward G. Robinson, who practically defined the Hollywood gangster from the thirties and forties, switches type and does an outstanding job as Barton Keyes, a sleuthful insurance claims manager.The script was adapted from James M. Cain's second novel, a follow-up to his enormously successful The Postman Always Rings Twice (1934). That too was made into a movie, in fact two movies, but neither one was anywhere near as good as this classic film noir. Wilder employs the convention of the voice-over (something he would use again very successfully in Sunset Boulevard) by having Walter Neff (\"Walter Huff\" in the novel) tell the story into a Dictaphone as a confessional memo addressed to his admired pal and mentor Keyes. He didn't get the girl and he didn't get the money, he says. Strange but we can see he didn't really want the girl or the money. What he wanted was the admiration of Keyes. At any rate that's the way Wilder played it, and it worked big time. If you read the book you'll discover that Wilder (along with Raymond Chandler, who co-wrote the script) changed a number of things from the way Cain had them, especially the ending--all to the better. In fact the movie is significantly better than the novel, which isn't usually the case.One of the things I was thinking while watching this was that it was actually as \"perfect\" a murder scheme as you'll see on the silver screen, although everything had to go just right. There was only one flaw, as Wilder saw it. He has Edward G. Robinson express it something like this: When a man buys an accidental death insurance policy and then dies an accidental death a few short weeks later, it ain't no accident.Don't miss this one, one of the all-time best film noir and a jewel in the crown of Billy Wilder, one of filmland's greatest directors. Would that we had another like him.",

Robinson, so often the tough guy gangster, is a highly decent man and insurance investigator; and the heroine of so many other good movies, Barbara Stanwyck, is the victim's wife and a frightening femme fatale.So, no matter what one may think of the plot (and reading some of the more negative reviews here, some think it to be pretty ludicrous), the actors totally sell it. I suspended my disbelief almost in spite of myself, because I believed that MacMurray really was wrapped around scary Stanwyck's little finger, but cheered on Robinson finally to uncover the truth.

However, Billy Wilder's \"Double Indemnity\" trumps all other entries in the genre, even the great ones like \"The Maltese Falcon\" and \"M\". Based on James M. Cain's novel, the story follows insurance salesman Walter Neff (Fred MacMurray), who enters his office one night bleeding from a bullet wound. Neff dictates his confession to his boss and friend Barton Keyes (Edward G. Robinson). He describes his first encounter with Phyllis Dietrichson (Barbara Stanwyck), who convinces him to help her murder her husband for his life insurance. The inquisitive Keyes, however, is not ready to call Mr. Dietrichson's death accidental just yet, and soon enough Neff and Phyllis turn against each other, culminating in an unforgettable finish. The script is full of dialogue that is delivered in a humorous way (like Keyes's speech about suicide) by talented actors-the three leads are all terrific. MacMurray is the austere antihero present in just about all film noirs, but it's Stanwyck and Robinson that make the acting in this stand apart. As Phyllis, she starts off with an almost childlike innocence, but by the end has proved herself to be one of the most reprehensible of all characters in cinema history. Robinson provides comic relief as Keyes, but at the same time delivers several dramatic speeches. Billy Wilder does a terrific job with his direction, creating a milieu of darkness, the quintessential setting for a film noir. The murder scene in the car and the first encounter between Neff and Phyllis in Neff's apartment are two of the most conspicuous examples of Wilder's manipulation of light and darkness to engender the aforementioned ambiance.

            "content": "Double Indemnity is a crime thriller with director Billy Wilder, actor Fred MacMurray, and actress Barbara Stanwyck on the top of their games. This 1944 picture is one of the earlier film-noir films. It has all the elements: a weak man who succumbs to something bad, interesting lighting techniques/camera angles, and strong, villainous female characters. Interestingly enough, Wilder said he did not realize he was making a noir film when it was in production but rather making a film he would want to see. Timing just worked out perfectly. This is a great, tense thriller that is one of the best. Each character is fleshed out and has some dynamic lines of dialogue. The screenplay, written by Wilder and Raymond Chandler, contains vivacious dialogue and interesting situations. I note that I love how the writers focus on the relationship between the main character, Walter Neff and his insurance agent buddy, Walter Keyes. They have a surrogate father-son relationship that elicited genuine emotion and made the ending even stronger.This movie was adapted from a James M. Cain (also wrote The Postman Always Rings Twice) novella. Cain got his book idea from a 1927 murder where a Queens married wife murdered her husband with the help of her boyfriend thanks to an indemnity clause. Yes, this is real stuff. The image of the wife being executed by electric chair is one of the most recognized images of the 1920's. In the 1930's, many studios bid hard for the rights. Being the time period it is, films had to go through the Hays Code and Joseph Breen warned studios about \"the sordid material\" and the bid fell apart. (If only Breen could see what is made in today's filmmaking LOL). Eight years later, a Paramount executive felt the material was right for Wilder's talent. They went about securing the rights despite some pushback from the people who work with the Hays Code. Eventually, Wilder won out and made some minor changes to placate the office.Now with the rights securely in hand, then it became the matter of creating a screenplay. Cain was Wilder's first choice, but was busy with another project. One of the film's producers, Joseph Sistrom, recommended Raymond Chandler who is the brilliant mind behind The Big Sleep. With the constant fighting between Chandler and Wilder, I am not sure how a screenplay (and a good one that is) got made. Chandler had not one lick on how to construct a screenplay, would always show up drunk or smoking cigars, and never really had a good attitude. But could the man ever write dialogue! The two men, despite their fighting, were able to work together and make something mundane as insurance and clauses interesting. Just needed to add murder!In addition to the excellent screenplay, the film has excellent camerawork from John F. Seitz. He experimented with camera angles and the way he lit scenes enhanced the mood of the story. The score is likewise very good. It was composed by Miklos Rosza. The head composer at the studio did not like his score but everyone else thought it was fantastic....myself included a good eighty years later. Rosza would go on to have an excellent career scoring movies.Walter Neff (Fred MacMurray) is an experienced insurance salesman. In one unforgettable scene, he meets Phyllis Dietrichson (Barbara Stanwyck) who is the seductive wife of one of his clients. He wants to keep seeing her, so she proposes that she murder her husband based on their accident insurance policy and Walter takes it one step further by suggesting a double indemnity clause. After her husband is found dead on the train tracks, the police accepted the death as an accident. Walter's best friend and insurance agent, Barton Keyes (Edward G. Robinson) suspects otherwise. He believes that Phyllis murdered him...with the help of another man.The performances were excellent all around. Fred MacMurray was known as the good guy in comedies, so he was playing against type. He was reluctant at first to accept the role because he personally thought he was a bad actor, so what a surprise it was to him when he realized he did have acting chops. I thought he was fantastic and his performance succumbing to sin and greed is believable. I thought his character had great chemistry with Edward G. Robinson who was transforming himself into a character actor at this point in his career. I really enjoyed how Robinson is able to piece the case together, clue by clue. Barbara Stanwyck and her fake wig also delivered the goods. She likewise was reluctant to accept the role at first, but she made her contemptible character really fun to watch.For Billy Wilder's third film as director, he carried the film with such grace. Only Wilder himself could have gotten away with some of the things he showed on screen. As one of the early film noirs, Double Indemnity is a must watch...even if you do not know anything about insurance. There are scenes that literally made me jump or gasp...like I did in that apartment scene. The use of voiceover is fantastic and was a device that worked so well, Wilder used it in future films. The story itself is engaging, the dialogue was sharp, and the performances were genuine. Cain liked this movie so much and said it is the only film adapted from his novels that he liked. And the ending is unforgettable. For any fan of cinema, this is a must-watch.My Grade: A.",

Talk about great acting and entertaining story-line - Billy Wilder was on the road to Hollywood greatness before making his Academy Award-winning The Lost Weekend (1945) a year later. Although the film was based on a novel, the film is told in flashbacks as a salesman falls for a mistress for which he becomes involved with murdering her husband and pretend if it he was killed in an accident. Barbara Stanwyck makes quite a beautiful impression while Fred MacMurray brilliantly portrays in a main dramatic role and Edward G. Robinson also joins in the mystery. There is lot of neatly-crafted camera-work and a memorable musical score to make it enough to be an instant masterpiece of the genre, and cannot ever forget to mention great mystery writer Raymond Chandler co-wrote the screenplay with Wilder as well. In other words overall, this is my new most favorite effort from Wilder after seeing some of his well-known works for over a decade now.My Rating: 5/5",

As a film student, I've heard the term thrown around before but, with the exception of the film L.A. Confidential, I haven't had very much exposure to the genre. Based on my first viewing of Double Indemnity, it definitely seems like a genre that I would like to get more familiar with.The most intriguing part of Double Indemnity was the way that it gently toyed with the audience by giving them a satisfying but original non-Hollywood style ending. Based on Hollywood films of today, it's pretty easy to see how Double Indemnity would be remade today. Walter and Phyllis would steal the money, end up together, and the final shot of the film would probably be them sipping margaritas as they talk about how they fooled the world (a'la Swordfish or Wild Things).If Hollywood were to do a remake of this film noir classic, I'd be willing to bet it would be a bastardized version as they have done so many times before. Remember the Casablanca inspired Barb Wire? Sadly, I do.Thankfully, there is no bastardization of the novel that accrues in this adaptation. There is no happy ending for anyone. Walter Ness sealed his fate the moment he agreed to help Phyllis with her deceptive con. This is a story of without heroes and without villains, everyone has faults and everyone has flaws. I say bravo to Billy Wilder for creating a film that stands with test of time with characters that are something unlike anything in films today.

Where Lang was a man getting out of a visual world to enter another one with similar visual effects, but used in a totally different way (and there lies Lang's difficulties to enter the new world) Billy Wilder was born cinematically in the context of the noir game, was one of the best in it, and made the best film in this first phase, to me. This is his first noir (only his fourth film). You can see where he is going, and to watch this is important if not else, to understand the roots of 'Sunset Blvd.', a masterpiece of cinematic storytelling.So, a common device is the narration where the main character around whom and on the back of whom the whole story develops, narrates the whole thing (in 'sunset...' we assumed we were hearing a dead man, here he tapes his own voice, before dying). That's good, it's effective in two ways. -First it tells us where the story ends, we know that somehow, something will happen to let the character as we see him at the beginning of the film and it limits the narrative in two points. The images we first get of the character after all happens, and the the first moment of the flashback he narrates. -Also it definitely tells us who the narrator is; we Know that everything we will see is from the eyes and point of view of Neff, and specially, what we don't see he also hasn't seen.The rest is common noir game, several characters fighting for power over the action, Neff, the blond 'femme', Zachetti; one woman who is a puppet to every puppeteer, Lola, and a 'detective' who in this case is not the center of the story, instead tries to figure things we, audience, already know, and serves as an obstacle to Neff (Robinson's character).It fails in some points. I think Stanwyck doesn't have the required magnetism, and even more when she shares the screen with the marvellous Jean Heather, who poses and acts in far more interesting ways. Her character could have been explored with much more depth, she is Lola(ita!). I suppose the codes and censorship wouldn't have allowed for something really interesting to be made with her character. Zachetti is supposed to be an unimportant character who turns out to be crucial. But the fact is he doesn't matter. And the conclusion to the game is weak because it is Neff who chooses his destiny, not the other way around... HE might simply had turn his back and get away with it if it wasn't for conscience problems. He should have ended tied up but the fate which moved him all along.My opinion: 3/5 http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com",

He grows wiser around the second culmination when he realizes he's made a mistake, however, his growth isn't deep enough for lasting change as shown when he tries to flee to Mexico. Another evidence that leads us to believe it's a Tragedy is that he never actually accomplishes his objectives. \"I didn't get the money and I didn't get the woman.\" He ultimately loses the fight and has minimal growth. Walter Neff is the main character because we experience the movie through him. It is his story and we are curious and sympathetic with him before anybody else. We gain a negative empathy toward him and am satisfied he doesn't get away in the end.The camera was used as narrator effectively when Mr. Neff and Phyllis first meet. We see Phyllis from Mr. Neff's point of view (first person) and it makes us feel sort of voyeuristic and we enjoy that cause she's in a towel. A fantastic use of a psychological gesture was when Keyes searches for his cigar light after coming to some sort of conclusion about the case. It clues us in to his state of mind which is befuddled by the case. He does this multiple times, allowing for the planting and payoff of Neff offering a light.The first planting is the silhouette of a man limping on crutches during the opening credits. That shadow is paid off multiple times but the limping figure is paid off most powerfully when he is limping to the observation car on the train. The second planting is Neff's words \"straight down the line\", those words are paid off when Phyllis repeats them to him at the 2nd culmination. The third planting is when Neff lights Keyes cigar and says the words \"I love you too.\" That planting is paid off in the 3rd act when Keyes responds saying \"closer then you think\" and again when Keyes lights Neff's cigarette for the last time.Omniscient Point of View was effectively used when Phyllis shows up at Neff's door while Keyes is inside. We know she is hiding but Neff and Keyes don't know that right away. Neff finds out but Keyes never does. We feel suspense when Keyes, who is standing at the elevator, changes direction and goes toward the door.Lola Deitrichson is a subplot character. She has an arc and acted as a catalyst for Walter to question the motives of Phyllis. The Janitor is an example of a one-string character. He has no arc.The \"Point of Attack\" or \"catalyst\" to the story is when Walter Neff decides to check up on an auto insurance renewal at the Deitrichson home. Had he not stopped by, he never would have met Phyllis, and the story would have never happened. The First Act comes to an end as Phyllis leaves Neff's apartment repeating his words \"straight down the line.\" and then slides into the 2nd act with Neff's words \"the machine was now in motion\". The main tension is fully in force when they officially join together to bring down Mr. Deitrichson. The 1st Culmination happens when Neff and Phyllis dump Deitrichson's body on the tracks. Although not complete, they have achieved the outer arc in a big way. It seems as though they will get away with it. The 2nd Culmination happens in the Grocery store. Neff knows they can't get away with it and he wants them both to back out. Phyllis refuses and insists that they stay with it using the payoff \"straight down the line.\" Billy Wilder gets us to suspend disbelief at the beginning of the film by showing a large silhouette of a man limping on crutches. We immediately become curious about who it is and why is he limping.Wilder leads us to further curiosity through an erratic car and a hunched over man going up the elevator with his back to the audience. We gain some sympathy when we see he had been shot but that sympathy became negative when he decided murder was an acceptable means to obtaining money and women. We gain negative empathy when Walter decided fleeing to Mexico was his best choice instead of facing the consequences of his murders. The filmmaker gets us to hope that Walter and Phyllis would sever their relationship early and fear that they would actually follow through with their plan.The tension increases when Keyes began to listen to his 'little man inside' and also when the \"Man from Oregon\" was on the observation deck. The tension is challenged when Lola is introduced. Neff doesn't like thinking about them cause it makes his task more difficult. Finally Neff's arc was completed at the end of the film and we walk away satisfied that good triumphed over evil. Even though Neff had temptations that any of us could have succumb to, we leave feeling good that he didn't get away with it.",

            "content": "With overtones of moral failure that almost make you remorse on behalf of the protagonist, undertones of lust, crackling dialogue that's as cynical as it's extremely classy and sharp-witted, a grim atmosphere of impending doom created by the stunning black-and-white photography, it's safe to say that my first Billy Wilder has all the trademarks of film-noir.That said, I wouldn't be wrong in saying that this film is kinda subversive; only on its own terms. In saying that, I mean that the jaw-dropping nuances Wilder has sizzled this film with, and the painstaking attention to details gave Double Indemnity unique taste, and made it stand out from all the films of its kind. Giving away the plot synopsis usually tarnishes the experience of watching your typical film noir because the toughness of them are their small details, let alone doing so with this one in addition to explaining why I find the subtlety of it so mesmerizing. Watch Double Indemnity and you'll know what I mean straight away!Alas, It seems that this very meticulous attention to detail came at the expense of making the most important the most crucial moments and the turning points convincing. The academic nature of the film's plotting made a lot of decisive moments a bit hard to swallow. It also made the movie drag, surprisingly, at what should have been the most intriguing part.All the performances here are fine, but it's Edward G. Robinson who steals the show for me. He plays the quick-witted, determined investigator, Barton Keyes, who may be a bit too smart and clever to be believable; but thanks to Robinson's fierce performance, Keyes hands down is my favorite character in the movie.Double Indemnity is an extremely well-crafted moody crime film that transcends the nature of its plotting with an unprecedented, unmatched, unsurpassable subtlety that made the main characters lifelike, and made the story thought-provoking in the first place. It raised the bar and set the standard for film-noir making at its time, and continues to inspire every neo-noir film, nay every crime film to this day.(8.5/10)",

            "content": "I don't understand the high average rating on IMDB for this film.This was my 2nd film viewing after many years, and I have the same impression.As much as I love classics and many of Wilder's films, this one was dull and predictable.Here's my breakdown:STORY:\nOK. Insurance fraud is not an exciting topic. So you throw in some adultery and murder and it's supposed to spice it up.Then you add a hard-nosed, bloodhound of a claims investigator and now you have a more complex conflict.Yes, but no. There are two major problems with this story:1. MacMurray narrates the film as it goes along with intermittent pauses to catch his breath, and give us a break.Narration stories, especially those looking back, are largely poor excuses for a weak script IMHO. Even so, the\nscript here just feels choppy, unimaginative, and like an ongoing drone of a cheap electrical motor.2. There are no characters to cheer for, no heroes, no saving grace, no moral stance, no humanity. I suppose\none is to \"like\" Robinson in his role, but he's doing nothing to warrant any enthusiasm or hero-like qualities.You can't have a film rife with villains, stiff characters, terse lines and expect it to hold interest.ACTING:\nMacMurray and Stanwyck are not what I'd call particularly good actors. Yes, MacMurray was fine in \"The Caine Mutiny,\"\n\"The Apartment,\" \"The Absent Minded Professor.\" After which he ends up doing mostly TV. Stanwyck has always just\nbeen way too stiff.Robinson was just being himself, and I found his character the most interesting of any. And, I think that's my point.MacMurray is not on par with Robinson's skill, so there's a mismatch in strength of character. Stanwyck just acts\nthe seductive \"dame.\"The ancillary characters were just flat and dull. Sorry, just a dull casting for a dull story.TEMPO:\nLike listening to the same song for almost two hoursCINEMATOGRAPHY:\nYes, I know this is classified as noir, but it was too dark, unnecessarily dark.DIRECTING / WRITING:\nAs I said at the outset, I generally like Wilder's work, but not here. In fact I'd say this is not in league with most of his work.It may be unfair, but I'll place the blame on the co-writer Chandler. I've only liked one of his feature films \"Strangers on a Train\"\n(directed by the master himself), but afterward he's almost solely writing for TV. That tells me he wanted his work more formulaic.Is it a good film? In its own right it's fine, but I've come to expect more from Wilder.Should you watch this once? Maybe, if you're really into noir.Rating: 7.0.",

            "content": "Perhaps the single best example of a film noir movie, Double Indemnity (1944), stars Fred MacMurray, Barbara Stanwyck, and Edward G. Robinson. Based on a novel written by James Cain, the screenplay was co-written by Billy Wilder and the amazing Raymond Chandler.Set in 1938 California, the story is based on the true-life 1927 murder of a married Queens, New York woman's husband who was killed by the woman's boyfriend after she took out a large insurance policy that contained a double-indemnity clause. In this movie, Phyllis Dietrichson (played by Stanwyck) takes out a life insurance policy on her husband with the help of insurance salesman-soon-to-be-turned-murderer Walter Neff (played by MacMurray). Robinson plays Barton Keyes, Neff's co-worker and a very suspicious claims adjuster who suspects Phyllis Dietrichson might have had something to do with her husband's sudden death.This movie is an hour and forty-seven minutes of pure movie love. The film was nominated for seven Academy Awards {Best Picture, Best Actress in a Leading Role (Barbara Stanwyck), Best Director, Best Writing-Screenplay, Best Cinematography, Best Sound Recording, and Best Music (Scoring of a Dramatic or Comedy Picture)}, though it won none.",

            "content": "To be honest, it's hard to know what to say about this film. It's been copied relentlessly, but it's hardly any less powerful for it. Like all the best Hollywood movies of this period, it goes down like milk and whiskey, sweet and smooth, deceptively intoxicating.The dialogue sparkles but never too much. The camera work and direction is flawless without ever once drawing attention away from the characters. Don't expect Hitchcockian symbolism or hints at fathomless intellectual depths, but the darkness that inhabits the characters is depicted in a few remarkably imaginative, yet vivid and immediate (stomach-turning, even) moments stomach-turning moments.Wilder, his crew and the script-writers don't so much capture the enduring essence of Noir, as define it with unparalleled clarity. You are vicariously experiencing the greed, the violence, and ultimately the self-inflicted, self-gratifying terror and shame. In this version of Noir, it's a temporary state of mind, but the consequences are permanent and inescapable. Yet this is no 'crime-doesn't pay' morality tale'. The morality is so twisted by the end that it may not be immediately apparent to a modern viewer just how far gone the characters are. Tally up the moral score at a later date and you might be shocked just how dark a vision of humanity Hollywood was selling. There's no doubt in my mind that this echoed with a public that had been repeatedly shocked by war, degraded and desensitized. Having said that, there seems to be a small distinction drawn between crime of passion and cold blooded murder.If there is a problem for the modern viewer it's probably that it's not all that easy to take George MacMurray seriously, but you probably will by the end.",

            "review_title": "A perfect film with great, snappy dialogue (Mild Spoilers)",
            "content": "(NOTE: This review has mild spoilers, it doesn't spoiler everything, but I would possibly recommend watching the film first). I was left completely speechless. From the opening shot to the absolutely genius ending shot, this film drew me in. The film begins with Walter Neff (Fred MacMurray), an insurance salesman who returns to his office building one night and begins to record a message for a colleague at his work, Barton Keyes (Edward G. Robinson). All we know from the start is that Walter has committed murder, we have no access to other details which gives the film a perfect setup to make the viewer be extremely curious as to what is going on. Afterwards, it begins to be told in flashback as Walter records his message which allows for narration that does not feel forced because well, he's recording a message. Right off the bat, I noticed how great the fast, snappy dialogue was as Walter meets and begins a conversation with Phyllis Dietrichson (Barbara Stanwyck). This fast dialogue is a huge advantage to the film because not only does it allow for smartly written lines and a well-paced film, it even allows for the occasional moment of comic relief because it never feels out of place. Walter and Phyllis eventually seem to like each other even though Phyllis is married, she hates her husband, he's always drunk, never talks to her, and sometimes even beats her. Walter is there to talk insurance but Phyllis' husband is not there, Walter decides to take the opportunity to flirt with Phyllis. She brushes him off at first but eventually meets him at his home. This meeting at Walter's home leads to the two deciding to kill Phyllis' husband and using the double indemnity clause for insurance to allow Phyllis' to get $100,000 rather than $50,000 by making it seem Walter's death was an accident. This is all only in maybe the first twenty minutes which displays how ingenious the film's dialogue is, it allows for a lot to get done in a short amount of time. The performances by the two leads are incredible, you can always see in the two leads eyes that something isn't right. Phyllis has a cold, sinister look in her eyes throughout. Walter has a look of confidence but eventual worry as the murder plays out. Easily one of the best aspects of the film is the amazing use of shadows which is a staple in the classic noir genre. Not only is it used as a piece of characterization, but it's used to give the film a beautiful, unique, stylistic look that could more than likely only be done in black and white. Throughout the film, Walter lights a match for Barton Keyes for his cigarettes and I was wondering throughout, \"Why would they keep on showing that?\" And on the final shot, I understood. It allowed for a genius parallel in what is probably one of my favorite final shots of a film ever due to its simplicity and use of said parallel. If anything, this is a definitive piece of cinema. Not only is it filled with some of the best twists in film with double crossing and smart writing, it is stuffed with genius camera work, perfect performances, and snappy dialogue that gives the film a unique touch and great pacing. Ultimately, this is a film that anyone who loves a good mystery should watch but most importantly, anybody who studies film, should give this one a watch. This is filmmaking perfection at it's finest.",

The insurer fell in love with the mistress and planned to help her kill her husband, and also helped her defraud double compensation. They made various certificates of absence, and hid their husbands in the car when they went out to kill them. The insurer then disguised as a broken leg husband and got on the train, and led the witnesses to jump. The two then moved the body to the jump position, flawlessly. It is a pity that the tracing started from above, and the supervisor of the insurer found the grotesque, thinking that the speed of 15 miles might not be lethal. At the same time, the naive stepdaughter of the female host also revealed to the insurer that her biological mother should have been brutally killed by the female host who was then a nurse. The boss pushed back all the way, and found that the hostess's stepdaughter's boyfriend and the hostess were in close contact. The insurer found out that he was just a chess piece. Both he and his stepdaughter 's boyfriend were just her tools. The hostess never loved him. The male host went to the female host's house to make it clear, but the female host fired the gun. The insurer finally killed the female host and intercepted the stepdaughter's boyfriend at the door, told him to leave, and called the stepdaughter away. The muddy water. Finally, the insurer dragged the body of the gun to the boss' office, intending to confess what he had done through the answering machine, and then the boss arrived. The insurer asked the boss to let him go, and said that he could escape to the border, but eventually fell at the door. The male owner silently lit a cigarette, waiting for the fate to come.The suspense of the story is repeated, the reasoning is meticulous, and the reverse reasoning is also pulling the cocoon and advancing layer by layer.

            "content": "Double indemnity is a Film Noir classic. Director Billy Wilder gives the film the classic Noir look, with dark shadows and a twisted murder plot. Whether it's the darkness of a house or a poorly lit street the scenes are given an attitude by the lighting that Wilder chose. Walter Neff, played by Fred MacMurray is pushed in the middle of a femme fatales' unscrupulous scheme.  Neff an insurance salesman is coaxed into a murder/fraud scheme by a beautiful woman. Neff gets lured into this plot of deceit because of an anklet that the femme fatale, Phyllis Dietrichson played by Barbara Stanwyck, wears throughout the film.  Stanwyck's performance is superb, she plays a cold-blooded woman with a mindset of taking what she believes belongs to her. Dietrichson is nonchalant, and methodical when it comes to her femme fatale characteristics. Neff and Dietrichson tend to light up the dark scenes with their lustful looks towards each other.  Lola, Phyllis' stepdaughter, on the other hand  is the complete opposite of the femme fatale. Jean Heather playing Lola does an excellent job of selling her character as an innocent and meek teenager wary of her stepmother's actions.  Edward G. Robinson plays Barton Keyes an insurance investigator with a `little man' that gives him clues to the status of a claim. Keyes is like a father figure to Neff and they spend much time together as Keyes throws his ideas of what happened around.This was a great film going to great lengths to please the viewer.  This Film not only leans towards the serious side but also has some comic relief mainly in the use of the word baby, and the endless search for one mans matches.  A great work of art Double Indemnity should be on everyone's list of movies to see soon. It will not only keep you wrapped up but also will keep you on the edge of your seat waiting for the next plot twist.",

            "content": "When I think of just what film-noir is, I think of love triangles, a femme-fa tale, dimly lit sets. lights and shadows, slick operators looking to score and finally, some desperate crime born of their lust and depravity. Double Indemnity contains all these elements and defines this genre better than any movie I've ever seen. I have to give this movie a 10 and not because I like giving perfect scores but because of the towering performances of three of the all time great actors of American film as well the masterful directing and writing of Billy Wilder. I've been a big Billy Wilder fan for some years now and I believe this is his masterpiece.Wilder directed and co-wrote (with Raymond Chandler) Double Indemnity, and worked hard to convince the two stars, Barbara Stanwyck and Fred McMurray to overcome their hesitancy and join him in this endeavor. Both didn't like the idea of playing these shady characters, but because they did we end up with possibly the best acting trio (along with Edward G. Robinson) ever in one film. Bold statement yes, but I'm talking about PERFECT casting here...straight down the line.Stanwyck plays Phyllis Dietrichson, she's married to an older man who she detests and one day a wise-cracking insurance salesman named Walter Neff (McMurray) comes to the door and they begin talking...or should I say flirting. This marvelous introductory scene is the essence of film-noir, filled with fast lines with double meanings and it really captivates us right from the start. Phyllis asks about accident insurance for her husband and the banter continues and then Neff leaves. He leaves, but hes hooked (as are we), and later Phyllis stops by his apartment and they get closer and start plotting. Wouldn't it be nice if they could knock off her hubby and split the insurance payout?What a premise; this is the ultimate film-noir plot setup. They start meeting secretly and planning, meanwhile Neff tries to keep his prying (and extremely perceptive) boss Keyes (Robinson) at arms length. Edward G. Robinson, playing against type as an all-consumed, almost anal claims investigator, gives a performance that is truly the foundation of this film. Stanwyck, to me is maybe the most talented all-around actress in Hollywood history and the extremely under-rated McMurray (also cast against type) displays an easy charm that covers up his building anxiety, and they are both fantastic, but Robinson absolutely shines as the insurance scam expert who claims the \"little man in my stomach\" won't let him rest easy. There's a brilliant scene where Keyes shoots down his bosses' idea of the crime being a suicide by quoting statistics from actuary tables and you'd think at the time he was in on the plot with Neff (of course we know he isn't) because he is so convincing and compelling. I really think its one of the greatest supporting performances ever in film.We get some of the little plot twists that we'd expect in a film-noir, as Walter and Phyllis decide whether they should even contact each other until the heat dies down. Walter at times seems to be coming completely unglued while Phyllis' cold, conniving exterior is hiding secrets she hasn't told anyone. The great fun in watching Double Indemnity is just watching these incredible stars do their thing. There aren't any shoot-outs or big explosions or effects like you see in todays films, instead there is the charisma of three extremely talented actors who absolutely radiate their skills in the hands of one the best directors in history.So sit back and enjoy a masterpiece of film. This is what movies used to be about when acting, writing and directing were often honed to perfection.BTW..If you like this film and want some other Wilder films try; The Lost Weekend (Ray Milland) or Stalag 17 or Sunset Blvd (William Holden) or The Apartment (Jack Lemmon)...These are all critically acclaimed and all of these except Stalag 17 are on the AFI Top 100 list....but (to me) Double Indemnity is the best of them all, enjoy.",

Barbara Stanwyck's Phylis also needs no explanation. She is an obvious conniving, tarty fake accentuated by her awful sleazy blonde wig. These two were made for each other.The witty, tight script pulls you in to their horrible, ridiculous murder plot and is so totally engrossing that you almost find yourself rooting for this couple. You almost start to hope that they'll get away with it and live happily ever after until you realise you're being as much manipulated as is the hapless Walter.

At that time, the DVD was still a reserved movie of a certain course and could only be lent for four hours.'the movie starts by telling the audience who the killer is,' he says. 'so it loses a lot of suspense.'Is double indemnity a suspense movie?How good is the mental change of the hero? How about a well-planned murder by an adulteress? How do two people get tied together and betray each other? There is a problem with the perfect murder. The biggest problem is that everything doesn't go according to plan 100% of the time. For example, there was a passenger at the back of the train... Refer to Hitchcock's \"Dial M for Murder\" to see how the perfect plan for Murder becomes imperfect. The employer forgot and killer to watch, buy fierce watch stopped, there is an old man in the phone booth to occupy the phone, the desk happens to have a pair of scissors... .Billy Wilder was certainly not Hitchcock. Although Hitchcock once said \"Since double indemnity, the two most important words in the movie are\" Billy Wilder.But Billy is Billy and Wilder is not the hitch. Plot film, the final show is human nature.Neff, 35, unmarried, insurance company salesman, outstanding performance, smart and steady, loved by the boss. One day in the California sun, breathing the scent of honeysuckle, into a spanish-style villa, met the hostess, Phyllis, everything changed. He forgot about car insurance and everything else except Phyllis, Phyllis' anklets, the smell of Phyllis.So neff helps Phyllis murder her husband, USES his expertise to devise and execute the perfect murder plan, and gets double compensation.Phyllis, came out in a towel; Then, while buttoning up the breast of the dress, one step at a time down the stairs, high-heeled slippers, ankle chains, all sensual and seductive.Do they love each other? Unknowingly. The two of them had sex. In that moment, everything had changed for neff. The two of them got on a through train to the tomb without stopping.When things go wrong, the two men turn against each other and betray each other, one with the intention of killing someone and the other with a gun hidden under the sofa.In my opinion, \"endless possibilities\" can be used to summarize the human nature in the movie. Who knows how many potential possibilities of human nature are there? Give a little catalyst, such as honeysuckle and anklet, and all is possible.The astute and sedate middle-class insurance company employee, effortlessly became a cold-blooded killer; Suddenly there is a chance to escape, and suddenly conscience decided not to blame others.The most surprising thing about Neff was Phyllis.This \"lady of beauty\", almost like a typical film noir \"femme fatale\", is unlucky for a man to get involved with her. The biggest characteristic of this kind of woman, of course, is beautiful in the first place. Another major characteristic is that no one loves, only love themselves; There is another major feature is a strong desire to fill the dissatisfaction.Phyllis has it all. She said to herself, \"I love nobody. I love myself.\" So for Phyllis, killing isn't her potential, it's her bloodlust. First she killed Mr. Dickinson's wife and made herself Mrs. Dickinson; More ready to murder her husband, earn insurance compensation; When neff appears to be changing, a revolver is wrapped in a silk handkerchief and waiting for her lover.Just -- -- -- -- -- -- --After the first shot, neff survived. The bullet hit neff in the shoulder because the room was too dark.Phyllis couldn't fire a second shot... . She said, \"I love no one but myself. I never loved you until a second ago when I couldn't fire a second shot... ..\"Phyllis had fallen in love with someone other than herself!That's the infinite possibilities.The heart is really moved, the game is lost. Neff took her pistol and shot her dead. She was surprised that Neff would kill her, especially after she confessed.Anything's possible, Phyllis, you don't know?",

            "content": "Double Indemnity is a smart movie for most part. I say for most part because it somehow assumes that the public does not know about fingerprint identification or the fact that strangulation leaves marks on a victims neck. The murder in this movie is handled rather poorly from a technical perspective. Everything else around it is sharp and interesting. The movie is smart on an emotional level more than on a technical level.The main character dictates the story into a recorder, explaining what happened before each scene. He also explains straight from the start that he kills someone. You would think that this spoils the plot and any tension, but it does not, as the narrator only gives a brief description.In fact, the movie become quite tense towards the second half. At the beginning you are shown the situation of the main character being wounded and all the way until the end of the film you have a but a faint idea of how it may have happened. The story is quite good at keeping you sucked in.There are a couple of very good acting jobs here and a couple not so good ones. There is a gentleman, Richard Gaines, who plays the head of the insurance company. You do not see him for long but he had a very strange delivery of lines. Among the more well known actors is Edward Robinson (Little Caesar, Key Largo) as the claims adjuster and it is a delight to watch this sharp observant character. Barbara Stanwyck is the next strongest character as the main dame of the film, while the main male character played by Fred MacMurray is probably one of the weakest, with his typical film-noir delivery and saying \"baby\" all the time (quickly as if the word accidentally falls out of his mouth, like he is a Tourette's patient).There is nothing particularly outstanding about the music or visuals, other than it is all competent. The movie is well paced; the tension is good and the writing is fine as long as you do not mind a little bit of 40s stylization, like when the lady stares up at the guy with teary eyes and the screen is blurry as the dramatic violins play. I am not a big fan of that, but there is no denying that Double Indemnity is one of the strongest femme fatale movies.",

I was struck in awe in particular when the line \"A: I wonder if I know what you mean. B: I wonder if you wonder.\" dropped.

But, for some reason the movie stayed with me. I could not get it out of my head. I kept thinking about certain scenes with sharper dialogue, I kept humming the fantastic score, I kept thinking of the heavy atmosphere and how scenes where made interesting with the use of blocking.The dialogue especially rang in my mind for days. The \"Next time I'll rent a tuxedo\" line, the overuse of the word \"baby\" from the two leads when they address each other.\nMost of the scenes with Edward G. Robinson were amazing, and his lines are straight to the point but they retain understated humour and wit. He is the hero of the film, the one with the clear moral compass and the only one working for justice, not merely for money, as opposed to Mr. Norton. He is incorruptible but not unfair.\nThen there is the way Fred MacMurray barks his lines. I loved it unironically. He has this old-school stoic delivery, which of course is how they did at the time, yet it plays into his character who is this corrupted leading man. His \"stoicism\" is why he cannot cope with crime and vice. He is too clean to be able to do the things he does and live with it. More than Phyllis' mind games, it is the conscience and guilt of Walter Neff that is his undoing.The score is one of its kind. It is iconic. It is loud and sinister; epic and tragic. The music has the quality of instinctively creating the ominous atmosphere of the movie. Without that score, the movie would not feel so dark. It is not a score that you would expect for a crime story. It is a style that you would rather associate with a Monster-movie or a horror film. It is also a nice way to introduce what Film Noir is: it is a detective story treated as horror film.The perfect example would be the hallway scene at Walter's place with Keyes and Phyllis hiding behind the door. The whole scene is three people in a hallway, but the suspense and thrill is real. The dialogue underlining the threat that Keyes is to the couple, and the physical manifestation of it. It gives you the text and the sub-text; the metaphor and the meaning.\nSimilarly the whole train sequence is built on the same mechanics. The movie establishes the whole set-up and gives you all the information ahead of time, but when it plays out it throws all sorts of problems at it. This creates tension throughout most of the second half of the film.And at the end that is the strength of the film. It tells this simple story effectively and is very competent in many things, which balances out the most dated elements.",

Starring Richard Crenna, reprising the Fred MacMurray role, Samantha Eggar replacing Barbara Stanwyck and Lee J. Cobb instead of Edward G. Robinson, it uses a shortened version of the Billy Wilder and Raymond Chandler screenplay to give us a 74 minute color edition of the 108 minute, black & white original. It would be interesting to take a group of university film students who have not seen either film and divide them up into two separate groups. Show half of them the original and the other group the TV version -- then have them each write their responses in a paper. Then let each group see the opposite version. It should make for a lively discussion. Why does the color in the TV version not work? Could color create the right mood? Does Miklos Rozsa's score have a positive impact on the original? The actors in the TV telling are speaking much of the same dialog found in the 1944 film -- why doesn't it have the same impact? What role does the director have in making the screenplay come to life? You get the idea. Comparing the two would bring home the point that it takes more then making a film by the numbers to come up with a memorable film experience. This special edition DVD is still a must own set!",

            "content": "Billy Wilder gave away the climax to his movies more than most directors. All it took was 2 or 3 minutes of Sunset Boulevard and Double Indemnity to know where the movies were going. Double Indemnity starts off with scummy insurance salesman Walter Neff (Fred MacMurray) racing to his office with a gunshot wound. Rather than leave town or get medical treatment, he is compelled to confess his crimes. Then we see why somebody would shoot this rather dull fellow. This framing device wasn't as common in 1944 as it is now, so kudos to Wilder for making it work so well.Maybe Neff doesn't just blow town because he's in love with his semi-genius co-worker Barton Keyes (Edward G. Robinson) and needs closure on that relationship. Okay, they're not in love sexually, but this is one of hundreds of great movies that---if you think about it---feature a bromance that overshadows any man/woman attachments. As outstanding as the outstanding Barbara Stanwyck is as the fatal femme fatale, the real story is the strong friendship betwixt Neff and Keyes.Wilder's story (co-written with Raymond Chandler, adapted from James Cain's novella) is luridly delicious. Neff meets married Phyllis Dietrichson (Stanwyck) on a visit to renew her husband's insurance policy. They decide to make sure her hubbie has an \"accident\" so they can make off with a big payday. Keyes, however, is smarter than the gullible cops and he won't let the case go. He doesn't KNOW that Mr. Dietrichson was murdered, but he's going to figure it out. Meanwhile, Walter and Phyllis don't trust each other.The American Film Institute loves Double Indemnity almost as much as I do, proving that by ranking it 38th in 1998 and then 29th in 2007 on their Top 100 lists. Not bad for \"The Insurance Movie\"! The AFI appreciates it as a thriller and as a love story too, even if it's hard to believe that Walter and Phyllis ever had any real feelings for one another. She's rotten to the core and he's too horny to notice until it's too late. It's pulp and it certainly isn't the most uplifting movie made during WWII, but I smile just thinking about how bad these people are.If you dug this snapshot review, check out the website I share with my wife (www.top100project.com) and go to the \"Podcasts\" section for our 36-minute Double Indemnity 'cast...and many others.

I thoroughly enjoyed this \"old\" classic! Fred Mcmurray & Edward G. Robinson both played very different roles for this era. They were superb! If you've never seen the movie, it is worth a viewing. If it's been awhile since you've seen it, see it again. For me, it was as though I had never seen it. I knew the stars and I knew the plot, but that's about all I remembered. I would really like to see what the movie would be like if it were remade 2008 style! This is a black and white movie. No color is really needed. The stars make it all happen.",

Robinson to protect the company from having to pay a double indemnity charge on the life of the deceased.The viewer will be able to follow the movie rather easily, but it is obvious that Robinson sniffs something suspicious, and is not going to let go of the matter without giving a serious effort t uncover the truth.  Eventually, the tensions mount to the climax, and the lovers are ultimately pitted against themselves in an effort to avoid the legal charges.This film did receive several nominations from the Academy Awards festival, including \"Best Picture\" and does remain a great example of suspense coupled with tension and mystery.  An easy 9/10, and a must see for fans of this genre.",

            "content": "James Cain's novella \"Double Indemnity\" was published in Liberty Magazine in February 1935. A few days later four major Hollywood studios contacted the author. MGM, Warners, Fox and Paramount all wanted to turn the yarn into a film. But there was a snag. The mighty Hays Office, which in practice decided what movies the companies could make, said no. The story was considered too grim.In the film a young, naive salesman is seduced by one of his clients' wives. Together they take out life insurance on her aging husband. Then they plan to kill the man to collect the indemnity.Eight years later, Paramount decided to try to film \"Double Indemnity\" again. Director Billy Wilder was asked to rewrite the material to appease the Hays Office. And together with author Raymond Chandler, the director set to work. But unfortunately problems immediately arose. Billy Wilder hated that Raymond Chandler constantly smoked his smelly old pipe in their small study. He also couldn't stand that the alcoholic writer drank large amounts of whiskey while working.If there were problems in the script department, things worked better in front of the cameras. Wilder managed to find three actors who gave some of their best performances in his movie. Barbara Stanwyck was the very prototype of a sleazy, film-noir femme fatale, Fred MacMurray, who usually did comedies, played patsy and Edward G Robinson stepped forward as a first-rate character actor.Sadly, the efforts by the actors couldn't save \"Double Indemnity\" at the box office. World War ll was raging, and cinema audiences preferred happier stories on the big screen. It would be many years before the film was reevaluated and given its rightful place among Billy Wilder's major works. But by then the director himself had moved on and made \"The Lost Weekend\". Ironically, a film about an alcoholic writer.",

            "content": "Now entrenched deeply in the echelons of cinema history, Double Indemnity is a Film Noir classic and a must see for any avid film enthusiast. Directed by Billy Wilder, who co wrote the screenplay with Raymond Chandler, the film is based on James M. Cains novella of the same name that originally appeared as an eight part serial in Liberty Magazine.Walter Neff, played by Fred MacMurray, is an experienced insurance salesman who meets a sultry young broad by the name of Phyillis Dietrichson who wishes her husband dead. She uses her lascivious charms to convince him to enter into a macabre scheme where she can cash in on her husbands death. Neff quickly succumbs to her toxic allure and before long is conspiring with her to do away with the husband and assist her in claiming twice the amount, in a policy clause that pays double in the event of a death arriving by accidental means. Hence, Double Indemnity.Drawing upon his vast knowledge from years in the business, Neff steers Dietrichson through the potential pitfalls of making such a claim, and the convoluted plan needed to outsmart the astute claims adjuster, Barton Keys, whose job it is to sniff out any bogus claims.Throughout the film we see how the nefarious arrangement begins to erode Neffs conscience as the film regularly cuts to the protagonist in flashback as he archives a dicta-phonic confession to his mentor Keyes.Apart from the meritorious plot and brilliant directorial skills of Wilder, this picture boasts some of the finest dialogue and exchanges in any film I've seen. The sublime and effortless performance by MacMurray and his perfunctory deliverance is matched perfectly by the leading lady Dietrichson, played by Barbara Stanwyck. It's easy to see why critics and film buffs wax lyrical about classics such as this. Everything about this piece is perfect, from the acting, the plot, the cinematography, and perfect economy of scene time that keeps the viewer gripped at every turn. This film was also a trailblazer for what followed, paradigmatic in its conception and style, it set the tone and standard for many Film Noir classics that succeeded it. Chosen in 1992 by the U.S Library of Congress for preservation in the National Film Registry it cements its worthwhile place as one the all time greats. Flawless from start to finish and comprehensively agreeable, Double Indemnity is a film any serious film lover should see.",

            "content": "I recently viewed this classic Billy Wilder movie of the 1940's on video tape.  Wilder's friend and protege` Cameron Crowe won a writing Oscar for last year's ALMOST FAMOUS and among his dedicatory remarks mentioned the MASTER (Mr. Wilder).  What a masterful cinema classic this noir \"who dun it to whom\" is even in the brand new century!! Fred MacMurray was also cast against his \"nice-guy\" type in Wilder's THE APARTMENT (1960) but in this film he's a victim of sexual attraction that keeps him dying throughout the majority of the film.  The use of flashback framing is great and the not-yet resolved ending is also highly memorable.  The question I'm left with at the end of this masterful narrative is:  WHO LOVES WHO and WHO REALLY WON IN THE DOUBLE-CROSS ENDING?      The ultimate villain is played by Barbara Stanwyck who really embodies sexuality turned up to the maximum.  She controls and manipulates every character who crosses her path. We fear for everyone in the \"back-story\" that she got her \"hands\" in strangle-holds on (necks and other body parts). She avows her love for her fellow murderer at several junctures of the narrative but his love and appreciation are also oddly expressed for his co-worker at the insurance agency. The story of DOUBLE INDEMNITY is not simply told and the ending is highly unresolved.  The author of a recent significant film's screenplay, THE USUAL SUSPECTS, owes in part his big surprises to brainy earlier writers like this movie's master plotter, Billy Wilder.  High praise and sincere recommendations for all young movie fans with only a few Parental Guidance (PG-13) aspects to be mindful of.",

One of the best scenes in the movie features the pompous head of the insurance company who interviews Stanwyck in front of Robinson and MacMurray(in order to \"show them how it's done\").  Edward G gets all the good lines, and in a Wilder script, that's a lot.A movie that refuses to be dated, \"Double Indemnity\" makes the case for simplicity in a story.

All you can do is sit there reveling in the drama and soaking up the images, as if they were being melted onto the screen. There's so much atmosphere in the first few frames of Billy Wilders' 1944 noxious noire classic, that you immediately become engrossed in the momentum of the film, and so that by the time the plot kicks in there's no choice but to take part. And that's a deliciously, dangerous proposition, as the only thing sharper than Wilder's script here, is the angle on the caper.There's so much heat to this film, not just from the matches which MacMurray so impact-fully strikes, but from the mercurial nature of the relationships. It's not a traditional dynamic, the one between MacMurray and Stanwyck, and that's half of the film's enigma. They feed off each other as if for sport, rather than love, and MacMurry never uses Stanwyck's name unless as a formality when being coy around inspecting parties. He instead refers to her only as \"baby\", as if completely intoxicated by his personal style fusing with hers. The lone occurrence of assumed intercourse seems to be fueled by lust and danger as he clutches her closely to the point of pain. His feelings for her are right in line with those she has for him, as she later confesses that she could never love anyone at all. At least that's what she had thought before she couldn't pull the trigger twice, sparing her cohort turned adversary. But then again, maybe she's still working him. Maybe even still, as her eyes somehow enflame and water at the same time, in chorus with words of how she truly loves him, that even this is merely posturing; that she is truly, as she said earlier, rotten to her core. In an unbelievable display of callous and pragmatic decisiveness, MacMurray brings her close and plugs her twice in the chest. Stanwyck's antecedent declaration of love is left hanging in the air, those rancid words left unconfirmed.The other half of the enigma, is the apposing dynamic between MacMurray and Edward G. Robinson's \"Keyes\" and how strongly the two seem to care for one another. Is it just a bond created by proximity and time? Not likely. True the two men have been working together for eleven years, but their reverence for one another goes well past that of seasoned co-workers; and when Robinson turns the tables and finally flicks a match for MacMurray you have to wonder just how strongly Wilder intended the homosexual undertones to be as he worked his way past the censors.Whether you choose to look into that angle or not, Robinson's relationship to MacMurray seems to be what Wilder is interested in most. The final scene shared between the two actors is what sticks with you. It's a wonder how so much tenderness could come from the ever terse and guarded MacMurray, as the final frame burns out in rhythm with the match.",

I've stumbled upon a film noir, in an admittedly short journey, that I can safely say is Great!It'd be easy to assume that the stupendous Billy Wilder, who is currently batting 1.000 for me, is to blame, but it *may just be*\u00a0the much-publicized Raymond Chandler, who I had not previously had the pleasure of coming into contact with, who deserves the credit. Who am I kidding; of course shared with Billy.Who I\u00a0*have*\u00a0seen from before, are the three main actors - in three separate films - all making improvements here ranging from meh to good (MacMurray), okay to really good (Stanwyk), and really good to great (Robinson).To give brief thoughts on the two making changes that I found to be the most eye- catching - Fred & Edward (sorry Barbara, you still killed it) - : Fred's stiff presence is\u00a0*far*\u00a0better suited for a 40s noir than a 60s Romantic Dramedy ('The Apartment'), where he was noticeably out-of-place when next to the natural Shirley MacClaine and the vibrant Jack Lemmon. There\u00a0*are*\u00a0some issues present, minor however, in that some of the emotions he claims to be feeling don't always seep through his often emotionless exterior. I say minor as this isn't always the case, ultimately he's one smooth momma- poppa.As for Edward G. Robinson, his performance here\u00a0*was*\u00a0better, in my opinion, but not vastly so than his one in\u00a0'Scarlet Street'. Why I bring him up is to point out his superb range, visible when contrasted with his performance in said other film. His ability to convincingly go from frail and pathetic to dominant and relentless is beyond impressive. What a talent he was.Of course they alone (the fantastic Barbara included) are not what make the picture great. No, not by a long shot. They are but enhancing the on-its-own entrancing tale. To slightly change the film's tagline, which speaks on the centered immoral lovers, to express my views:\u00a0From the moment they met it was\u00a0GOLD!Something I found strange in retrospect, was that I was subtlety rooting for the aforementioned lovers - strange, considering I'd never advocate for the things they were doing. My way of discovering this was due to me feeling the impact of the \"Oh no\" moments - if I wouldn't be slightly on their side I would actually be hoping for their demise. Instead, I was nervous, almost as much as MacMurray, whenever they hit a bump in the road during their\u00a0*impressively*\u00a0calculated trip; singularly when that bump came in the form of Robinson's character, the short and aggressive (\"Like a little Chihuahua\") Keyes. I have a couple of theories as to why this is, but nothing concrete. A second watch is required, because at the moment, I just don't know.What I do know is that every new road the film took me down, with the regretful voice narrating our journey, was better than the last. And even having known where it would eventually land, due to this being produced during the Hays Code, I still was enamored, up to the last second. That takes skill. Though they may have intensely disliked one another (which makes the success of the story all the more impressive), Billy and Raymond sure were one helluva duo.",

The set, the acting (specially a Stanwyck in a 1000%), the script and the direction, the music... Everything can be the best for a film noir. The scene of the crime is fascinating, with a short plane of the diabolically happy Cooper's face after sounding the claxon, and the elegance (Wilder) of not to show the murder explicitly, but only to suggest what is happening by this plane. If you have seen Garnet's The postman always rings twice, you're likely to prefer this one, although Garnet's movie may be very good. If you like film noir, and you have not seen this one (\u00a1!), after seeing it, you will be able to remember a lot of scenes, scripts and all sort of details in every movie made after Double indemnity that have been developed or taken out from it: from Kasdan's Body heat to Verhoeven's Basic Instinct or Edel's Body of Evidence -look at the pyjamas of Stanwick in the last scene-. This one can be considered as one of the best \"telling by flashback\" Hollywood classic movies, with Curtiz' Mildred Pierce -based upon another Cain's novel, as The postman is too-. The worst... Well, I think it's Stanwick hair-stylist, but I prefer watching the good things... The rest of the film.",

Edward G.

And Neff is a beautiful protagonist with complexity and depth.Despite all that. For my money. It's VERY good... not great. The Third Man and The Big Sleep were shot better. We didn't get enough of Barbara Stanwyck. I still can't poke any holes in Edward G's performance. But MacMurray offered very little charisma. For a character written so that we must cheer for him, in the hands of another actor we'd fall in love with him a la Sam Spade.A wonderful movie, worth everyone's time but possibly not all of the accolades it gets.",

The black and white gives the film a very nice, vintage look. We are introduced to a normal insurance man who gets caught up in a web of greed and lust, and tests the limits of how far man will go to get what he wants.The film holds up perfectly in entertainment value, and it is probably a safe choice to watch with your grandparents, as The Hayes Code was still in effect at the time and it isn't anywhere near as explicit future crime movies such as The French Connection and L.A. Confidential.My personal take is that this film puts our minds to the test. We've all loved someone that we shouldn't, but is that person worth the trouble of getting caught up in a web of murder and conspiracy for? Probably not.",

            "content": "I haven't seen many neo-noir films or movies that have noir ideas or images in them; but the movies I have seen under this category (Casablanca and Roger Rabbit) I absolutely love, so I was excited when my film class was taking on the classic film noir genre of the 40's. I know now that film noir is not just detective movies, as Double Indemnity is a well-crafted thriller, and was surprised throughout most of the movie of how interesting the crime was. I thought of the crime in this movie like folding paper, where each layer matures or enhances the main characters' plan, sometimes with hidden words on the pages on the backsides that you will only learn about later when the page is unfolded. The reason the protagonist begins in this path didn't intrigue me too much, but after I saw how he planned and how he conducted his plans, I couldn't help but be sympathetic to his goals because he was so clever. The female lead's role was dull at first, but her character grows into a formattable force and becomes very interesting; she eventually became my favorite character, which I didn't think would happen, given less development as the protagonist. The secondary characters are all fleshed out and have reasons for being in the story; my favorite of these being Robinson's character. It had a solid ending to an amazing climax, and some great classic film noir moments too. I gave it an 8 because I thought some moments were slow, even for a 40s movie, and some ideas a little too fantastical for my tase. They never hindered the entire plot however, and I recommend this to anyone interested in a classic thriller or film noir.",

The film's title come from the term that is widely used in life-insurance policies to state that, due to an accident death, the company must pay the policy holder's beneficiary double the original amount. Viewers watch as an unsuspecting insurance salesman, Walter Neff (played by Fred MacMurray), is drawn into a murder scheme by a flirty (a dirty!) wife, Phyllis Dietrichson (played by Barbara Stanwyck). The already corrupt insurance industry is suddenly thrown into murder mystery that is driven by Phyllis' provocative mannerisms, desire wealth, a cold-heartedness. Even though this film was released with high hopes from critics, I suppose there is a reason the film never won any Academy Awards! Personally, I enjoyed the film, for it captivated me in a weird sense, but I can see how the distinct dialogue and chilling plot would turn some viewers away from this classic!",

Fred MacMurray playing Walter Neff, an insurance salesman, is willingly seduced into committing murder for a $100,000 double indemnity insurance policy and the opportunity to have the beautiful Phyllis Dietrichson, played by Barbara Stanwick, to himself. Phyllis skillfully traps Walter into coming up with a \"foolproof\" plan to kill her husband and collect the insurance money without being suspected of fraud or worse, murder. Unfortunately, Walter works with a very clever investigator (Edward G. Robinson as Barton Keyes) whose \"Little Man\" and 20 plus years of experience, figures out the scheme. Because Neff and Keyes are friends, Keyes does not suspect Walter and it is not until Walter and Phyllis confront each other, with words and bullets, that Neff finally comes clean. Gripping and suspenseful, brilliantly acted, this film has some twists that you won't see coming right away and you'll be glad you spent the time to watch it.",

There is not enough praise in the world for this film.The best character with the best lines was that of Barton Keyes. My favourite scene of his is when he is in Norton's office, telling Norton - the president of the company - that, in effect, he is an idiot. I think many people would love to say what Keyes did to their bosses. I felt sorry for Keyes, as well. Keyes wasn't a man who gave his friendship and, in particular, his trust, lightly. He never once suspected that Walter Neff was the murderer and to find that he was, well, it must have hurt the man deeply.I found the last scene touching, where Keyes, despite knowing what Walter had done, still was trying to help him as best he could. He was still his friend and he lit his cigarette the way Walter had lit countless of his, Keyes, cigars.Having said all this, the storyline was weak. Let's put it this way, if you were in a pub and a guy told you about a guy who died in an odd accident on a train just two weeks after he had taken out an accident policy, wouldn't the first question you asked be 'So, have the police charged anyone for the murder yet?' It is a sign of the director's genius that he kept the audience's attention away from the weakness in the plot.One more thing: it is really good to see a film in which a woman was depicted as a black-hearted villain. I'm sick of the politically-correct portrayal of films these days. Phyllis Dietrichson used almost every trick in the book: she displayed her body, she flirted, she cried, she claimed that her husband beat her and wouldn't let her out of the house. It is clear, though, in the scene where she is driving her husband to catch the train that she was the one who was controlling him. She wanted him dead, not because he was terrible to her, but because he wasn't rich enough for her anymore.All in all, despite the weak plot, this is a great film. 10 out of 10!",

The first is the typical reaction when you see excellent old movies: \"Wow, they certainly don't make 'em like this anymore!\". But then, something that sets Double Indemnity apart in the crowd, even among the top classics: \"Wow, this movie has me nailed to the screen from the VERY BEGINNING and until the end!\".For those of us growing up in the 80's and 90's, watching \"old movies\" (unfortunate term, sorry) can be a bore. Let's be honest: Our attention span sucks, and a lot of the classics simply moves in a tempo we're not used to. Add to that a plot that typically only gets interesting 45 minutes in, and it's not looking good.Double indemnity is different. Yes, you cannot get away from the \"slowness\" of old films, but damn - this movie gets going from the very first scene, it hooks you, and never lets go until the surprising ending! The insurance fraud story is dead simple to follow, yet complex enough to allow for unexpected turns, \u00e0 la Fargo.Cinematography reaches typical noir greatness. Music is subtle and doesn't take away your attention unlike some other classics. Acting is top notch, and has a subtle touch to it. Make no mistake about it: This movie holds up VERY WELL, even in 2011.Citizen Kane might be the 1940's greatest - hell, many consider it the best movie period. But that's largely because of its complex, ahead-of-its-time narrative structure and innovative cinematography.But as far as just watching a classic film that's surprising, funny, enjoyable and - let's not forget - incredibly suspenseful throughout - Double Indemnity might just be the best there is.",

Fred MacMurray who play's Keyes is another great actor who played a detective in Orson Welles' \"The Stranger\".I can defiantly see the director of the 2005 movie \"Sin City\" taking some of Double Indemnity's Film-Noir qualities and using them in his film.

            "content": "Should you need a movie to explain the concept of film noir, most likely Double Indemnity would be the preferred choice of many, also for defining the perfect dark lady, a Barbara Stanwyck in her more refined role, seductive without being attractive. But who said evil must be beautiful to be luring for the lost souls of the night?Billy Wilder, already a solid and respected screenwriter in Europe before fleeing the Nazis and land in Hollywood to continue his trade, made the transition to directing only few years and two movies before co-writing, in a tempestuous cooperation with Raymond Chandler, and directing Double Indemnity, based upon a James Cain novel published in 1943 and inspired by a real crime occurred in New York City in 1927.While formally abiding to the feared Hollywood's Hays Code, Double Indemnity oozes sensuality and perversion, not only for the excellent script, the clever flashback structure, the remarkable cinematography and the majestic use of light and shadows, but above all for the alchemy between the two leading characters. Like two chemicals that alone can be inert and banal, the combination of Walter Neff, the ultimate nice guy, superficially self-confident, to whom Fred MacMurry gives his handsome and reassuring face, and Phyllis Dietrichson, the apparently frustrated housewife, a Barbara Stanwyck that, although not beautiful notwithstanding a kinky ankle bracelet that soon became a fetish, is dangerously sleazy and manipulative, creates an explosive mix of weakness and power, an evil magnetism that none of the characters can escape.An ineluctable and doomed journey, almost like in a Greek tragedy, where nobody can steer any more his own destiny once the wrong path has been taken, nobody can get off the tram directed to the cemetery, to use the words of Edward G. Robinson, who in this film is able to blend strict logic and sentiment, harshness and delicateness in a memorable performance.A movie that takes the viewer through the labyrinth of the human souls, uncovering and rummaging into the rottenness that both Phyllis and Walter know they have inside. It is not a coincidence that the whole story never takes place during the day, everything happens at night, a long, dark night without a dawn, a night that no light can brighten.",

Now I'm 19 I have just became a movie buff or movie freak in the last year or so, but I have come to love film noirs with a a passion. This movie is my 2nd favorite film noir, behind The Maltese Falcon. Now I just watched this one a few days ago, and I must say that it was suspenseful up to the end. Now this is a lot harder to do with this film, since they give the ending away at the beginning of the film, but it still manages to keep you intrigued to the end. The acting by both leads is superb, even though I thought it was a little annoying by the middle of the movie having to hear Fred MacMurray call Stanwyck \"baby\" every ten seconds. Stanwyck definitely deserved the Oscar nomination, but I think that MacMurray should have gotten at least a nod for the performance. The writing was excellent as well, as I said very suspenseful, and it makes me wonder just how much was taken from police reports or news stories from the crime in the late 20s that this story was supposedly based upon. Overall, I think that the story is what kept the movie flowing for me, and the performances just put it over the top. Kudos to Cain and Wilder though, superb script.",

Walter Neff (Fred MacMurray) is an insurance salesman. In an attempt to find Mr. Dietrichson (Tom Powers) finds his wife Phyllis Dietrichson (Barbra Stanwyck). The instantly have a connection and Mr. Neff explains certain situations of insurance payouts. Mr. Neff returns to the Diestrichson household and accuses Phyllis of trying to kill her husband. Which later at Neff's apartment she confesses to. During this time we are introduced to the best detective of all time Barton Keyes (Edward G Robinson) who happens to be Walters best friend. Phyllis and Walter make a plan to kill Mr. Dietrichson then they kill him. After they kill him Barton Keyes goes to work. The pressure of Bartons pursuit showers the flame of romance between the two for a time. Bartons investigation led to the him figuring out the crime, but he convicted Phyllis and Nino Zachetti (Bryon Barr), not Phyllis and Walter. With this information Walter goes to the Dietrichson home to let Phyllis know he's out of their plans together. Phyllis tries to kill him, she fails and Walter kills her. After Walter goes to work to leave Barton a message of his confession with the intent to leave the country after. As he does this he's slowly dying, then barton who had been listening comes into the room. He lets Walter know that in his state he won't get over the boded and eventually calls the ambulance for him.This movie was a Juggernaut for its time. The content for this movie was completely different from any movies that came before. This movie released during the time of The Hays Code era. This movie explains how to commit murder. This movie also shows how to get away with murder. Those two are strictly prohibited by the code. The story line and the shadiness of the movie fits perfectly. for the Noir era of films. The aspect of murder, double crossing, detective hats, detective work and the somber underlying mood is a perfect representation of what Noir films are supposed to represent.",

Right from the start you know how it will end because Walter's tells you he got neither the money nor the girl, but the real fun of the film is in figuring out how it ends up being that way, because at some points he seems to be getting a clean break and then you remember how the film truly began. I definitely thought that Lola would have had a more prominent role, but she seemed almost like a distraction.Double Indemnity is the pure definition of a Noir film. Every element is artistically met and well executed. The crime that envelops a decent man and the femme fatale that leads him down a dark path, where ultimately he meets some sort of doom. In this case, it almost cost him is life, and definitely his freedom. The film was also submerged in several shadows, especially towards the end in the final scenes at Phyllis' house.",

This is life reduced to its basic elements, with no sermons. Its protagonists are desperate people, destitute, on the run. This is why it seems so deterministic, or even defeatist. Fate is biological. No psychoanalyst will ever make sense of Stanwyck, when she declines to pull the trigger a second time on her intended victim, even to save her own life. It MAKES no sense, apart from the fact that it's in the script. Why do people commit irrational, self-destructive acts? It's in the script. That's Noir. It is also the reason why it can only be held up to its own standards. Wilder makes two fatal mistakes. He starts by giving the ending away, and that in a voice-over, which runs through the entire movie. And yet it all works splendidly. Stanwyck is neither scheming nor impulsive, she simply reacts to the hook dangled in front of her, thus herself becoming the dangling worm in front of MacMurray. A tiresome husband plus an insurance salesman make money plus sex. It's perfect. Only of course it isn't. It shouldn't take Robinson's little man to see it. People don't obligingly die under mysterious circumstances a fortnight after being insured by their young wives. How can the conspirators be so blind? It's in the script. What are their motives? Greed and lust. And yet the movie isn't a love story between Stanwyck and MacMurray. It is a - deeply tragic - love story between MacMurray and Robinson. And that's where it becomes pure genius.",

The acting and story are both so mesmerizing, it's hard to say anything more than what's rightly been said about them already. Barbara Stanwyck makes the gas chamber seem a small price to pay, while Fred MacMurray pulls off the trick of making a loathsome character sympathetic to the audience. Edward G. Robinson deserves a better class of cigar for the fine work he puts binding this whole thing together, by working simultaneously as MacMurray's trusting foil and instrument of his doom.But what makes this film work, and hold up so well more than half-a-century later, are the small touches. The clever opening (the killer reveals his identity in the opening scene) puts us on early notice that attention will need to be paid. Attention is rewarded, by the many little bits of business that are next to nothing on their own but make a great picture better when taken as part of the whole.* The opening conversation between a taciturn Walter Neff and a chatty elevator operator. We don't find out until a little later why Walter's so gruff.* How Neff accurately reads what Phyllis is proposing before it's even out of her mouth, tells her so, and then walks away. Was there ever a more unpromising beginning to a film noir tryst than this? Yet it shows us the guy has brains and some sense of morality, which makes his subsequent fall more of a challenge to accept, and more involving once we do.* The thumbnail match-lighting that goes on throughout the movie, usually at witty moments of simultaneous understanding and deception between Neff and Keyes. (Bet the Ronson people were glad this was one movie fad that didn't catch on.)* The problem with the car starting, which may seem a cheap bit of momentary suspense except when you think how it underscores in retrospect Keyes' great speech of murder accomplices sharing a trolley ride to the cemetery.* The fact that the only time the three main characters in the movie share a speaking scene together, it's one dominated by a fourth character, the supercilious insurance company president. His \"suicide\" theory, as delivered to the Widow Dietrichson, is perhaps the funniest moment in an often-very-funny film, closely rivaled by Keyes' subsequent, satisfying dressing-down of his boss. (What an exit line: \"Next time I'll wear a tuxedo!\")I'd say more, but I'm heading into spoiler country, so I'll let it go with a \"must-see\" recommendation, and this point about the last scene: Did you notice how Fred's last cigarette was soaked with blood around the middle, from being in his jacket pocket when he was wounded? So even the small enjoyment of a smoke would soon literally be cut off by his culpability in the crime. Gotta love that iron code of irony in film noir!",

The era is between the 1930s and 1950s in a city, which is recognized by the apparel and locations in the movie. The mise-en-scene is a dark and layered atmosphere that relates to the menacing plot; for example, when Walter kills Mr. Dietrichson, Phyllis turns onto a dark side road, beeps the horn three times, signaling Walter to choke Mr. Dietrichson to death.

'My Three Sons' it ain't.Revealing any part of the plot would be a crime, but if you know what the term 'double indemnity' means, it won't be too hard to figure out. What I will reveal is that the dialogue is outstanding(certainly a Wilder trait), and the two lead characters are unsympathetic misfits. MacMurray and Barbara Stanwyck took huge risks and gave classic performances. Equally outstanding is Edward G. Robinson, who plays the only likeable person in the movie. Of course, Robinson is remembered for his heavy gangster roles, so this twist is even more remarkable. The only thing that brings the movie down to a 9 for me is the hokey voiceover. Wilder reused the device with better results in 'Sunset Boulevard'.",

            "content": "Billy Wilder's Double Indemnity encapsulates a significant period in cinema history that never quite existed in the real-world. There is a romantic element to film noir that allows it to have a shade of the surreal, while exploring the more diabolical side of human desire. As a staple of the genre, Double Indemnity takes the audience on a thrilling journey more relatable than they may care to admit.\nWhen the sultry Phyllis Dietrichson, played by Barbara Stanwyck, is visited by insurance salesman Walter Neff (Fred MacMurray), she makes a proposition that begins their torrid affair and entangles the two in a lethal plot that is doomed from the start. Narrated as a dictation by Walter to his boss Keyes, played by Edward G. Robinson, the recorded confession signals to the audience from the beginning that things will not go according to plan. This reflective narration allows for Walter to call out his own foolishness in hindsight, and as the plan goes off without a hitch, adds to the intrigue of what will cause their downfall.\nFilm noir motifs are so particular and recognizable that it is difficult to pull off modern homages to the genre without coming off as clich\u00e9 or ironic. What they may lack in authenticity to reality, films like Double Indemnity make up for in their earnest effort to portray scandalous characters that the audience can live through vicariously. At the time of the film's release in 1944, divorce would not be reformed for decades, so it was not only shameful, but also exceedingly difficult for married couples to legally separate. As a result, it is no wonder that fantasies of adultery or even spousal death would become morbidly appealing. Dames in need of rescuing from their despicable husbands by brooding life-long bachelors became the modern stories of damsels in distress; their tales shrouded in secrecy and paranoia of conspiracy.\nThe ambience of suspicion and mystery is accentuated by the moody dim lighting with harsh contrast and close-up camera angles; intimate shots of characters sparking matches to light each other's cigarettes. The lighting on set is often so dark and concentrated that blocking and shadow can be used to striking cinematic effect. Like this painterly approach to capturing the story on film, the way the actors converse is not meant to be entirely realistic, but rather a stylized representation that evokes a response from the audience. While actors may no longer take elocution lessons to learn how to speak correctly with the accent from nowhere, there is something alluring about the Transatlantic accent. Perhaps it's the allusively hard to place nature of the fabricated manner of speaking, or simply a nostalgia for old Hollywood, but it's those classic elements of film noir that make movies like Double Indemnity so seductive.",

This was the reason for the delay. The film is a tale of adultery , murder , and fraud. The first sin was the main obstacle in approving the film for release. Since nudity and bedroom scenes were never shown on screen , the sexual context had to be suggested in the script and the imagery. In one key scene , Phyllis (Stanwyck ) comes to Neff's (MacMurray) apartment. Neff at this point is unsure of \"helping\" her. In one two-shot , both are on the sofa,Phyllis reclining and Neff sitting beside her. The film cuts to the Neff narrative of the story and then returns to the two-shot in the apartment.

Phyllis is on the other end of the sofa putting on lipstick.Looking at the subtext of the scene , we see the suggestion of a completed sexual encounter , probably ending in oral sex. After the sex, Neff agrees to help Phyllis murder her husband. This , then , is a key scene that sends both on \"a one-way street' to the finale.",

Unless she has a prenup it makes no sense to go for insurance when inheritance.  Considering prenups didn't exist until the 1980s.  Other than a catchy title, it makes no sense.  It would have made a tiny bit of sense that these two were having an affair and didn't want to risk divorce which would keep her from getting anything.

            "content": "The double entendre comes swiftly out of the gate in the film noir classic, Double Indemnity (1944)!  Fred MacMurray plays slick insurance salesman Walter Neff.  Mere minutes after meeting sultry Phyllis (Barbara Stanwyck), the wife of one of his clients, Walter is letting it be known that he's enjoying his time with her a little more than just professionally.\nPhyllis:  \"There's a speed limit in this state Mr. Neff, 45 mile an hour\"\nWalter:  \"How fast was I going officer?\"\nPhyllis:  \"I'd say around 90.\"\nPhyllis may play the part of a lady, but in reality she is a true broad in every aspect.  She's well aware of her wiles and more than comfrtable using them to her full advantage.  Walter imagines himself a very clever chap, but he's soon caught in the web of deceit that Phyllis spins. \nWhen the film begins, Walter shows up extremely early at his workplace.  He's injured and immediately begins recording a confession into a dictation machine.  His confession becomes the narration upon which the rest of the film is revealed through flashbacks.  His tale begins with his first time meeting the aforementioned Phyllis Dietrichson.  He's immediately smitten with her and becomes empathetic as she spins her tale of being trapped in a loveless and abusive marriage.  Before long, he's assisting her with secretly obtaining a life insurance policy on her husband.  As his affair with Phyllis intensifies, Walter soon finds himself helping her in plotting her husband's death.  Once the \"accidental\" death of Mr. Dietrichson occurs however, Walter's boss, Mr. Keyes (Edward G. Robinson), soon begins to have suspicions about it and about the large payout that his firm will be forced to pay out to the widow Phyllis.  Walter's cat-and-mouse tale quickly begins to unravel as he tries to maintain his affair with Phyllis and his employment with Mr. Keyes.  As a keen salesman, Walter had imagined himself the ultimate player, but he's now found himself as the one who's been played.\nThe dialogue is rapid and sharp, capturing the sort of gumshoe zeitgeist of the period.  Nearly every single sentence Walter utters to Phyllis ends with \"baby\"!   All three lead actors are at the top of their game, with Stanwyck receiving an Oscar nod (one of 7 Oscar nominations the film received in total).  Her portrayal of Phyllis is superb as the layers of her character are peeled back slowly and deliberately.  The pacing is superb, and even though we know Walter ends up injured, we still don't know how everything will play out until the very end.  Adding to the film's brilliance is the incredible score by Miklos Rozsa accompanied by the cinematography of John F. Seitz.  Seitz's use of light and shadows are a visual treat and director Billy Wilder perfectly incorporates the actors into that morsel.",

The plot manages to throw plenty of curveballs without you losing track of things altogether, and makes the characters interesting enough to be engaging, but also ambiguous enough to be mysterious. It's a downright ground-breaking film in terms of its content, where the murder it's based around is rationalised and presented as a viable and even desirable option, not just something a person wants to do for revenge, or because they're a psychopath. There's a few distracting elements, such as the fact that Fred MacMurray is quite clearly wearing a wedding ring throughout the film despite obviously being a single man. How a director as fastidious as Billy Wilder managed to miss that I'll never know. Also, the framing device is that of the lead describing the entire murder plot to another character, who then plans to flee the country. Why not just skip the confession and run away instead? It's like he actually wanted to be caught. But with that to the side, Double Indemnity, aka, Keyes & Baby: The Movie, remains a standout film in a near unparalleled directorial career. If Film Noir is your thing, then there's a very good chance you've seen it already. If not, you really need to.",

Wilder's direction is snappy and doesn't waste a moment of Double Indemnity 108 minutes. I'm used to Billy Wilder's pleasant comedies such as Some Like It Hot or Sabrina. However, Wilder's film noir style is perfect for Sunset Boulevard and Double Indemnity.\n\nBarbara Stanwyck is drop dead gorgeous as the iconic femme fatale Phyllis Dietrichson. Her manipulation of Fred MacMurray's gullible insurance salesman is a delight to watch. MacMurray is great at displaying guilt and feeling cautiously nervous about Stanwyck's sinister scheme. You see her every intention on screen, while the fallout of her radioactive behavior cascades down everywhere as people are shot, men are strangled, and lives are ruined. Stanwyck's magnetic charisma, flirty charm, and serious noir sultry flair are captivating in Double Indemnity. You can tell how Barbara Stanwyck in Double Indemnity was an influence on Gene Tierney for Leave Her to Heaven, Sharon Stone in Basic Instinct, and even Kim Basinger in Wayne's World 2.\n\nI loved seeing Edward G. Robinson's hard boiled insurance boss Barton Keyes figures out every detail of the story with his paranoid suspicions and lucky hunches. His fast talking, wise cracking, and no nonsense attitude makes Double Indemnity a splendid viewing experience. Jean Heather's supporting role as Lola Dietrichson was nice as her desperate pleas for belief and understanding are quite moving.\n\nBilly Wilder, Raymond Chandler, and James M. Cain's writing is thoughtful and has worked out every detail and mistake in this crime thriller scheme, so that the mystery of what went wrong is always interesting for the viewer. Wilder's playful and dark direction keeps you guessing, so that once you've figured out what has occurred, it's too late for the protagonist. Double Indemnity is an insurance fraud plot with a complex romance drama narrative mixed into the shadowy world of murder.\n\nDoane Harrison's editing is slick and cuts down Double Indemnity just to the main plot and scandalous intrigue, so the film never drags. John F. Seitz' cinematography is moody with these grim looking wide shots and splendorous close-ups of the stars. Miklos Rosza's score is steamy with a sizzling romantic score and unnerving noir mystique to his dramatic pulses. Edith Head's dresses are lovely on Barbara Stanwyck with that chic 1940's style. Wally Westmore's make-up does Stanwyck up in full glamour.\n\nIn all, I loved Double Indemnity. Wilder hooked me on the near private detective aspect of insurance claims agents discovering the nefarious deeds of insurance holders who are willing to commit murder and fraud for financial gain.",

But who said evil must be beautiful to be luring for the lost souls of the night?\n\nBilly Wilder, already a solid and respected screenwriter in Europe before fleeing the Nazis and land in Hollywood to continue his trade, made the transition to directing only few years and two movies before co-writing, in a tempestuous cooperation with Raymond Chandler, and directing Double Indemnity, based upon a James Cain novel published in 1943 and inspired by a real crime occurred in New York City in 1927.\n\nWhile formally abiding to the feared Hollywood's Hays Code, Double Indemnity oozes sensuality and perversion, not only for the excellent script, the clever flashback structure, the remarkable cinematography and the majestic use of light and shadows, but above all for the alchemy between the two leading characters. Like two chemicals that alone can be inert and banal, the combination of Walter Neff, the ultimate nice guy, superficially self-confident, to whom Fred MacMurry gives his handsome and reassuring face, and Phyllis Dietrichson, the apparently frustrated housewife, a Barbara Stanwyck that, although not beautiful notwithstanding a kinky ankle bracelet that soon became a fetish, is dangerously sleazy and manipulative, creates an explosive mix of weakness and power, an evil magnetism that none of the characters can escape.\n\nAn ineluctable and doomed journey, almost like in a Greek tragedy, where nobody can steer any more his own destiny once the wrong path has been taken, nobody can get off the tram directed to the cemetery, to use the words of Edward G. Robinson, who in this film is able to blend strict logic and sentiment, harshness and delicateness in a memorable performance.\n\nA movie that takes the viewer through the labyrinth of the human souls, uncovering and rummaging into the rottenness that both Phyllis and Walter know they have inside. It is not a coincidence that the whole story never takes place during the day, everything happens at night, a long, dark night without a dawn, a night that no light can brighten.",

When I first discovered her I wondered what all the hype was about as she wasn't what you would call traditionally attractive but I quickly realized that she had a chutzpah and a charm unmatched by any other leading lady since. She had possibly her most iconic role with this classic film noir as she embodies the femme fatale in the minds of many classic film fans. Few films from this era have held up as well as this cynical story about passion and murder that manages to have a heart without becoming sentimental mush. I'm not the first to note any of this, few viewers don't fall in love with the film or at least admire it, yet my response was totally organic in a way that my feelings about other classics haven't been.\n\nBored insurance salesman Walter Neff, Fred MacMurray, falls under the spell of the seductive Phyllis Dietrichson, Barbara Stanwyck, when he arrives at her house to sell automobile insurance to her husband, Tom Powers. Dietrichson eventually convinces Neff to murder her husband so that they can be together and collect a large payout as a result of the double indemnity clause that they have written into his life insurance policy without his knowledge. Although they initially believe that they have pulled off the perfect murder by killing Dietrichson and then placing him on the train tracks to make it appear that he commit suicide while Neff impersonates Dietrichson in the train the case is investigated by Neff's scrupulous co-worker Barton Keyes, Edward G. Robinson. Flaws in their plan are quickly brought to light and the two begin to fight as Neff takes measures to protect them while Dietrichson tries to drag a man into disposing of Neff.\n\nThe film is different from others of it's type as it leaves it's slimy protagonist's motives up in the air. Is he simply bored of his day job and the monotony of his life as the beginning of the film would suggest? We are certainly led to believe that he is excited by the prospect of putting the skills he has learnt over the year to good use and the fact that he appears to have little else going on in his life, being single and largely occupied with his work, convinces us that this could be his primary motivation. Furthermore for all of the leery shots of Stanwyck's ankles there is a dispassionate quality to the affair between Neff and Dietrichson as they seem to be seduced more by the idea of an illicit affair than by each other. There is palpable excitement in both of them as they plan and carry out the murder and what they both seem to crave, in my view, is an affirmation of their abilities. As the narcissistic Dietrichson revels in her power over men while Neff delights in doing something bad seemingly for the first time in his life.\n\nThe film also cuts to the chase remarkably quickly, as Billy Wilder's films are wont to do, with the set up of Neff and Dietrichson's affair and planning of the murder taking place within the first 30 minutes. After this the film becomes about the close, almost father-son like relationship between Neff and Keyes who trusts him implicitly even as he doesn't trust any of the insurance claimants who pass through his office. It seems in the second half of the film that Neff finds some moral center as he does not want the man who has nurtured and cared for him to realize what a rotten crook her has become. The final scene of the film informs us that despite the shocking revelations these two men will continue to be friends and compared to the end of films like Wilder's Sunset Boulevard (1950) that is heartwarming.\n\nThis is probably not what people remember about the film as there is one delicious scene in which the delightfully villainous Dietrichson gets what is coming to her. Before this occurs she has a terribly fun and oddly tragic revelation as she tells our hero that she never knew she loved him until she couldn't shoot him twice. Stanwyck's deadpan delivery and the many interpretations that could be applied to this line make it a great moment and the fact that she is brutally shot dead seconds later immortalizes it.",

In saying that, I mean that the jaw-dropping nuances Wilder has sizzled this film with, and the painstaking attention to details gave Double Indemnity unique taste, and made it stand out from all the films of its kind. Giving away the plot synopsis usually tarnishes the experience of watching your typical film noir because the toughness of them are their small details, let alone doing so with this one in addition to explaining why I find the subtlety of it so mesmerizing. Watch Double Indemnity and you'll know what I mean straight away!\n\nAlas, It seems that this very meticulous attention to detail came at the expense of making the most important the most crucial moments and the turning points convincing. The academic nature of the film's plotting made a lot of decisive moments a bit hard to swallow. It also made the movie drag, surprisingly, at what should have been the most intriguing part.\n\nAll the performances here are fine, but it's Edward G. Robinson who steals the show for me. He plays the quick-witted, determined investigator, Barton Keyes, who may be a bit too smart and clever to be believable; but thanks to Robinson's fierce performance, Keyes hands down is my favorite character in the movie.\n\nDouble Indemnity is an extremely well-crafted moody crime film that transcends the nature of its plotting with an unprecedented, unmatched, unsurpassable subtlety that made the main characters lifelike, and made the story thought-provoking in the first place. It raised the bar and set the standard for film-noir making at its time, and continues to inspire every neo-noir film, nay every crime film to this day.\n\n(8.5/10)",

Words to match the off-putting expressionist lighting, which doesn't just illuminate the set, but cuts these characters into pieces, as they and their plan fall to pieces, like the slow inexorable revelation of truth. Lighting to match the story itself-or at least it's telling-always only half exposed in its narration, shifting your attention to look in one (mis)direction while the real crime is happening just off screen, in the darkness, where you are not looking.\n\nForget, for a moment, if you can, the film's historical importance and influence as the first (or, at least, the prototype) film noir, step past its cinematic originality and impudence, important as that is-all reasons this is one of the greatest films ever made-and look at just what happens on the screen or in the script. This is a movie of detailed but subtle characterization (Stanwyck's trashy wig) and complex but earnest motivation (MacMurray's ideal ego), with unexpected turns that never pander to or underestimate the intelligence of either its audience or its characters. Yet for a movie about such darkness as what lies in the depths of the human condition, a movie that looks seedy and caused something of a scandal, for all about it that is hard on the soul it nonetheless is easy on the eyes and ears, profoundly enjoyable to watch even when the iniquity of these characters makes you, at times, want to look away.\n\nIn that sense, despite the narration by MacMurray which puts you in his shoes-and so makes you miss the story as its really happening, blinded by his ego while the real subject of the crime being Stanwyck-the viewer is ultimately in the position of the gumshoe-esque claims adjuster. Surrounded by brilliant performances, Robinson is the true criminal here, stealing every scene he's in, and in him is the whole spirit of the movie: Cantankerous, wordy, energetic, intelligent, skeptical, pessimistic. In fact, part of me suspects-and here we return to the filming and not just the film, to what happened off screen and not just what happens on-that Robinson is a stand-in, in a way, for Wilder, the force who keeps the action moving through his relentlessness, who is a step ahead even when he's playing catchup.",

If you murder, you're a murderer. You've removed the floor of your conscience's deepest toleration of evil, and it's difficult if at all possible to replace it. Perfect example of a film noir.

            "content": "Billy Wilder's Double Indemnity is a classic film noir and a classic crime drama about bad people doing bad things and doing them badly. It's a rich narrative environment that has been explored in droves before and after. Double Indemnity was a box-office sensation, critical hit that was nominated for seven Oscars, and solidified Wilder as one of the most creative and daring voices in cinema. This was only his third directing effort and it provided the freedom to make his own way through Hollywood. There's a certain danger in going back to cinematic classics. It's easy to see their influence in a sea of imitators and sometimes the accomplishments can be taken for granted just because the viewer is too removed from the initial splash the film made. Double Indemnity is a sharp, surefooted, and highly influential film that still resonates with suspense and intrigue. The formula was refined with Wilder at the helm and his genius can be readily recognized.\n\nWalter Neff (Fred MacMurray) is a mid 30s insurance salesman in Los Angeles. He gets into some big trouble when a prospective client, Phyllis Dietrichson (Barbara Stanwyck), intimates that she would like to bump off her husband and profit from the act. Walter is appalled but also intrigued, drawn to the charms of the sexy Mrs. Dietrichson. He agrees and says they're going to do it right. She takes out a hefty insurance policy on her husband that pays double for rare accidents, which spurs Neff to stage a phony accident where the injured Mr. Dietrichson (Tom Powers) fell to his death off a train. The scheme is elaborate, with alibis, swapped identities, hiding places, and a minimal of public interactions. It seems perfectly executed that is until Neff's boss, Barton Keyes (Edward G. Robinson), starts inspecting closer feeling something is amiss. Neff must outwit his boss and co-workers and keep the scheme from getting further out of control.\n\n\"I killed him for money - and a woman - and I didn't get the money and I didn't get the woman.\"\n\nThanks to the morally and creatively restrictive Hays Code, it's easy to see all the roadblocks that could have sabotaged the movie from getting made, let alone becoming a great film. It's a movie not just about adulterers but they're also murderers, and the script places you in their perspective, clinging to hope they might succeed in their scheme. Admittedly, the characters are punished for their misdeeds by the film's end as the Hays Code would demand, but the film experience was different, and Wilder made it so early on. Within minutes, as Walter Neff dictates his confession in his boss' empty office, he admits to being a killer, to killing Mr. Dietrichson, and in doing so out of a desire for Mrs. Dietrichson. By the very fact that he's slumped over, panting heavily, and confessing in sordid detail, we can rightfully assume that he did not get away with it. What's left for the audience to discover? Wilder has already established the major turns of his story for his audience and seemingly robbed us of any notion of surprise. But that's where Wilder's storytelling prowess emerges, because it's not so much a story of whether something was done or would be done, it's a story of how and how to elude capture.\n\nWe're locked into Neff's perspective, and with it as an experienced insurance salesman, he knows the proper way to stage a murder, make it look like an accident, and not get caught. It's in the details that Wilder hooks us, and as we watch the trap unravel, the movie becomes an exercise in nervous tension wondering what will trip up our lovers. An audience generally gravitates to smart characters trying to outwit others, appreciating the wiles but also, perhaps, wanting to see if the scheme can be accomplished. It pushes the audience into an interesting position of rooting for our murderer. There's a wonderful scene right after Neff and Phyllis have deposited the body of her dead husband. They've hopped in her car and are ready to flee the scene of the crime, and that's when her car won't start. Wilder simmers in the moment, luxuriating in the encroaching panic as key turn after key turn only results in the sounds of a stalled engine. Finally, it starts, but during the sequence you empathize with the killers and their panic. Wilder and company have done their job and at least some part of the audience is pushing for them to escape. What happens later tests audience loyalty, but we're still firmly in the perspective and in the shoes of the film's killer, the only killer in the picture at that. He's our man.\n\n\"I think you're rotten.\"\n\n\"I think you're swell - so long as I'm not your husband.\"\n\ndouble-indemnity_in-text1520The staples of noir cinema really came alive with Wilder's excellent crime drama. The visual signifiers we associate with the genre are all here in accordance, like the chiaroscuro lighting that bathed the actors in swaths of invading darkness. The lighting does a great job of reflecting the sordid schemes of our lovers. As soon as Walter accepts, the lighting changes drastically and the layers of dark creep in on the actors' faces. The dialogue by Wilder and Raymond Chandler (his first screenwriting gig in Hollywood) has that robust rat-a-tat rhythms of hardboiled genre fiction that we love. The twists and turns keep an audience glued even though we have already been told the major plot particulars. The inclusion of Mr. Dietrich's twenty-something daughter Lola (Jean Heather) from his previous marriage presents an intriguing complication. She suspects her wicked stepmother might have something to do with her father's death as well as her mother's death. Walter Neff keeps tabs on her as a means of trying to dissuade whom she tells her suspicions to, as a means of manipulating her, but then when Lola reveals that her ex-boyfriend has been seeing Phyllis on a nightly basis, we don't know what to think. Is Phyllis setting up her own scheme to kill Neff? Is Lola knowingly manipulating Neff to enact vengeance against her hated stepmother? Is there anyone a guy can trust? It's a fine character and played sincerely by Heather (Going My Way) almost to the point of ache. She stopped acting altogether in 1949, to the detriment of us all.\n\nBut the ultimate femme fatale is Stanwyck (The Lady Eve). I think what makes her work is the fact that she doesn't immediately leap to mind as a femme fatale. She's not the most gorgeous actress in Hollywood, though clearly still an attractive woman. The stiff blonde wig they saddled her with doesn't help on that front. She's a temptress that doesn't sizzle off the screen so much as step from the mind, because she feels more realistic. Working within the repressive confines of the Hays Code, Stanwyck still knows how to provide a sexy smirk to things left unsaid with her character. There are a few looks she employs that could make you melt. A standout scene focuses entirely on her face. Her husband is being murdered just off screen. That violent act is left to our morbid imaginations while we watch Stanwyck's subtle expression of satisfaction crosses her face only to dissolve when she knows better. I wish MacMurray (The Absentminded Professor) was a better scene partner with her. He seems overly stiff like he's trying more to get out the stylized dialogue in the tone the director wants. Wilder finds ways to subvert the actor's tendencies but I feel like he's at best a likable dolt of an actor.\n\n\"You're not smarter, Walter... you're just a little taller.\"\n\nPhyllis is a classic femme fatale figure and Stanwyck plays her with a beautifully controlled sense of menace, but I want to offer a different theory as to what kind of twisted love story inhabits Double Indemnity. I think Walter Neff was never in love with Phyllis, though acknowledged her beauty and general seductive effect. This much is clear from his first meeting with her where the insurance veteran can't help himself with how forward and transparent his flirting is. He's interested, though he's also interested in getting a sale, and then when she floats the idea of life insurance, his tone immediately changes. The flirting stops cold and he promptly sees himself out. But he can't stop thinking it over. I propose he isn't drawn to Phyllis so much as he's drawn to the intellectual challenge of pulling off the \"perfect crime.\" He considers himself a clever man and this would put all his skills to the test. He knows what agents look for to suss out foul play. He knows what the police ask over. Now he gets to see if he can fool them all. In this interpretation of mine, it's not Neff's love for the dame that gets him but his love of his ego. There's a cold manner in how often he calls Phyllis \"baby,\" lacking apparent affection and instead seemingly turning the pet name into something dutiful. Oh, but you'll argue, his voice over goes into great detail about the magnetic and sexual appeal of Mrs. Dietrichson, and that's the point to remember, that it's his voice over. Neff is retelling this story, knowingly dictating his confession, and perhaps he's playing into a narrative that removes some of the emphasis from his true intentions. Since it's from his perspective, his words are all we know about Phyllis and her assumed seductress ways. Having the final word on his story would provide a perfect opportunity for Walter to alter the story as best he sees fit, shifting some blame onto the woman who done him wrong. I believe that in the end it was Walter Neff's desire to prove he could outsmart the world of law enforcement and get away with murder that drove him onto this wayward path and not a woman as fetching as Stanwyck and her anklet may have been.\n\nThere's a very unexpected emotional current that surfaces fully by the conclusion of Double Indemnity. Edward G. Robinson was at a transitional point in his career, having been the lead in a slew of older crime pictures. An audience was prepped from association to consider Robinson a disreputable character, just as they had prepped to consider MacMurray's character a likeable fellow from his previous comedic roles. Wilder's film flips audience expectations to great effect. MacMurray is the cunning murderer and Robinson is the moral center. Keyes is exceptionally skilled at insurance fraud and it naturally should be him that unknowingly tightens the noose around his beloved employee as he gets closer and closer to the truth. He just can't see it; Walter Neff is so close he inhabits a blind spot. When Keyes does discover the truth, his crushing sense of disappointment he tries to hold back is an emotional moment that hits hard. It's the professional and loving relationship between these men that helps to add something more to Double Indemnity; it's got the noir staples we come to expect nowadays but it also has a surprisingly sweet and affecting father/son relationship between mentor and student. Robinson is terrific in the bravado moments like when he unleashes a torrent of statistical categories on suicide types and methods and he sells the quiet hurt of a proud man who must admit he placed his trust in the wrong recipient.\n\n\"I couldn't hear my own footsteps. It was the walk of a dead man.\"\n\nDouble Indemnity is a film classic that holds up thanks to deft plotting that puts the audience in the place of the killers, solid twists and turns, and a clear understanding of the strengths of the genre. It's a standout film noir that still stands rather tall. It's always reassuring when the great pieces of art can still transport, still excite, and still resonate with the same feeling that communicates why they deserve the decades of plaudits and acclaim. Wilder was one of Hollywood's greatest storytellers who could hop genres like few others. His foray into noir cinema left a long lasting legacy for the genre and its fans to follow, and Double Indemnity is still the crackling crime thriller it was under the Hays Code. Perhaps the scrutiny of censorship forced Wilder and Chandler to get more creative, and the finished product is a taut and stylish imprint that others eagerly copied. There's just something inherently interesting about bad people doing bad things badly no matter the best intentions of the moral crusaders of its day.\n\nNate's Grade: A",

            "content": "MacMurray does justice to the characters pervading Cain's novels, justice that was partially obliterated by Garfield later on. In spite of Wilder's and Chandler's\nwriting, MacMurray rises above a very poor screenplay adaptation of Cain's novel to capture the essence of the noire genre. Wilder and Chandler might seem to be writers cut from different cloth but what they have in common, a tendency to dwell in schlock and awe, is what rips the fabric from the Cain storyline. You know, I partially take what I wrote about MacMurray back, on second thoughts he has a tendency to fall into the overwrought emotional mannerisms typifying movies of the '30's and '40's.  Emotions run strong in Cain's novel, emotions of desperation not the outraged anger MacMurray exhibits at inappropriate moments. Stanwyck does a decent job in her role, her laid back style might have been the inspiration for the method acting school of thought. Stanwyck's acting style is also a function of the Hollywood star system as exhibited in Mae West and others, a laconic style meant to impress upon the viewer a persona of being sated and unapproachable. It works in the early parts of the film and Stanwyck makes the transition to the later, more desperate parts adequately.\nSo is the movie worthwhile in spite of its different take from the novel? I would say so, it's one of the movies that helped found the whole noire genre. Eventually the genre would become relegated to B movie status without the stars and with scripts not based on novels and written specifically for the screen. in some ways the stars of the later, smaller scale noire films are more up to the task because their relative anonymity fits perfectly with the ordinary horror that is an essential element of the genre.",

You sense it in the dreamy way scenes transition, how the lighting and angles in each frame is stylized like a comic book panel, how the dialogue is smooth and filled with one-liners like a showdown between superhero and villain, and so on. Double Indemnity isn't like that. It's more down to Earth and grounded in reality, while at the same time retaining the clever, romantic and devious charm of the genre. This makes it either one of the best or one of the worst. In my opinion, it's one of the best. It's a good movie for people who don't like the eccentricities typically found in old film noir.",

            "content": "Double Indemnity is film noir at its finest. The story is about an insurance salesman who allows a woman to talk him into a murder plot that will help them defraud the insurance company and runaway together. Fred MacMurray plays dramatically against type as the insurance salesman who has dreamed up the perfect way of getting the best of the insurance company. His narration throughout is very classy and feels perfect for this style of film. I also appreciated that the narration explained some of his thought process, but didn't waste time retelling moments we were able to see on screen. Barbara Stanwyck plays the femme fatale in this story, and she is just mysterious enough that you can never tell what she is really thinking. Is she genuinely in love with Fred MacMurray's character, or just leading him on? You'll have to watch the film and decide for yourself. Without question, though, my favorite performance comes from Edward G. Robinson. Who would have thought that an insurance claims manager would be the hero of a film, but I feel like he is definitely the hero of Double Indemnity (although your rooting interest kind of shifts around as the movie goes on.) He is so perfect for this role, because he manages to be the hard-nosed boss, but his affection for his coworker softens every scene they have together. In fact the relationship between the characters played by MacMurray and Robinson is easily the most interesting and engaging aspect of the film.\n\nOf course the cinematography includes a lot of darkness. It fits the dark tone of the film, and locks it solidly in the noir genre. However the more intriguing choices that were made behind the camera were how shots were set up. There's a scene where Stanwyck is hiding behind a door trying to avoid being seen by Robinson, and they brilliantly place the camera down the hallway so we can focus in on her. This one staging choice adds so much tension to what could be a very mundane conversation between MacMurray and Robinson. Also the scene of the murder is executed in a brilliant way because we aren't allowed to see the deed, but instead experience it through the expressions on Stanwyck's face. There's really not much to complain about in Double Indemnity. It is a well-crafted story, and it takes a different angle on a classic murder mystery. It was very intriguing to think about how the insurance company has more at stake than the police so they have more incentive to sniff out a murder. Instead of following around some detective we are left with a pencil pusher played by Edward G. Robinson, and yet it works. I thought there were a few odd choices in the film, and I never fully understood what role Nino played in the story. His entire subplot kind of went over my head. That being said, I still think Double Indemnity is a great film, and it is definitely worth seeing at least once.",

Cain based his novella on a 1927 murder perpetrated by a married Queens, New York woman and her lover whose trial he attended while working as a journalist in New York. In that crime, Ruth Snyder persuaded her boyfriend, Judd Gray, to kill her husband Albert after having him take out a big insurance policy - with a double-indemnity clause. The murderers were quickly identified, arrested and convicted. The front page photo of Snyder's execution in the electric chair at Sing Sing has been called the most famous newsphoto of the 1920s.\n\nDouble Indemnity began making the rounds in Hollywood shortly after it was published in Liberty magazine in 1935. Cain had already made a name for himself the year before with The Postman Always Rings Twice, a story of murder and passion between a migrant worker and the unhappy wife of a caf\u00e9 owner. Cain's agent sent copies of the novella to all the major studios and within days, MGM, Warner Bros., Paramount, 20th Century-Fox, and Columbia were all competing to buy the rights for $25,000. Then a letter went out from Joseph Breen at the Hays Office, and the studios withdrew their bids as one. In it Breen warned:\n\n\nThe general low tone and sordid flavor of this story makes it, in our judgment, thoroughly unacceptable for screen presentation before mixed audiences in the theater. I am sure you will agree that it is most important...to avoid what the code calls \"the hardening of audiences,\" especially those who are young and impressionable, to the thought and fact of crime.\n\nEight years later Double Indemnity was included in a collection of Cain's works entitled Three of a Kind. Paramount executive Joseph Sistrom thought the material would be perfect for Wilder and they bought the rights for $15,000. Paramount resubmitted the script to the Hays Office, but the response was nearly identical to the one eight years earlier. Wilder, Paramount executive William Dozier, and Sistrom decided to move forward anyway. They submitted a film treatment crafted by Wilder and his writing partner Charles Brackett, and this time the Hays Office approved the project with only a few objections: the portrayal of the disposal of the body, a proposed gas-chamber execution scene, and the skimpiness of the towel worn by the female lead in her first scene.\n\nCain forever after maintained that Joseph Breen owed him $10,000 for vetoing the property back in 1935 when he would have received $25,000.\n\n\n\n\n\nExteriors of the Dietrichson house in the film were shot at a 3,200-square-foot (300 m2), Spanish Colonial Revival house built in 1927. The house can still be seen today and is located at 6301 Quebec Drive in the Beachwood Canyon neighborhood of Los Angeles. The production team copied the interior of the house, including the spiral staircase, almost exactly on a soundstage at Paramount.\n\nThe exterior of the train station in the film was the Mission Revival Style Southern Pacific Railroad Depot in Glendale, California built in 1923. The station can now be seen as part of the Glendale Transportation Center and was added to the National Register of Historic Places on May 2, 1997.\n\nOther locations around Los Angeles used in the film were an apartment building at 1825 N. Kingsley Drive in Hollywood where Walter Neff lived and the building on the southwest corner of Hollywood Blvd. and Western. That building still stands, but the Newman Drug Store originally on the ground floor is no longer there\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDouble Indemnity opened on September 6, 1944 and was an immediate hit with audiences - despite a campaign by singer Kate Smith imploring the public to stay away on moral grounds. As James M. Cain recalled, \"...there was a little trouble caused by this fat girl, Kate Smith, who carried on a propaganda asking people to stay away from the picture. Her advertisement probably put a million dollars on its gross.\"\n\nReviews from the critics were largely positive, though the content of the story made some uncomfortable. While some reviewers found the story implausible and disturbing, others praised it as an original thriller. In his mixed review of the film in The New York Times, film critic Bosley Crowther called the picture \"...Steadily diverting, despite its monotonous pace and length.\" He complained that the two lead characters \"...lack the attractiveness to render their fate of emotional consequence,\" but also felt the movie possessed a \"...realism reminiscent of the bite of past French films.\"\n\nHoward Barnes at the New York Herald Tribune was much more enthusiastic, calling Double Indemnity \"...one of the most vital and arresting films of the year,\" and praising Wilder's \"...magnificent direction and a whale of a script.\" The trade paper Variety, meanwhile, said the film \"...sets a new standard for screen treatment in its category.\"\n\nInfluential radio host and Hearst paper columnist Louella Parsons would go even further, saying, \"Double Indemnity is the finest picture of its kind ever made, and I make that flat statement without any fear of getting indigestion later from eating my words.\"\n\nPhilip K. Scheur, the Los Angeles Times movie critic, ranked it with The Human Comedy, The Maltese Falcon, and Citizen Kane as Hollywood trailblazers, while Alfred Hitchcock himself wrote Wilder that \"Since Double Indemnity, the two most important words in motion pictures are 'Billy' and 'Wilder'\".\n\nThe film's critical reputation has only grown over the years. In 1977, notably terse critic-historian Leslie Halliwell gave it an unusual 4-star (top) rating, and wrote: \"Brilliantly filmed and incisively written, perfectly capturing the decayed Los Angeles atmosphere of a Chandler novel, but using a simpler story and more substantial characters.\" In his 1998 review, film critic Roger Ebert praised director Wilder and cinematographer Seitz. He wrote, \"The photography by John F. Seitz helped develop the noir style of sharp-edged shadows and shots, strange angles and lonely Edward Hopper settings.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nman this is such an incredibly really well written/directed/acted movie 2 watch, its got a fantastic cast throughout this movie.....man this is such a brilliant classics movie 2 watch. it is so thrilling it is such a fantastic, movie 2 watch, its got a great cast throughout this movie.....man this is such a brilliant movie 2 watch, it is such a fantastic movie 2 watch.....",

The mystery takes twists and turns, teasing the audience with the direction in which the investigation will go until the inevitable discovery ends the plans Neff and Phyllis took such great care to construct.

Granted, Stanwyck (to me) doesn't look like the kinda dame that a schmuck would risk all for, but she's good in the role. McMurray (especially to those of us who mainly know him from \"My Three Sons\") is a revalation though, perfect in the role as the arrogant dupe. And Eddie G is as awesome as ever - the speech he delivers to his boss about insurance (before taking the boss's glass of water and chugging it down) is a keeper. Exceptionally delivered. But the real star of \"Double Indemnity\" is the script - Chandler and Wilder's dialogue is fast and scattershot and delicious and bounces off the walls, lurid, purple poetry, endlessly rewatchable. The two lead characters may be nasty pieces of work, but Wilder makes the humanity - and the humour - dark, noir humour - shine through the shadows. Love that little dude's work.",

The classic story about the extramarital affair that commits spousal homicide. One of the great classics from Hollywood's golden age, \"Double indemnity\" is a seminal film noir directed by Billy Wilder, based on a novel of the same name authored by James M. Cain, whose inspiration came from a real case dating from 1927. This realistic movie does not portray the mechanics of the real case, the story here is much more sophisticated, intelligent and still perfectly plausible to happen in the reality of that time. In \"Double Indemnity\" we know from the very beginning that things will end terribly wrong. However, we still afford the privilege to witness and experience the tribulations of the evil mind as it meticulously sets in motion the perfect crime. We also experience the emotional unrest of the perpetrator as he verifies the authorities proving him wrong as they slowly unravel the truth. In addition to the wonderfully crafted suspense, this movie is also a wide open window to the complex psychological canvas of the guilty subject who deceives his daily friend until the eventual confession.\n\nThis movie is notable for the excellence of the narrative craft, which is enough to wrap me in the thrilling and realistic story, the dialogues are superb. The naturalistic and effortless acting endows the movie with life and emotional power. Barbara Stanwyck's role stands in my memory as the archetype of the femme fatale, beautiful, lustful, sweet, but a true wolf in sheep's clothing! Fred McMurray and Edward G. Robinson are also at high-level. Except for some memorable scenes, I didn't find the visual style to be particularly notable, the camera work is clean and polished, but apart from the innovative light and shadow work of John F. Seitz, there are no other gimmicks to enhance the visual style, this is a thoroughly realistic and stripped picture. I also lament the less than perfect condition of the film's analog source when it was converted to digital format, a bit more visual integrity and \"Double Indemnity\" would be an immaculate cinematic experience for me. Another wonderful black-and white classic, highly recommended!",

This suspenseful and dark film-noir set the standard for the genre and many imitations and parodies followed in it's wake, but it's a good film and it has some very good performances in it. It begins with insurance salesman Walter Neff (Fred MacMurray) dictating the events that came to this point, all told in flashback. It all began when he met Phyllis Dietrichson (Barbara Stanwyck) at her house to remind her that her husband's (Tom Powers) car insurance is up for renewal. But she wants to take out a life insurance policy on his life, but Neff susses out she's up to something and backs off. But he can't get Phyllis out of his mind, and agrees to help her kill her husband. Which they do, by having Neff jump off a train, and put Dietrichson's body on the line. It seems to go well but Neff's colleague Barton Keyes (Edward G. Robinson) deduces something's not right. It's a very good film, and it has some good dialogue and a good plot too. It's a complex plot and does require attention, but it does pay off at the end, and it shares DNA with Cain's other great crime novel The Postman Always Rings Twice.

It has a murder mystery element to the screenplay. \nA femme fatale in Mrs Dietrechson. (Barbara Stanwyck)\nA suspicious detective in insurance company Mr Solve dodgy claims Mr.  Keys. (Edward G Robinson).\nWalter Neff is an insurance salesman who becomes infatuated with married Dietrechson. So much so that he devises a plan to activate the Double Indemnity clause in a life insurance policy he has just sold to poor Mr Dietrechson.\nMrs Dietrechson could be a very rich widow if her husband had the misfortune to die. Neff explains that were it to happen on a train the claim would be double for some insane reason.\nThe film is directed by Billy Wilder and told in flashback as Neff dictates his confession to Keys.\nNo flash CGI. No gimmicky product placement. Film heaven.",

It demonstrates this idea by a man who gets on the slippery slope of adultery that ends with a double murder. In the process, he loses his career, friend, a woman who really loved him and ultimately his life.\n\nThe main plot of the story is the external one: to get away with the perfect murder in order to be with the woman he loves. This plot ends in failure. Suspicion ruins his love and he commits another murder to hide the first. His suspicion is proven to be misplaced as his lover refuses to kill him before he kills her. In the end, he is caught, confesses and dies from his wounds.\n\nBut we already knew that he doesn't get away since the movie starts with his confession and the whole thing takes place in a flashback that catches up to the present.\n\nIf the movie ended where it began, it would have been a simple morality play about how the slippery slope of the loss of morality (that started with some innocent flirting) can quickly spiral out of control and take everything with it. But our hero chooses to redeem himself at the end. He realizes he has lost everything and chooses to confess. He also choose to put two young lovers who have broken up because of mutual distrust back on track to be reunited. This minor plotline of Lola and her boyfriend's love is crucial to the hero's redemption.\n\nDouble Indemnity is a very tight story. Each character plays roles on multiple plotlines and each scene provides turning points of expanding stakes and meaning. It absolutely proves the idea that even a small loss of morality will lead to the ultimate destruction.\n\nMy Story Chart of the movie is at storycharts.ca",

Basically, it began as an innocent visit to discuss insurance with a Mr. Dietrichson at his home, but when he's not there, he meets Phyllis Dietrichson, played by Barbara Stanwyck, his sultry and flirtatious wife. Eventually, she talks Walter into murdering her husband and making it look like an accident in order to claim a large amount of money. This movie is in incredibly sexy for a movie made in 1944.

It's the blind purpose of alienating other people just for the sake of sacrificing for one person. Manipulation, lust, ignorance. 'Double Indemnity' is all these things that play a part in blindly \"falling in love\" with someone, without knowing that person is acting purely on lustful desires. Once the movie begins and we are introduced to our main character, we are already aware things have taken a bad turn, but we just don't know how bad. All we know is that things are not looking good as our character is about to begin his confession.\r\n\r\nWe cannot help, but feel pity for Neff, but I think we can all agree that this was a lot of stupidity on his part for not using his brain to investigate things further before he went in too deep. This is an engrossing story and as the story unfolds, many layers of the mystery begin to peel off, unveiling one shocking revelation after the next. With each twist and turn, we can feel our insides twisting more and more as the big picture starts to show revealing the disturbing truth.\r\n\r\nThis has everything I love about the film noir genre. From the witty dialogue delivered to its dark tone, its just all in all, a well thought out plot that is bound to cast a spell on its viewer and hold her or his attention until the end. It did for me, and I'll never forget the impact of its story.",

An insurance salesman is drawn in by a wealthy house wife into murdering her husband and collecting his accident policy \"earnings\" that he unknowingly applied to have. However, the investigations of the salesman's boss (Edward G. Robinson), cause the plot to thicken and take dramatic turns when he discovers the events had been premeditated and that the conspirators are right under his nose. Low-lighting techniques are put to great effect and the claustrophobic atmosphere and sets heighten the tension and suspense. Great acting on the part of Robinson makes for an entertaining performance that fully takes advantage of the dialogue and flesh out a strong supporting role. However unoriginal the plot may seem after dozens of these types of movies have been made, it embraces the concept with style and delicately wrought anxiety.",

The story was simple he taught, all he had to do was kill the lady he so desires husband and make it look like an accident, while tricking him to sign an accident insurance policy where everything goes to his lady friend, so he will get the girl and with her comes the money. \n\nThe movie is best put using the word nice, and a classic as it has come to be. Double Indemnity is beautiful and captivating, based on a 1943 novel of the same name by James M. Cain. This movie was the height of film noir in the 40s spring out many copycat B movies from other producers.\n\nThe screenplay is penned down by Billy Wilder, who also directed the movie, and from the way the movie drove you just have to appreciate the work of the screen writer, I while watching I was so eager to know if they will get away with it or not. Fred MacMurray narrated and starred in the movie, although the movie was a huge critical success and was nominated for seven Academy Awards but did not win any. Billy Wilder's writing and directing of this movie is a masterpiece worth treasuring and a work of art worth owning.\n\nThe movie and the book's idea is based on the Double indemnity clause provided in life insurance or accident policy whereby the insurance company agrees to pay the stated multiple (double) of the face amount in the contract in the case of death caused by accidental means.\n\nThe movie was a box office success making over 5 times its production cost, and the cinematography used \"venetian blind\" lighting which became popular in later film noirs. Double Indemnity was well received by the American Film Institute, in AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition) it was rated 29th; it also got other American Film Institute recognitions. \n\nThis movie is wonderful, so if you have not seen or heard about the movie now you have so go see it.\n\nwww.lagsreviews.com",

However while trying to sell some accident insurance he falls for a woman who is married to a former widower. Together they plot and carry out a murder on her irritable husband trying to cash in on a double indemnity clause. Although everything goes as clockwork the two of them must stay apart and Neff's colleague is hot on their trail. Through a series of visits with Deitrichson's depressed step-daughter, Neff himself finds out Phyllis was seeing someone else. In their final confrontation he figures out she killed her husband's first wife . Then she preceded to use Neff for her own purposes. Following their confrontation Neff feels guilt and so he records all he knows for his colleague Keyes to hear later. This movie was definitely full of suspense as well as great characters.

This film became a blue-print for many new fresh ideas in Hollywood film making.\r\n\r\nThe script was written by Wilder & Raymond Chandler & crackled with sharp double on-tundra quips deliciously delivered by both the lead actors Fred MacMurray & Barbara Stanwyck. As the story goes no one else wanted to play the roles in this seedy morally corrupt caper. But as fate would have it both Stanwyck & MacMurray were perfect for the parts & did some of their very best work on screen. I would also be remiss in not mentioning the great Edward G. Robinson's performance as Keyes, the claims manager who is the detective in this noir classic. What is really fascinating is the uniquely nuanced relationships amongst the leads. Particularly Robinson's & MacMurrays characters who clearly respect & care very much for one another. Perhaps they love each other as colleagues & friends. And what is the real story between Stanwyck's & MacMurray? Do they love each other? It seems not, right up to the final scene when thay are together. We never will really know. Brilliant stuff!\r\n\r\nAlong with the legendary photography of one John Seitz who really developed the noir style with this picture. With it's high contrast scenes, to it's sharp edged shadows & interesting angles & composition Seitz helped create a look that is a classic & has been copied countless times in films to follow.\r\n\r\nThe film is unique & brilliant in it's detail. It's brilliant in its cold characters, it's more realistic portrayal of the personal frailties & greed of our species. It stripped back the layers of naivety & reveled a much more cynical & raw realism that was certainly cutting edge when the film was released to an appreciative audience in 1944.\r\n\r\nLike many of the great films one viewing is not enough to fully appreciate this films brilliance & artistry. Double indemnity is surely one of the great Hollywood films of all time.",

Billy Wilder, Howard Hawks, John Ford, Alfred Hitchcock; all renowned people within cinema history, but were unknown in my book. Little did I care to learn about these filmmakers, nor did I care to see their work because it was too \"old school\" for me. Boy, am I glad to have seen this film. \n\nJames M. Cain, the author of \"The Postman Always Rings Twice\" which is the source material for the narrative, is beautifully translated from book to film by Billy Wilder's deft hands. The narrative's where all the glory is at: it flows like liquid gold with tensely interesting twists and turns from start to finish; no hiccups found here. And what's found within the storytelling is one of the most highly engaging and innovative crime thrillers to date. Though \"Double Indemnity\" is already regarded as an exceedingly entertaining film due to the narrative, the film surpasses further due to flawless directing. The noir elements audiences have come to know are present, but with spotless results. The style \"Double Indemnity\" takes to deliver crisp, sharp-edged shadows, the breathtakingly distinct shots, and the narrative told by flashback are nothing short of astonishing. \n\nMerely, everything about \"Double Indemnity\" is perfect. Billy Wilder managed to craft a masterpiece that remains fresh even to the 21st century. Nothing short of cutting-edge, \"Double Indemnity\" is brimming with an atmosphere of a cool, cold cockeyed-ness style -- a film that will not be forgotten for decades to come.",

The murder scheme certainly is not the most difficult part, the real challenge is after the evil conduct, in one hand, Walter's super-acute superior Keyes (a bona-fide scene-stealer Edward G. Robinson) who gradually detects the real motive after the presuming accident death; on the other hand, the more devilish past of Phyllis suggests that there is an even bigger conspiracy is under the way.\n\nOne could never argue that the script is prodigiously witty and most notably is Keyes\u00e2(TM) eloquence in harnessing his professional intuition (\u00e2the little man inside\u00e2?) to find out the loophole behind any ostensibly qualified insurance cases. It\u00e2(TM)s quite unimaginable that Robinson had been snubbed for a supporting acting nomination while the film has acquired 7, including BEST PICTURE, DIRECTOR and LEADING ACTRESS (without win though); while MacMurray, had been eluded by the Academy throughout his wholesome career, potentially had delivered his best work in depicting an ambiguous figure with all he had; Stanwyck\u00e2(TM)s role is a tad feeble due to her not-too-copious presence but she is just marvellous to watch with each gesture and expression entangled with her own breed of complexity, but the final convolution of her heartlessness-turns-soft tactic is a self-conscious compromise, woman falls prey of a man\u00e2(TM)s world is just an illusionary chimera, which has been haunting us until this moment and will thrive on and on.",

And it is simply because the art form was still in its adolescent phase. In acting, special effects, music, etc., I feel that generally, movies are only getting better,  the majority of older movies I've seen being drab, boring, and stodgy by comparison. I feel like it has been impressed on me over and over that old movies are superior to new because they came first, or that they are purer artistically. It is reckoned as heresy, or at least a sign of boorishness, not to appreciate \"films\" from the Golden Age of Hollywood. Also, simply because a noted contemporary director idolizes certain old movies, as Scorsese showed his feelings in Hugo, does not mean I should like it. Perhaps numerous old classics are worthwhile because of their influence on later generations, or because they introduced novel techniques which became widespread. This makes them then important for film students, or as a diversion for someone interested in tracing the evolution of moviemaking. Take \"M\" for example, almost universally hailed as a masterpiece. It's sense of dread and atmosphere, its lurid subject matter, and it's use of music were influential; personally, I found it extremely dull. No doubt perhaps Billy Wilder was influenced by it in making this film noir. At any rate, as this digression has consumed so much space, although I found, honestly, that most widely acclaimed movies pre-1970s were not worth watching, clearly there were a number of well-made movies that, even now, decades on, can still provoke and entertain, and . These are movies that transcend their technical and dramatic limitations. Double Indemnity is one of them, and naturally there are many others. But if you are of a certain cast of mind, who is historically minded and respectful of canonization, you have to cast off the pressure that the critical establishment places on your shoulders to enjoy \"art\". So, anyway, Double Indemnity is a firecracker of a movie. The story is a textbook example of a noir and the script is just filled with clever, funny dialogue, and great characters who just flow together on screen. You really forget you're watching a movie released in 1944, over 60 years ago.",

Billy Wilder's first huge success, ushered in his run of stone cold classics. This is as important as nearly any American Film for the possibilities it offered for everyone who followed and copied/echoed it. MacMurray was a great choice for the lead, as he is quite easily believable as an honest man gone wrong \"I did it for the money, did it for the girl\".  I definitely saw parallels between this and Dostoevsky's Crime & Punishment in the way the aftermath of the crime and the guilt and conscience eats at Neff and Raskolnikov.

Phyllis is miserable in her marriage and casually drops a hint about getting life insurance for her husband. Neff deduces Phyllis's plan to kill her husband and collect the insurance money. He stars an affair with her, and he both plan the murder together. It goes off without a hitch, but Neff's boss isn't so sure that it was an accident.\n\nFred MacMurray gives one of his all-time best performances in a dead serious role. MacMurray is known for his family comedies, but he plays Neff spectacularly. Billy Wilder seams to bring out he best in MacMurray, in strange roles for him. Barbra Stanwyck plays a classic Femme Fatale s Phyllis. Another good performance.\n\nOverall, this movie doesn't live up to the great noirs, but it is a very strong movie, with a good message.\n\n\"Yes, I killed him.

The elements in it - the performances, the music, the dialogue, and even those little hints of alternating homosexuality AND heterosexuality in Walter Neff's mind - were, to say in the least, greatly depicted by Billy Wilder's brilliant direction. But above all else, what really stood out from all others was Barbara Stanwyck's chilling part as Phyllis Dietrichson. I could see at once why she is considered even today as being the iciest femme fatale in film history. She isn't just icy and scheming - she's simply too dangerous and murderous even for a femme fatale. The way she hooks on Neff to her schemes, and then dumps him, struck me as horrifying, as though she were a sort of Oriental seductress-courtesan entrancing Neff to kill her fat and oafish Sultan. Her words and dialogue seem to provide a brief key to her real character, but her beauty strips away all that. Ultimately, thus, that is what made Double Indemnity a really chilling noir. The other chilling part of it is, of course, how both Neff and Stanwyck react to the eventual downfall of their schemes and plans, and how the once collaborating lovers become murderous enemies. Dietrichson may have got what she deserved in the end, but her death signifies that Neff too must go down. That part of the film takes place after the ending. What we really want from it is what we get - the schemes, the plots, and their eventual collapse.",

I will probably have to check out Stalag 17 and The Apartment next.\r\n\r\nIt was bold to start Double Indemnity with the ending.  Not only does the audience know that the anti-hero is guilty of the crime within the first few minutes, but we also know that he is probably going to get caught.  What lead to the confession is told through flashback narration.\r\n\r\nIt took me a while to warm up to Double Indemnity because of the stylized acting and occasionally corny line of dialogue.

Cain, directed by Billy Wilder, script by Wilder and Raymond Chandler, and starring Fred MacMurray, Barabra Stanwyck, and Edward G. Robinson. Damn.\n\nThankfully, this talent doesn't go to waste at all, and the end result is one of the greatest entries into the film noir genre. The plot concerns an insurance salesman named Walter Neff who, smitten with a client's wife, schemes with her to kill the husband in an accident like fashion in order to cash in on the double indemnity clause of their policy- a cluase that will pay out double than normal in the event of a death caused by accident. Things get tricky though, when a suspicious claims adjuster who works with Neff is assigned to the case.\n\nThis is a smart, suspenseful, and tightly written thriller, and despite how old it is, really holds up extremely well. The film has also been very influential not only on the film noir genre, but also several films by a couple of guys you may have heard of named Joel and Ethan Coen (among others). Wilder's direction is superb, and the acting is brilliant. MacMurray and Stnawyck had never done anything quite this sleazy and gritty before, and this also marked the start of a long tenure as a supporting character actor for Robinson..something he was great at.\n\nFrom the music, to the technical details like cinematography, editing, etc, the tightness of the plot is made even more spectacular, and this is hands down one of the best ever. Leave it at that and go see it.",

I don't think he ever calls her by her first name, constantly calling her \"baby,\" while giving a great example of a man bored with his career and excited by a challenge and a hot dame. Edward G. Robinson is fabulous too. I was amazed by that suicide statistics speech! I don't think Miklos Rozsa's perfect score gets enough credit for creating the mood of this picture.

They're pretty passionate, and they want to get married-- but instead of leaving her husband, Phyllis wants Walter to kill him so they can cash in on his insurance policy. All goes good, and no one suspects them: until Walter's super smart boss (Robinson) suspects that all isn't as it seems ... \"Double Indemnity\" is one of the best movies ever made in every sense. It's the definitive film noir, started a trend in plot devices, brings home to bacon of what you expect a '40's movie to be like, and then-- you get Billy Wilder directing, and that's the key to why the film isn't as ordinary as it could be. Wilder wanted this to be one of those steamy, erotic thrillers, but we all know that those didn't exist in the 1940's due to the Hays Code, and Paramount wouldn't allow anything \"sexy\". Wilder, one of the smartest movie makers of all time, works around it. We know Walter and Phyllis are having an affair, but do we see it? Nope. The most \"dirty\" thing going on is them kissing, but we get the hint. Then of course, we have the crime of the movie. But all murderers had to be caught in the '40's. Does he get caught? Yep, but Wilder fashions it to the point to where it covers the plot twist area, and makes no disappointment available. Who knows how he did it?? Better off, he gets help from screenwriter Raymond Chandler (one of the biggest drunks of the time) who he didn't like, but Chandler makes the lines absolutely perfect, and makes Phyllis more cheap and evil, and Walter the wholesome guy who gives into temptation. Stanwyck was nominated for an Oscar for Best Actress, and Wilder was for directing (who knows how they didn't win) but who gives a crap if they won or not? \"Double Indemnity\" will always be one of the best, and most daring films of all time.

Double Indemnity pushes the boundaries of the film in that sexual motivation becomes a key part of Neff's character as well as the advancement of the plot. There's plenty of both subtle and blatant symbols; The fact that Neff is always lighting the match for Keyes with a role-reversal at the end, the positions of the characters in the frame to assert dominance (as plenty of films employ) and an archetypical \"car wont start\" that has finagled its way into any modern film that claims to evoke suspense. You know a film has had a lasting impression when an action or event began in said film becomes commonplace in modern film 70 years later (Psycho? okay, maybe 50 years later.) The characters are so well developed and the lighting is brilliant (for a noir film and particularly in the artistic sense). The brilliant piece of the film is how the suspense is evoked. We're told that he did it, by him, within the first few moments, but we keep wondering how, why, and when. This evokes more suspense than if we would be wondering if they get caught or not. We have to worry about three elements rather than one. The original noir to implement the frame narrative, followed by plenty of noirs that executed the same styllistic storytelling in response to how well it preformed (Out of the Past???). In conclusion, not only a classic, but an archetypical noir, frame narrative, and suspense thriller.",

            "content": "I never really knew what the definition of a film noir was until I saw Double Indemnity. Not only does Billy Wilder's adapted crime-drama epitomize the genre, but it redefined the careers of Fred MacMurray, Barbara Stanwyck, and Edward G. Robinson and reestablished Wilder's versatility as a director. \n\nYou needn't be attuned to insurance to understand this film. The succinct writing and story delivers all of this for the audience, taking the basic practices of insurance policies (with all of their bureaucratic loopholes) and placing them into a heinous murder plot. It's the kind of film that addresses that damning \"what if\" scenario so many Americans probably contemplate with insurance policies but dare not demoralize. But this is Los Angeles, in the Golden Age 40's, and murder can arise from almost anything. \n\nThe plot opens with Walter Neff, an insurance agent 15+ years in the business. With experience and credentials like that, you'd expect him to recognize scandals. And that's the irony of it--he's seduced by a deadly femme fatale (Barbara Stanwyck) to the point of abandoning logic and reason just for a scent of her honeysuckle (you get the point). Neff reports back to his insurance manager, Barton Keyes--a derisive but knowledgeable friend who despises Neff just as much as he trusts him. Keyes is definitely the film's most interesting character, and G. Robinson delivers an Oscar-worthy performance with every scene he's in. Keyes is the guru, the wizard, the indefatigable man who ceaselessly investigates the insurance scam. He keeps everybody on edge, from Neff to the audience, and utilizes his wit to test the limitations of Neff's waning conscience. As a result, what we see is a suspenseful, dark, morbidly funny, and even earnest film that is packed with a cadaverous ambience that can only be defined as film noir. \n\nDouble Indemnity is one of the greatest films to emerge from the 1940's era and made an indelible mark on the genre of film noir. It opened my eyes and enlightened me to films with similar and/or recognizable themes. Honeysuckle never smelt so murderous, or perhaps, murder has never smelt so sweet.",

Featuring superb direction from the great Billy Wilder, beautiful black-and-white cinematogrpahy, and pitch-perfect performances from Fred MacMurray, Barbara Stanwyck, and Edward G. Robinson, Double Indemnity remains an American classic that explores the lines between black and white/good and evil.  A taunt descent into the psychology of desire and greed, Double Indemnity remains a compelling thriller that deftly blends humor, streetwise dialogue, and ethical infractions together into a heady yet thoroughly entertaining film that dared to tackle taboo issues in its day.",

But the ultimate power here derives from the rippling, infectious script, one that grabs the viewer by the throat with its glib directness while maintaining a brooding and enigmatic quality about the way these characters approach each other, and their internal impulses. The hard-boiled language comes at a clip that is practically hypnotic.\r\n\r\nDefinitely one of the cinematic landmarks of its era, confidently persuasive in its ability to wrap the viewer up in its dark, entertaining web.

MacMurray plays an insurance agent, Walter Neff.  Stanwyck is Phyllis Dietrichson.  These two characters get involved in murdering her husband and making it look like an accidental death so she can get twice as much money off of the insurance policy.  This film is told in flashbacks, as it starts with Neff recording his confession for his co-worker Barton Keyes (Edward G. Robinson).  Neff then becomes the narrator for the rest of the film through extended flashbacks.  Keyes thinks something is strange and that the death, might not have been accidental.  At this point there are plot twists galore.  Double Indemnity was incredibly well made.  The two leads had great chemistry with one other, and MacMurray was great as an accomplice to murder, a type of role he was certainly not known for.  The black and white cinematography was beautiful, with dim lighting and lots of shadows, just to make the genre a little bit more obvious to everyone who watched.  I loved this film and was thoroughly entertained the entire time.  I would recommend this one as well for those interested in seeing one of the best American films of all time.

            "content": "Walter Neff is an insurance salesman for Pacific All Risk Insurance Company.  He falls for Phyllis Dietrichson, the wife of a client of his, and is drawn into a plan to kill Mr. Dietrichson and pocket the insurance money.  Between the two of them they come up with the perfect murder, so good it not only looks like an accident, but ensures that the insurance pays out double the usual sum insured - double indemnity.  Between them and the money stands Barton Keyes, Pacific Insurance's Head of Claims.  Experienced, wily and possessing a sixth sense for claims fraud he is a formidable adversary...\n\nBrilliant crime drama - a film-noir classic.  Written by Raymond Chandler book and directed by master-director Billy Wilder, this is great on so many levels: the clever plot (especially the murder plan, which is so good you almost want them to succeed); the snappy, often funny, dialogue and the excellent, engaging performances.  Moreover, there's a smoothness and coolness about this, a hallmark of film noir.\n\nOnly things missing from making this one of the greatest movies of all times is a good twist and possibly less predictability.  The use of flashbacks to tell the story sort of gives away the direction the plot is taking.\n\nGood work by Fred MacMurray as Neff, Barbara Stanwyck as Phyllis and Edward G Robinson as Keyes.  In hindsight, Humphrey Bogart would have made a better Neff, but then you could say that about any 1940s role requiring a cool, tough, smooth-talking, wise-cracking male lead.  Fred MacMurray does well and doesn't really put a foot wrong, but I kept thinking \"Imagine Bogie in the role...\".\n\nBarbara Stanwyck got a well-deserved Best Leading Actress Oscar nomination for playing Phyllis.\n\nThe film itself garnered seven Oscar nominations but no wins, losing out on Best Picture to Going My Way, the so-so musical starring Bing Crosby.  Billy Wilder got his first Best Director nomination and fourth writing nomination for Double Indemnity.  He would have to wait for his next movie, The Lost Weekend, for his first win.",

            "content": "This is certainly a worthy film and an archetypal film noir, but I can't help but compare it to the novel that it is based on and be a little disappointed. In a lot of ways, the film cannot really be blamed for lacking some of what the novel has; the Production Code of 1944 Hollywood simply would not allow much of the novel's dark content to be put on screen. Still, though, watching this movie today is not nearly as electrifying an experience as reading the James M. Cain novel is.\n\nThe core of the plot, the scheme by an insurance agent and a seductive woman to murder the woman's husband and collect the insurance money, does remain intact, and it's still a compelling story. Much of what happens after the central murder, however, is condensed, erased, or otherwise sanitized. Without wishing to reveal the ending of either work, I'll say that the movie's ending feels much more conventional, whereas the book's ending goes to some truly dark and shocking places. The characters have also lost some depth and intensity in the transition to film.\n\nAll that being said, it is still a good movie. Fred MacMurray's performance is nicely understated. Barbara Stanwyck, in an Oscar-nominated role, does do a good job with the relatively limited scenes she is given, and does have one perverse shot of one of the more disturbing facial expressions I've seen in a movie. Edward G. Robinson makes quite an impression in the smaller role of a suspicious insurance claims adjuster. The movie is well-made, with lots of the stark shadows typical of a good 1940s noir. It's really interesting to consider that, after this, director Billy Wilder went on to make some of the funniest comedies ever, such as Some Like It Hot and The Seven-Year Itch. This movie is worth watching for noir fans, but don't let it replace the experience of reading the book for you.",

            "content": "Billy Wilder\u00e2(TM)s \u00e2Double Indemnity\u00e2\u009d is a classic film noir of which I had often heard, but never seen or knew much about, so I had nothing to create expectations around as I went in. I saw it in Greenbriar Theater and noticed that the room was a bit fuller than usual. I guess, unlike Juno, people had not seen it before and had all waited until the last showing, as I had.\n\nThe movie did a great job of absorbing me into its atmosphere from the very beginning. I was definitely interested from the moment I saw the silhouette of the man with the crutches and heard the entrancing music, and having a bleeding man confess to a murder on tape was certainly enough to get my attention.\n\nI thought Fred MacMurray\u00e2(TM)s performance as the unsavory insurance salesman was interesting. At first, I frowned at his monotone, thinking him just a bad actor, but the scene where explains his motives changed my mind. He compared himself to a casino worker, wanting to rip off the house just because he thought he was the only one who could get away with it. Even for a murder motive, that is remarkably cold-blooded. He really does not feel any moral qualms about it, and the movie is only stronger for never calling him a psychopath.\n\nOn the other hand, his dispassionate demeanor creates an awkward dissonance in his romantic scenes. A lot of people in the theater laughed out loud when Phyllis came to his apartment and they kissed. It was partly funny because he grabbed her so firmly and mashed his face onto hers so indelicately. I also thought his cold monotone and blank expression did not suit the repeated usage of \u00e2baby,\u00e2\u009d or any other expression of affection. It just seemed unnatural. The line, \u00e2Shut up, baby\u00e2\u009d was especially funny to me.\n\nThe opening credits said that the film was based on a novel by James M. Cain. I have not read it, but my impression while watching the movie is that the screenplay may have quoted from the novel a bit excessively. Walter\u00e2(TM)s voiceover describes the room where he meets with Phyllis in a very literary way. He does not need to describe at all, since, via the magic of cinema, we can see it, and it is an unnecessary digression from Walter\u00e2(TM)s confession to Keyes. If I had to guess, I would say that the description was lifted from the book and grafted onto the script.\n\nThere were other instances of rambling voiceover. One occurred after Walter said he knew where to go to find out if Keyes suspected him. We all instantly knew that he was going to go to his office, but rather than simply cut Keyes\u00e2(TM)s office, Walter pauses for dramatic effect and then spells it out for us. More amusing was when Walter reminisced on Keyes\u00e2(TM)s metaphor about the trolley, and how the last stop is the cemetery. As if we would not understand what that meant, Walter notes what goes on at the cemetery. Then, as if we still were not getting it, he told us straight out that they put dead people there. Not one to leave any dead horse unbeaten, Walter then wondered out loud whether that meant that he or Phyllis would end up dead, as if we could not have followed his line of logic on our own.\n\nDespite all this, as I left the theater, I still thought the movie had an intriguing story- an academic approach to murder. I also found the relationship between Walter and Keyes fascinating and an interesting contrast to the film\u00e2(TM)s dark heart.",

            "content": "This film is putting a hard fight to Sunset Blvd on my book as Billy Wilder's best film. Both films are excellently acted, directed, written, and highly entertaining. Sunset Blvd cleverly mixes noir with black comedy, while Double Indemnity is a very intriguing noir thriller, which is certainly one of the bests of the 40s. I didn't like Some Like it Hot or The Apartment as everybody did, though I still can enjoy them, I prefer Witness for the Prosecution actually, but Double Indemnity is one of my favorites of the 1940s. \r\nThe performances in this film are very impressive from its two leads, and from the rest of the cast two. On the opening scene when the main character arrives to tape his confession you can see the concern in his eyes and face, you can see how nervous he is, you can even see he is very sweaty. This is clever acting. The woman also does a good job with her character. No scene in particular comes to my mind, but she throughout is pretty good at her role.\r\nThe writing in this film is incredibly good. Billy Wilder has a great talent for writing. He details his characters with great care, making them what they are supposed to be, giving each of them its own importance. The dialogues are very amusing too in this film. And the general plot is very intriguing and exciting. The screenplay of this film is clearly one of the best of the first half of the 20th century, and probably the best of the 40s, if not it is only topped by the wonderfully dark British noir The Third Man.\r\nBut the spotlight must go to Billy Wilder, the crafter of this movie, the architect, the basis. His direction is extremely well done, with intense, funny and even romantic moments, making the viewer feel the emotions he needs to feel in the right time. He works with his characters in a very good way, directing them all to become their characters and to believe what they are saying. The film's tone and atmosphere is dark, what was an achievement Wilder was looking for, and he does it effectively. \r\nThe film is very thrilling, which is one of my favorite aspects from it and probably what makes it so great for me. The story is  a very intriguing one, and we get attached to the characters from the word go. But it is the great suspense we get from this film that makes me love it. This is what makes it possible to be greater than Sunset Blvd, though it is still a hard choice.\r\nI didn't feel it was perfect enough to give it an E, it felt like there was something that could have been done better, but it is still a very good film that is probably one of my favorites.\r\nAmp Stamp: S for Superb",

Then again, he wrote \"Ace in the Holy\", so there. However, its familiar plot, reserved performances (from Barbara Stanwyck and Edward G. Robinson), and twist at the end makes this one of those films you need to see during your life. \n\nThis film is about Walter Neff (Fred MacMurray), who's this god amongst all insurance salesmen until he meets up with Phyllis Dietrichson (Stanwyck), who expresses general discontentment with her husband. With that and his sudden lust for her (he's single), Walter decides to hatch up this plan to make the both of them rich: get the husband to sign up for accident insurance and kill him in an accident of sorts. This seems to go well for the first few days, then Barton Keyes (Robinson) starts looking into it to see if it conforms to standard procedure. Then all hell breaks loose.\n\nMany have stated before me that the cinematography in this film is just amazing - and it is. Wilder tends to make even the most trivial of situations (sitting at an insurance desk, shopping, riding a train) into some of the most frightening of situations. Also, the script isn't what you would expect from a man whose history, until Ed Sikov's \"On Sunset Blvd.\" was published in 1999, was somewhat muddled by stories and general apathy - this seems very suited for English-speaking audiences. No faults - everything's so natural. And so groovy - the result of Billy listening to jazz records in his teenage years.\n\nI recommend it for a film noir aficionado or anybody who wants a change in pace. Don't want the villain to be glamorized? You've come to the right choice, my friend.",

The calculating Phyllis has Walter sell her husband a accident policy, then a short time later kill her husband making it look like accident; so they can collect the $100,000 on the 'Double Indemnity' clause, but then what almost seemed like the perfect crime begins to fall apart because of the two characters absolute mistrust of one another, and the fact that Walter's best friend and colleague Barton Keyes, played by Edward G.

It's hard to picture Walter Neff so easily manipulated into killing a man he doesn't know - the characterization just isn't there - but towards the end it's so easy to sympathize for him.

            "content": "\"Double Indemnity\" has been labeled the greatest film noir, and I couldn't agree more. Everything in this movie was spot-on perfect. The dialogue was all natural and every meticulous detail put into writing the script was all there for a REASON. For example in one scene Fred MacMurray's character impersonates a soon-to-be dead man on a train, and has a very brief conversation with a random man. Normally a scene like this would be just to simply add character development, or some sort of humor. But here it all comes full circle in the end, as the \"bad-guy\" gets what is coming to him. Typically in the world of film noir, there never are clear good guys, and bad guys. That is a clear theme in this movie, as ambiguity runs thick. One particular character named Keys(played brilliantly by Edward G. Robinson), starts off to look like the antagonist of the film. Going against the two cocky main characters. But as we get wrapped into this dark story of crime, we side more with him than MacMurray or Stanwyck. This, of course, is a method Billy Wilder uses ingeniously to his advantage, throwing  the audience off balance as to what is right and what is wrong in this movie. In film noir, there is neither. Dark lighting, good camera angles, and contrasting shadows make this movie what it is. That, and some haunting narration by MacMurray throughout the whole duration of the film. It is a particularly dark movie for it's time, but certainly is a classic. All three leads play their rolls quite well. The two main(MacMurray and Stanwyck), both too arrogant to think things through, and Robinson to counter that. Movie like \"Double Indemnity\" expose the darker side of cinema, and prove that Hollywood can do more then just recycled, optimistic films. Of all the noirs made in it's time, and even today, \"Double Indemnity\" has got to be the best of it's kind. Or at least ONE of the best.",

            "content": "DOUBLE INDEMNITY is classic film noir in so many ways, it's hard to discuss without rambling on about its praises. All its elements conjoin with such attitude and panache that it's probably one of the few films where style drips from every frame without overwhelming the equally engaging substance. If any movie were the ultimate crime film, it's DOUBLE INDEMNITY. \n\nFor those who unfamiliar with film noir, it's a genre characterized by the strategic use of black and white film to emphasize the negativity of the human condition. Few noir characters are moral, even fewer are likable. But the look of film noir seems to work some sort of magic wherever it's employed; by its very nature, however, the genre takes itself so seriously that it becomes tough to do without veering into overstatement or parody. When it's done right, the result is DOUBLE INDEMNITY; when it's done wrong, you get Frank Miller's THE SPIRIT. DOUBLE INDEMNITY succeeds because it avoids all the genre pitfalls and doesn't pull any punches, delivering a sly, gritty, and sinister morality tale about sexual temptations and forbidden fruit.\n\nWalter Neff (Fred MacMurray) is a stoic, morally ambiguous, and fast talking insurance salesman. When we first meet him, he's also practically dead. Bleeding profusely from a bullet wound in the shoulder, he lumbers weakly into his boss' office and prepares to record a confession of double murder. How and why is what the rest of the film answers, as in the best of noir traditions, our \"protagonist\" must retell his story in first person. And what a story... lust, sex, murder, fraud, and then of course, the inevitable brush with the law. Turns out he was seduced by Phyllis, a sultry femme fatale (Barbara Stanwyck) who wanted his help to kill her husband and cash in a major life insurance policy. Foolish average joe that he is, Neff falls for her totally, raising the suspicions of his insurance boss (Edward G. Robinson). What follows is a taut thriller about seedy and sordid murderers who by today's standards might seem tame, but whose snappy, pointed dialogue is loaded with frank double entendres that will still raise your eyebrows if you're really paying attention. In 1944, the Hays Code stipulated that one couldn't use profanity or sexual references overtly, but that just meant Raymond Chandler and Billy Wilder had to find creative ways to say just as much in subtler ways. Furthermore, while color films were growing in popularity, DOUBLE INDEMNITY's black and white photography was not only a stylistic choice but also a symbolic one; the controlled range of contrasts symbolizes the characters\u8292\u8059\u8076 literally shady morality. They commit a crime in a black and white world, but we see the moral gray area. Shadows arc high on apartment walls, and in some parts you'll swear there's no way they could fit anymore darkness into the frame. The silhouettes of window shades end up looking like prison bars on the walls, and the smoky haze created by characters' cigarettes never lets us forget that these people are up to no good. It's expertly shot, and anyone seeking to make a crime thriller of any type should school themselves in this film almost exclusively.\n\nSince it was one of the first films to legitimize crime drama, DOUBLE INDEMNITY originally caused quite a controversy. Like many film noirs, it hinges on adultery; its characters are inherently alluring because they\u8292\u8059\u8076re tempted by sex. Second, they\u8292\u8059\u8076re murderers, and the plot explains how to commit a crime for money. These were HUGE red flags in 1944, but with a certain amount of artistry, one could get away with them. So things like the double entendre dialogue passed the censors, but audiences still got it. Plus, it's worth noting that we never see the murder; in fact, the script never even includes the word \"murder\" in connection to the crime. Instead, we see Stanwyck\u8292\u8059\u8076s face. Her husband\u8292\u8059\u8076s being killed right next to her, but we see only her smile; it's a restrained shot for dramatic effect that makes the reality feel worse. (That\u8292\u8059\u8076s noir.) Even smaller details abound, as when MacMurray walks down a street and can\u8292\u8059\u8076t hear his footsteps on the pavement, like he\u8292\u8059\u8076s a dead man. It's a chilling moment that heightens the suspense and foreshadowing. Finally, there's only one moment of moral goodwill in the film--whenever Neff lights boss Edward G. Robinson's cigars for him. It\u8292\u8059\u8076s reversed by the end of the film because one good turn deserves another, but that provides the only emotional core of the picture. Once that happens, it\u8292\u8059\u8076s over. As with most noirs, there are no clear-cut \"good guys\" in DOUBLE INDEMNITY. Maybe that's why its style doesn't overwhelm us, because its characters have real, flawed, and honest substance. It's refreshing to see a film that can comment on the depravity of humankind while reinforcing our moral sensibilities and looking amazingly moody while doing it. So do yourself a favor; give in and watch the film.",

I loved this film so much that I literally wanted to rewatch it as soon as it was over.  Barbara Stanwyck is THE perfect femme fatale, except her wig was suuuper distracting.  However, my favourite person to watch on screen was Edward G. Robinson and his entertaining way of fast-talking, lol.  The movie offers many plot twists and heart-pumping moments.  It's simply one of the best in it's genre.  It proves Wilder can direct anything.",

It is such a breathtaking, sexy, beautiful film of deliciousness. Well acted and contains terrific, scathing dialogue, this film has turns and twists, and essentially set the bar for mystery and suspense movies of the 1940's. It is a well crafted murder mystery, that essentially has two plots. One follows the enactment of the murder along with the plotting of the brutal crime, and the second, follows the criminal's plan go wrong, with little cracks developing, eventually showing their identity to the world. Credit for greatness must go MacMurray (who some say was not great but I personally could not picture anyone else in this role and he was very good), the sexy and breathtaking Stanwyck, the pervasive Robinson, and two the supporting cast. As well Chandler and Wilder should be complemented for their extraordinary efforts. My favourite film of Wilder's, my favourite film of the 1940's cinema, and one the best films of all time. Masterpiece! Incidently, to those who love watching old movies or are Wilder fans, you must watch his 1960 masterpiece The Apartment and this film at the same time, and you will find some astonishing similarities (although the genre of both films is incredibly different).",

The same was used here, but not from the deceased, but from an individual dying of guilt, transforming a regular narration to further the movement of the story into an overheard full-fledged confession of the crime.One of the main points of it being a perfect noir film is the inclusion of the primary moral flaws and human misdemeanors always present in the said genre: greed, forbidden affair, betrayal, and ultimately, murder. \"Double Indemnity\" also shows the complications arising from insurance policies, and how it reignites dark intents for material advantage. A practice of pure storytelling, and in some ways supports Hitchcockian views, that a \"perfect murder\" is nothing but illusory.",

Many have written about the post-war sense of paranoia that shadowed America in the mid-to-late 1940's, as the dark intentions of our WWII Soviet allies became all too clear.  The sense that perhaps there are no good guys, that no one is to be trusted, and that darkness lies beneath every gleaming surface is everywhere here in Billy Wilder's masterpiece.  An essential element of the film's pessimism is its beginning, which is in fact an ending--insurance salesman Walter Neff (Fred MacMurray) is gravely injured, hobbling into his office to dictate a confession to his boss (Edward G. Robinson).  The Dietrichson case, accident and double indemnity, was indeed a murder, as suspected.  Only the wrong suspect was pursued.  I'm giving away nothing by revealing Neff as the real killer.  \"I did it for money, and for a woman.  Only I didn't get the money, and I didn't get the woman.\"  Indeed, by the end, Neff no longer wants the treacherous Phyllis (Barbara Stanwyck, amazingly enticing and poisonous here).  Neff has been a fool, and a tool, and discovers through his disastrous caper that he may be rotten, only Phyllis is \"a little more rotten.\"  They have conspired to kill Phyllis' husband for the insurance payoff, the oldest scheme in the book, but as an insider Neff has plotted an ingenious chronology of events to throw off any investigation.  Knowing from the outset though that the plan will fall apart lends the proceedings their whole doomed appeal.  We know that this will be a world without happy endings or heroes.  People are unpredictable, fate is cruel, and stylish dialogue exchanges mask deep inner desperation.  Phyllis has secrets, you see, and some are all too willing to talk.  Neff will learn the hard way what every general knows:  a battle plan collapses the minute the battle starts.  He will find himself spinning different stories for different people, desperately back-peddaling and dashing around, under, and ahead of the investigation, Phyllis' enemies, and the vixen herself.  The byplay between the leads is witty to say the least, and their chemistry sizzles, as of course it must in all doomed romances.  It's telling that both the angel (Robinson, playing boss and best friend Keyes) and devil (Phyllis) in Neff's life offer him a path towards his future.  He can choose a promotion and years pushing paper behind a desk with Keyes, or he can go for the easy woman and the easy money.  Unfortunately, Neff will learn that he lives in a world where nothing comes easy but trouble, and where endings are inevitable but not necessarily happy.",

For the most part, quite happy with the results. Yeah, they were mostly predictable, but that meant that I ended up winning the Oscar Pool I was in. No money involved, but I am milking those bragging rights for all they're worth. I only got 3 wrong. I missed Foreign Film, even though I considered switching it at the last minute. I shoulda known that the same thing that happened to Pan's Labyrinth and Waltz With Bashir would happen to this year's frontrunner, The White Ribbon, but didnt listen to my gut there. I did pay attention to that for the sound awards, picking Hurt Locker for both, which is what gave me my edge. Well that, and following EW's advice for the shorts. The one short I missed was Animated Short, and having seen all the nominees I was kinda sad about the result. Yes, Logorama was the most inventive and original at least as far as the visual, but I found the story itself quite boring. If anything was gonna beat out Wallace & Gromit I was hoping for Granny O'Grimm's or The Lady and The Reaper. The last one I missed was adapted screenplay. Did not see Precious coming at all, and was quite sad that what shoulda been a lock for \"Up In The Air\" resulted in that film going home empty handed.\r\n\r\nAs far as the ceremony itself, it was rather unmemorable. My two favorite moments (without thinking too hard about it) were wicked early in the program: NPH's surprise appearance and Christoph Waltz's \"uber bingo\". Alec Baldwin and Steve Martin were great, but nothing much was really happening otherwise.\r\n\r\nAt least now I can relax for a few months on that front. Except for being very gung-ho about Shutter Island, there isnt really much speculating to do yet for next year :-D\r\n\r\nNow--Double Indemnity. I'd actually sat down to watch Swing Time instead, but then went down to check the mail and Double Indemnity was waiting for me (bee tee dubs, I now own or can easily access all the rest of the AFI's). I'd been really wanting to see this one. The whispers of a plot I'd heard really intrigued me. Sounded like my kinda thing.\r\n\r\nSadly, as has often been the case, I was a bit distracted so I didnt get into it as much as I woulda liked. This will definitely merit a second watch at some point in the hopefully not to distant future. I mostly followed the dialogue but missed most of the visual. But the story didnt disappoint.\r\n\r\nReally liked Fred MacMurray. He caught my eye when I recognized him from The Apartment. Dont know why I was so struck by the way he said \"Baby\".\r\n\r\nAnyhoo, starting to crash now. Long day at work and I didnt sleep too well last night, so I should prolly go pick something outta the queue to go sleepy-bye to\r\n\r\nhttp://expletivedleted.livejournal.com\r\nhttp://www.twitter.com/expletivedleted",

            "content": "Double Indemnity is based on a novel by James Cain adapted to the screen by great novelist Raymond Chandler, who made here his most important contribution to the cinema history in his career, though somehow matched by following screenwriting work for 1946 Howard Hawks' classic The Big Sleep, and Billy Wilder, who previously worked as a screen writer for Ernest Lubitsch and had been already nominated three times for Academy Awards in the process before making Double Indemnity, which nevertheless played the key role in establishing him as one of the best writer-directors in Hollywood, and giving him his fourth Oscar nomination as a writer and his first one as a director.\r\n\r\nDouble Indemnity was the third feature Wilder directed after 1942 The Major and the Minor and 1943 Five Graves to Cairo, but it was definitely the first film, his primary American tragedy where the author for the first time revealed his black and somehow hopelessly pessimistic view of the American society and of the human society in general, blackishly desecrated in the film simply by populating it with exceptionally sordid characters, who independently of being a victim or victimized, of being the protagonists or just simple supporters are never really able to transcend the utterly low and devilish motivations in theirs as a consequence sordidly painful lives and reach such a state where the viewer might get relieved by considering one of them as a positive element. Instead the characters' lives shown in a continuous noir flashback of Fred MacMurray's not-a-confession are driven from the start to the very end by an utter greed in a form of double and not only indemnities with consequential and inherent to it risks and fears in a rather unsure world of insurance.\r\n\r\nThis is one of the classics of film noir that everybody should see. Fred MacMurray, as ordinary insurance agent Walter Neff, really shows his acting chops, putting on weight for his character and restraining his natural geniality to play an amoral insurance man drawn into an intricate murder plot by his own carnal weakness. MacMurray demonstrates that when he needed to be, he truly was a major acting talent as well as a top Hollywood star. He is all sidelong glances and grimaces, rueful expressions and sudden passion.\r\n\r\nBarbara Stanwyck, playing femme fatale Phyllis Dietrichson, gives perhaps her finest performance, making us believe that she really could wrap a man around her little finger and then toss him aside like an empty soda can. The scene with her at the top of the stairs, wrapped only in a towel, is quite steamy even today. Rarely in her body of work does Stanwyck come across as a great seductress, but she manages it here. Another great talent unleashed in a rare opportunity to play against type.\r\n\r\nThe mood is dark, the lighting is all shadows and darkness, and the characters say more with a look than with a page of dialog. Let's face it, anyone can play with light and shadows, that's not too difficult, but making it fit into the story and enhance it, as here, is the mark of genius. Director Billy Wilder was at the top of his game, creating an atmosphere throbbing with passion and innuendo. Despite all the deserved accolades, Wilder has to be the most underrated director ever. The way he could master the film noir, then leave it behind and change with the times, shows phenomenal adaptability.\r\n\r\nBut all that aside, this film is stolen by Edward G. Robinson, absolutely nailing his supporting role as Barton Keyes. Keyes is the kind of back-office guy who always solves the hard projects. His job as an insurance investigator is to try and find out who (if anyone) killed the victim, which would avoid a huge indemnity claim. He and Neff are friends, and Keyes' flaw is that he can't suspect his pal of murder. My favorite scene is when he and Neff are called into the office of their boss and Robinson, completely wrapped up in his job, neglects to bring his suit jacket. Facing a comment about this, he just blows the issue off (\"I didn't realize this was a formal occasion\"), sits down, and starts talking about the case, getting more and more excited. He gets so agitated that, while taking a drink of water to calm down, he accidentally splashes water on his vest (you can barely see this happen). Rather than demand another take, as a lesser actor might, Robinson instead goes with it, and shortly after stops to brush the water off his clothing, which has a double meaning as he is talking to Neff at the time. Brilliant acting job!\r\n\r\nThe plot is the film's weakest point, with a rather straightforward murder at issue and not a lot of mystery surrounding it. But along the way, motivations are questioned, friendships and loyalty are examined and sometimes broken, and all the intricacies of human interaction are put on display and dissected. Watching Neff twist in the wind as he realizes that Keyes is putting two and two together is gripping. The scene of Neff being confronted in front of Keyes by someone who happened to see him at the scene of the crime, and almost (but not quite) being recognized, has tension worthy of the best of master Alfred Hitchcock. MacMurray's narration at times does get a bit heavy-handed, but ultimately everything is wrapped up in just the perfect way.\r\n\r\nFour stars out of four.",

Aside from being, quite possibly, my favorite film and an undeniable film noir masterpiece, it is a very dark and challenging work from one of the most skilled artists of his time (or any other for that matter); for those and many other reasons, no words are capable of doing this film justice. However, seeing as I have already started writing, I shall press on and give it a lame attempt.\r\n\r\n    Double Indemnity is about an insurance salesman named Walter Neff (Fred MacMurray) who becomes smitten with one of his company's clients' sexy wife (Barbara Stanwick in what is by far the best performance of her amazing career). As the sexual tension between them rises, Walter is duped into murdering her husband so they can collect on his insurance policy. The only thing standing in their way is Barton Keyes (Edward G. Robinson), the insurance company's claims investigator who is absolutely positive that everything is not as it seems.\r\n\r\n    While this film has numerous strengths, I'd say its biggest is its ability to sustain a mood of tension throughout. This has a lot to do with the Direction (Billy Wilder) and the brilliant acting, but I think the most contributive (Firefox doesn't recognize this word... lol) element is the amazing screenwriting (the film was scripted by renown novelist Raymond Chandler and the director Billy Wilder), which stands out to me as possibly the best ever; whatever the reason, this movie is a classic of the highest order and is practically demanded viewing for any and every film lover. Watch it... and even if you don't like it, at least I won't egg your house.\r\n\r\n7 Oscar Nominations - Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actress in a Lead Role, Best Screenplay, Best Cinematography, Best Music, Best Sound Recording",

            "content": "Hands down, one of the best noir films out there. Interesting, dark and thrilling Double Indemnity is an instant classic on the DVD shelf. Billy Wilder directs and writes a deep followup to James A. Cain's novel. In my opinion, Wilder's adaption is actually better than the novel. Fred MacMurray and Barbara Stanwyck are a beautiful scandalous couple on screen and supporting roles from Porter Hall and Edward Robinson as MacMuray's boss is a great refreshing role as the funny, stubborn Barton Keyes.\r\n    Double Indemnity revolves around the life of insurance broker Walter Neff (MacMurray) who ends up in a weird love triangle with a rich man's wife, Phyllis Dietrichson. When she gives him the haunting idea of murdering Dietrichonson's estranged husband, all hell breaks loose and the insurance money becomes a bigger hassle to obtain, the couple slowly drive to madness, and ultimatly a tragic, unforgettable end. \r\n\r\nTHE GOOD:\r\n\r\nNeff and Dietrichson are a powerhouse couple, she is beautiful, he is charming. The script fills the classic 1940's noir sterotype, easily seen in the Cohen's and Tarintino films. Dark, haunting and totally unforgiving a classic tragic film at its best. Brilliant acting, beautiful filming and excellent music for the time frame, Double Indemnity is Billy Wilder and his finest of moments. Keyes is the comic relief and plays off really nice. Elements of suspense and modern thriller litter the film. To me, this is way better than Scarlet Street.\r\n\r\nVERDICT:\r\n\r\nDouble Indemnity is a great noir film. Regardless if your into the genre or not, the film offers a great story, great acting, making it an overall enjoyable thrill ride way beyond its time.",

            "content": "The genre that is film noir can trace its roots to this 1944 film directed by Billy Wilder. \u0093Double Indemnity\u0094 is called the start of film noir, and what I mean by this is you have a femme fatale, or a female villain, a hard-boiled detective, and a plot usually involving murder. But there were other films that could be considered film noir before \u0093Double Indemnity\u0094. So technically, we can not give this film the title of \u0093starting film noir\u0094. Yet, \u0093Double Indemnity\u0094 can be a good example of how to describe film noir and the process of how it can be described.\r\n\r\nSalesman Walter Neff (Fred MacMurray) comes to visit a man about car insurance, but Walter only confronts the man\u0092s wife, Phyllis (Barbara Stanwyck). After seeing the wife a couple more times, Phyllis finally confesses: she hates her husband and wants him dead. So, after some persuasion, Phyllis and Walter plan on killing the husband so that the wife can get all the money. Everything goes according to plan, until Walter\u0092s partner, Barton Keyes (Edward G. Robinson), gets a sneaky suspicion about the murder. And from there, it gets into some dark territory.\r\n\r\nThe three main stars, Fred MacMurray, Barbara Stanwyck, and Edward G. Robinson, are the central focus points in this film. They deliver excellent performances that show what they can be capable of. Billy Wilder did an excellent job at directing this film. He really captured the detective genre that was popular in the 1930s and brought film noir into the 1940s.\r\n\r\n\"Double Indemnity\u0094 does a pretty good job at creating sets. These sets showcase buildings that detail Southern California very well. The lighting also gives a good job detailing the sets and the scenery. My only problem with the lighting is that it can get too dark and you can\u0092t see what\u0092s going on. The music here is a fine orchestrated piece that can stand on its own.\r\n\r\nOverall, \u0093Double Indemnity\u0094 is an amazing film that still holds out on its own today. \u0093Double Indemnity\u0094 is a movie that needs to be seen and I highly recommend it.",

A good lookin\r\n dame like her makes it so much more believable that this lowly insurance salesman (who, for some reason, is an amazingly smooth sweetalker. You don't see too many suave insurance salesmen like this guy.)would help assist this beautiful woman in the murder of her calloused husband.\r\n\r\nBilly Wilder helms the Director's chair for this flick and never fails when he's behind the camera lens. The atmosphere of the film was dark and brooding while also giving barbara stanzwyk's character this sexy but sadistic look to her.\r\n\r\nThe music is beautiful is this film! This is also the case in Sunset Boulevard (the other Billy Wilder film i've seen of this kind of nature). Billy Wilder knows how to edit a movie so that the music weaves together with the visuals and the movements of the characters. The sharp stings of the ensemble come in at just the right time with beautiful sweeping glory. The music gets dark at just the approriate times it needs to.\r\n\r\nI particualarly loved Edward G. Robinson, who plays the good guy of sorts ( or is he the bad guy? i don't know who i'm really rooting for!) in this later film of his. He's a fast talking man with some great dialogue in this film and Ed Robinson plays his part convincingly well. i'd have to say his acting is above all the rest. But, I gotta give Barbara Stanzwyk credit for playing A sexy dame while also giving the audience this brooding feeling that she shouldn't be trusted. Should she? Well, folks, you'll have to watch and find out for yourself\r\n\r\nSome cite this as one of the first film noirs (although I think M should helm that honor myself) and the film has all of the elements that makes one great. The moonlight shining into a dark room, the smoke, the gritty feeling throughout. It's one of the first entries into the night life of the big city and the characters, seductions and deceptions that lay underneath when the lights go out.",

And, I can equate the twists in a thriller equal to the passing bridges. It's thrill! The two most inconvincible professionals are tax auditors and insurance clearance agents. It's not only the attribute of police to investigate a crime but also for an insurance officer. There are few films associated where the crime is based on insurance. I remember one Tamil movie which followed this theme - Kei Niraya kaasu with Nagesg acted in dual roles.\r\n\r\nDouble Indemnity - 1944/Thriller\r\nAdapted & Directed: Billy Wilder\r\nBased on a novel by John Cain.\r\n\r\nPlot\r\n\r\nThe entire story is narrated by Walter Neff, a charming insurance agent. Phyllis is rich man's wife who happens to meet Neff once in her home. They slowly develop a friendship and gets into a relation. They get slowly into a dangerous and an almost perfect plan to murder the rich man. In turn, they plan to get the insurance money and lead a new life.\r\n\r\nThe plan looks easy but complicated as much as a big mess. Neff's boss Barton Keyes, an outstanding insurance investigator who has a little guy inside him [intuition] leading him to crack any great case. With these elements, what happens is the plot for a perfect thriller. The story moves in flashbacks from Neff's view and involves the clash of different fates of all the characters involved. That makes this movie a super thriller.\r\n\r\n\r\nView\r\n\r\nAlfred Hitchcock movies were the eye opener for me, which stated that black & white movies were not slow movies. There are certain films which move at the speed of a bullet train [ Tamil example : Gilli ]. There are many examples of this genre.. Spellbound(1945), The killing(1956), Strangers on a train are few to quote for now. This film is a classic example of a fast executed script.\r\n\r\nThe BGM is an inevitable part of storytelling - even I remember we used to narrate the action films with sounds and BGM.. In fact, even when we fight in childhood we make sounds [ Dishaaal, Dishyum :) ]. That's the power of BGM. This movie got the perfect BGM which enhances the thrill and increases our temptation to look for what happens next.\r\n\r\nI liked the light and shadows part of this thriller. More'shadows' are used in this film to represent the darkness of the events involved in the story. Somehow, this movie resembles 'the strangers on a train'. The best part is the characterization of Barton Keyes. He is one of the sparkling and brilliant characters in the story. His dialogues are rally outstanding and soundly convincing. That's the reason I used his dialogue as quoted in the beginning.\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\nA perfect thriller for a Saturday night movie time.\r\n\r\nIt wasn't an accident.. it wasn't a suicide.. What it was then ?\r\n\r\n\r\n-Toto.",

The great Billy Wilder's masterful noir (or pre-noir) pits a weak willed, morally compromised insurance salesman (Fred MacMurray) into a steamy affair with an oilman's wife (a charged Barbara Stanwyk), who in turn conspire to kill her husband and claim his insurance.  The film is infused with gritty, sharp, edgy black and white shadows, much like the shadows of deception, mistrust and evil the characters move in and out of.  The world created in this film is a hardboiled one, with some truly crackling dialogue by the legendary Raymond Chandler (\"I wanted to see her again, close, without that silly staircase between us.\").  The standout performance is from one of Hollywood's finest character actors, Edward G. Robinson, playing the gruff, cynical, straight-as-an-arrow claims investigator Barton Keyes, wonderfully navigating his character between what he knows to be his gut feeling and his quest to prove it.  In the end, it really is the brilliant craft of this great movie that stays with you, with each character moving between their own lies, deceptions and flaws as the narrative deftly moves in perfect pace and unison.  Although not as hardnosed as its source novel (which in turn is a masterpiece of crime writing), this is Hollywood filmmaking at is very best.",

Barbara Stanwyck rules the summit of femme fatales.  So much fun watching Fred MacMurray, who thinks he's the smartest man in the room,  and then slowly realizes he is the biggest chump of all.  Edward G Robinson's calm clear, headed insurance investigator nicely contrasts all the wacky sinful deeds going on.",

This is the very best any movie can get - any genre. I defy anyone to compare it to any other noir movie ever made. Simply sublime perfection and definitely right up there in the top ten best movies ever made.Highly Recommended.",

In saying that, I mean that the jaw-dropping nuances Wilder has sizzled this film with, and the painstaking attention to details gave Double Indemnity unique taste, and made it stand out from all the films of its kind. Giving away the plot synopsis usually tarnishes the experience of watching your typical film noir because the toughness of them are their small details, let alone doing so with this one in addition to explaining why I find the subtlety of it so mesmerizing. Watch Double Indemnity and you\u2019ll know what I mean straight away!Alas, It seems that this very meticulous attention to detail came at the expense of making the most important the most crucial moments and the turning points convincing. The academic nature of the film's plotting made a lot of decisive moments a bit hard to swallow. It also made the movie drag, surprisingly, at what should have been the most intriguing part.All the performances here are fine, but it's Edward G. Robinson who steals the show for me. He plays the quick-witted, determined investigator, Barton Keyes, who may be a bit too smart and clever to be believable; but thanks to Robinson's fierce performance, Keyes hands down is my favorite character in the movie.Double Indemnity is an extremely well-crafted moody crime film that transcends the nature of its plotting with an unprecedented, unmatched, unsurpassable subtlety that made the main characters lifelike, and made the story thought-provoking in the first place. It raised the bar and set the standard for film-noir making at its time, and continues to inspire every neo-noir film, nay every crime film to this day.(8.5/10)",
