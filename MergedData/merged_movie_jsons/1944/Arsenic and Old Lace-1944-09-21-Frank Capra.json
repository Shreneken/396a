            "content": "In Frank Capra's autobiography he explains that the reason he wanted to do Arsenic and Old Lace was that he was planning to go into the service, in preparation for the war he was sure coming. He wanted a surefire moneymaking hit that could be done on the cheap.Arsenic and Old Lace was running on Broadway at the time and authors Howard Lindsay and Russell Crouse had sold the film rights to Warner Brothers. Capra negotiated a deal with Jack Warner for a percentage and told him how he would do the film on the cheap, but not cut production values. Years of experience at Columbia had taught him how. The property was perfect since 90% of it is on one set, the Brewster living room. So the shooting was for four weeks and a big percentage of the budget was spent on getting a name star for guaranteed box office, that of course being Cary Grant. Of course this being 1941 the shooting was interrupted briefly by the actual attack on Pearl Harbor. But the film wrapped up quickly and was not released to the public until 1944 after the show on Broadway closed. It was however shown to troops overseas as were several other Hollywood films before they reached the domestic market. Of course with a Capra selected cast the film was a great triumph. Only Jean Adair and Josephine Hull as the Brewster sisters and John Alexander as \"Theodore Roosevelt\" Brewster repeated their Broadway roles. Capra had insisted on that.I don't think Cary Grant was ever more frantic in his film career than in Arsenic and Old Lace. He's one bundle of perpetual motion as Mortimer Brewster theater critic and member of a family where insanity doesn't just run, it gallops. He's got two daffy old spinster aunts who poison lonely old men to cure their loneliness, a brother who thinks he's Teddy Roosevelt, and another brother who is a homicidal maniac. Quite a family tree. Grant's performance is so good, you can see the fevered workings of his mind in his facial expressions as he frantically tries to get his whole family committed before the aunt's deeds are discovered.Of the supporting cast I think that Raymond Massey as the homicidal brother, Peter Lorre as his sidekick, and Jack Carson as the dense police officer truly stand out. They and the others play parts that seem tailor made for them.Over fifty years later, Arsenic and Old Lace will still fracture the funny bone in you.And I wouldn't bet we've still not seen the last Roosevelt in the White House.",

            "content": "For those who enjoy dark comedy, it's hard to see how anything could be funnier than \"Arsenic and Old Lace\".  With Cary Grant's talent for madcap comedy, with hilariously sinister performances by Raymond Massey and Peter Lorre, with two adorable old ladies who have a very dark secret, plus half-a-dozen other eccentric characters, all involved in a complicated and unpredictable plot, this is a comic masterpiece.  Director Frank Capra keeps everything moving and adds his own touch, keeping some dark material entirely light-hearted.This is the kind of movie for which mere analysis cannot do justice to how well everything fits together.  The characters, cast, and writing are all perfect, and the crazy story gives every character some great moments. There is plenty of witty dialogue, lots of funny slapstick and physical humor, and quite a few wild plot developments.  None of it is meant to be plausible, but it is all hugely entertaining, and done with such skill that it is easy to suspend disbelief.  If you happen not to have seen this before, stick with it for the first few minutes, until you arrive at the home of Cary Grant's two aunts, and then things will take off quickly.If you enjoy morbid humor, \"Arsenic and Old Lace\" is an absolute must-see.",

            "content": "With many silly comedies of recent years, comedy has become the most underrated art form.  People take comedy for granted.  As if there's nothing to it.  True, there are some people will just laugh at anything.  In some cases, it doesn't take much to raise a chuckle out of a certain someone. But this is the kind of film that will make you fall on the floor laughing. Why?  Because it makes use of every comic device you can think of.  The timing, the delivery, the choreography.  Absolutely perfect!That's right, no cheap shots here.  There are some absolutely brilliant scenes in this film that made me laugh out loud, while at the same time scream out \"Capra's a genius!\"  If you wanna see what comedy is truly all about, watch the scene where Cary Grant (noted drama critic) is describing the story of a bad play he had just seen to Peter Lorre.  As he's doing so, everything that happened in the story is going on right behind his back. Doesn't sound like much on paper, but you have to see it to believe it. There are also many great lines, including \"Pull up a tombstone.\" \nThe acting is topnotch.  I can't believe Grant felt this was the worst movie he's ever done (check the Trivia section).  I actually liked the fact that this was a different role for him, as opposed to the suave, quiet, laid-back romantic he-man he usually plays.  In this movie, we really get to see his knack for slapstick--and he's great at it!  Every facial expression, every bulge of the eyes--he did it with such perfect timing.  There's also a great scene where they all start fighting, and Grant sits on the stairs and smokes a cigarette while all this bedlam ensues.  His deadpan expression during that scene is classic.  I also have to give it up for everyone else in the cast--though Grant deserves the most acclaim.  There are lulls here and there, and the film runs a little long (though that wouldn't surprise me being that it was adapted from a stage play), but there are so many beautifully crafted, hilarious moments that I can't rate this movie as anything less than a must-see!  I would go on and on about which scenes I found memorable, but I don't wanna spoil it for anyone.  Just see it for yourself!  Trust me, you'll die laughing!My score:  9 (out of 10)",

After, he should have taken home his third for best Actor in one of his best comedic performances in his amazing career. Arsenic and Old Lace takes place pretty much in one location. A stage comedy, the movie does justice to its original theatrical version. Cary Grant makes you laugh, even an audience 50 and 60 years after its original release. The story of innocent guilt and laughable situations, other movies like What's Up Doc, Marvin's Room, and even Lake Placid (with its moments of ignorance and bliss) have all stolen moments of Arsenic and Old Lace. No one but Cary Grant could have starred in this movie. A delightful performance and an over the top comedic talent was showcased in this comedy classic.",

            "review_title": "The Brooklyn Brewsters",
            "content": "\"Arsenic and Old Lace\", one of the best stage comedies that were seen on Broadway, gets the royal treatment via Frank Capra, a man that was born to direct the movie version, if ever there was a man to do so. The play written by Joseph Kisserling was given an excellent screen play treatment by the Julius and Philip Epstein team, two great movie adapters of all time.This is a combination of a madcap and a screwball comedy. The first best thing in the film are the star turn performances by two of the original actresses that created the roles of Aunt Abby and Aunt Martha, Josephine Hull and Jean Adair, respectively. Just to see the Brewster sisters in action is worth the price of admission. These two women had the roles of a career by bringing life into the two kinds souls living in Brooklyn and doing good, as well as \"helping lonely old men\" to find happiness.The second best reason for watching the film is Cary Grant. This is without a doubt one of the actor's best achievements in his long career in the movies! Mr. Grant plays Mortimer Brewster, a man that hates the idea of getting married and losing his freedom. That is, until the beautiful Elaine comes along. Mr. Grant is a joy to watch in the film, no matter what he is doing, at any given moment. His expressions, as well as his timing is impeccable, something one expects of all of Mr. Capra's movies.The Brewster household is the center of the action, but for a stage play, it never seems confining, or theatrical, even though it's basically shot in one single set. This appears to be the Brooklyn area near the Heights where one can see the majestic bridge in the distant. Maybe around Old Fulton Street, or that area, where the River Cafe is located now.Mr. Capra was able to assemble such a wonderful group of the best actors working in movies. Lovely Priscilla Lane is the woman that conquered Mortimer's heart. Raymond Massey is Jonathan, the Dracula-like sinister figure that is Mortimer's brother. Also, John Alexander, is seen as \"Uncle Teddy\", the man with a Teddy Roosevelt's complex. Peter Lorre makes a good contribution as Dr. Einstein. Jack Carson and John Ridgley are seen as the police working the area where the Brewster live. The supporting players are amazing: Edward Everett Horton, Garry Owen, Grant Mitchell, James Gleason, and although seen briefly, the great Charles Lane, who is one of the photographers pursuing Mortimer and Elaine when they are getting the marriage license. Mr. Lane appeared in hundred of films and is still alive, 100 years young! In a way, it's ironic Mr. Lane survived almost all the people in the film!An excellent film by that American master, Frank Capra!",

            "content": "On Halloween day, the writer and drama critic Mortimer Brewster (Cary Grant) secretly marries his next door neighbor Elaine Harper (Priscilla Lane) and they decide to travel to Niagara Falls in honeymoon. Mortimer has written many books criticizing the institution of marriage and his weeding would be a scoop for the reporters and paparazzos.Mortimer and Elaine take a taxi to Brooklyn to bring their luggage and Mortimer visits his adorable elderly aunts Abby (Josephine Hull) and Martha Brewster (Jean Adair), who raised him and are considered Good Samaritans in the neighborhood, renting rooms and giving meals to the poor. His aunts live with his insane brother Teddy (John Alexander), who believes that is Theodore Roosevelt and is digging locks for the Panama Canal in the basement of the house. When Mortimer is ready to go, he finds a dead body hidden in the window seat and his aunts explains that they have murdered the poor men for charity to stop their suffering serving wine spiked with arsenic and other poisons. Then Teddy buries the corpses in the locks believing that they had yellow fever. Mortimer decides to send Teddy to the Happy Dale Sanatorium but things get worse when his other insane and cruel brother Jonathan Brewster (Raymond Massey), who had disappeared twenty years ago and has the face of Boris Karloff, unexpectedly appears in the house with his alcoholic partner, the plastic surgeon Dr. Einstein (Peter Lorre), expecting to find a place to dispose the corpse of his victim. The place transforms in a nuthouse.\"Arsenic and Old Lace\" is a hilarious screwball comedy by Frank Capra based on a theater play. The plot and the characters are very funny with Josephine Hull and Jean Adair performing two innocent serial-killers believing that the death of their victims is charity. Cary Grant exaggerates in his reaction and he seems to be crazier than his insane relatives, but the result is wonderful. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): \"Este Mundo \u00e9 um Hosp\u00edcio\" (\"This World is a Sanatorium\")",

If Boris Karloff had joined his fellow Broadway cast members - Jean Adair, Josephine Hull and John Alexander - I think it would have been an even better movie. Raymond Massey, unquestionably a good actor, did his best, but didn't quite seem to get the joke, or maybe was overwhelmed by having to incarnate Karloff. But it's a quibble, really, and we're more than compensated by the the rest of the cast.Cary Grant motors the piece along at a terrific pace. He's a joy to watch, with his double-, triple-, even quadruple- and quintuple-takes. Hull and Adair are equally wonderful in their different ways, the former all floaty and tip-toe, the latter hysterically earnest - one of my favourite moments is Adair's superb double-take when she notices, on the dining-room table, a shoe she doesn't recognise.Peter Lorre, Jack Carson, Edward Everett Horton, James Gleason, and the rest, are all everything they should be, and Priscilla Lane is splendidly dewy-eyed and pouty as the love-interest.I've seen Arsenic and Old Lace countless times. I've never tired of it, always look forward to it, and highly recommend it.",

            "content": "Arsenic and Old Lace is the most important contender for the funniest movie ever made !! Every single aspect and element in this movie is just perfect. And I'm NOT exaggerating... If I have to rate all the different elements of cinema separately, I would rate them all 10 out of 10. Acting, directing, plot, location, dialogues, sense of humor...all brilliant and in the right proportions. Frank Capra was responsible for several milestones and masterpieces in the history of cinema but - in my opinion - Arsenic and Old Lace beats them all. Yes, I DO think it's even better than 'It's a Wonderful Life' and 'Mr. Smith Goes to Washington' !!! Arsenic and Old Lace is just everything you could possibly wish for in a motion picture. A must see that comes with the highest possible recommendation. Explaining the plot a bit would almost be impossible to do. The story goes about so many things. Don't be alarmed, it's not at all hard to follow or something. As a viewer, you're just being overwhelmed by a series of hilarious plot twists and intelligent side-characters and their backgrounds. So much that it is almost impossible to mention it all. And besides, it's better that you start watching it without knowing too much about the story anyway. Just sit back and enjoy being pleasantly surprised. I can't imagine that there are people out there who didn't fully enjoy this movie !! It comes really close to perfection, and the intelligence and originality of it will never again find an equal. Nowadays comedies are all low-brainers ( or even no-brainers ) that handle about dumb teenagers or dick and fart jokes. Arsenic and Old Lace is a comedy that is mainly story-driven and brought to an even higher level thanks the flawless acting performances.\nYes...let's talk about the cast a bit !! Cary Grant plays the role of his life in my opinion. Sure, he played many other brilliant roles but his character Mortimer Brewster is just the most memorable of them all. Grant's comedy talent was never stressed better than in this film. His facial expressions are hilarious and his the amazingly funny lines sound brilliant coming out of his mouth. The girl who played his wife Elaine ( forgot her name ) is very beautiful and a great match for him. And I was very enthusiast to see Peter Lorre in this film. He's in my top 5 list of greatest actors who ever lived and anyone who saw this movie will agree with me on that. He's just perfect as Dr. Einstein. I can keep on rambling about the cast but I think you get the whole picture... FLAWLESS !!!\nBlack comedy is one of the hardest subgenres of cinema to make a good movie out. Not many directors and scriptwriters have enough talent to take a subject like murder, death or insanity and make a masterpiece out of it. Stanley Kubrick did it with 'Dr. Strangelove' and Frank Capra did it with this one ... I think these men are the exception. Only these guys can make you laugh hysterically with subjects like this. Finally one more note : This is also a perfect movie to watch if you're a fan of classic horror movies and thrillers. First of all because of the tribute role by Peter Lorre of course but also because of the constant morbid atmosphere hanging around the movie...And, naturally, because of the character of Jonathan Brewster which clearly is a direct tribute to Boris Karloff...They even say so most of the times.What the hell are you waiting for ?? Go watch it right now !",

            "content": "This is my all-time favorite classic movie. It has an very sophisticatedly entertaining plot line, the casting is superb, the pace is breathtaking, and it deals with a subject (euthanasia) that is still controversial today. The story is a fine example of \"black comedy\", where a socially unacceptable idea is shown in a very entertaining manner.The story is set up brilliantly right from the get-go; where a 'certifiable' publicly-acclaimed bachelor is secretly getting married. The personality of the cast is excellent. I know that Cary Grant reckoned this was his worst movie, saying it was more of a \"Jimmy Stewart-type part\"; but his spot-on comic timing and professional style hamming plays the role to perfection. Also co-starring in the movie is a brilliant Peter Lorre as a maniac doctor and Raymond Massey as the psychotic brother. Most critics have attacked this film by saying the script refers to the psycho being a Boris Karloff look-alike, highlighting the fact that Boris played the role is the original stage play. However Massey plays the role to deadpan perfection, and the humor of the scenario still works.My favorite scene is the self-referential one where Mortimer (a theater critic)is describing \"bad plays (and movies)\". If you watch the background action, and pay attention to the dialog, the ironic situation is brilliantly realized. This film also has my personal favorite quote, said by Cary Grant as Peter Lorre frantically tries to warn him of impending doom; \"Stop underplaying - I can't hear you!\"",

But before heading off to Niagra Falls for the honeymoon, Mortimer stops in to see his aunts, Abby and Martha Brewster, two sweet little old ladies who donate toys to charity and care for their nephew Teddy, a bugle blowing nutbag who thinks he's Theodore Roosevelt. But Abby and Martha aren't as sweet and innocent as they seem. Mortimer soon discovers, to his horror, that his dear old aunties have a dozen bodies buried in the basement. It seems the Brewster sisters have a new hobby - luring lonely old men into their home and serving them Elderberry Wine spiked with arsenic poison. To make matters worse, Mortimer's deranged and very dangerous brother Jonathan shows up. Jonathan, on the run from the law, has a dead body in the trunk of his car, a drunken plastic surgeon at his side and a face that looks like Boris Karloff. Mortimer frantically attempts to deal with dead bodies, insane asylum directors, attempted murders and a new bride all on a single crazy Halloween night.This is a must-see Halloween movie, filled with Gallows humor, leaf-strewn graveyards, pumpkins and death. Cary Grant delivers a performance unlike any other he has ever done - manic, panicked, hysterical and almost as insane as his screen family. John Alexander is flawless as Teddy; bugles, pith helmet and all. Jean Adair and Josephine Hull are so sweet and cute and so absolutely morbid you'll forgive them anything. Raymond Massey as Boris Karloff lookalike Jonathan is simultaneously menacing and amusing, and Peter Lorre as his drunken German sidekick Dr. Einstein is a riot, bugging his eyes and flinching through the entire film in a most endearing way. This is a must see film, no matter your genre preference. There's something for everyone here: quick-witted comedy, true romance, grisly deeds, everything! Fans of Grant and Lorre must not miss this film. 10 stars!",

The film through Jonanthan references the already classic Frankenstein at the time.

Upon arrival, he finds that his two dear, sweet, lovable aunts have embarked on what they see as their mission of mercy ... killing lonely old men, by giving them arsenic-laced wine. Our sane young drama critic soon learns that insanity runs in the family.Five years ago, the American Film Institute selected America's 100 funniest movies. \"Arsenic And Old Lace\" (1944) came in at Number 30. And that's not surprising. A lot of people enjoy this dark, screwball comedy, with its slapstick, its fast pace, its sharp dialogue, and its engaging characters. A lot of viewers like it simply because of Cary Grant.The film's underlying premise is really great. And I must confess that Aunt Abby (Josephine Hull) and Aunt Martha (Jean Adair) are cute and entertaining. (Interestingly, the film portrays them as usually together and almost always in agreement with each other. It's like they function as a single entity). And the other denizen of the house, Uncle Teddy (John Alexander) is also a hoot.But I'm not a big fan of Cary Grant. His performance here is exaggerated. His hyper and jerky behavior is distracting and grating. The plot gets ever sillier as it moves along, and downright tedious toward the end. Lastly, I have never cared much for films that are so top heavy with dialogue.The best part of the film is the cinematography. Most of the scenes take place in a big living room, at times with lights out. The B&W lighting is very stark with high contrast, which renders a suitably sinister atmosphere.\"Arsenic ...\" is not my cup of tea. But, for viewers who like talky stage plays with an accent on macabre humor, this film is a fine choice. Could I interest you in a glass of elderberry wine, perhaps?",

This is a loud movie, with one brother believing he's Teddy Roosevelt yelling 'Charge!' as he runs up the stairs and slams his bedroom door repeatedly, characters rapidly entering scenes in a pell-mell confusion of trying to hide bodies, threaten each other, commit others to mental institutions, etc etc. It's also all over the map. At first I thought Capra may have threaded the needle and been able to deliver both a dark comedy and a drama, since Raymond Massey's glowering and Peter Lorre's simpering are quite sinister, and a nice counterpart to Cary Grant and the sweet old ladies played so wonderfully by Josephine Hull and Jean Adair. However, the movie dragged on, and was far too long at 118 minutes. Some may like the madcap frenzy Capra created based on the stage play, and I have to say there are some nice moments and lines (\"Insanity runs in my family. It practically gallops.\"), but overall the movie gets to be a little much, and doesn't stand the test of time, at least for me.",

Besides , a police officer (Jack Carson) and later a lieutenant (James Gleason) enter at the household and the things go wrong for Mortimer.This is one of the best black comedies of all time with dark humor , frantic situations and awesome performances . Top-notch Gary Grant , he gives an authentic recital, he puts faces , grimaces , and overacting but he's splendid. Raymond Massey and Peter Lorre in sinister roles are magnificent. Excellent the sweet spinster aunts , Hull and Adair , repeating their Broadway acting , equally John Alexander as the insane cousin with trumpet included . Furthermore , agreeable secondary role by the usual Edward Everett Horton who is in charge of a mental hospital . The film is well adapted by Julius and Philip Epstein - Casablanca's screenwriters- . Adequate musical score by the classic composer Max Steiner and atmospheric cinematography by Sol Polito. The pic was perfectly directed by the master Frank Kapra who previously got a lot of experience in silent comedy and slapstick vein , working for Mack Sennett and Harry Langdon. Also exhibited in horrible computer colored adaptation . It's a must-see for classic movies buffs and Gary Grant fans.",

            "content": "Two seemingly sweet little old ladies bump off their lonely male lodgers much to the horror and surprise of their newlywed nephew Mortimer (Cary Grant).What I had hoped would be a charming American comedy classic turns out to be amongst the most tortuous two hours of cinema I have ever sat through. Directed by Frank Capra, the film stars Cary Grant as Mortimer, a writer renowned for his anti-marriage diatribes, who has just done the unthinkable and got hitched to beautiful blonde Elaine (Priscilla Lane). But before Mortimer can leave with his wife for their honeymoon, his discovery of a dead body at his aunts' Brooklyn home throws him into disarray.With zero concern for subtlety from either Capra or his star, Arsenic and Old Lace is a loud, repetitive, drawn-out exercise in absolute tedium, the plot going round and round in circles until the viewer is finally put out of their misery with a really dumb ending. Grant over-acts like his life depends upon it, mugging and doing double takes whenever possible, as though this is all that is needed to drum up laughs; it isn't. The majority of the supporting cast are just as insufferable: the guy who thinks he is Teddy Roosevelt really grates, the old ladies are far from endearing, Raymond Massey (as Mortimer's escaped criminal brother Jonathan) glares a lot, and Peter Lorre merely plays a caricature of himself.Somehow this movie has earned itself a solid reputation and a high IMDb rating (8.0), which confuses me just as much as It's a Wonderful Life's place at #25 in IMDb's Top Rated Movies. What is it that others see in Capra's films that I don't?",

There are so many scenes in this film that had me laughing my head off. Much of the credit goes to the actors who all play their parts well, but Frank Capra did a fantastic job with this.

Raymond Massey plays the fiendish Cousin Jonathan to a tee, with his equally creepy sidekick Peter Lorre. Edward Everett Horton is so ideal as Mr. Witherspoon of the Happy Dale Sanitarium, coming to claim the eccentric Uncle Teddy Brewster, who believes he is President Roosevelt. Jack Carson is funny as the dense police officer O'Hara. Cary Grant is a complete riot as nephew Mortimer Brewster, who so vainly tries to resolve the predicament his kooky Aunts have placed him in. Grant never misses a beat, and his facial expressions are priceless. I believe it to be one of his most winning-est performances. Frank Capra pulls it all together into one deliriously enjoyable comedy. I never tire of watching this classic movie, a favourite of mine to start off every Halloween.",

I did my job with the lighting panel and the curtain, but I thought it was the dumbest play I had ever seen (not that I'd seen many at that point). So for the last 40+ years I've avoided watching the film version.But, what's not to like? After all, Cary Grant is my favorite actor. Priscilla Lane is usually quite good, and Raymond Massey is often impressive. Who doesn't like Edward Everett Horton. Jack Carson is enjoyable enough. And then there's Peter Lorre and James Gleason.Well the first thing not to like is Cary Grant in this film. Cary can be manic in films, and for short bursts, it's always hilarious. However, being manic throughout a 118 minute film isn't funny...it's mugging...you know like The Three Stooges. For my money, this is worst Cary Grant film I've seen, and I've seen almost every one. And then there's the Teddy Roosevelt angle. Did anyone ever here of subtlety, rather than screaming? Stupid.I will admit enjoying Peter Lorre here, as well as James Gleason. And, I thought there was ONE funny line -- mentioning Boris Karloff, who had been the villain in the stage production and who had been the first choice for the film, but was not available and was replaced by Raymond Massey. Okay, THAT was funny.But as for the rest of this film...well, I gave it a \"1\" rating, but only because you can't give a \"0\".",

The problem with this movie is that although it's a black comedy, for one to work it really can't be quaint. Frank Capra is certainly talented but his worst instincts are insufferable, and none of them are restrained here. He overplays the sweetness, overplays the reactions, overplays the conflict, etc... Exacerbating the problem is that the script (and the original play) is overwritten, without having sufficient plot once the conflict in introduced. There isn't a second of this movie that's subtle. Every sequence is louder and more head-ache inducing than the previous. Each has a painful setup and the facile expected resolution. I would argue that the suckier screwball comedies include a de rigeur sequence in which the volume and tempo build to a degree that is simply annoying to a modern audience. This screwball comedy is more shrill than all the others. Grant felt that this he was not any good in this and he's not. But no one is; blame the script!It's really surprising that it came out during the war, and that it pre-dates almost all the big serial murder cases on the 20th century. This is more interesting as an odd, prescient take on the dysfunctional dark side of the American family.",

While he is in the house for a matter of minutes he manages to discover that his Aunts have taken to murdering lodgers for the fun of it and using crazy Theodore to bury the bodies. While he tries to tidy that mess up, his crazy brother Jonathon turns up with a weird sidekick in tow, hulking a body and fleeing from the police. Things get more complicated when a couple of dead bodies are used as bargaining chips.I have been lucky enough to have TCM thrown into my cable package as a free sample for a few days but the downside seems to have been that I have been unimpressed with a couple of \"classics\" that are generally well regarded. \"Arsenic and Old Lace\" was one such film with a \"classic\" reputation and one that I had not seen since I was very young. Viewing it now I am taken by how messy the plot is \u0096 Mortimer vanishes for a significant period, the dark tone is not used at all well and it is really just an average slapstick of sorts at times. This is not to say it isn't funny because it is amusing and enjoyable but too much of it is basic, lacking pace and not doing a good job of melding the slapstick with the dark material. It is hard for me to put into words but the plot wasn't that engaging and at times was silly and then at others dark and serious \u0096 both are good in their own right but neither is that great even if the total product does have plenty of good moments. It gets better in the second half but the first half was surprising to me in terms of just how weak it all seemed.The cast is mixed. Grant took the role for the chance to work with Jean Adair but to me it is one of his weaker moments at times. He is better in the second half of the film but in the first he nearly damages his eyes with the amount of silly double takes etc that he does; Laurel & Hardy are masters of the double take and to compare them with this is no comparison, Grant just eye pops all over the place to no effect. In the second half he is better and provides more humour in a balanced manner. Adair and Hull are delightfully dotty and underplay their role really well even if they have less time than I'd like. Massey is not that good although he does add a menacing tone to the whole affair that worked the \"dark\" angle well. Lorre is much more fun with the sort of whiney performance that he is famous for. Lane does very little but support is good from Alexander, Carson and McNamara.Overall an enjoyable comedy that gets better in the second half but still not really worthy of its classic label and great reputation. Grant overplays the \"bug-eyed\" thing but is better when he doesn't do it and the film takes a while to settle down into a good comedy. I suppose if I'd come to this just expecting another Cary Grant comedy then I might have not been a little disappointed by it but as it is it struggled with the weight of expectation somewhat. Worth seeing as long as you come to it for what it is and not expecting a classic comedy.",

He decided to let all the players--especially Cary Grant--play their roles in way \"over the top\" fashion in as broad a style as if they are in a stage version. Toning the farce down would have been better, in my opinion--but nevertheless 'Arsenic and Old Lace' manages to be one of the funniest dark comedies ever made! Cary Grant's role as Mortimer Brewster was expanded from the stage version to make it a starring role for the actor. He does wonders with it--mugging outrageously, doing double takes with aplomb, and even pratfalls (thanks to his acrobatic training). He never had better comedy material and he is one of the chief pleasures in watching the film. Josephine Hall is priceless as one of the dotty aunts, waddling around with an innocent air as she ponders which elderly man to poison next. Edward Everett Horton as an asylum manager is his usual hilarious self and Peter Lorre as Dr. Einstein spoofs his own screen persona. Boris Karloff originally played the \"man who looks like Boris Karloff\" in the Broadway version--but here Raymond Massey manages to be just as threatening. Jack Carson is a bit too broad in his antics as a dumb cop--and poor Priscilla Lane is given little to do in a weak role. While all of it requires a total suspension of disbelief, it has to be one of the most amusing screwball comedies ever. I love Josephine Hall's line on learning that Mortimer has discovered a body in the window seat. \"Oh, Mortimer, you peeked!\"",

Priscilla Lane, in the right movie -- opposite John Garfield, say -- can be lovely.Loved the title cards -- black and white drawings of Halloween -- and the studio sets of just over the bridge Brooklyn.

Priscilla Lane and Cary Grant are horribly matched. The actresses playing the little old lady aunts lack charisma -- a crime given that there were so many interesting older actresses in those days.Raymond Massey's make-up was simply grotesque.

But before he actually goes to the wedding, his life gets tremendously complicated. First he discovers a dead body in his aunts house. Then his aunts actually confess to him that they know the man, in fact they killed him themselves, and he is not the first one either. Mortimer already starts to spin out of control, it's not better because a mentally ill relative, who thinks he is Theodore Roosevelt (Alexander), that lives with the aunts frequently causes the police to come over. Mortimer, who likes his family very much, tries to resolve the situation without anybody going to jail. But it's get worse when his long lost, criminally insane, brother Jonathan (Massey) turns up with a submissive surgeon Dr. Einstein (Lorre) and a dead body of their own. Jonathan is actually a worse murderer than the aunts and is on the run from the police and consequently has had Dr. Einseint alter his face. When Mortimer and Jonathan discover each other's secrets, and a police turns up, who happens to be an amateur writer that wants Mortimer's opinions, life turns into utter chaos... And what to do about his fianc\u00e9e?Comment: An extremely quick paced comedy, that started off a little confused but soon straightened out with a lot of laughs. After a while, easy to comprehend and follow even if there is no moment when the story slows down. There is always something strange happening and it is best just to be swept away with the story. All the actors give great performances, almost too good sometimes. Combined with the story, some characters actually go too far in their reactions to what happens around them, losing some credibility. However, in the midst of all things, as a viewer it is easy to forgive and forget. A great classic that many modern comedies could learn from.8/10",

Mortimer does his best to dispose of the evidence but his plans are impeded when his psychopathic, also-serial-killing brother, Johnny, comes to visit, along with his plastic surgeon, Dr Einstein.The great Frank Capra, more renowned for classic, largely sentimental, dramas like 'It's A Wonderful Life', \"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington', 'Mr. Deeds Goes To Town' and 'Meet John Doe\" turns his hand to comedy, and the end product is a bit hit and miss. At its best the movie is a funny, off-the-wall dark comedy. At its worst it is plain silly, and dull. Unfortunately there's an equal measure of both, and they come in waves.The best moments generally involve Johnny and Dr Einstein. Their schtick is more darkly serious, but in being serious they're very funny. Some great dark comedy moments involving them.The worst bits involve Cary Grant / Mortimer Brewster. The character is over-the-top and overacted by Grant, to the point of irritation. In addition, Teddy Roosevelt was initially interesting as a one-off comedic device, but quickly grew irritating due to overuse, and, well, for being irritating. Until Johnny and Dr Einstein entered the movie, I was starting to lose interest, that's how irritating and dull the remaining characters and sub-plots are.So it become a roller-coaster of very funny scenes and eye-rollingly bad, irritating scenes.Overall, reasonably fun and funny, but certainly not deserving of its 'classic' tag.",

It's a funny movie.Anyway, when you come right down to it, I don't know who would have handled this farce better than Grant and the others we see on screen. (What would Jerry Lewis have done with it?) Grant runs back and forth, strikes awkward poses, falls over chairs, screams warnings, throws his bride out the door. The role calls for somebody with Grant's acrobatic body language. As for the others, there is Priscilla Lane who is, I'm convinced, concocted out of peaches melba and who serves mostly to add immediacy to the headlong plot. The two aunties are little old ladies, blinking and giggling insanely and good naturedly. Raymond Massey isn't Boris Karloff but he might as well be. Peter Lorre is superb as Doctor Einstein, \"Heidelberg 1919.\" The rest of the cast is made up of stalwart character actors with not a weakness between them. The Irish cop turns to the Protestant minister and remarks, \"Isn't it a shame, Fa -- tsk -- isn't it a shame, REVEREND, that such a nice family should be hatching a cuckoo.\" Not all the jokes are as good as the others. Lane to Grant: \"But, darling! Niagara Falls!\" Grant: \"It does? Well, LET IT.\" It's hard to believe that Capra had very much to do with this movie, because it's so stage bound. But the art direction is fine and there are some outdoor shots of Halloween in Brooklyn (when it was still livable) with falling October leaves, a chill in the air, and a tiny cemetery established in 1654. When Grant, in a tizzy, needs to think in that cemetery he mindlessly sits down on a small pointed headstone that made my prostate wince with pain. It wasn't as bad as \"the Melbourne method\" must have been, though. There are hilarious scenes shot mostly in darkness inside the house, involving bodies being carried to the Panama Canal in the basement, and another body appearing and disappearing amidst struggling crashing sounds -- \"Now I got heem, Johnny. I got heem now!\"The movie was shot a few years before it was released, but 1944 is 1944 and some of the jokes, though still amusing, are dated enough that they may get by some viewers. I don't think I'm throwing too slow a pitch when I wonder if younger people will know that in the early 1940s the president of the United States was Franklin Delano Roosevelt. Or that the president who succeeded Teddy Roosevelt was the heavy-set Taft. People who avoid movies because they are in black and white instead of color may be confused by these sorts of arcane topical references.I expect just about everyone else will enjoy this atmospheric and frenzied examination of a family that would put the Jukes and the Kallikaks to shame.",

            "content": "Frank Capra was probably best-known for his mature and inspirational dramas with a social conscience {'Mr. Deeds Goes to Town (1936);' 'Mr. Smith Goes to Washington (1939)'}, or otherwise his fun and innocent screwball comedies {'It Happened One Night (1936)'}. 'Arsenic and Old Lace (1944)' sits as a fascinating anomaly among Capra's cinematic output, since I would have never associated him with black comedy, and yet this one is about as black as a deserted street on Halloween night. A spoof of the horrors and thrillers of the 1930s and early 1940s, 'Arsenic and Old Lace' casually blends murder, dead bodies, criminals and mental illness into a frantic, madcap black comedy with uproariously over-the-top performances and highly-amusing slapstick. The film opens normally enough, with famous dramatic critic and outspoken anti-marriage bachelor Mortimer Brewster (Cary Grant) quietly getting married to his sweetheart Elaine Harper (Priscilla Lane). The mere irony of this situation would undoubtedly have resulted in an excellent screwball comedy, but then the screenplay pulls its first twist.Mortimer's dear aunts \u0096 purportedly the dearest, sweetest, kindest old ladies that ever walked the earth \u0096 have just poisoned their twelfth gentleman friend, an act of charity they extend to every lonely old man who comes their way! 'Arsenic and Old Lace' was based upon Joseph Kesselring's successful Broadway play of the same name, and adapted for the screen by Julius J. Epstein and Philip G. Epstein. This cinematic farce of a film is undoubtedly one of the funniest comedies to emerge from the 1940s, featuring terrific quotable lines and a selection of the most absurd characters imaginable: there is the understandably befuddled Mortimer, the two loving aunts with a dark secret (Josephine Hull, Jean Adair), a sinister Boris Karloff-lookalike (Raymond Massey), a creepy German surgeon (Peter Lorre), the lunatic brother who believes himself to be Theodore Roosevelt (John Alexander) and a collection of completely-clueless law-enforcement officers. With most of the story unfolding place in the one room, the film stays very much true to its theatrical roots, and, indeed, several of the performers from Kesselring's play {Hull, Adair, Alexander} reprised their roles for this film. As the tale unfolds, the circumstances slowly become more and more ridiculous, with poor Mortimer darting feverishly about town in an attempt to restrain a situation that has already expanded well beyond his control. Cary Grant is excellent in the main role, delivering a wide-eyed, frenzied, constantly-bewildered performance, doing more double-takes than Stanley Kubrick on the set of 'The Shining (1980).' Everybody else brings just the right amount of hyperactive exaggeration to their roles, and I particularly liked the character of Teddy; I laughed every time he ascended the stairs by blowing his bugle and screaming \"CHARGE!!!\" as though he was back at the Battle of San Juan Hill. As I was watching the film, a surprising revelation occurred to me. When I had slotted the disc of 'Arsenic and Old Lace' into my DVD player last night, I had absolutely no idea that it was a Halloween movie. Additionally, I also didn't realise that yesterday *was* Halloween (an almost nonexistent celebration down here in Australia). If that isn't spooky, I don't know what is!",

            "content": "Adapted for the screen by the same folks who next did \"Casablanca,\" incidentally with Lorre.Filmed by someone known for his light touch. I'm not of a fan of Capra's, as he values the little quirky hooks in the story and dialog and depends on some grand sweep (usually nostalgic) to make a film hang together. I'm interested in the meatier tricks that filmmakers use, and because Capra avoids them I'm not attracted to his postcards.You can read others about the witty setups and all, and make your own decision on whether Grant was right in remembering this as his worst performance. What I want to point you to is the self-referential nature of the thing. I don't know the original play and assume that most of this was added by the adapters.The thing is presented as a play. Most moviegoers of the time would know this as a smash play, an absolute hit.Our hero is a drama critic, so off the bat, we are set up to be inside and outside of the thing at the same time. This is exploited less than you would imagine, which is surprising since every other comic device is so overused we resent it. The use of this is twice. There's a scene where our character is with some bad guys; he doesn't realize the threat. During the time that he is sneaked up on and captured, he is describing a play he has seen where the main character was so dumb, he was in a house with murderers, he doesn't get out in fact he sits in a chair \"like this\" and gets tied up. At which point he gets tied up, of course.The other use of this device is during a fight. Our hero retires to the stairs and remarks on the fight as if he is watching a play.Elsewhere the general theme of plays is used a bit. Two characters have scripts that they want our hero to read. One of these, when described, overlaps the play we see a bit. One character has had botched plastic surgery and looks like Boris Karloff. Jokes are made about this that would have been funnier in the play which featured Karloff himself in the role.There's a character who is crazy, so \"plays\" the role of Teddy Roosevelt. (In talk about having him committed, the director of the looneybin says he already has too many Teddy Roosevelts. Remember, this was during the war.)The mere presence of Peter Lorre as a stereotypical mad doctor is along the lines of general self-reference but distinctly cinematic. This wouldn't have been in the play of course.All of this is handled as just more jokes, together with whatever other is given to us to laugh at. The anchor is not the gentle spine which I imagine the play has: about the nature of reality and imagination. Instead the anchor of this movie is Grant's over the top slapstick mannerisms.Because of this incompetent handling of narrative, the effectiveness of the main framing device is lost. In addition to being a famous drama critic, our hero has written several popular books debunking marriage, more specifically the romance associated with marriage. Its an apt thing for an observer of the artificial to note: that romance is mostly a scripted illusion. As the play begins, he is himself in a romance despite himself and is getting married.There's a wonderful relationship between this drama which he willingly enters and the others that are paraded past us in this movie. But Capra doesn't get it, so it is oddly disconnected.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.",

A daring move that only Cary Grant could pull off - I have no idea if it was in the script but it feels like a Grant improv. The climactic scene at the end of the movie where Cary is tied up, about to be murdered when the police come and the climactic fight scene breaks out. This is a life and death fight - the climax of the movie ! Chaos ensues...chairs flying, bodies flying and what does our friend Mr Grant do? After freeing himself from his bonds he goes and sits on the staircase - still in harm's way of the brawl and with a classic Grant gesture of \"don't bother me\" he says the immortal line...\"everybody off\" . At that point he pulls out his cigarette case and lights up. He completely pulled himself out the movie ! Sitting there puffing away on a cigarette without care for the bedlam or threat to his life that whirled around his character in cyclonic fashion.....\"everybody off\"...what a line !",

Cary Grant very ably plays Mortimer Brewster and he, and the entire movie, are so weird that they make the films HARVEY and BRINGING UP BABY seem normal!! And, for Cary Grant, it's hard to believe but true that he is even better in this film than he was in HIS GIRL Friday or BRINGING UP BABY. No other leading man of his time had that same wonderful touch for light comedy. Mortimer, once a confirmed bachelor, is marrying perky and beautiful Priscilla Lane and they are they plan on Honeymooning at Niagra Falls. But before the trip, Mortimer goes home to get his things and tell his sweet old aunts that he's married. And then,...everything gets VERY, VERY crazy to say the least! Mortimer accidentally stumbles on a dead body when he opens up the window seat! When Mortimer confronts them with the body he just found in the window seat, they don't seem the least bit concerned and tell him to forget about it and go to Niagra Falls! He finally convinces them to stop what they are doing and explain WHY there's a corpse in the house. They explain that some time ago, one of their aging male borders had a heart attack and died in the house and for the first time his face appeared genuinely happy! So, they reasoned that if they \"assist\" other lonely old men to an early grave they were actually doing a great kindness!! It seems they have spiked the Elderberry wine with a very toxic cocktail and once the victims die, crazy old \"Uncle Teddy\" (who thinks he's Teddy Roosevelt) just buries them in the basement--where he's already digging the Panama Canal!!! Now all this zaniness happens in just the first few minutes of the film! From there, it just gets stranger and funnier--and produces many of the funniest moments I have ever seen--particularly in the performances of Cary Grant, his aunts and the dreaded Jonathan Brewster, the \"black sheep\" of the family who stops by for an uninvited \"visit\".The movie, by the way, was based on a successful Broadway play. In fact, the movie actually was completed several years before it was released, as the play's writer got the studio to agree to hold off on the film's release until the play's run ended. Instead of the anticipated few months, the play ran for several years. In addition, one of the funniest lines from the movie was actually funnier on stage. When someone sees the ugly Jonathan Brewster, they comment that he looks like Boris Karloff. In the play, this IS who played Jonathan and it must have provided a heck of a laugh!",

            "content": "The phrase \"they don't make 'em like this any more\" must have been thought up with this film in mind. Arsenic and Old Lace is a comedy the likes of which could only have been made before cinema audiences became as jaded as they are now. The comedy is pitch black - but it's pitch black in a nice humour sort of a way. These days, too many filmmakers seem to think that black comedy has to be really dark - but Frank Capra knew it doesn't, and this movie is the result. Here, we have a film that follows themes of poisoning, crime and insanity, but it's so fun to watch that you don't realise just how macabre the plot is. The whole film is played out with a great big smile on it's face - and although the plot just continues to get more and more complicated as the film progresses - the audience doesn't notice because it's so fun to watch. We follow Mortimer Brewster, a critic who, on his wedding day, finds out that his kindly old aunts are really homicidal maniacs that have killed twelve gentlemen already. One of his brothers thinks he's Teddy Roosevelt, and the other is a wanted criminal with a strange likeness to Boris Karloff...as Mortimer himself says, insanity doesn't run in his family - it practically gallops! The whole film is held together courtesy of a maestro performance from Cary Grant. Grant is an absolutely superb actor, and every single scene with him in is just mesmerising. The one where he finds out that his aunts have killed the man in the window box is one of the best Cary ever did. The way that he commands the screen is awesome and I really can't lump enough praise on this great, great actor! He is joined by a whole host of weird and wonderful characters. The fact that all these characters are in the film gives it free reign to basically do whatever it wants. The plot is easy to follow because the characters are so unique from one another, and really; they could all be just standing around watching paint dry and it would be funny! Speaking of the word 'funny' - this film epitomises it! Arsenic and Old Lace doesn't suffer from a single dull moment, and you could laugh at practically any moment in the film and you wouldn't be laughing at nothing. Many people think that great classics need substance to be remembered - but this one proves otherwise. Arsenic and Old Lace is a good time, plain and simple - and yet there's nobody that can argue that this isn't a masterpiece. See this film!",

            "content": "And it doesn't even gallop, it's like roadrunner's running style. Indeed, this is one of the craziest movies you'll ever experience, even by today's standards. Yet it is so confident in its material that it embraces it with wide open arms and squeeze the most out of it\u0085 sometimes a little more than needed.Roger Ebert said that no good film is too long, no bad film is short enough, but I think there should be an exception with screwball comedies, because they're fast-paced and rely on plots that are the densest in terms of twists and situations' reversals, so that eighty non-stop comedic minutes have the same two-hour feel than thrillers. \"Arsenic and Old Lace\" would have benefited from a wiser editing, and Cary Grant's performance should have taken a significant part of it. The star himself disliked his performance saying it was too over-the-top, and \"Casablanca\" writers Epstein brothers, who adapted the play, expressed similar concerns.Director Capra agreed to make a few changes but the call of World War II left the initial production unaltered and some notable irony in Grant's acting as Mortimer Brewster: the straight-man of perhaps the most lunatic movie family ever being no less lunatic in his own reactions. His two aunts (Josephine Hull and Jean Adair) have discovered an unorthodox way for euthanizing old and lonely men: some glasses of wine mixed with arsenic, strychnine and a pinch of cyanide. It's less the fact that they just 'relieved' their twelfth victim from the burden of life that is funny in its wicked way but their total obliviousness to it, and this is where Grant's acting doesn't match the actresses' performances.The two aunts are funny because they are exactly as you would expect two old ladies to behave: sweet, smiling and cheerful, thus contributing to the funniest running-gag when no one, not even cops, believe they really buried corpses in the cellar. Someone acting ridiculously isn't funny, but someone being ridiculous in all seriousness can be. So while the aunts play their part with the perfect dose of nuance, cluelessness and a pinch of detachment, Grant's reactions when he discovers the corpse, learns about their actions, tries to reason them or to get his newlywed wife Elaine (Priscilla Lane) out of the house, are so over-the-top that they undermine the plot's credibility.What can be so credible about two old ladies who kill men and get away with it? Well, even the zaniest screwball classics had order within their chaotic story-line. \"Arsenic and Old Lace\" follows a clear plot line, Grant must prove that the acts of killings are from his crazy brother who pretends he's Teddy Roosevelt, so he has to keep the lowest profile. Yet his hysteria has side-effects and raises more suspicion and troubles than his brother's antics and aunts' behavior. In the end, he's as crazy as everyone else, one can blame it on the shock but he never feels like recovering from it and plays Mortimer Brewster in the same note. Now, is he funny? Yes, even hilarious. On its own, Cary Grant is unforgettable with all his screams, charges, howls and mimics to the camera, Grant really takes you off-guard and proves that he has the comical timing of the greats. It is just that he's not in-line with the other performers. And what was just a feeling in the beginning was confirmed when the two villains made their entrance: Raymond Massey as brother Jonathan and Boris Karloff's lookalike (another funny leitmotif) and his diminutive companion, Dr. Einstein, played by Peter Lorre). In the scene where the two men discover the macabre truth about the cellar, they don't overreact, but they simply compare their tallies and have a similar argument about one who didn't technically die by being killed till 'Johnny' points out that if the ill-fated man hasn't been shot, he wouldn't have died of that pneumonia.So, I'm torn between two attitudes when it comes to Grant's over(re)acting. I love to think that Mortimer wouldn't be so \"crazy\" if he wasn't surrounded by such crazy people, and his attitude is precisely the one of a sane person, but I'm pretty sure there was a way to tone it down. His character wasn't far from his Dr. Huxley from \"Bringing up Baby\" who also had a lot to deal with, and Huxley had an interesting line, he said he felt some attraction toward Hepburn's Susan during quiet moments, but there were no quiet moments. I wish Brewster went into quieter phases and not just when he was gagged.Now, the film had all the ingredients to the perfect screwball classic, using every kind of humor, and some great meta-referential jokes, exploring the profession of Brewster as a critic, it just tried to be too funny for its own good while a little less would've been better. But I'm being too harsh on the film; overall, I think it's a very nice moment you spend watching it, its length doesn't ruin the enjoyment and it has aged well, like a good wine... without any lethal addition of course.",

In 'Arsenic and Old Lace' he tackled the darkly funny type of humour that originally made Joseph Kesselring's play such a hit on the stage.Cary Grant stars as the drama critic Mortimer Brewster who has just married his sweetheart Elaine (Priscilla Lane) one fine morning. He rushes to tell his spinster aunts, but finds a horrible secret instead. Aunt Abby (Josephine Hull) and Aunt Martha (Jean Adair) Brewster have developed a quirky little habit. They invite lonely old men into their residence, poison them with arsenic, and bury them down in the cellar. Uncle 'Teddy' Brewster (who thinks he is Ted Roosevelt!)has a hand in the final act, but he's mad and doesn't have a clue what the old girls are up to. They consider the murders not as a crime, but an act of charity to the poor, lonely men out there. All havoc breaks loose when another member of the family, the Boris Karloff look-a-like Johnathon Brewster (Raymond Massey, in a wickedly funny performance), suddenly arrives home with his weak tag-along buddy Dr Einstein (the always great Peter Lorre).Wow. This film is so funny I literally had tears streaming down my face. Yes, Grant does overact and is completely over the top in his role, but who cares? The whole thing is zany, so it fits in perfectly. His facial expressions and reactions are priceless, great comedic timing from Mr Grant. It's still got the stage-bound feel to it, it's very talky, but what great talk we are blessed with! The dialogue is so witty and acerbic and dark for an early 40's comedy.It would have been interesting to see what a mystery/suspense director like Hitchcock would have done with the play.

            "content": "There's a great film here but you'll have to dig down in the basement for it.I saw this a few days after The Philadelphia Story and what a contrast they make. Both incidentally take place around a house. But that one stagy, sedate wit, pleasant in the way of a dinner engagement you'd rather skip. This one imaginative, uproarious, fluid in visual narrative, both in the short and the long form.In the short this means a lot of gags and a constant zap of manic energy - no less from Cary Grant who gives a Bugs Bunny performance, a new slapstick expression every minute. Once more a house of fiction and games, by now a Capra staple. In Mr. Deeds and You Can't Take it with You, it was a house where in all the playing around and unexpected fooling with etiquette we could recognize the upending of boring normalcy. It's a bit different this time.The playing around in this house is all about self-referential recognition of the absurdity of what we're watching. Fiction.Grant for one plays a dramatic critic, someone whose job is to watch and criticize plays. One such play unfolds in the house all around him, and it's one that constantly opens trapdoors in what we expect to see. I will not spoil the main surprises.This is one thing that's marvelous here. Having Grant (a rather smug fellow when we first see him) as viewer who is constantly bamboozled by what goes on around him.The swirl of fiction about fiction also involves a passing cop on the beat who is an aspiring playwright. In another spot Grant describes a scene from a silly play he once had to see, one where a hapless victim agreed to be tied down to a chair by killers, and while demonstrating the scene he finds himself in the very same scene he's describing, tied to a chair by killers. Another scene has him watch from a staircase at a fistfight while commenting on the action.There is a crazy nephew in the same house who thinks he's Teddy Roosevelt, dresses and performs the part and constantly charges up a staircase he thinks is San Juan hill. Teddy was probably still at this point the most iconic president anyone could remember. And of course famous for his blustering performances and a natural storyteller.Another brother is made up to look like Karloff from Frankenstein and is recognized by everyone in the film as Karloff the actor. No accident. Karloff himself was playing this character on the stage but could not appear in the film version. I should say it's a pity we don't have him but Massey is superb and truly steals every scene he's in.That's all fine. I adore visual imagination, the spontaneous and impromptu, the fooling with expectation. But Capra as so many times before misses in the long form; this is where what we see would begin to amount to real significance for someone who has a life in the story.There was no filmmaker more capable at the time than Capra (and I think him immense in talent), who always comes so close but could hit so widely off the mark.The long form here is that Grant is not just a critic, he's also a writer who's written a few books against marriage - but as the film begins has actually decided to marry his sweetheart. The film opens at the courthouse where he tries to marry while avoiding being recognized as the writer of those books.So this should be against everything he's espoused so far, there has to be some unresolved tension in him. Note also that one his books is titled 'Mind over marriage', possibly implying a life of the mind and enjoyment of oneself is preferable. And how about his aunts commenting at one point that 'everyone is nervous when they get married'?Here we see a narrator who has been attached to a story about how life should be, but now life and the vagaries of love capriciously upend it, showing to him how silly it has been.So what happens in the film? No sooner is he back from the courthouse to his aunts' house who are preparing a wedding cake and a celebration than things start happening out of the blue.Dead bodies suddenly abound, note, of lonely old men who had no family of their own. A brooding brother appears in the house (in the face of a famous cinematic monster no less), who has led the solitary life of a vagabond and has to change faces every so often, lost to himself.Is it his own brooding self the one who subconsciously intrudes upon the house on the day of his wedding and is creating what we see? Marvelously these intrusions are in the form of self-referential bits from other plays and movies, a critic's imagination.There are eventually too many shenanigans for this to shine clearly across the whole film, but you should definitely visit at some point.",

He's a much overlooked actor these days.  Also, the ending isn't changed.  I don't mind the \"son of a sea cook\" line -- in fact, I think it's funnier than the original.  However, the last line on the stage gives the play a hilarious twist, while the last line in the movie is anticlimactic.  After you've seen this movie (which I recommend you do) procure a copy of the play.  One more note:  with all the fine scene-stealing actors in this movie (Grant, Massey, Lorre, Horton, Carson) Josephine Hull leaves the most indelible image, and her performance does not dull with repeated viewings but remains as funny as the first time you saw her.  However much the other actors try to put their stamp on this, it's Hull's movie and we're fortunate to have her performance on celluloid.",

Police and paramedics arrived and the victim was pronounced dead on the scene.  Homicide detectives concluded that all evidence pointed to Frank Capra's film ARSENIC AND OLD LACE, which the man had watched on his dvd player while his wife was out.  The film apparently reached out from the television and killed the victim with an astonishing array of blunt trauma instruments: loud, annoying characters, poor comic timing, tepid pacing, stagebound theatrics, clumsy physical comedy, initially [mildly] amusing bits run into the ground repeatedly, and, most lethal of all, forced farce.\"If only the film had been 30 minutes shorter, the victim might have lived,\" claimed the county coroner.  \"He just couldn't take it for 118 minutes.

It runs fast, the situations are hilarious even if you are not supposed to be amused by the family with the history of insanity that not just runs.... \"It practically gallops\". The film which is based on the highly popular and successful play of the same title, takes place during one Halloween night that brings all Brewster's family skeletons out of the closet with the vengeance. During the course of one night, Mortimer Brewster, the famous writer and critic, will discover the shocking truth about his two most charming aunties, the nicest and sweetest ladies any nephew can imagine. They are two serial murderesses who had poisoned dozen of elderly lonely gentlemen with their famous elderberry wine out of pity for the misery of their loneliness. The aunties call the killings one of their charities. They see themselves as angels of mercy.Mortimer's escaped from prison psychotic long lost horrifying monster older brother Jonathan (he does have a face of Boris Karloff's Frankenstein) with a creepy accomplice plastic surgeon named Dr. Einstein (terrific Peter Lorre) chose the Halloween night for coming home and dragging a dead body with him. Comparing to the aunts and Johnathan, Mortimer's uncle Teddy is sweet and truly innocent. There is a little problem with Teddy though. He thinks he's Theodore Roosevelt; each time Teddy goes upstairs he blows a bugle, yells \"Charge!\", and takes the stairs at a run with a sword in his hand (an imitation of Roosevelt's famous charge up San Juan Hill). I read some comments that found Teddy's ascent that he repeats few times, irritating and annoying but I thought it was one of the funniest parts of the movie. Teddy is also digging 'The Panama Canal' in their cellar to bury the victims of \"yellow fever\" (or so Teddy is told by the aunties). Oh yes, on the top of all, Mortimer, who is known as a staunch bachelor and become famous for writing sarcastically about marriage in his articles and plays, just got married to a lovely young lady, the next door neighbor to his aunts in Brooklyn. His bride expects the attention that is only natural from the groom on the wedding night but...who would blame Mortimer of a little forgetfulness and absent-mildness when he is trying desperately to take care of the crazy relatives, two dead bodies in the living room, to avert the attention of bunch of cops that keep popping in from dozen of dead bodies buried in the cellar, and to survive his brother Jonathan's long lived hatred, very short temper, and passion to torture and to kill. I never thought that Cary Grant, the embodiment of a gentleman, romantic hero, and the man whom Jan Fleming had in mind when he created his immortal James Bond, could be so funny. The film that is directed by Frank Capra is almost two hours long but it combines the elements of comedy/horror/thriller/mystery so clever and witty that it never slows down or drags. It's got surprises on every turn, the acting is first class, and it is absolute delight. 9.5/10",

Oh yes the plot, the elderly Brewster sisters are the dear hearts of the neighbourhood, but what folk don't realise is that they are poisoning elderly male visitors to their home to save them from being lonely! This sets us up for romps as nephew Mortimer (Grant) lurches from one incredulous scene to another upon finding out about his dear Aunt's penchant for murder.Peter Lorre & Raymond Massey add to the madness upon visiting the house, whilst John Alexander almost steals the film as the barmy uncle who thinks he is Theodore Roosevelt! But it's Grant's show all the way, rarely will you see an actor express so many faces of incredulity with such mirthful results as what Grant gives us here. A joyous performance from the great man. Directed with all the sharpness and knowing of tones we expect from Frank Capra, the film is an out and out joy. So be sure to wear a corset to stop your sides from splitting. 9/10",

            "content": "Frank Capra's Arsenic and Old Lace took me by surprise, and I'll be the first one to admit that. Going into the film, I expected something serviceable thanks to the legendary names of director Frank Capra and lead actor Cary Grant. I was somewhat hesitant due to my lukewarm taste of screwball or slapstick comedies. Boy, was I ever in for a delightful surprise! From start to finish, I was laughing out loud which is an extreme rarity for me. I connected with the story, despite the themes of the movie. On the outside, the movie was made for laughs. Capra, in his autobiography, said he wanted to create a simple comedy designed to be a money-making hit before he went into service (at the end of World War 2). Despite the funny exterior, there is darkness if you dig too deep. Some of the themes the movie deals with is euthanasia (which is still a debatable topic in today's modern world). Because of these darker themes and the ability to make me laugh, Arsenic and Old Lace is what you can consider to be a black comedy. Frank Capra's movie, written by Julius Epstein and Philip Epstein and adapted from a popular Broadway play by Joseph Kesselring, is about a drama critic named Mortimer Brewster (Cary Grant), who had a courthouse wedding with his new wife, Elaine Harper (Priscilla Lane). Mortimer is on his way to tell his two dear aunts, Abby Brewster (Josephine Hull) and Martha Brewster (Jean Adair) the good news. These ladies seem to be kind, old ladies, but they hold a dark secret. They like to murder lonely, single men affiliated with religion. They force their nephew, Teddy (John Alexander), who thinks he is Teddy Roosevelt, to bury the bodies in the Panama Canal (perhaps the cellar). Then there is the other nephew Jonathan who comes home after a long time avoiding the authorities due to his nature of killing people and has an uncanny resemblance of Boris Karloff. Now Mortimer has to keep his aunts happy and prevent them from murdering others, appeal to the love of his life, and deal with the nephews all while trying to cling on to his sanity. Cary Grant once said that this was the worst film he has ever been a part of. Granted, this is a different kind of film than what Grant is accustomed to, but points need to be given because he expanded his acting chops. I thought he gave a delightful and funny performance. On occasions, Grant has shown the ability to be funny and he does that here. Raymond Massey does a great job as Boris Karloff reincarnate. Funnily enough, Karloff was the first choice to star in the movie but he was unable to commit because he was one of the main people in the stage play which led to this film. Jean Adair and Josephine Hull were delightful as the murderous aunts. Rosy on the outside, but bloody on the inside. I also must give a shout out to Peter Lorre, who portrayed Jonathan's German sidekick, Mr. Einstein. Overall, I had a great time watching this movie. It is funny, delightful, and honestly the perfect movie to watch as a family on Halloween. Whether there is witty comedy, sweet romance, or macabre deeds-this film certainly has something for everyone! Arsenic and Old Lace was my first taste of Frank Capra, and boy it was such a sweet taste. I think now I need to check out other Capra's masterpieces such as It's A Wonderful Life or Mr. Smith Goes to Washington. My Grade: A+",

            "content": "The 30s and 40s were the great age of genre movies, and with any kind of genre establishment, there will inevitably be spoofs. The horror movie in particular was advancing swiftly at this time (largely thanks to Val Lewton and his antics over at RKO), but Arsenic and Old Lace has its origins not in movie-land but is adapted (by celebrated fraternal duo Julius and Philip Epstein) from a popular Joseph Kesselring stage play of the time.The director is Frank Capra, of all people. It's the closest Capra ever got to horror, and really his first all-out comedy since the silent era (his silent comedies were truly dire, by the way). Oddly enough though he actually does a very decent job of taking on the methods of horror. Arsenic and Old Lace shows many of the \"unnerving\" formal techniques that had been perfected over the last twenty or so years \u2013 actors moving towards the camera, doorways open in the background. The cluttered set decoration really helps here, as does the cinematography, not so much because of the light and shadow but because of the sharp definition it gives to all the bits and bobs on the set, giving that archaic, stuffy, Gothic feel to the house in which the action takes place. Of course the aim of this picture is not to be actually scary, but it certainly does add to the fun to set the right tone. It actually looks better than most of the genuine horrors from around this period, but this is probably mainly due to the fact that the genre was strictly B-budget. Perhaps what is most surprising about this being a Capra picture is that it does not have Capra's name all over it.What is more interesting about Arsenic and Old Lace is its cast. A lot of comedies feature a \"straight\" man surrounded by various loopy oddballs, and this is more or less the case here, except that the opposite is true for the way they are played. Lead man Cary Grant, always an excellent and sophisticated comedy player, is unusually over-the-top, seeming to put in various crazed mannerisms as they occur to him. A lot of these are hilarious, but easy to miss \u2013 like waggling a spoon when someone gets Witherspoon's name wrong \u2013 so repeated viewings are recommended. Grant himself felt he went a bit too far, and at times I am tempted to agree with him (his head-bobbing like an intrigued pigeon is not really very funny) \u2013 this certainly isn't his best work. But he gets a good share of laughs and that's what counts.Besides Grant, we have a good selection of the sort of people we can expect to see as supporting players in a comedy, except that in contrast to the lead man (and even in contrast to their usual personae) they are in fact underplaying it. The wonderful Edward Everett Horton is almost natural, although he still has that brilliant tendency to make an innocuous line sound funny, a good example being his \"One never can tell\" response to Grant saying he'd never been to the sanatorium. Raymond Massey (not actually a comedy player, but a fine dramatic actor) certainly looks outlandish, but his performance is creepily understated. Peter Lorre, who could sometimes be a little annoying, as at his very best here, again in very subtle mode. Jack Carson is also very funny as an unintelligent cop. Strange as it may sound, this dynamic between a normal-yet-exaggerated lead man and weird-yet-natural supporting players works fantastically, and is the main thing that makes the movie enjoyable.But on the downside, Arsenic and Old Lace is perhaps lacking a little in structure and purpose. It is in fact not really a proper horror spoof, as despite the look of the thing it doesn't really send up or even reference the conventions of the genre at all. Not that it necessarily has to be a true spoof to be good, but a decent, fully-fleshed comedy needs something else, some other point of interest, be that satire, romance, suspense, pathos or simply the pricking of pomposity, which is largely what kept the Marx Brothers comedies going. Without that additional factor it simply a collection of gags and silly business. And on that level it is good fun to watch (albeit a little long and slow to get going), but it falls some way short of being a masterpiece.",

The brother who thinks he's Teddy Roosevelt is beyond annoying after his first \"CHARGE!\" up the staircase.The action and characterization are contrived.

Firstly, it was a very well received Broadway show and the film wasn't released until the play closed. A so-called one-two punch for the public. Now we take a Munster like home, with a cemetery on the premesis, in Brooklyn. Add to it an elderly gent who thinks he's Teddy Roosevelt and because so, CHARGES UPSTAIRS blowing a bugle because it's San Juan Hill which the neighbors can't tolerate. Then when necessity demands, he's in uniform holding a shovel and going down to the basement to dig out another Panama Canalish grave because there's been another yellow fever victim.Then we take two of his biddie sisters who spice up homemade elderberry wine which is a staple for elder lonely gents who are interested in their room for rent and stay for dinner and stay and stay and stay.Then we have Cary Grant,the nephew of the bugle blower and two biddies who write books about the misery of marriage and still takes the plunge while his bride sits and waits and waits and waits until their cab leaves for Niagara Falls.Then we have a window seat that contains unusual merchandise which very much concerns Mr. Grant who wants to move to the left and can't; wants to move to the right and can't; wants to move straight ahead but can't; wants to please his new wife but can't...the man's trapped, tormented,confused and hilarious too.Next we add to all this a cop played by Jack Carson who wrote a play and amid all the confusion,wants critic Grant to review it.

            "content": "ARSENIC AND OLD LACE was one of the great stage comedies of the 1940s, and even today the script remains a staple of high school, college, community theatre across the country. The story is convoluted, to say the least: two elderly sisters renowned for good deeds have taken to aiding lonely old men by offering them a glass of poisoned wine (one of their victims found time to say \"How delicious!\"), and when their homicidal maniac nephew Jonathan unexpectedly returns after several years he feels compelled to keep pace with their body count. Fortunately, there is a ready victim at hand: his brother Mortimer,who is apparently the only sane member of the family.Cary Grant is on record saying that he greatly disliked his work in this film, and in truth his entire performance consists of nothing but double and triple takes, stammerings, and fits of hysteria--but he executes them with impeccable timing and creates a good foil for the truly memorable performances that run through the film: Raymond Massey as the homicidal Jonathan, Josephine Hull and Jean Adair as the lethal ladies, and memorable supporting performances from Peter Lorre, Edward Everette Horton, Jack Carson, John Alexander, and Priscilla Lane, all of whom play out the outrageous script with considerably dexterity, intelligence, and disconcerting humor.This is an extremely frantic, extremely broad farce, and director Frank Capra is not entirely at home with the material, which he presents in a somewhat stagy manner--but truth be told it is unlikely that any other director would be more successful. ARSENIC AND OLD LACE is most at home on the stage; on the screen it has a tendency to become slightly overbearing, and some will find it too strident for their tastes. But the script is wickedly funny, the complicated plot is fun to unravel, and the cast is extremely memorable. Most people will enjoy seeing it more than once! Gary F.

For Capra, it was a return to comedy after the seriousness of his \"name\" recent social commentary films, involving Messrs Deeds, Smith and Doe and who better to employ in such a film than Grant, the acknowledged master of screwball, most prominently in films like \"His Girl Friday\", \"The Awful Truth\" and \"Bringing Up Baby\". The film was an adaptation of a long-running hit stage comedy, the Broadway success of which in fact delayed the release of the movie by some two years until it ended its run, so you really think that this combination of director, cast and material couldn't fail,Well, while it certainly didn't fail with the screen audiences of the time, I have to say it left me pretty much as cold as the stiffs interred in the makeshift Panama Canal dug by \"Teddy Roosevelt\" in the cellar of the home maintained by Grant's two endearing old aunts. Grant is Mortimer Brewster, the famous journalist and playwright of the day, well-known for his advocacy of bachelorhood, who tries to quietly conceal from the press his new marriage to his vivacious young wife Priscilla Lane, his very own girl-next-door as it turns out. The only people with whom he wants to share the news are his elderly Aunts Abbie and Martha who it turns out have a bigger surprise for him which I'll discreetly mention involves collecting the hats of recently departed elderly male guests at their shambling old house. The plot thickens when Mort's brother, Jonathan (Raymond Massey), the very definition of the family black sheep, being a convicted murderer and all, plus his make-it-up-as-he-goes-along plastic surgeon Peter Lorre turn up on the same family doorstep the same night as Grant and Lane.It's all very frantic and fast-moving but the humour is very broad, lots of gags are repeated throughout the film, to ever-decreasing returns and the performances are very uneven. Grant is on record as stating this was his worst ever screen performance and he's not wrong, he's wildly over the top from the minute he fatefully opens his aunts' window seat and can't seem to get back down from there. There are many recognisable faces, as ever, in Capra's supporting stock company but they're all acting in a stammeringly silly way. Massey is amusing up to a point in his Boris Karloff guise, Lorre is a good foil for him and Lane adds a touch of effervescence as she forever tries to lure her husband upstairs on what is after all, their wedding night but I wasn't much beguiled by the dotty old spinsters and soon tired of one-joke \"Teddy Roosevelt\".Capra made one of the very best screwball comedies, indeed he practically invented the genre, years before with \"It Happened One Night\", but here, for some reason, he's way off. Maybe he rushed things, as he had a wartime military assignment awaiting him and certainly he doesn't rein in Grant's excesses but besides these faults, there's just none of the crisp timing and slick humour I normally associate with him.For me then, this is a rare misfire from two of the giants of Golden-Age Hollywood and I rather wish the movie had glugged some of the aunts' potent wine before heading out into circulation.",

I wasn't. But the plot, gags, and dialogues are so well designed, written, and put into action, that a smile will spread on your face at the very beginning of the film and will last until the ending credits.Cary Grant, with his over-the-top over-acting, carries much of the film on his shoulders. He plays a journalist who became famous for his anti-marriage bestseller, and then he himself tied the knot. As if this in itself does not complicate his life enough, on the wedding day and just before leaving for the honeymoon, he learns that his aunts, who raised him, are secretly serial killers who, out of pity, put lonely old gentleman out of their misery. And that's not nearly the end of complications. His benevolent but completely crazy brother, who lives in the belief that he is Roosevelt, helps them bury the victims, and soon, in the family house where the entire film takes place, joins them maniacal third brother who has just escaped from life imprisonment.While Grant is trying to resolve the situation (at the same time hiding it from his wife, who persistently sneaks around in anticipation of the departure on the honeymoon), potential new victims, police officers who seemed to have dropped out of cop-joke, and the head of the sanatorium parade through the house, creating utter chaos, which seems more and more hopeless.\"Arsenic and Old Lace\" had no Oscar nominations, and perhaps it does injustice only to the script. Then again, I have nothing to complain about, because everything is at a high level and perfectly balanced. I wouldn't rank it among the best films of all time, but it doesn't lag far behind. Quality entertainment, very fun and can be watched countless times without losing effectiveness.9/10.",

            "content": "My first thought as Arsenic and Old Lace ended: I didn't know Capra had it in him! This is a delightfully morbid comedy, one that sometimes is pitch-dark in tone, but it so insane that it can do no wrong. It opens on a Brooklyn Dodgers game that goes into riot and then... it moves on right away to a whole other location somewhere else in Brooklyn, as the title cards reveal. We're then placed into the home of two little old ladies- the Brewester Aunts- who happen to keep not one, not two, but about twelve or thirteen dead bodies down in the cellar (well, also one in that chest in the living room), much to their son Mortimer's (Cary Grant) total shock and wide-eyed \"WHAT!\" attitude. But, hey, how can just this make a movie? Why not also throw in a \"Boris Karloff\" character in Raymond Massey and his cohort played by Peter Lorre who hold up in the house and have a body of their own. And then, well, I haven't mentioned Theodore Roosevelt...This is one of the all-time champion madcap comedies. It starts with craziness and never lets up, not for a minute (maybe for a second or two, and even then there's some sardonic weirdness), and Capra also has a great control of style when it's commanded (i.e. the scenes in the dark, the silhouettes, the solid close-ups on Grant and Massey when they make indelible, uproarious facial expressions). Mostly, however, he just lets the material take over as his guide, and it's genius work. Never something that is much subtle- matter of fact, it's one of the most obvious works ever- it's like a high-voltage spoof of Hitchcock's Rope, before it was released, and themes of death, insanity, marriage, the tenderness between brothers and mothers, are put up in the air for total comic frenzy. Even Grant works wonderfully, in a performance he himself thought was too over-the-top, which might be true in any other context but here is pitch-perfect.It's got plenty of amazing quotes, more than a few moments that seem to be hip and wild even by today's standards, and there are several strands of comedy that go through and overlap and make up lots of things that are sometimes unbelievable... wait, sometimes? You've got a guy who trumpets and charges up the stairs, and distrusts men who look like Taft, and he might not be the most delirious character in the movie! It's incredible work, and one of the funniest movies ever made.",

The writing, the acting, the timing, and did we forget to say Frank Capra? Done deal. One thing that has to be underlined is Cary Grant's hilarious double takes and mugging. In fact, according to film notes, after initial pre-screenings, it actually was bantered about that some of his scenes should be edited, believing they were \"too silly\"! Didn't happen. Good idea. This film was beautifully mounted and, ironically, the great Raymond Massey, who could have played this all with a smile, did quite the opposite was just as hilarious as Grant! Shear genius. More over, how can you mess with a guy who looks so much like Boris Karloff? Peter Lorre is also thrown into the mix for good measure and this makes one incredible black comedy. An interesting note is that Lorre co-starred in a very similar vehicle, or take-off, with Karloff, THE BOOGIE MAN WILL GET YOU, two years earlier. The dialogue is fun, peppered with some dandy one liners, which the whole cast takes advantage of. And never forget the memorable running gag of Teddy Roosevelt and his bugle, which all of us kids loved to imitate and, every once in a while, may still be to this day!!

He finds more than what he bargained for. When he finds a body instead. What's even more peculiar is that his Aunts cheerfully admit that they did the dirty deed, and leave the body for Teddy Roosevelt to bury in one of his locks in the Panama Canal (don't ask). During all of this, his long lost brother and a weasely doctor come by, on the lam, themselves carrying a body, and so the whole thing becomes a cat and mouse, bait and switch thing, that somewhat tries to resolve itself but leaves us wanting the whole thing to end just so we can stop watching Grant mug for the camera all the time.

The movie is about drama critic who goes against his convictions about matrimony and marries the girl he loves and on the way to his honeymoon he finds out that his two adorable aunts are insane murders who likes to kill old pathetic loner and bury them in their cellar. Though the start is bit a slow but after some while the movie takes a roller coaster ride. Often movies revolves around one or two characters but in this movie every character is unique and has its own domain; whether it's mentally delusional Teddy Roosevelt (John Alexander), who in my opinion was the brightest and most funniest impersonation ever done on cinema or whether its Jonathan Brewster (Raymond Massey), maniacal murderer who with the help of his friend Dr. Einstein (played superbly by Peter Lorre) gets a new face resembling Boris Karloff, every one was hilarious in the movie.

Alas, this black comedy about getting away with murder is too antic by half, with Grant famously over-the-top and director Frank Capra trying to squeeze his usual \"feel-good\" vibe into a clunkily-over-sized Charles Addams cartoon. And who had the bright idea of inviting stone-faced Raymond Massey to the proceedings?Grant's hot-and-cold routine with perplexed bride Priscilla Lane annoys, and his double-takes and chronic mugging only make him look like a poor man's Lou Costello. Beautiful people can't gurn; that's why Will Ferrell makes the movies he does and Jude Law doesn't.There's also a Brewster who thinks he's Theodore Roosevelt, used as an excuse to overuse a gag about him charging up a staircase like it's San Juan Hill. And poor Massey, trying to fill the shoes of Boris Karloff, who on Broadway played the same character of Mortimer's evil brother, overplays the menace and loses the laugh in every scene he's in.\"Arsenic\" would be more palatable if it were shorter. I loved Anscules' review here, the news report about that man \"bludgeoned\" by slapstick. It's not that the humor is in bad taste, though you may feel as bad as I did for those dozen poor souls, not to mention a cabbie who loses a night's labor. It's just that Capra's one of those directors who think it's funny if it's played faster and louder. Grant disliked his performance here, and I did, too.I did like the killer aunts, especially Josephine Hull as Aunt Abby, who almost hops in and out of frame with her delightful smile (there's someone who could GURN!). Peter Lorre underplays his part of Massey's less evil sidekick, selling every scene he's in. Being a play adaptation, the film is largely bound to one set, but it's a great set, a living room in a pastoral part of the big city replete with Victorian knick-knacks like tea cozies and a grandfather clock. There's nice camera-work, too, subtle and lending an antic tone to the proceedings, as if it was needed.It's not a bad film, but it goes on too long, and doesn't really leave a pleasant taste.

They don't seem to know loneliness isn't always permanent . . . and anyway, wouldn't a better antidote be to offer friendship instead of arsenic?) It's kind of weird that Mortimer's brilliant solution to the problem is to blame all the murders on Teddy Roosevelt Brewster, their brother who, compared to them, is innocent (him not knowing reality from fantasy.) If there's a hearing about Ted, won't his version of being President of the US clash with poisoning lonely old men? The Yellow Fever story doesn't jive with the evidence in the basement.\nTHE most irritating behavior of Mortimer's is that he begins to treat his bride of a few hours like dog poop. He offers her no explanation for his one hundred eighty degree shift in attitude towards their marriage and honeymoon. 'Just get the f... out of my house', he's saying, basically. It's especially galling to me that when she has finally had enough of the mistreatment and tells him good bye, he says, \"That's wonderful dear,\" and goes back to his phone call which is part of his loony bin scheme. Is it really an excuse to treat her like she has the plague just because he's discovered his aunts are batty? Why can't he confide in her anyway? What is their relationship based on? Not trust certainly. At what point did he plan on bringing her into his world where they shared their worries?\nThe next exasperating flaw of Mortimer's is his belief that mental illness is inherited. Even in the forties this wasn't a majority belief. By then we had Freud and other experts that focused the cause of mental illness more on the environment than inheritance. Mortimer is a playwright and author which means he's educated which raises the question: how did he not learn this? Rather than even consider that there's no one to one ratio between insanity and mentally ill offspring, he abruptly says good bye to her . . . . oh, and he doesn't think she even deserves an explanation. As an audience we're supposed to laugh it off: Ha Ha Ha Ha.\nI also found the cops annoyingly stupid. The most egregious part is how long they tolerate a bound and gagged Mortimer to stay bound and gagged. His eyes state that he isn't part of the joke . . . or play pitch or whatever Officer O'Hara is calling it. And when they do decide to untie him WHY IS THE GAG THE LAST THING TO BE TAKEN OFF???? How is that even believable that cops could be that obtuse? And after at least four different people mention the bodies in the basement you'd think the police captain might just walk down there out of curiosity. They're asking the audience to believe that a borough the size of Brooklyn doesn't have any policemen with brains. That's the worst of it. Want to know what kind of screwball comedy does pass my test of believable? \"Hangover.\" Twice the movie this was.",

But that's just the beginning... we see the home he was raised in, and find that they're all a little bit crazy, and have been since the first Brewster came off the Mayflower. What kind of impression does this make on the new bride? As with every other movie of the time, Cary Grant shows up again! But this time as a perennial bachelor, very George Clooneyish (before there was a George Clooney), and incredibly silly. By far my favorite Grant performance that I have seen yet. Perhaps one is to thank director Frank Capra... is he the one who brought out this humorous side of Grant that was underplayed in his past roles? This is also a fine performance from Peter Lorre, as a scheming man posing as a doctor. Very Lorre! And partnered with him? A Boris Karloff lookalike (complete with Frankenstein scars), with a quite memorable shot of the monster's shadow looming over Lorre in the basement. And then, a relative who thinks he's Teddy Roosevelt? Even knowing what things he's going to do in the future? Interesting.I'm not sure where the \"arsenic and old lace\" fit in... I may not have been paying attention at that part. I was probably distracted by the thirteen bodies in the basement. Or maybe it was the Panama Canal.This film is quite humorous, and a fine anticipation of William Castle's version of \"The Old Dark House\". The two are very similar in spirit, and it would be hard to say which is the superior. I may have to give this one the credit, primarily for being made first... but also for the best Peter Lorre role since \"M\".",

Cary Grant's Mortimeris a masterpiece. His reactions to his situation are astonishing. For me it is one of his great performances. Raymond Massey as the returning Jonathan, who now looks like Boris Karloff since his plastic surgery, is hilariously menacing, and Peter Lorre, as the surgeon Dr. Einstein, is a perfect foil for him. He does a lot with his gestures - he's a riot. The cast is rounded out by Priscilla Lane, James Gleason, Edward Everett Horton, and Jack Carson, all of whom are marvelous in their roles. Capra brings it all together in a fast-moving film where there is always something going on.This is a hilarious movie. During the introduction on TCM, Peter Bogdanovich mentioned that Boris Karloff could not play the role of Jonathan, which he did on Broadway, because he was actually performing on Broadway at the time. I thought I had read elsewhere that he was actually very upset that he wasn't cast in the role of a man who looks like Boris Karloff. It would have been great to see him.

He's referenced by name in at least two other movies I'm aware of - \"Dick Tracy Meets Gruesome\" (1947) and \"Charlie Chan at the Opera\" (1936) - and he's actually in both of those! Unfortunately he wasn't available to appear in this picture, but Raymond Massey's makeup job was pretty credible; the fist thing I thought of when I saw him was Boris Karloff! Director Frank Capra had a wonderful touch for his screwball comedy projects. Though viewers will find favorable comparisons to other Cary Grant films like \"His Gal Friday\" and \"Bringing Up Baby\", the picture I thought of while watching this was another Capra picture, \"You Can't Take it With You\". That one also featured a dysfunctional family, though with a larger and more disparate cast, and fortunately, no one gets murdered!What gives this story it's surreal comic edge is the vitality of the Brewer Sisters (Josephine Hull and Jean Adair), whose approach to putting elderly gents out of their misery is handled with genuine nonchalance and sincerity. As Mortimer Brewster, Grant has all he can do to maintain some semblance of sanity with all the lunacy surrounding him and his new bride. The only downside to the story for me was the short shrift given to the character of the new Mrs. Brewster (Priscilla Lane). Had her part been written to take advantage of the hysteria surrounding the Brewster household, I think audiences might have appreciated it even more.Even so, repeat viewings are probably in order to fully appreciate the zany antics of 'Teddy Roosevelt' (John Alexander), Dr. Einstein (Peter Lorre), Officer O'Hara (Jack Carson) and all the rest. For his part, Cary Grant was never more expressive than he was here, with each new turn of the story dealing yet another blow to his fractured psyche. His best scene for me was when he simply gave up the pretense of being surprised any more, and just sat down on the staircase with all the mayhem swirling around him while peacefully lighting up a cigarette - \"Amazing, amazing, amazing\".",

But I'm not one of the types of lonely old men that the sisters go after, and while I might rent a room from them, I would be sure to let them know that I had a life. The sad thing is that the men they poison and bury in their basement did not, and when the rest of the family discovers that, it's motive for blackmail, a chance to panic, and if you are a nervous Nancy like Cary Grant, you will be frantic of being tied in with these hysterical but brutal murders. He's engaged to Priscilla Lane, a lovely girl who doesn't realize the family of macadamia's she marrying into, and while the old lace on the curtains and homey feel of their large house seems genuine, there's something sinister. The other nuts in the family includes a brother who insists that he's Teddy Roosevelt and a psychopathic killer they refuse to talk about anymore. John Alexander screams \"Charge!\" every time he runs down the stairs, and insists that he's off to Africa on a safari. All of a sudden, sinister gloom arrives in the form of Raymond Massey, the long forgotten Brewster brother who quickly discovers, along with his strange little friend Peter Lorre, that there is more going on in his old home than elderberry wine making and pie cooking.A huge cast of familiar and funny characters players helps move this comedy right along, held for two years from release due to the success of the Broadway play. Hull and Adair get to repeat their roles, but most of the cast is new to the material. Massey takes on the role of Jonathan Brewster, the psycho brother originated on stage by Boris Karloff. But as much as he was missed in the movie, it wasn't the end of Jonathan for Karloff who would appear in a TV version a decade later. Grant seems a bit too sophisticated at times for the role of the nervous brother, but is so funny being cast against type, and of course Hull and Adair are delightfully lovable with only the best intentions of dispatching of the men they poison.Massey and Lorre are wonderfully malevolent and sinister, while Edward Everett Horton, Jack Carson, James Gleason and Grant Mitchell offer very funny performances as well. The stage origins of the film are obvious, but it is directed extremely well by the legendary Frank Capra who isn't striving for anything but hysterics in perhaps his only non topical feature. The sets and photography defy description in their excellence, and the pacing never lets down. It wasn't that much edited from the original play, and really stands the test of time.",

I know he thought his performance was one of his least believable in the film but I thought he acquitted himself quite well with the rest of the cast. I also know about Boris Karloff being the originator of the role of Jonathan and his being the one who was most suitable to play it because of the in-joke of his character's resemblance to him, but Raymond Massey taking over was still pretty funny enough especially with Peter Lorre playing alongside him. Frank Capra did very well adapting this stage comedy to the screen so kudos to him for taking the assignment. Anyway, that's a high recommendation for Arsenic and Old Lace. P.S. Since I'd always like to cite when players from my favorite movie-Capra's It's a Wonderful Life-are in others, here it's Charles Lane as one of the reporters in the beginning of the movie and Gary Owen as the cab driver Grant keeps avoiding who eventually appeared in that particular classic-as the guy who says to Potter he may eventually work for George Bailey and the person who helps Bert the Cop decorate the Baileys' honeymoon suite, respectively-I always like to watch every year during December.",

I often find the screwball comedies of the thirties and forties to be a little too \"slap-stick\" for my taste. However, this one has such a dark twist to it's plot that the silliness is necessary to keep it from nearly becoming a crime drama! Mortimer Brewster (Cary Grant in an over-the-top performance that he has said was his least favorite of his performances) returns to his kind, sweet aunts, Martha (Jean Adair) and Abbey (played by the wonderful Josephine Hull). All he wants to do is let them know he has gotten married, and that he is off to his honeymoon. Everything is all good, until Mortimer discovers a body in the window seat of his aunts' house. Trying to make sense of all of this would be hard enough if poor Mortimer wasn't already concerned with the mental-state of his brother, Theodore (John Alexander), who believes that he is Theodore Roosevelt. On top of all of this, Mortimer and his aunts are visited by his estranged brother, Jonathan (Raymond Massey) and his side-kick, Dr. Einstein (Peter Lorre). If something can go wrong for Mortimer, it does! Based on the hit Broadway play, Arsenic and Old Lace features eccentric performances from everyone involved, ranging from the Grant's manic Mortimer to the sinister Jonathan Brewster, and from the lovely Abbey and Martha to the outrageous Theodore/\"Teddy\" (who incidentally steals the show!). Peter Lorre's performance is very good, too. Everyone in the film has their timing down, which is important because of the millions of double-takes you see in this movie. Every facial expression is very telling, albeit exaggerated. However, as I said, it needed to be \"silly.\" Cary Grant HAD to be over-the-top, and I believe it is to his credit that he could go against his instincts to deliver the performance that he did. Frank Capra's ability to pull this three-ring circus together is certainly an achievement in of itself.All in all, this is a wonderful comedy, not to be missed by anyone with a dark sense of humor!",

The hero knows he's in danger, yet sits around waiting to be gagged and tied; he doesn't turn his head to see the villain sneaking up behind him, as a normal person would do ... and all the while, Mortimer is doing exactly the same thing, as a villain sneaks up on him in exactly the same way.  His bellyaching monologue even provides the villain with a useful idea.The scene was obviously crafted for the stage.  And yet, if Capra had changed it, made Mortimer a FILM critic, and had him carp about some movie he'd seen recently, the joke would have fallen flat.  I don't claim to fully understand why this is so.  Part of the reason is this: in the movie, at any rate, the reason the joke is such a delicious one has nothing to do with its self-referential nature.  The real joke is that Mortimer has seen so many plays that he has started to act like the characters in them, even at the very moment he reflects on and complains about how stupid they are.  The joke isn't on the nature of fiction or anything like that - it's on HIM. The scene might well be funnier in a stage performance - I suspect it is - but this particular joke would be lost.It's the fact that the film is based on a play that accounts for the fact that the characters, at times, seem to move around in a confined space as though they're model trains on rails.  I mean this as a compliment.  The cast moves with energy AND precision.  Cary Grant is wonderful.  (He's the one uncomfortable performer in \"Bringing Up Baby\", and a very leaden jester indeed in \"North By Northwest\", but here he shows he CAN do comedy, as well as anyone.)  Timing throughout is flawless.  Just one of several touches of genius: the establishing scene at the registry, which all by itself prevents the fact that Mortimer is unaccountably neglecting his bride from preying unduly on our minds (since we've been implicitly told that nothing bad will come of it in the end).No truly great comedy NEEDS to be hilarious in order to be good.

            "content": "Attn: Spoilers (not that it really matters) I had little idea what Arsenic and Old Lace was about when I began watching it tonight. All I needed to know was that Cary Grant was in it and Frank Capra directed. What else do you really need? Well it turns out, quite a bit.Let's start with the beginning. A baseball stadium. Crowds cheering. Vendors yelling almost directly into the camera. Excitement on the field. Great way to start a movie -- my attention is piqued. Looking back, though, it begs the question: Why? The opening sequence, while whetting the appetite of the viewer, serves little other purpose than to place the story in Brooklyn and then leave you wondering what a baseball game had to do with the rest of the film at all. Seems a bit clich\u00e9 and gimmicky in hindsight.Then we're introduced to Mortimer and his wife to be. We find out he's a well-known theater critic and author of books trashing the institution of marriage. How ironic it is, then, that he's getting married... Now even though there are countless romantic comedies based on this concept -- of the playboy bachelor meeting his match and falling in love, throwing away his old lifestyle to finally settle down -- I never tire of it. It's a classic story line. Why this particular element is in this film, though, is another question. Mortimer could have just as easily been an uptight and conservative insurance man who was getting married to the girl next door and the character would have worked just as well. At no point in the film is Mortimer's change in attitude toward marriage ever utilized, and his background as a theater critic is played up for nothing more than a few cheap laughs.These initial scenes, then, raise the question as to whether Frank Capra was intentionally trying to mislead the viewer as a kind of in-joke -- teasing us with the idea of something exciting happening in a baseball game, or with the possibility of screwball antics to come -- or whether it was just poorly thought out, arbitrary storytelling. For a film as unhinged as Arsenic and Old Lace, I would presume the latter.The rest of the movie suffers from inconsistencies in tone, swinging from romantic to creepy to foreboding and then downright ridiculous. It is, in total, clumsily put together. I will grant that it has its funny moments (notably the scene when the taxi driver waiting outside the house helps Cary Grant call another cab) but these are rare in what is an otherwise extremely frustrating film to watch.One of the biggest problems with this film is that most of the action is driven by the very thin plot device of Mortimer trying to get all the signatures necessary to commit Teddy into an insane asylum. This is what motivates Mortimer to run all over town, ignore his new bride, and desperately try to hide the fact that his two sweet aunts are cold-blooded killers. It also blinds him from seeing that his supposed brother, Jonathan, is completely insane. All of Mortimer's actions appear to be centered around saving Teddy, first and foremost. We must assume, then, that Mortimer cares deeply for Teddy. The problem is, we can only assume, as we never really see any sort of unique relationship between the two. Capra clearly thought there was enough time in the film for a couple sincere scenes between Mortimer and his new wife. But it would have been much more effective to develop Mortimer's relationship with Teddy, because then we might know why saving Teddy was so important. I realize this is supposed to be a zany comedy, but in great comedies, you usually care about the characters. I realized about halfway through this film I didn't care about what happened to anyone because they didn't seem to genuinely care about each other.This makes the last third of the film excruciating to watch, as it drags out the tension between the characters as they try to hide or divert others from finding out the truth of what's lying in the cellar. Again, I understand this is supposed to be a madcap kind of comedy. But it has no heart -- the characters are one-dimensional, lack any sliver of self-awareness, and barrel their way to the finish line by sheer inertia and stupidity. My question is: what's so funny about that?",

But this unusual comedy set on Halloween evening is much more.Though others reviewers may reveal twists and the writers' intentions, I will only say that this is an unusual comedy that is appropriately called \"dark\".Cary Grant plays Mortimer Brewster, nephew of the two elderly sisters. When the film opens, he has just--unexpectedly--married Elaine Harper (glowingly played by Priscilla Lane). The couple drops by the house to announce their big news and gather their belongings for a honeymoon trip to Niagara Falls. But circumstances derail their plans and what ensues is a night of absurd hilarity.The supporting cast is wonderful and wonderfully recognizable. Frank Capra may have directed some of them to play their parts over the top, but the wacky spirit of the story shines through. This is a comedy classic.",

Still everyone else involved in this film is superb especially Peter Lorre as Dr. Einstein and Raymond Massey as the Boris Karloff-like Jonathan Brewster. Great menace from Massey and wonderful spinelessness from Lorre--just terrific support to keep the film fun and entertaining when it was starting to get a little stilted.Josephine Hull, Jean Adair, John Alexander are all truly outstanding in their roles and play them with gusto (they seem to be enjoying themselves playing the roles). Also the very lovely Priscilla Lane is really quite good here too and her performance is too often overlooked and unappreciated.There's too much good here to overlook this film even though the bad is generally annoying.",

This legion is composed of gentlemen who have been drafted to the cause. They have reached their terminus a tad prematurely thanks to the \"kindness\" of his lovely old aunts.Grants leaping Mortimer, Massey's looming Jonathan and John Alexander bringing his stage role of Teddy to the screen; all under the hand of Frank Capra at the height of his powers, make this a wonderfully fresh and watchable comedy after all these years.Let's see if anyone's writing about a current teen-slacker comedy in such glowing terms 6 decades hence.",

This film is a very different type of animal: Every frame, every line is contrived to an absurd degree. The scriptwriter and the director seem to have insisted that every second of the movie MUST be rip-roaringly, thigh-slappingly funny, or else! Needless to say, it doesn't work. The human brain is not built to absorb this kind of an all-out onslaught. The non-stop, frenetic action and the relentless fishing for laughs kill the story within the first few minutes.

Had I first seen Grant in this movie, I doubt I would have sought out another in which he starred. (On the other hand, Raymond Massey's 'Jonathan Brewster' seems almost a type-casting that is maintained through his other work, and I have, in fact, avoided watching him).Viewers are immediately introduced to the radiant Priscilla Lane, whose fine acting is almost brutally cut by Capra. She so connects with the camera and the audience, that it is a wonder she was cast, as her treatment in this film is so offensive.All other supporting cast elegantly portray their characters, and I wonder how it is that Capra let them. 'Mortimer' - Grant is only somewhat less empathetic than the charging, bugle-blasting.'Teddy Roosevelt Brewster'.I know.

ISN'T THAT FUNNY?\" while he himself is being tied up by the bad guys. A sick, weird sentimentalism occurs around Grant's aunts and their hideous crimes, which are regarded mysteriously as funny. This is supposed to be a comedy, but a nasty and not at all funny cruelty animates many of the supposedly funny moments. Grant's treatment of his fiancee is a study in ugliness. The movie treats his evil aunts as harmless if eccentric ladies; the entire idea of a character who has been surgically altered to resemble Boris Karloff is inherently stupid.

            "content": "Black comedies from the 1940's are always an interesting watch. What makes them more interesting is if they're made by Frank Capra, Mr. Wholesome America himself! I believe this is sort of his \"skeleton in the closet\" picture, an abrupt change from his usual cleancut, all-American picture. This was another one of AFI's Top 100 Funniest Movies of All Time (#30), but I think HAROLD AND MAUDE (#45) is funnier.Based on an original play, Cary Grant is Mortimer Brewster, a drama critic who loves his two old aunts Abby (Josephine Hull) and Martha (Jean Adair) and his brother Teddy, who thinks he's President Teddy Roosevelt! Mortimer discovers that his two sweet old aunts invite elderly courters inside and poison them with wine laced with arsenic, then hide the bodies in the cellar so \"Roosevelt\" can bury them in \"the Panama Canal\". To add to his surprise, his psychotic murderous brother Johnny (Raymond Massey) and his sidekick Dr. Einstein (Peter Lorre) have escaped from jail and have taken up residence in the house. How will he ever explain this to his new wife? And does this mean insanity runs in the family?Cary Grant has impeccable comic timing, proven here by his reactions to the shocking truth about his aunts and his handling of the facts. I've never been much of a fan of Grant's, what with his annoying voice, but here he gives a wonderful comic performance. He was always a better comic actor than a dramatic actor, anyway. You have to love the scene where he catches the sisters trying to poison a prospective boarder in the house. Josephine Hull and Jean Adair are superb as the two little old ladies who look as if they wouldn't hurt a fly. Their best scenes are when they are explaining their crimes to Mortimer, so matter-of-fact, as if they're describing a family recipe for apple pie. Raymond Massey takes over the role of Johnny from stage actor Boris Karloff (Johnny is constantly told, \"You look like Karloff!\") and is very creepy. Peter Lorre, a personal favorite, is great as the heavy drinker Dr. Einstein. Edward Everett Horton is the head of an insane asylum; he is best-known as the narrator of \"Fractured Fairy Tales\" on \"The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show\" and is fantastic in POCKETFUL OF MIRACLES. Frank Capra is a genius and every film of his is an instant classic. This will surprise those who have only seen Capra's IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE, but is a pleasant surprise indeed.",

Even the return of his psychopathic brother did not alter his caring for the old girls.While the delivery is tongue in cheek, the story is quite intense at times, generating some palatable suspense, even while it makes fun of itself. Oddly enough, that fact does not break or lessen the suspenseful feel, where appropriate.The relationship the Aunts enjoy both with one another and with everyone else in their sphere, is quite lovely in a Fiendish sort of way. They reserve the \"special\" wine for \"special\" company, excluding the police officers, neighbors, and mail carriers who stop by to pay their respects. No one knows. No one suspects.I like Cary Grant, and unlike a myriad of other reviewers, I like him well in this. He plays the comedic aspects off with a frantic dignity and grace.

Cary Grant (Mortimer Brewster) plays a well designed role and his acting is quite good, but his counterpart Pricsilla Lane (Elaine Harper) doesen't seem like a good enough fit. The two characters do not compliment each other well and there is no visible comedic conflict between them, a very important part of any comedic film.

Grant's over-reacting reduces his performance to the level one could expect from any ordinary comic actor.It's left to Raymond Massey to add some desperately needed \"quiet\" time in a film that seems to be frantic beyond anything that makes sense.Perhaps the IMDb Trivia section for the movie sums it up: \"Hated his performance in Arsenic and Old Lace (1944), saying it was way too over the top and that it was his least favorite film\"",

He's got the role of a lifetime, even if it qualifies him for the all-time loony bin. Can't help but wonder if he ever looked at a staircase normally again.

I just feel sorry for Priscilla Lane. Here she is the only normal one amid all the certified lunacy.

As if that's not enough, Mortimer's long-lost criminally insane brother Jonathan (Raymond Massey) shows up with his plastic surgeon Dr. Einstein (Peter Lorre).Frank Capra often included bits of comedy in his dramatic films but this is one of the few cases where he tackled the genre head-on. It's a brilliant blend of screwball and black comedy with an exceptional cast that knocks it out of the park. The film maintains an insanely manic pace like no other comedy I can think of. Cary Grant brilliantly holds the whole thing together. Few other actors could match his comedic talent while also being good at dramatic leading man roles. Perhaps Jimmy Stewart but I can't think of another. Raymond Massey, partially hidden behind makeup to give him a Frankenstein's monsterish appearance, is wonderful. Massey was a versatile actor who seldom gets the respect he deserves. The in-joke with his character resembling Boris Karloff (who played the role on stage) is great fun, especially for a huge Karloff fan like myself. Peter Lorre shines in every scene he's in, which should surprise no one familiar with this terrific actor. Hull and Adair were tailor-made for the roles of the aunts. John Alexander as Teddy and Priscilla Lane are also enjoyable. Let's not forget some great character actors in memorable roles: Edward Everett Horton, Jack Carson, James Gleason, Grant Mitchell, and John Ridgely. A truly classic comedy. One of the all-time greats.",

            "content": "I don't know how this was received at the time (1944) but I think it's safe to think in terms of a spectrum spanning nothing lower than fair and nothing higher than sensational. Capra sandwiched this in between Meet John Doe and It's A Wonderful Life and punctuated them by eleven of his acclaimed 'Why We Fight' documentaries, seven between Doe and Lace, four between Lace and Life. With neither Doe nor Life aspiring to a barrel of laffs it's reasonable to assume that Capra satisfied a craving for comedy here. For me, seeing it for the first time in 2010 it was vastly entertaining and I confess to the odd moment of laughing out loud. Okay, Cary Grant, never one to let a chance to mug remain unmolested and a living and breathing definition of OTT indulges himself in both here. In spades. Still, we find ourselves accepting it; like an earlier Capra comedy, You Can't Take It With You, which it resembles inasmuch as both feature eccentric families, it was based on a stage play - in fact Lace was still running on Broadway at the time of shooting - and the movie retained three principals, Josephine Hull, Jean Adair and John Alexander, all outstanding. There's a nice touch when the script tries to wrong-foot us in the first reel, when, having established Mortimer Brewster (Grant) as not merely a misogynist, but one who has gone so far as to write at least one book denouncing marriage, we see him tie the knot with Priscilla Lane, not exactly a chore, and we settle down for a battle of the sexes only to discover that the real story is about his two maiden aunts - again presented as pussycats - who have, albeit in the best possible taste, seen off between twelve and thirteen elderly and lonely gentlemen via their lethal elderberry wine, only one to a customer. These are disposed of in the cellar by a brother who thinks he is 1) Teddy Roosevelt and 2) digging the Panama Canal. Throw in a second brother, mass murderer Raymond Massy, who turns up out of the blue bearing more than a passing resemblance to Boris Karloff in Frankenstein monster mode, accompanied by 'Doctor' Einstein, Peter Lorre, ready and willing to perform more plastic surgery, together with a stiff of their own and the words cup runneth over spring to mind.

            "content": "Frank Capra directed this screen adaptation of the hit Broadway farce Arsenic Old Lace just a few months after it premiered, however Warners was contractually committed to not releasing the film till it ended its New York run. As the play was one of the longest running ever in the history of Broadway, it wasn't released for three more years! This goes to show what a big hit this black comedy was. Even today, when watching the screen version it's easy to see why. The story is fast-faced, the characters nearly all either mad or eccentric, and the central idea is highly original: a pair of kindly old spinsters are discovered, by their newly married theater critic nephew, to be poisoning male guests in their Brooklyn home, not out of malice but due to their kindness. They want to put the old gentlemen out of their misery, so they offer them elderberry wine laced with arsenic. The events unfold on Halloween eve is an added bonus, as it adds a nice touch of holiday cheer and fear.I've seen this movie on television, alone and with others, and in a crowded theater, and it never fails to please. There's something so wacky and good natured about it that it draws me in, as much for its charm as its wit: the movie enchants, puts one at ease and never, despite its theme of serial killing, offends. It's rather like the old ladies at the center of the story, quaint and disarming. Even with the body in the window seat,--and eleven more in the basement!--and criminal nephew Jonathan lurking about, it feels upbeat, almost reassuring in its mood, like a slice of Americana. That so much of the dialog echoes the America of seventy years ago,--references to the Roosevelts, the long gone from Brooklyn Dodgers, rumble seats, the fact that Jonathan's botched plastic surgery makes him look like horror star Boris Karloff (who played the part in the Broadway production but not in the movie)--make it feel like a product of its time in the best sense of the term: it's from a bygone era, when cops walked the beat, people put room to rent signs in their front windows, sang hymns in the parlor, that's long vanished. Arsenic and Old Lace may be about murders and dead bodies lying around the house, yet it feels warm and cozy.The production is modest in scale, as befits a film adaptation of a play, and Capra wisely chose to not \"open it up\" too much. Most of the action takes place in the family's home, and the central set is beautifully designed, worthy of an Academy Award. It's a handsome movie, and it's a credit to its director and cast that despited its limited setting it feels larger than life. As the sane brother, Mortimer, Cary Grant hams up a storm. I like his manic playing, many don't. I think that the decision to present Mortimer as crazier seeming than his batty family was the correct decision. Josephine Hull and Jean Adair recreate their Broadway roles as aunts Abby and Martha, and don't miss a beat. Nor does Raymond Massey as Jonathan. I think that Massey works perfectly in the film. Many wish that Karloff could have played the part. Massey strikes me as a better fit, as while he's made up to look monstrous, his voice and manner are American, thus he only looks like Boris Karloff. He doesn't sound like him. Also, he practically whispers all his lines, which makes his character come off as genuinely menacing. Peter Lorre shines as his assistant, Dr. Einstein (Heidelberg, 1919). The writing (much of the play was rumored to have been rewritten by its producers, Howard Lindsay and Russell Crouse) more than gets the job done without drawing attention to itself; and some of the best lines,--\"murder doesn't run in my family, it practically gallops\", \"not the Melbourne method!\"--are fondly remembered even today and are still quoted by fans of the play.",

If this weren't stressful enough, Grant's sociopathic brother (played humorously by Raymond Massey) shows up with a body of his own to get rid of. What's a man to do?

It starts by establishing the relationship Grant has with Lane and then quickly sets up the family as having a severe history of mental illness (not real mental illness of course, comedic mental illness).once these things are set up, we quickly go onto the silly journey of the film and watch Grant react to numerous fantastical situations. Grant's double takes are a joy to watch and everyone does there bit to keep the momentum going until we get to the resolution.The film is a stage play farce of the best kind and the light hearted nature of the film is something all players are aware of, leading to the moment when Grant actually looks into the camera. pure entertainment of the best sort.

            "content": "\"Arsenic and Old Lace\" has entertained people for decades. The original Broadway production ran more than 1,400 performances from January, 1941, to June, 1944. It since has been among the favorite of stage plays for neighborhood theaters, high schools and colleges. But its widest appeal comes from this 1944 Warner Brothers film, starring Cary Grant.Considering Hollywood's penchant for remakes of older successful films, it's worth noting that this comedy classic has not been tried again for the silver screen. I suspect that the movie makers who watch this great classic realize that they probably couldn't find a cast today that would pull it off as well, let alone any better. Three TV productions were made \u2013 in 1962, 1969 and 1971. The 1962 film with Tony Randall in the lead role, was quite good, but still well behind this original. Even with some better known female leads for the two Brewster sisters, none of those TV films could equal or better this original classic. All of the cast excel in this film. But Cary Grant's Mortimer Brewster is over the top funny. His may be the best one-man screwball comedy role of all time. Grant shows his very capable acting ability in this frantic, forgetful, fast-paced, ranting, and rushing role. His double-takes, facial expressions, and almost constant state of anxiety drive the plot after a short time into the film. But for a couple of scenes outside and at the marriage bureau, all the action takes place in one large set. The living room of the Brewster home is one mad-cap funny scene after another. This is a film the whole family should enjoy. It is a must for any film library.",

Hearing and reading about such a high volume of negativity day in and day out reaches a point of being tiresome. I think that's why I love classic movies so much. They're like my personal escapism. I had watched Arsenic and Old Lace as a kid. In terms of the scenes and dialogue, I hardly remembered anything. After discovering more of Cary Grant's movies as an adult, and subsequently becoming a fan, I was excited to watch it again. Based on a play by Joseph Kesselring, it's a story about Mortimer Brewster (Cary Grant) a writer and theater critic who's vehemently anti-marriage, but goes along with marrying a woman named Elaine Harper (Priscilla Lane), a minister's daughter. She lives next door to his aunts, played by Jean Adair and Josephine Hull. They're sweet and harmless, or so it appears. Mortimer is headed to Niagara Falls for his honeymoon, but gets sidetracked when he finds out his aunts have been killing people. His brother (John Alexander) - who identifies as Teddy Roosevelt - buries them in the basement, thinking they're yellow fever victims. Mortimer's other brother, Jonathan (Raymond Massey) - he looks like Frankenstein - is a murderer on the run from the police. He hides out in the aunts' house with his alcoholic plastic surgeon, Dr. Herman Einstein (Peter Lorre). Mortimer predominantly spends his time trying to get his brother who thinks he's Teddy Roosevelt committed to a mental hospital called Happydale, while Jonathan and Dr. Einstein are attempting to conceal their victim's body in the aunts' house. People who don't like this movie are taking it too seriously. It's quite impossible not to laugh. Cary Grant's facial expressions were hilarious. I think it's interesting how a reviewer mentioned that this film is probably the least suave he had ever been, which more closely resembled how he behaved when he was just existing as a human and not acting. So I'm guessing he was dorky off screen. I feel like that made his performance all the more enjoyable, because he was pretty much being himself. Comedic actors are so irritating to watch nowadays. Modern Hollywood is just overrated celebrities who aren't funny, talented, or attractive. I see nothing wrong with Arsenic and Old Lace. It does make humor out of psychosis, which some people may find offensive, but you can't watch this through a 21st century lens. I don't normally like dark comedies, but I can watch this over and over again. It's an excellent film if you've had a long day or week.",

It's a great time, enjoyable pretty much from the first frame to the last. The performances are all on-point, especially that of leading man Grant who runs around in flustered frustration and does more double takes than you can shake a stick at. It's his near cartoony performance (at times, it's like watching a live-action 'Looney Tune') that gives most of the piece its life, effortlessly energising any scene and provoking genuine laughs at a simple facial expression. Of course, it's not realistic (Grant considered this to be a low-point in his acting career precisely because it's so over-the-top) but it isn't supposed to be. For what it is, it's phenomenal. The witty script keeps the pace up and the laughs coming. It's obviously adapted from a stage play, with almost only one location and a lot of long-winded dialogue. This isn't an issue, though, as Capra keeps things feeling cinematic enough to warrant the transition. It's the kind of film that sets all its dominoes up and then delights in teasing their toppling. It's also a surprisingly tense experience, with moments of genuine danger balancing out its otherwise silly antics. Its ending perhaps doesn't explode as much as you'd expect. Still, it does a good job of maintaining suspense and, eventually, finishes things off on a high. Plus, despite some areas that are a bit iffy (such as the depiction of one character's mental illness), it mostly withstands the test of time. It's a fun, fast-paced farce with plenty of laughs and even more smiles. 8/10",

Arsenic And Old Lace is among his finest works without doubt, nevertheless the theatrical attribute on the contrary hampers the film from fetching its altitude which it should had reached. To to specific, what I mean is the tempo for the audience to assimilate the entire plot is in haste despite of its 118- minutes running time, all the characters seem to convey their performances in a rapid speed without rendering much time for us to ruminate, lest we would sense its logically inconsequent absurdities. I was enlightened to watch the first half of the film, the two innocently murderous Brewster aunties are truly one of a kind (thanks to Josephine Hull and Jean Adair's sincerely over-the- top performances), on the other hand, the main protagonist Cary Grant is physically engaged himself into the play while the awkwardness residually shows off as if himself is aware of the unedifying plot and wish it would finish asap. Raymond Massey, who replaced Boris Karloff in the film version, put on a new look as a mimicry of Boris and being the sole villain in the film, his presence and the conversations between him and Peter Lorre (the short and coward doctor from Germany) establish a fresh yet scaring B-film flavor, which pitifully diminishes under the pressure of the pervasively farcical aura.

            "content": "***SPOILERS*** One of the screwiest screwball comedies ever made \"Arsenic & Old Lace\" has the usual cool and handsome as well as suave & sophisticated Cary Grant as well known theater critic and life long bachelor Mortimer Brewster lose it to the point when by the time the film is over he's about to be committed to the Happy Dale Sanitarium together with his crazy brother Teddy,John Alexander, and two sweet nutty as well as homicidal aunts Abby & Martha, Josephine Hull & Joan Adair.Mortimer who finally decided to tie the knot with pretty Brooklyn girl Elaine Harper, Priscilla Lane, at City Hall went across the East River to Brooklyn Heights to spent the evening with his two spinster aunts Abby & Martha whom he hasn't seen in almost 20 years. It doesn't take long for Mortimer to realize that both Aunt Abby & Martha have been helping out the homeless and down in the dumps old men in the neighborhood by treating them to a last meal that consisted of small doses of cyanide and arsenic in order to give them, in that they were on the way out anyway, their final send-off! To give the old geezers a final Christan burial Aunt Abby & Martha had their nephew Teddy, who thinks he's the late President Teddy Roosevelt, bury them in the basement under the assumption that they, twelve as of last count, died from yellow fever in digging the Panama Canal! Digging it right there in the Brewster House in the heart of Brooklyn!If things weren't screwy enough already it's when Mortimer long lost brother an escapee from an Ohio mental institution for the criminally insane Jonathan, Raynond Massey, and his assistant Dr.Herman Einstein, Peter Loore, shows up that things really starts to get out of whack in the movie. Jonathan who, after a number of failed facial operations, looks like Boris Karloff's twin brother is on the lamb, after his escape from the mental institution, from the police after wracking up a total of twelve murders. What shocks Jonathan more then anything else, even his brother Mortiner, is that his two aunts Abby & Martha had killed as many people as he did! An even worse they did in all in one place, the Brewster house, where he committed his murders on four different continents!Mortimer who's trying to keep buried the fact that his two sweet and kindly aunts are in fact serial murderers slowly goes out of his mind with all the attempts he tries to keep the local police from finding that out. Jonathan who's got ideas of his own, in killing his hated brother Moritmer once and for all, also got a stiff Mr. Spanazio, a former associate of his who tried to double-cross him, to dispatch and there's only room for one left in the Brewster basement with it filled to capacity, twelve, and the latest victim being the one that his two aunts treated his last and final meal to!It's when Mortimer ends up getting tied up by Jonathan who plans to slowly dissect him, like a frog in a laboratory, that the calvary or police arrive to save his neck and all his other organs but the fact that he's related to such a bunch of nut cases like his two crazy aunts and delusional and murderous brothers Teddy and Jonathan has his own mental faculties become suspect! As well as Mortimer being slated to be committed to the Happy Dale Saniterium together with his crazy relieves!***SPOILERS*** That very pressing problem is settled in the final few minutes in the movie with Mortimer not only learning that he's not only sane, he's not a Brewster but the son of a ship' cook, which will not only keep him from being committed but won't keep him from marrying Ealine!",

I also liked this movie because of the direction which made by Frank Capra and for one more time he did great job on it. About the cast I have to mention the great interpretation of Cary Grant who played as Mortimer Brewster and of course the equally good interpretation of Priscilla Lane who played as Elaine Harper. This movie reminded me at some points the movie \"Bringing Up Baby\" in which also played Cary Grant and his interpretation had many commons with his interpretation in this movie.Finally I have to say that \"Arsenic and Old Lace\" is a nice movie to watch and it combines very well comedy with crime and the result is very good.

            "review_title": "A Hilariously Sinister Comedy",
            "content": "\"Arsenic\" is the filmed adaptation of the hugely successful Broadway play that starred Boris Karloff. Only John Alexander, in the epic role of Theodore \"Teddy Roosevelt\" Brewster, and Jean Adair and Josephine Hull as the maiden Aunts who preside over the Brewster home, reprise their roles from the play. But the remainder of the cast is perfect, even Raymond Massey replacing Karloff as the evil Jonathan Brewster.Cary Grant plays Mortimer Brewster, a drama critic who just got married on this Halloween day to the girl next door (across the cemetery, that is), Elaine Harper (Priscilla Lane). Stopping at home to collect their things for their honeymoon in Niagra Falls, Mortimer discovers that all sorts of unexpected things are going on that seriously interrupt his plans.This is one of the most frantic comedies ever filmed. One can only imagine how wonderful the stage version with the original cast must have been. Once Massey shows up with Dr. Einstein (Peter Lorre) in tow, things take off and never set down. Jack Carson is around for comic relief as a new beat police officer who is an aspiring writer, and Edward Everett Horton acts like a man who has gotten a little too close to his patients as the head of Happy Dale, the local sanitarium.Everybody in the cast has their moments. Teddy's charges up the stairway are legendary, as are his bugle blowing \"to summon the cabinet.\" Priscilla Lane is charming as the spunky new bride who never does quite figure out the craziness going on next door. And Massey, with his comically dark portrayal, steals the show with his constant affront at people who keep saying that he \"looks like Karloff.\" James Gleason brings a momentary element of sanity to the proceedings as the police Lieutenant who shows up towards the end, but the insanity of everyone else is positively infectious and he joins in the fun.While clearly a comedy, there are more serious elements thrown in for, well, relief. A brief conversation on the basement staircase between Jonathan and Dr. Einstein, in which Massey's looming shadow on the wall forms a brilliant counterpoint to the cringing Einstein, is a personal favorite. Artsy types might say that this is a \"film noir comedy.\" Lorre gets off the immortal line there, \"Oh no, not the Melvin method!\" And every appearance by Miss Lane, who plays it straight throughout, is a treat. Such a shame that she retired so young.Highly recommended, one of the few must-sees in cinema. Best seen around Halloween. You can always find someone at work or play who has seen this and has a delighted reaction to share about it. At least, that's what I have found.",

Seems like Frank Capra wanted to have some so he made us laugh like mad guys by presenting this crazy comedy film. Every character in this film is purely mad whether it is Mortimer or his wife or those aunties or the doctor or horrible looking Jonathan but still film doesn't go downwards on the basis of quality. The major credit goes to the writer, dialogue writer and Screenwriter because the film is full of crazy conflicts, struggle and at last that much needed happy ending. And even that comes with a shocking yet funny suspense from past. The original Drama was adapted so quickly on screen therefore freshness did not fade away at the time of release and me watching this film after 76 years found it certainly funny. There isn't much to call for an acting, it's all about Screenplay and Direction. Frank Capra did a fantastic job and it was quite shocking to see such a hilarious ride coming in 1944 when Hollywood was doing not so great with comedies. Overall, Arsenic and Old Lace provides Fun in mad way like never before but you must enjoy the intellegence hidden in it's screenwriting.\nRating- 8/10*",

He gets hitched to the lovely Elaine Harper (Priscilla Lane) then they rush to share the good news with Mortimer's spinster aunts, and Elaine's father - a widowed preacher who lives across from Mortimer's family.Perhaps I should elaborate a bit ... Reverend Harper lives in a house across from the graveyard next to Brewster sisters dilapidated old house ... and it's Halloween!While sharing the news with his aunts Mortimer discovers a dead body in the house. He also discovers that his dear sweet elderly aunts are murderers ... and it all goes hysterically downhill from there.I don't want to give too much away because this is one of those films where it's better if you go into it knowing just the basics.I will say that some of the funniest gags take place off screen where you can hear what is happening and the rest is left to your imagination.

This movie actually proved to be one of the best comedies of its time. As with other great Cary Grant movies of this time, such as \"Bringing Up Baby,\" this film was very fast-paced and got funnier as it went along. Despite the dark themes of old ladies poisoning people and a deformed man coming to their home, I found every minute of this film to be enjoyable and lighthearted. There are so many wisecracks and ironic moments, such as Cary Grant talking about the bad guys tying him up just as they are about to do so. The pace never slows down for a minute and keeps us engaged throughout. Don't hesitate to see this movie because of the black comedy nature of the film.

            "content": "This movie was based of a play of the same name, though the play must have been written after 1932 as there is a comment on a second Roosevelt becoming president, but more on that later. This movie is described as a classic, I just think it is absolutely hilarious. There is so much in this movie that makes it great though to really appreciate the comedy you need to watch the movie. After seeing this I have decided that Frank Capra is one of the greatest directors: both this and Mr Smith Goes to Washington are brilliant movies, and his comedy is in such away that it is hilarious without being rude, crude, or simply stupid. One thing about the comedy in this movie is the way that Carey Grant is so animated. His facial expressions are something that must be seen rather than talked about, and the comedy in this movie is very visual. Some of the scenes in this movie that I like are the poor cab driver left waiting outside for the entire night and at one stage he is asked to hail a cab, which he does, before he realises that he is a cab driver. (Hey, I reckon I ought to play the cab driver! I wonder if it is in the original play). Another are the subtle political jokes about Teddy Roosevelt. The Brewster household are basically nuts and one of them thinks he is Teddy Roosevelt, which leads to a lot of interesting comments, especially if you know about American History. Capra has constructed this movie as if it were the stage play. While watching it, you feel as if you are watching the play. Only the first two minutes are removed from the play, so I believe. Capra has done a very good job at it though. The BBC versions of the Shakespeare plays are similarly done but turn out really poorly. Arsenic and Old Lace could be viewed by a live studio audience. One thing that the movie raises is the question of euthanasia. It wasn't really a question back then, and is joked about as in this movie, but now it is very topical. The old ladies think that it is okay, but their son, Mortimer, is horrified, while John is shocked that they have killed as many people as he has. The movie is does not have the ladies prosecuted for this act, but it emphasizes that it is murder. Mortimer ends up committing the ladies to the mental institute. They do not get away free. Another interesting thing about the movie is the name of the sons. The evil son has a normal name, John, while the good son has a rather sinister name, Mortimer. Arsenic and Old Lace is a classic movie and deserves all the rave that it receives. I loved the movie and others that I have spoken to are just as thrilled about it. I have been approached about doing it as a play, and now that I think of it, I would love to do it.",

I think that his ultimate goal was to create a hilarious party that no one will take seriously.Cary Grant as Mortimer Brewster is again up to the task. Frankly, his nearly two-hour murmur and hysteria accompanied by funny grimace I'm not thrilled. Mortimer is so confusing and clumsy that I at times felt sincere remorse. The effect is not so bad. Aunt Abby and Aunt Martha (Josephine Hull and Jean Adair) are so positively silly (innocently gentle artist murder) that is a real pleasure to watch them. Raymond Massey as Jonathan Brewster was not so successful parody of Boris Karloff, but his assistant Dr. Herman Einstein (Peter Lorre) saves sequences.

            "content": "Few classic era film directors did comedy better than Frank Capra, if any. The over-the-top ridiculous dark comedy farce \"Arsenic and Old Lace\" is not the three-time Oscar winner's usual cup of tea (there's an inherent lack of romance), but he captures the adaptation of the play with a sense of humor that's critical for a story so ridiculous.Having seen the play myself, admittedly the comic twists and sheer outrageousness of some of the characters was less effective upon a second viewing, but it doesn't detract from comprehending the comic genius of Joseph Kesselring's original script. The moral of the story is that everyone's crazy. Period.\"Arsenic\" takes place in one afternoon and night in Brooklyn, where esteemed theatre critic and self-proclaimed marriage-hater Mortimer Brewster (Cary Grant) has taken refuge with his dear old aunts before taking off on his honeymoon with Elaine Harper (Priscilla Lane), a fact he's publicly ashamed of. Not long into his stay, however, he discovers both sweet Aunt Abby (Josephine Hull) and Aunt Martha (Jean Adair) are in fact mercy killers who poison lonely old men without families and homes and bury them in the basement with the aid of Mortimer's delusional brother, Teddy, who believes he's Teddy Roosevelt. In an effort to sort it all out, Mortimer drives himself practically insane.I've never had a bad thing to say about him, but this is a fine piece of total overacting by Grant. Part of it is the charm story and Capra's vision to acknowledge its absurdity, but from his first discovery of the body in the window seat, Grant is up and over-the-top. It takes a bit away from the momentum, neglecting a steady accumulation of craziness, even if that's not the film's intention. Grant is much better in charming romantic roles and not as an all- out comedian, but he has some quality moments.Capra's creativity was no doubt limited by the confines of the story. It almost entirely takes place inside the Brewster home (convenient for the play, just not the movie). The Epsteins' adaptation takes some liberties where possible, but it's merely wiggle-room. The director leaves his mark in moments when the story hits a peak in terms of the physical humor. He also films some comically dark scenes when Mortimer's loony brother Jonathan (Raymond Massey) returns with his accomplice Dr. Einstein (wonderful character actor Peter Lorre). Those two actors add more dimension to their performances which helps the film be taken a tad more seriously.Amidst the chaos, however, \"Arsenic and Old Lace\" has a truthful ring to it. Sanity is a relative attribute and we should be so lucky as to possess it in the slightest bit. \"Arsenic\" doesn't feel like some of the '30s and '40s classics before it, but it's great fun and a real laugh.

Well after watching the film I can definitely say its an amusing film with some hilarious scenes but I just wished it had been a bit shorter.\nWhile watching the film I was reminded of Bringing Up Baby. This is probably understandable since both films have Cary Grant in them. However, Arsenic and Old Lace is a slightly darker comedy(it does deal with 13 dead bodies). There is another key difference between the two films. Bringing Up Baby ran 103 minutes and the pacing was mostly consistent. Arsenic and Old Lace is 15 minutes longer and the slow spots are much more noticable. The running time feels bloated where in Bringing Up Baby it was anything but that.\nI will get to the good points. Cary Grant is as always a joy to watch. Josephine Hull and Jean Adair were fine in their roles. Raymond Massey and Peter Lorre were both chilling in their roles. The rest of the cast was also solid. Theres no doubt there are some funny parts. A lot of this is because of Cary Grant. The fight between the cops and Massey's character was hilarious. There were other good parts too. However, I occasionally felt nauseated by some of the movie. I knew it would be too long when I saw it was almost two hours. This kind of movie cannot have a two hour running time, even when it is hilarious in certain spots. I will recommend the film because for the most part, it was entertaining.

That he adds a handful of filmic jaunts, however, doesn't do much good or add any punch. The movie opens on a montage about peculiar and random Brooklyn, and fosters the chuckle along with a riot scene at Ebbets Field, a scene which has no perceptible basis for being in the movie at all. From there it switches to a high-octane schmaltz sequence in the marriage license bureau, where above all things, people are getting marriage licenses, Cary Grant and Priscilla Lane among them. Then there's another sequence of elaborate chasing and necking in a Brooklyn cemetery, and, at last, guess what, the story of Arsenic and Old Lace. All the same, in the long run, these filmic additions give impact to the farce with Aunts Abby and Martha in the house, because beginning so schmaltzy and mawkish makes such ink-black humor so much more unexpected.This unconventional patchwork is distinct from most of the other \"reform-minded Capra-corn\" films with social principles that became his brand, like It's a Wonderful Life, Meet John Doe, or Mr. Smith Goes to Washington. It's more similar in tone to his screwball romantic comedy It Happened One Night and to Capra's other adaptation from a Broadway play You Can't Take It With You. Playing theatre critic Mortimer Brewster---frankly it doesn't matter, it's fine just viewing him for his star power the whole time---Cary Grant accomplishes a stunning mission of overstated acting with remarkable double-takes, slapstick and overall bewilderment. What makes his performance so effective is that in essence he plays the straight man in a house crammed with eccentrics, yet it is his relentless mugging and other facial agility that make you laugh. Naturally it's all exaggerated from top to bottom, but that's what the role demands and he succeeds in peddling the motor for all the farce happening around him.Not that Grant is the lone one to get laughs in this combination of slapstick and fast-paced jousting. Played impeccably by veteran stage actress Josephine Hull and Canadian vaudevillian Jean Adair, the doting aunts' account of how they routinely murder gentleman visitors is really my favorite part, by far. After telling Grant how they add Arsenic, Strychnine, and \"just a pinch of\" Cyanide to Elderberry wine because it makes tea taste bitter, they smugly add that one of the gentlemen even found time to say how nice it tasted before he died. John Alexander is hilarious in his unquestionably most memorable performance as Grant's brother Teddy, who believes he's Teddy Roosevelt to the extent that his behavior, dress and perception of his surroundings all correspond with defining aspects of the vividly inimitable American president. Another of my favorite elements is how old Abby and Martha delight in using Teddy's belief that he's digging the Panama Canal to bury their shocking amount of dead bodies in the basement.Ahead of its time? OK, but it is also markedly of its time, and has stood the test of time to stay as witty today as anything Hollywood is producing now. Our reactions to inconsistencies, oddities, unanticipated discrepancies with normalcy and established ranks will differ in terms of particular circumstances. The established rule we hear vintage comedians talk about is that if the incongruity works in a context where it's foreboding, it'll dispose us toward a fearful response, but if the framework is one that's marked as non-threatening, where the prospect of harm and dread has been denied, the circumstances are apt for humor. I've rarely found this notion better substantiated than in the characters of Aunt Martha and Aunt Abby, whose descriptions of their serial murders are so sweet and innocent that they couldn't be less congruous.",

            "content": "'Arsenic and Old Lace' is a very entertaining movie.  It goes by very quickly and is generally always interesting.  However, there is some over acting in the film, specifically from Cary Grant, whose gestures are a little over the top at some points.  Even then, he is still quite funny at many points.  I was surprised by some of the darker elements of this movie, most notably Mortimer Brewster's(Grant) brother Jonathan.  The movie(or play for that matter)takes a rather dark twist upon the arrival of his character.  I was not expecting it to be dark at all.  The running Boris Karloff joke was quite amusing though.The best thing of all though are Moritimer's aunts.  They are easily to most memorable and enjoyable characters in the movie.  Seemingly so innocent, and really they have no bad intentions at all.  They are happy Mortimer fell in love, scared of Jonathan and so forth.  They are the best thing in the movie, and unfortunately aren't in it quite enough.  The other characters really aren't anything special.  The bumbling police force, Mortimer's crazy brother that thinks he is Teddy Roosevelt and Jonathans friend, Dr.Einstein, are all underused a bit and at times irritating.  Most underused however is Priscilla Lane, who plays Mortimer's new wife.  She is hardly anywhere to be found, and its a shame because I would have liked to have seen more of her as well.Even with all the extra stock characters, and a mad cap ending that seems to last a bit to long, this movie is still worth watching.  At least you should watch it to see the two innocent old women.  They are great characters.  I know I'll never look at little old women the same way again.  7 out of 10.",

            "content": "I am baffled, BAFFLED, by the high rating of this film.  I thought it was awful.  I know Cary Grant can do screwball comedy--see Bringing up Baby and the Philadelphia Story--but his performance here was laughable, and unfortunately not in the way intended.  He was bad.  He was stiff.  His timing was five hundred miles off.  I blame Frank Capra, who didn't seem to be able to pull this story together.  All his characters seemed to be acting in their own separate films, most of them badly.  And it was all so forced and so stagy.  I felt like I was stuck in that room with a bunch of loud hammy actors running around.Peter Lorre was good, though, and the two aunts, and I did enjoy the surrealist strangeness of it all.  I love laughing at murder, for some reason.  I think this film could have worked well with a different director and different lead, and maybe a few re-writes to some of the more ludicrous plot points.  Bob Hope was originally supposed to play Cary Grant's part, and I think he would have been way better in the role.  Some of the dialogue felt like it was written for him, and I could well picture him delivering it.  I could also see this film working really well as an Ealing Studios production, the obnoxiousness turned down a notch, and the strangeness cranked up, and maybe with Alec Guinness playing the villainous brother.Priscilla Lane had one of the sexiest mouths in cinema history.  Saucy lips and a sly tongue.  Just a really good, kissable mouth.  Always an enjoyable addition to a film.Overall, probably the worst Capra film I have seen, and a lesser screwball comedy.  5/10.",

            "content": "When this production was first considered for filming, the play was still having a successful run on Broadway.   Boris Karloff took the role of Jonathan Brewster based on one line of dialogue. this When Dr. Einstein asked, \"Johnny.  Why did you kill that man?  He was being nice and he gave us a ride,\" to which the Jonathan Brewster character answered, \"Because he said I looked like Boris Karloff.     Herein lies my problem with this motion picture. Mr. Karloff was asked to stay with the play, and not the role went to Raymond Massey, who looks very little like Boris Karloff, and was a poor substitute for the horror legend. Besides, Karloff delivering the line is far funnier than any other actor delivering the same line. This is not to say that I don't like the movie, but whenever Massey comes on screen I have to imagine dear Boris doing the scenes with the wonderful Mr. Peter Lorre, so this does hurt the film for me at those moments.     Strangely enough, Cary Grant thought this was his worst film performance, and I really don't get that.     I remember being blown away by his impeccable timing and over-the-top, yet fitting performance as the beleaguered theater critic Mortimer Brewster. What's funny is that he seems to be the least same member of this family.\n    Another footnote: Warner Bros. made agreement with the the theater productions' producers that they would not released the film until after the Broadway show had completed its run, even though the film was made while the show was still onstage.     As a sort of consolation prize, Karloff and Lorre played similar roles in a forgettable Kay Keyser B movie, \"The Boogie Man Will Get You.\" Capra convinced Warners that the film was do-able because of the low cost using some standing sets and that much of the Broadway actors could be bought for a song. The only real cost was the price tag for Cary Grant's acting services, and that was a guaranteed box-office draw anyway, so the production was a done deal.    The key members of the cast were the very same actors that appeared in the original play, with the exception of Edgar Stehli as Dr. Harry Einstein and Alyn Joslyn as Mortimer. (I believe Jack Carson was a contract player at Warners anwyay, and most likely was NOT in the play either.) I don't see Stehli being anywhere near as perfectly cast as was Lorre, and I know that Cary Grant beats Joslyn in a walk as a comedic actor, not to mention that Joslyn was never leading-man material anyway. But these changes make sense.    Anyway, the casting of Raymond Massey is the only flaw I can see in this otherwise fabulously funny motion picture.",

            "content": "During his lifetime, if anyone had asked Cary Grant about his performance in Arsenic & Old Lace, he would have declared it one of his least favourite film roles AND also his least favourite on screen performance. However, if you ask any Cary Grant fan their views on the movie and the vote will be unanimously contradictory to Mr Grant's own sentiments.Frank Capra had seen Joseph Kesselring's black screwball comedy farce on the Broadway stage in 1941 and immediately set about procuring the movie rights. The movie was actually filmed in late 1941 but not released until 1944 to allow the play to finish it's Broadway run, so audiences couldn't compare the play to it's screen counterpart. (And potentially diminish Box Office returns).Grant plays Mortimer Brewster a newlywed drama critic who before embarking on his honeymoon with his bride Elaine, (played by the delectable Pricilla Lane), visits his two maiden aunts in Brooklyn to give them the good news.Aunt Abby, (Josephine Hull), and Aunt Martha, (Jean Adair), are two kind hearted pillars of the Society, who regularly invite the local Reverend to tea, they give old toys to the local children's home and help the police benevolent fund whenever possible. Sounds perfect doesn't it? However their demeanour hides a darker secret. They're murderers whose body count is already into double figures. However, they are not hardened mob assassins and neither are they psychopaths. They innocently poison lonely, sad passers-by with their home made elderberry wine. These are not random killings either, their victims have to meet a certain criteria. They only kill gentlemen that have no family, home, money or prospects. They see their killings as an act of mercy by helping these poor people find the peace in death that has been so cruelly denied them in life. How sweet.Mortimer has a brother Teddy, another harmless nutter who believes himself to be President Theodore Roosevelt who's digging the Panama Canal in their cellar and whenever his Aunt's present him with another body to bury in the cellar, simply assumes that Yellow Fever has claimed them. Quite a normal assumption I suppose...if you think you're in Panama.As luck would have it, Mortimers other and dangerously psychotic brother Jonathan, (Raymond Massey), also returns home to Brooklyn that night on the run from the law and he's not alone. His German plastic surgeon Dr Einstein, (Peter Lorre), is with him, and just to blend in, they've brought a corpse of their own to the party.Mortimer now believes that insanity is hereditary in his family and that he too will one day becomes as mad as a box of frogs. However his immediate concern is to figure out how to save his aunt's and his brother Teddy from either life imprisonment or the chair, a situation not made easier, as Jonathan already has plans to make him the next body that Teddy buries in the cellar.The script is fast and furious and the acting from ALL is superb, and Grants facial expressions are legendary.Black Comedy was never better than this.Enjoy!!!",

            "content": "I must first say that, although I have read that Cary Grant was unhappy with his role in this film, he should be well proud of himself.  Yes, he overplays it a little, but when you consider the material and the fact that the movie is a comedy, it is just such a perfect performance.  The fact that Mortimer is afraid that he will also end up as nutty as all of these relatives of his only adds to the poor man's neurosis, and makes him paranoid on top of being afraid and bewildered by the day's events, and Grant is magnificent in portraying all of these emotions and conflicts at once.  I can't see anyone else in the role - it belongs to Grant completely.THE BEST RUNNING GAG IN MOVIE HISTORY:  What can I say about the `he looks like Boris Karloff' gag except that it's so damn funny that I laughed every single time, or when Jack Carson says, `hey look at that puss,' or when Grant calls him `handsome.'  And Jonathan's baby photo and talk of it scaring children at Halloween .!!! All of this was just hilarious.  Hats off to Massey, and as much as I like Boris Karloff, and I'm sure he'd have been great in the role, it's simply funnier that the guy LOOKS LIKE KARLOFF!Another fun and oh-so-true-to-life running joke: People in all sorts of situations barraging Mortimer with their play/novel ideas because he is a writer -- even, a couple of times, when their lives clearly were in danger.I love the many, MANY throw-away lines that were tossed off so matter-of-factly by the stellar cast (especially Grant), but my favorite must be when the cat comes out of the body-strewn basement and Grant remarks, `even the cat's in on it.'  Oh, man, I'm laughing just typing this.John Alexander was delightful as President Roosevelt, and it was funny to picture that `he wouldn't be anybody' when the aunts persuaded him to be George Washington, and simply hid under the bed.Priscilla Lane was great as always, even though her role was pretty thankless for the most part. James Gleason was terrific as the cop, Jack Carson was funny beyond compare, Everett Horton was his usually silly self, and the aunts wonderfully underplayed their roles.Peter Lorre, one of my favorite actors, was such a trip as the `short, balding bug-eyed' Dr. Einstein, and Raymond Massey was an absolute hoot as Jonathan.Hands down, my favorite comedy ever.

            "content": "Directed by Frank Capra, with a well-written screenplay by the Epstein brothers and a fantastically haunting music score by Max Steiner, \"Arsenic and Old Lace\" is an outrageous Hallowe'en comedy. The star of this picture is none other than the slick, fast-talking Cary Grant, who is full of wild & unpredictable humor as drama critic Mortimer Brewster, literally bending over backwards in order to cover up the lethal peculiarities of his two otherwise dear & sweet aunts (Josephine Hull and Jean Adair). Costarring is Raymond Massey as Mortimer's long-lost brother Jonathan, whose grim demeanor might be a little too dark for such a lighthearted comedy. Jonathan's hideously scarred face can be blamed on the bumbling, intoxicated plastic surgeon Dr. Einstein (Peter Lorre). Not to mention John Alexander as another one of Mortimer's demented brothers who believes himself to be Teddy Roosevelt, repeatedly charging up the staircase as if it were San Juan Hill; and Jack Carson as police officer O'Hara, who delightfully tells Mortimer about a play he has written while Mortimer is literally tied up and gagged! Certainly, this movie bears the resemblance of a stage play, from which, in fact, it is based.Aside from what I have already mentioned, here are some of my other favorite highlights from \"Arsenic and Old Lace.\" Mortimer has an unforgettable look on his face when he discovers the body in the window seat. He is also hilarious as he tries unsuccessfully to get the telephone operator to contact the Happy Dale Sanitaruim and as he stops an elderly gentleman from being poisoned by a drink. The opening chaotic baseball sequence (the Brooklyn Dodgers vs. the New York Yankees) is memorable, even though it has nothing to do with the rest of the film. In order to divert the policemen's attention from the thirteen bodies in the cellar, Mortimer pretends to act crazy, such as by running around while gagged & tied to a chair and by charging up the staircase with Teddy's bugle. And finally, Mortimer devises a brilliant little word game to convince Teddy that the word \"Brewster\" is code for \"Roosevelt.\" \"Arsenic and Old Lace\" is a truly wild & wacky movie, no question about it whatsoever! It does have a happy ending but, as Frank Capra Jr. once stated, you gotta pay for a happy ending! Amidst all of the various oddball characters, this film raises the question of who is mentally stable and who isn't, as confirmed by the cab driver (Garry Owen) at the very end of the movie: \"I'm not a cab driver! I'm a coffeepot!\"",

However, he has fallen in love and, earlier in the day, married Elaine Harper (Priscilla Lane), the daughter of the minister who lives across a cemetery from his aunt's home. His aunts, Abby (Josephine Hull) and Martha (Jean Adair), seem sweet and model citizens.

Jonathan and Doctor Einstein have their own murderous secrets.Mortimer tries to sort out the rapidly increasing chaos, and incompetent Brooklyn police provide little aid.

            "content": "What would you do if you found out that your own dear aunts were homicidal maniacs? There's a variety of ways to deal with the situation but Cary Grant probably picks the most unorthodox and unconventional solutions in Arsenic and Old Lace, a classic Frank Capra comedy from 1944. Grant stars as Mortimer Brewster, a drama critique who, at the opening of the film, marries his girlfriend. He goes home to tell his aunts and prepare for his honeymoon to Niagra Falls. However, while at home he finds out his aunts have poisoned twelve men over the past few months and they are all buried in the cellar. This news sends Mortimer racing around trying to hide the fact that his aunts are homicidal, while also dealing with a variety of other problems as this kind of insanity runs in his family. At the same time as he is dealing with his aunts Mortimer has one brother who thinks he's Teddy Roosevelt and another a deformed serial killer who, after being gone for twenty years, decides to return home at the most inopportune time. It's a wild and bizarre ride that is chock full of innocently delightful laughs.Arsenic and Old Lace represents the Golden Age of the American comedy. Some of the most classic comedies were made during World War II in order to ease the troubled times America was involved in. Arsenic and Old Lace falls right in with these films, having been released in 1944. Therefore, it's only purpose is just to make us laugh. It aims to entertain and delight, and I would say it does just that. It's got a cavalcade of wacky and eccentric characters played by a fantastic cast of hilarious actors and actresses. The duo of Aunt Abby and Aunt Martha is one of the most hilarious on screen pairings I've ever seen and the two actresses, Josephine Hull and Jean Adair respectively, play the part so perfectly. They come off as the sweetest old ladies you could ever meet who just don't understand what all the fuss is about concerning the twelve dead bodies they have buried in their cellar. It's certainly comedy at its most intelligent.The whole point of Arsenic and Old Lace is to be incredibly weird in a very entertaining way. And that is definitely what it does. This is a very strange film with all sorts of moments that make you scratch your head in confusion and chuckle at the same time. It's an incredibly offbeat film for its time, and this adds to the humor. As far as comedy goes this isn't quite my cup of tea, but I have the utmost respect for what a quality comedy film this is. Personally my taste leans towards more modern comedy stilings, but Arsenic and Old Lace is representative of a great era of comedy and just film in general. It's a great film that shouldn't be missed.",

Who am I kidding? I still enjoy them. Thank God for DVDs and Videos.Of all the Halloween Specials and Movies I have seen the best I think by far is Frank Capra's  `Arsenic and Old Lace' 1944. I bought the DVD release and must say it never gets old. I know all the criticisms for this movie, Cary Grant's Double Takes, The weak script, The over acting. To all the negative critics I say `LIGHTEN-UP'. You have to take this movie for what it is.  A Frank Capra 1940 Movie Classic.The movie is closely based on the hugely successful Broadway play. Cary Grant plays Mortimer Brewster a dramatic critic who's written many books about the pitfalls of marriage. The movie takes place on Halloween night. And starts with Grant getting married.  Together he and his new wife Elaine played by Priscilla Lane go tell his two aunts (who raised him from birth) about is marriage. What he finds is that his spinster Aunts are in fact Serial Killers and have been poisoning lonely old gentlemen and burying them in their basement. Its what they call their charity. This sets Grant in to a whirlwind of double take after double take. When you add his 2 brothers Teddy (who thinks he's Teddy Roosevelt) and Jonathan (Mortimer's Lunatic murdering brother) to the mix you get a Madcap Halloween Romp that with tickle your funny bone! Or as Teddy says in the movie `BULLY', ` DELIGHTFUL'!",

Loaded with zany characters, absurd situations and biting satire, \"Arsenic and Old Lace\" is the granddaddy of black comedies. Decades before Kevin Williamson wrote \"Scream\" and Joe Dante made any of his films, Joseph Kesserling loaded this production with self-referential inside jokes and comedy that paved the way for films that followed \u0096 films that ranged from \"The Trouble with Harry\" to \"Heathers\" and beyond.The production values are slick but modest \u0096 the majority of scenes play out in the Brewster sisters' sitting room, though with the outlandish goings on, one hardly notices how stagy it appears. The cast is near perfection, and appeared to have been having as much fun as the viewers. Peter Lorre is a particular standout as the creepy cohort of Jonathan Brewster (sadly, Boris Karloff, who originated the role of Jonathan on the stage was not contractually allowed to reprise it in the film \u0096 but Raymond Massey is a more than adequate replacement). Frank Capra's direction is on-the-ball every time, undoubtedly focusing on the greatest moments as he saw them on the stage. A five-star film in every way, \"Arsenic and Old Lace\" is a must-see for all lovers of dark humored comedies.",

Perhaps it was the mood I was in at the time, but I found the story ridiculous.

I wish Ms. Lane could've had more screen time. I became extra attentive whenever she was onscreen.

            "content": "Frank Capra's Arsenic and Old Lace is one of the best comedies I've ever seen, combining slapstick, screwball, silent film antics and sharp dialogue to produce a gem of a movie.Cary Grant plays Mortimer Brewster, a drama critic who's just married. Before leaving to the Niagara Falls on honeymoon, he pays a visit to his elderly aunts in Brooklyn. It should have been a normal day, but there's nothing normal in the Brester abode. His mad brother thinks he's Teddy Roosevelt, Mortimer finds out his aunts are serial killers poisoning lonely old men and burying them in the cellar, with proper religious service and fresh flowers on Sunday included; and to cap it all, his deranged brother Jonathan, who looks like Boris Karloff in Frankstein (this isn't my comparison; this is a running gag in the movie), has ran away from the hospital for the criminally insane along with a plastic surgeon who'll operate on his face.In the middle of all this, Mortimer has to find a way to commit Teddy, get rid of Jonathan and Dr. Einstein, and keep his aunts out of jail. What follows is a movie full of wit, twists and lots and lots of humor, from the darkest to the sweetest.The entire cast is to be praised, but of course the real star is Cary Grant, one of the greatest actors, comedy and otherwise, the world ever saw. He delivers a performance that is just as memorable for its physical, over-the-top behavior as it is for his quirky dialogue.Finally, the brothers Julius and Philip Epstein deserve credit for the adaptation of the Broadway play the movie is based on. No strangers to witty dialogue, I'm sure the writers of Casablanca had a lot to do with the movie being so marvellous.",

Here, he is called upon to be manic and shocked at everything he hears. Everything he says has an question mark + an exclamation point behind it.Now for the good part. Peter Lorre as Dr. Einstein. Lorre was famous for his kind of nervous, fidgety persona and to this day, he is still the subject of parody, especially in cartoons. His performance as Dr. Einstein is almost like seeing a live action incarnation of those parodies, although his characters were never that insane.The two little old ladies are also very well played by two actresses who were not that well known in movies, although one of them, Josephine Hull, became somewhat famous because of this part and one in Harvey with James Stewart.And of course who can forget the supremely crazy performance by John Alexander as Teddy. It is hard to imagine an actor playing such a character today but Alexander never breaks the wall and let the audience know that he is in on the joke.The many references to Boris Karloff are only funny to people who know either the movie Frankenstein or that Karloff played the part of Jonathan Brewster on stage, but it gets a big laugh for any movie buff every time. There are too many memorable characters to mention and that's the reason why it's still a joy to watch, even after nearly 70 years since it was made. It is also a shame that the director Frank Capra is mostly known for his message pictures like Mr. Smith and Mr. Deeds because he certainly nailed the comedy in this one.So if you can ignore Grant's mugging and suspend disbelief of the rather insane story, you will have a fabulous time.

Strangely the worst part about the whole movie is Cary Grant's acting.  He's one of the top 10 actors of all time, but he was way over the top in this thing.  He appeared to think the movie was a big comedy, but the other actors treated it like a comedic drama, as they should have.  Grant was way off the mark on this one.There are some mild spoilers here, but I wouldn't think they'd damage your pleasure before you watched it.  Proceed at your own risk.The story is a little absurd, but that's where the comedy comes from.  A newlywed dramatic critic (Cary Grant) in the big city lives with his two aunts (Josephine Hull and Jean Adair) and an uncle (John Alexander).  Uncle Teddy is cookoo and thinks he's Teddy Roosevelt.  The aunts think he's the only one that's screwed up in the head, but, in fact, they are as well.  For they have been murdering lonely elderly gentlemen in their own home and burying them in the cellar.  When the nephew finds out, he goes a little weird himself in his attempt to figure out what to do about it.Everything gets worse when the long, lost, delinquent brother (Raymond Massey) returns home after a prison escape and is looking for a place to live and to bury his most recent victim.It's a plot that Hitchcock himself would have enjoyed, but there just wasn't clear direction of the acting and therefore no cohesiveness.

The amount of ridiculous gags and absurd situations is enormous, making the film really enjoyable. It is sometimes so ludicrous that it's even hard to imagine how can anyone come up with a plot like this one.When a well-known drama critic Mortimer Brewster visits his two adorable aunts in order to tell them the fantastic new about his engagement to beautiful Elaine Harper, he finds out the horrible truth that spins the would-be quick meeting totally out of control. There is a dead man in the wooden box inside the house. But that is not all! There are eleven more buried under the residence. Then, there is also Teddy, who is a 100% sure that he is the late president Theodore Roosevelt. And if this was not enough, after some time we meet another member of this peculiar family - Jonathan (possessing a face that provokes a fantastic recurring gag concerning Boris Karloff), who shows up suddenly with his old friend Dr. Einstein.Even though that Cary Grant considered this to be one of his personal least favorite movies, his performance is so exaggerated that is almost excellent. For his character seems to be the only normal person in the entire household, trying to resolve all the farcical problems that occur throughout the whole film. One of them may be convincing the aunts that killing an innocent older man with an addition of arsenic to his wine is not right, because in their opinion they just shorten the miserable life a poor, lonely fellow. Another obstacle relates to the fact that his own brother, the gruesome Jonathan, wants to torture and kill him on the same exact night. Then, there is of course more action involving police officers and locked up corpses.If I'd have to pick one particular scene that I found the funniest (or the most absurd) I'd go with the conversation between aunts and Jonathan, who try to resolve a dispute about their little 'competition' - who killed more people! Because the sides are currently tied, one of them must be the winner, right? If you think that this is already too much you are very wrong, but I won't go into details, because I don't want to spoil the whole experience of watching this amazingly hilarious picture.All in all, I want to highly recommend this movie to EVERYONE. It is one of the funniest pictures ever made and it certainly didn't lose its charm after all those years. The jokes are intelligent and fresh, the cast is first-class and the remarkable screenplay will leave the most pleasant mark on your memory.

In those days, the baseball season was well over by then.But that's is only a little baseball geek stuff. The cast is all superb. We even get James Gleason & Edward Everett Horton towards the end.

No male could achieve the kind of performance that Grant gives here and made so beloved as a screen star. The Philadelphia Story, Bringing Up Baby, and Topper are other examples of the kind of comedic tour de force for which Grant was so famous. Only when Grant teamed up with Hitchcock in Notorious, To Catch A Thief and North by Northwest did we see just how grand Grant could be in dramatic roles.",

He overacts tremendously, and I am convinced that it was Capra's fault, since Grant played the same sort of frustrated-to-distraction role perfectly in \"Bringing Up Baby\". The character of the fiancee is very lame, and apparently was rewritten for the screen. The rewrite for the screen apparently took much of the edge off the play. which may explain why the more ominous scenes with Massey seem so jarring when compared to the rest of the movie.Massey is fine as the evil \"looks like Boris Karloff\" brother, and Lorre is playing himself (which he does effortlessly). Anyway, there are moments, but the plot is poorly constructed and the movie is badly directed, so it's more interesting as an example of a sure hit that fails. (The play was a huge success on Broadway, and what a cast in the movie...)",

            "content": "Arsenic and Old Lace\nFrank Capra's film Arsenic and Old Lace tells the story of Mortimer Brewster (Cary Grant), a dramatic play critic who criticizes love, marriage, and honeymoons in his reviews preaching bachelorhood. Additionally, he published a book titled Marriage a Fraud and a Failure. Ironically, this dark comedy has Mortimer marry Elaine Harper (Pricilla Lane), the girl next door, on Halloween, and they return to the houses in Brooklyn where they grew up before leaving on their Niagara Falls honeymoon. Priscilla lives with her father, Reverend Harper (Grant Mitchell), at the church with a graveyard that separates Mortimer's Aunts Martha Brewster (Jean Adair), Abby Brewster (Josephine Hull), and his brother Teddy Roosevelt Brewster (John Alexander) house on the other side. His Aunts raised the brothers Teddy, Mortimer, and Johnathan Brewster (Raymond Massey), who returned home that Halloween evening to his Aunt's house with his sidekick plastic surgeon, Dr. Einstein (Peter Lorre).The theme of Arsenic and Old Lace (Capra, 1944) is murder, mayhem, and mental illness in the setting of Mortimer's Aunts home in Brooklyn, New York, on a Halloween evening. First, Aunt Martha and Aunt Abby are kind, pleasant older ladies who take in lonely borders, then offer them elderberry wine with strychnine, arsenic with a pinch of cyanide that kills them. Then Teddy, who has an identity disorder and thinks he is Teddy Roosevelt, is told to dig a canal for another yellow fever victim who needs to be buried by his Aunts. Finally, Johnathan has escaped prison for the criminally insane with Dr. Einstein, returns to the house with his own dead body, and plans to bury him in the canal after he finds out what his Autns have done in the cellar, and finally, his goal to have facial reconstruction by Einstein, so he does not look like Frankenstein.In this setting, many events within the Brewster family cause Mortimer to doubt his future mental health, especially what it may mean in his marriage to Elaine. Mortimer first arrives at Aunt Abby and Martha's house to tell them of the marriage and finds a body in the window seat, and he automatically thinks it is Teddy's. However, when speaking with Aunt Martha and Abby, he discovers they take in lonely male borders and offers them elderberry wine with poisons added. Mortimer then finds out that 12 men have been poisoned by his Aunts. Aunt Abby and Martha feel they are doing the right thing by poisoning them, and Teddy is clueless about the real cause of death because he thinks he is Teddy Roosevelt with the basement as Panama.Throughout the movie, Mortimer is troubleshooting and attempting to get Teddy committed to Happy Dale Sanatarium, stopping another potential border from drinking the elderberry wine, getting tied up by his brother Johnathon, and managing the police who stop in on their neighborhood beat. Likewise, Elaine is trying to figure out what is happening with Mortimer. These scenes constantly hop from one to the other throughout this evening in the Brewster house, making it mayhem for Mortimer and realizing that his whole family is mentally ill.Arsenic and Old Lace film is lighthearted with all characters except Johnathon and Dr. Einstein. Who could believe these sweet old ladies would ever cause harm to anyone? Alternatively, Teddy always charges up the stairs, blows his bugle, goes to Panama to dig canals, and appears harmlessly insane.Spoiler: In the end, Teddy, Aunt Martha, and Abby are all going to Happy Dale, Johnathan is arrested, and Dr. Einstein escapes. The main takeaway is that Mortimer is told by his Aunt that he was adopted and is not a blood relative, which makes him happy that he will not be insane and can go on with his life with Elaine.It is hard to find a film comparable to this black comedy. Other films of the era and beyond have murder and comedy, but none like Arsenic and Old Lace. It is a must-see for everyone.",

Even in a Hitchcock thriller like \"North by Northwest\", Grant relished the chance to evoke laughter in his scene as a drunk.Based on the hit stage play, \"Arsenic and Old Lace\" is the quintessential dark comedy of its era. Josephine Hull and Jean Adair are priceless as the well-meaning sisters whose \"ministry\" is mercifully ending the lives of their lonely, elderly guests and burying them their basement. Raymond Massey is the menacing Johnathan Brewster. Pricilla Lane is winningly cute as Mortimer's confused bride-to-be. Peter Lorre is the shifty but sympathetically conflicted Dr. Einstein. And if you haven't seen John Alexander as the delusional Teddy Brewster, you're in for an unforgettable treat!Enjoy the Brewster sisters' hospitality, but I don't advise drinking the wine!!!",

Cleverly directed, brilliantly acted and scripted, it is a prime example of black comedy at its best.The actors (particularly Massey and Lorre as two of the era's most original and disturbing villains) are perfectly cast in rolls that they truly bring to life. There are many memorable scenes and lines (\"No! Not the Melbourne Method!\") and each player gets a turn in the spotlight. Indeed, while watching, I was under the impression that everyone must have had a wonderful time making this picture. This is truly a peculiar film in that it excellently balances the mood between light-hearted comic adventure and borderline horror. In fact, one may have a hard time recognizing this as a work from Capra, owing to the amount of bizarre shenanigans and twists that beset the plot.Packed with witty blocks of conversation, extraordinary personalities, and an interesting setting, Arsenic and Old Lace is highly recommended viewing for all.

It's a black comedy but it never loses the Capraesque sentimentality. Two sweet old ladies are murdering people and yet the tone of the film is about as affectionately idealistic as Capra's It's A Wonderful Life. There's something truly charming about that.Enough can't be said about the casting. Raymond Massey and Peter Lorre play almost caricatures of their characters, and yet they do it so well you almost don't even notice, until of course the story takes a moment to literally point these things out. Cary Grant, who famously said that he didn't look back fondly on this role for fear that he overacted, is brilliant. Maybe there's truth to his words, maybe there is some overacting here, but it feels so necessary for the character that it's impossible to imagine Mortimer any other way.And through the sentimental tone there is some truly great humor at play here. Grant and Massey both rushing to the window seat followed by Grant's realization to what has happened will never not get a laugh from me, and the scene where the police in the background read out a description of Peter Lorre's character as he is standing in the foreground as he has to agonizingly listen is comedic gold.There's something so incredibly beautiful about this movie that I have tried to put into words countless times throughout the years and I somehow always come up short. All I can say is I can and in all likelihood will watch it at least a hundred more times before I die and even then I shall never tire of it.",

Sure, he stretches, and the more he does so, the funnier the scenes.Hope and Benny were the first choices. Benny with his familiar put-upon expressions would have done well.

            "content": "Over a drinking conversation, a friend asked me what was the darkest film ever made. Instinctively, I said Arsenic and Old Lace - a film I hadn't seen in over twenty years. My friend had never seen the film, and asked general questions about it. When I told him that it was a Frank Capra film he seemed incredulous. I guess he couldn't peg the director of Mr. Smith Goes To Washington with making a dark film.To tell the truth, neither could I - not on recall alone. That weekend, I plopped a borrowed copy into my DVD player, and watched the film again. After the first reel, which now seemed plodding, it all rushed back to me why this film was dark: It seemed that Mr. Capra had lost his na\u00efvet\u00e9, and filmed why he lost it.Mortimer Brewster (Cary Grant) is a famed drama critic for a New York paper. But mostly, he is known for his stance against marriage and the many books he has written mocking the institution. One Halloween, in which the Brooklyn Dodgers get into a real row of a fight, Mortimer and the love of his life - the girl next door, Elaine Harper (Priscilla Lane) - get married. Mortimer, fearing the deluge of negative comments of the famed bachelor tying the knot, brings Elaine by their folks' houses to announce their marriage before they sail away for a two-month voyage. It is here where Mortimer's life falls off the cliff. When he tells the kindly old Aunts that raised him, Abby (Josephine Hull) and Martha (Jean Adair) Brewster, the news, he discovers that the nicest people in Brooklyn have been putting arsenic in their homemade elderberry wine, and knocking off lonely old gentlemen. The news gets worse. It seems that Mortimer has repressed memories of the violence that was done to him by his brother, Jonathan Brewster (Raymond Massey), when he was a child. Plus, there is the delusional uncle who thinks he is Teddy Roosevelt. In all, after a half-hour, Mortimer now fears for Elaine's safety, for he believes he is as loony as the rest of the Brewsters.By the way, this is a comedy. It was adapted from a hit Broadway play starring Mr. Frankenstein himself, Boris Karloff. He actually was supposed to be in the movie also, but couldn't leave the play. Frank Capra directed Arsenic and Old Lace in the genre of the screwball comedies of the thirties. He shot it five months after the play premiered. He had previous success in the field of screwball comedies with It Happened One Night. Old Lace also could be considered a film noir piece with the abundant nighttime location shoots, and very dark interiors. The Brewster house provided for very ominous, long shadows. But if this was a noir film - I say it is - then it would be Capra's first. And the question would be \"Why\"?It was an obvious choice to cast Cary Grant, who had drawn crowds to several screwball comedies since his first screen role in She Done Him Wrong. In every one of these genre roles, he played the straight, sane one - the one who gets more insane as the plot progresses. (Of particular note, in later years, Grant held a very low opinion of both She Done Him Wrong and Arsenic and Old Lace. He found She Done Him Wrong and Mae West to be too sexual. And he found Arsenic and Old Lace to be too dark and cynical.) At the time of the play's release, America was in the beginnings of WWII. And maybe dark themes were all that could be tolerated by an entertainment seeking public. It and Sweeny Todd are definitely the darkest of the light theatrical subjects. And strangely enough both plays were released around American wars. Maybe funny comedies had to show a dark sense of humor. Or light musicals for that matter had to explore horror. Unlike Sweeny Todd the movie, Arsenic and Old Lace was a hit - mainly because it was shot within months after it opened, and released soon after it closed. By that time Europe was close to D-Day.",

I found the most driving force in the film was simply that I had to know how the story could possibly untangle enough to deliver an ending that didn't feel forced. It managed it quite nicely.Cary Grant is terrific. Everyone in the film is. Peter Lorre is magnificent in what I think is an unusual comedic role as the violently homicidal brother's flunky.The mood of this gem of a film simply can't be described sufficiently in words. It must be experienced. So go watch it. NOW! Really. You won't regret it.",

It all flows along like a great piece of work and there's not one let down throughout. I'm not sure why he hates this movie, it's not as if he'd been doing a bunch of different films the same way, this is a once in a career looking role, and he fits it to a tee, alongside his strangely irregular cast-mates.

This is one of the most hilarious comic inventions ever - with a cast that's so full of great stars (and top-notch seasoned character actors) at their very best that it shines like a universe of bright lights. (And it's one of Frank Capra's very best - and most unusual films, for a man who normally represented \"Americana\" and charm. This falls outside his norm. It's just zany!)Plus - unlike other comedies - it builds and builds with tension until the very end.And like all great movies, it's full of memorable scenes and lines you'll be quoting forever (including Garry Owen's throwaway line (as the incredulous cab driver), \"I'm a teapot!\" - which you'll understand when you hear it).Even IF Cary Grant weren't in this film delivering one of his very very best comic performances ever, there are so many performances and reasons to see this film it's impossible to list them all here. Josephine Hull and Jean Adair practically steal this movie, for example - and that's saying a lot in a movie chock full of amazingly awesome performances, such as: Fine actor Raymond Massey's scary yet hilarious performance as a Frankenstein-like Jonathan Brewster (and what a stretch for him!) Peter Lorre's off-the-charts delightfully schizophrenic performance as the alcoholic and sadistic yet strangely caring at times Dr. Einstein Jack Carson's hilarious performance as a dumb cop with a dream of becoming a playwright John Alexander's performance as a mad but lovable relative of Cary's who thinks he's Teddy Roosevelt Edward Everett Horton's brilliant performance as a \"rest home\" director ...And it goes on and on from there.While this also functions as a \"romantic\" comedy - since Priscilla Lane is wooing Cary throughout - this is the not your traditional romantic comedy and I suggest that that ruse was grafted on to lighten the premise. It's necessary to the film but not what it's \"all about.\"Hopefully you'll give this movie a chance and \"get it\" - because this is one of the wildest and most incredible comic rides you'll ever take.",

They would charge up and down the stairs like Teddy, not quite grasping the dark comedy aspect until they were older.It is obvious the old ladies have gotten themselves into a \"very very bad habit\" and that they are just going to go on doing what they've been doing if some intervention isn't taken. The whole idea that the entire family is nuts is great. Cary Grant is the one person who is supposed to be sane and he's losing his mind throughout.Great performances by Raymond Massey and Peter Lorre.

            "content": "Cary Grant said, more than once, that the only film he wished he hadn't made was Arsenic and Old Lace. Cary was one of the most brilliant actors ever to grace the screen, and his own self-deprecation of this movie proves the rule that the best actors make the worst critics. This is far and away the best movie the old boy ever made and the best performance he ever turned in \u0096 and, given The Philadelphia Story, Mr Blandings Builds His Dream House, Charade and many others, that's saying something.If you believe that performance art is actually art, that Martin Scorcese directs comedy well, or that Quentin Tarntino is an actual person instead of a character created by Andy Kaufman \u0096 don't waste time watching this movie. You have neither the wit nor the sophistication to appreciate it.Following the best formula for comedy, Frank Capra starts with two great leads, creates circumstances which make them both lunatics, and then surrounds them with brilliant comedic actors playing characters who are raving lunatics on their best days. This formula is why Arsenic and Old Lace, Young Frankenstein, What's Up Doc and Love and Death are brilliant, while Fletch is merely funny (Dick Libertini, Ken Mars, George Wendt et al playing straight men for anyone is inherently wrong).This is the archetypical door-slamming comedy \u0096 with a few dozen murders and a family that would make Hannibal Lector faint dead away thrown in for laughs. Cary, as the only normal member of the family, turns in a performance that is suave, yet slapstick to a degree that would do Harpo Marx or Larry Fine proud. The female lead (who isn't seen all that much) is the equally brilliant Priscilla Lane, who made far too few movies. Add in Raymond Massey, Peter Lorre, Jack Carson, James Gleason, Edward Everett Horton and lots of other great comedians and you get funny in spades.Mortimer Brewster (Grant), theater critic and author of books against marriage, has just married the minister's daughter (Lane) who lives next door to the two maiden Aunts in Brooklyn who raised him. They stop to tell them on their way to Niagara Falls. You get to see Mortimer's brother Teddy, who thinks he's Theodore Roosevelt, and, in incidental conversation, learn of the psychotic third brother, Jonathan, who's long since departed. But, as least Mort knows good old Aunts Abby and Martha are sane ... until he finds the china closet full of men's hats and learns about the little \"charity\" service they've been performing. Of course, while he's trying to sort out the chaos he thought was order, Jonathan returns with two friends, one living.While best viewed just before Halloween, this movie is an absolute treat any time. The dialogue is great, the slapstick is splendid, and there are more and better double-takes than any other film. Watch Cary use every muscle in his face as he intones \"Now, Aunt Abby, when you say 'others' do you mean others \u0096 as in more than one others?!?\" If Raymond Massey's Jonathan doesn't frighten you to your toes, and if Cary doing a prancing pantomime while singing \"there is a happy dale far, far away\" doesn't put you on the floor \u0096 call the ME's, you're as good as dead.",

I hadn't seen it in many years, and it was terrific to watch this comedy gem again! One of the most entertaining movies made in the 1940s. Cary Grant was incredible as a physical comedian, as Mortimer Brewster, and I was comparing his performance to say, Jerry Lewis, and it is really way over the top! I consider this film to be Cary Grant's greatest comedy performance! Priscilla Lane as his fianc\u00e9e/wife was such a beautiful, sweet blonde, sweet as honey, the two naughty aunts with their bad habits of poisoning lonely old men with their arsenic-laced elderberry wine were superb; John Alexander as the wacko-nutcase Brewster brother who thinks he is Teddy Roosevelt was also a standout: \"Charge!\" as he runs up the staircase, as he was as the fallen angel Doremus in Jack Benny's HORN BLOWS AT MIDNIGHT (1945), and Raymond Massey in full horror makeup (including some very realistic-looking stitched scars on his face) as a diabolically evil Karloff-knockoff horror character, Jonathan Brewster, is fantastic! Of course, those of us who have done our homework on this picture know that Karloff played this very role in the Broadway play! And Peter Lorre, as his lesser, but just as diabolical sidekick (whose fluid acting makes him seem to be a cartoon character) Dr. Einstein, is terrific! Plus Jack Carson as the knucklehead cop on the beat O'Hara, with the added understated comedy performances of Edward Everett Horton as Mr. Witherspoon, the happy-go-lucky director of Happydale Sanitarium, matchstick-slim James Gleason as the police inspector (who goes from being a police lieutenant to a captain in the dialogue), a brief appearance of crusty old Charles Lane, makes this movie a wonderful Halloween masterpiece, originally filmed in late 1941, and released about a month before Halloween 1944. Capra at his very best! Highly Recommended for the Dead Comedians Society!",

It's all in the characters: sweet, dotty old ladies with a purpose, a plastic surgeon with a slight alcohol problem, a globe-trotting serial killer who's \"Melbourne Method\" brings chills just the way he SAYS it, and an average Joe who will elope with a typical '40's sweetie, just happening to find a stiff in a window-seat. Oh, yes....I forgot the President of the United States (former). Mix all together and you get a \"screwball comedy\" that rivals any others I've ever seen. Personal note here. I saw the play in Portland, Oregon with Bob Crane as Mortimer....yes, Col. Hogan! When the cast came out for a bow at the end 12 \"dead\" people came out of the cellar for a bow!

I was told to expect a charming black comedy, I wasn't disappointed.The premise of the film, two old spinster sisters living together and killing lonely old men, doesn't seem overly appealing. It sounds like an attempt to imitate the quirky British comedies of the same era. However this is something quite different. It is mainly a bit of silly fun. It doesn't take itself seriously at all, and you can tell that most of the actors involved thought that the picture would be something they could have a laugh with.The energy of the piece is what brings it alive. As I have mentioned, the actors really bring it to life. Carey Grant, for once, is very good. However the actor who play's Teddy deserves a special mention. For me, he makes the film, without his influence I feel it would be a slightly above average comedy. But the sheer amount of one liners, quips, and great acting brings him to the forefront of the film.I enjoyed this film, but nowhere near as much as Kind Hearts, which is a shinning example of how a dark comedy should be done. Good film, but perhaps overly reliant on Teddy for gags.8/10",

But the movie brought it more to life to me.Cary Grant was hilarious as usual and probably played the best performance I have seen him do. His facial expressions and the way he acted because he was so perplexed to learn that his aunts were murders was hilarious. But I think my favorite character in the movie might be the man who thought he was Teddy Roosevelt, I used to laugh so hard at the scenes of him running up the stairs every time yelling, \"Charge.\" The whole movie was just wonderfully done and shot very smoothly. And the fact that its a comedy/ thriller that is usually on t.v. every Halloween makes it all the better to me.This movie had everything you could possibly in a comedy, great and funny characters, a Thriller, and crime film, a bit of a funny love story. I would definitely recommend this movie to people who love a good comedy/ thriller. There are no other movies like this film and you do not wanna miss an amazing performance by Cary Grant.",

            "content": "\"Arsenic & Old Lace\" is about the dramatic critic Mortimer Brewster (Cary Grant), who, after getting married at the beginning of the movie, is prevented from going away on the honeymoon by the terrible discovery that his beloved aunts have the habit to poison gentlemen and bury them in the cellar. From this point on, things get complicated, nothing seems right, and Mortimer tries his best to change the situation for the better, but, in many occasions, he is prevented from doing this.Cary Grant once said that he disliked his performance in \"Arsenic & Old Lace\", because it was way too over the top. Before seeing the movie, I thought he was exaggerating, but once I saw it, I understood what he was talking about. But I do not mean this as a critique. Yes, it was over the top, but this is exactly how it was supposed to be: big, exaggerated, desperate...and yes, it is pretty apparent that he was acting, but he was surely acting mighty fine, and I was terribly amused by both his performance and the movie as a whole! I don't know if you ever noticed the following situation in a movie, because I personally have, and it kind of annoyed me. In some movies, when the characters face a tragic or intensely dramatic situation, they are trying to act accordingly, I mean to seem in pain, or confused, or amazed, but, somehow, they do not succeed in portraying these emotions adequately. Well, when this happens, I feel terribly annoyed, because I understand the situation, the tension and all that, but the characters seem to be lost, so I don't get to enjoy those movies thoroughly. My point is that Cary Grant did exactly the opposite in \"Arsenic & Old Lace\". He was constantly restless, nervous, somewhat amused, because after all, the situation he was in was so crazy, that it called for a bit of amusement. But enough about Cary Grant.Before seeing the movie, I actually had no expectations. I didn't even know what it was about. I only knew it was Frank Capra's work, and I love Frank Capra's work. And this one didn't let me down, not even a bit. The most enjoyable part of the movie was, of course, the intricate and funny(but dark funny) plot. It kept me entertained and I didn't get bored at all, which is a very important thing. In addition, a main aspect is that, throughout the whole movie, we weren't shown any dead bodies. I thought this was fantastic. It certainly added mystery and suspense to the plot, and it showed that a proper atmosphere can be also created by means that do not imply revealing blood or corpses.The cast was amazing, and apart from Cary Grant, I loved, loved, loved the 2 aunts. I would have never expected them to act so naturally, not to deny anything, and to even want to call the police, in their naivet\u00e9(insanity, actually). The script was also fabulous...I particularly liked a certain line:\"Insanity runs in my family. It practically gallops.\" It made me burst out laughing, and it definitely is one of my favourite movie quotes ever.Overall, I think it is one of the best classic movies, and it definitely is worth seeing. 10/10",

They do a really good job convincing the audience that there is nothing wrong with killing lonely gentlemen who have no family. Practically the entire movie takes place in the dining- room, but it doesn't take away from it because the circumstances are so entertaining. I noticed that they did a close-up of the brother when he walks in to make him seem scarier. Also, there was a scene in the basement when the brother is talking to his assistant and the only thing you can see is his shadow. It is a nice way of making him seem intimidating. There was also a lot of play on sounds. The horn for example, and the whistling, and the clock. Additionally, there was a lot of repetition, but it didn't have a negative effect.",

The film was fast moving and keeps the audience's attention. It had a great flow to it.Cary Grant is incredibly funny, likable and enjoyable in his character. His family adds humor and laughable moments, especially his aunts. They say everyone has skeletons in their closet, apparently his aunts have many as they are murderers who have 13 bodies buried in their basement. The humor keeps the audience engaged. It's easy to understand that this is one of the classic comedies of all time. As the fight scene was happening in the end, we see a lot of activities that are happening by use of shadows against the wall on the stairs.

When on of the aunts is justifying her actions to Mortimer, she uses a hand gesture used in the many portrayals of Jesus Christ- with the right hand raised and the thumb, first and middle fingers held open while the third and fourth finder are down. Teddy. Oh, Teddy, Teddy. An absolutely lovable, quirky character. His role is beautiful- mentally impaired, he believes he is Theodore Roosevelt and his duty is to bury yellow fever victims and dig the Panama Canal.

I dear you not to double over laughing th first time you see and hear Mortimer's brother \"Teddy\". On top of that, Carey Grant, Raymond Massey and Peter Lorre Turn in brilliant performances. If you've never seen the movie before you'll be tearing up the first time you see Massey on screen and hear the name of his cohort Peter Lorre. This movie has earned a well deserved spot in my favorite comedies list. Frank Capra directs this wonderful comedy and from what I've read, the movie stays true to the play it was adapted from. Bottom line, if I could recommend this movie to everyone I know I would. One of the all time greatest screwball comedies ever made.",

I found it to be very entertaining, with situations as funny today as they would have been back when the movie was made. It took dark, disturbing topics - serial murder and family insanity - and made them humorous.The plot was fast paced, with one outragous situation after another. I especially enjoyed the humor that occurred as the main character, Mortimer (played by Cary Grant) had to mulitask and sometimes juggle several problems at once. He had to deal with his two aunts - sweet, elderly, well intended serial killers who are practicing euthanasia on unsuspecting men - his creepy, apparently dangours brother, his new wife, another relative who thinks he's Teddy Roosevelt, a sinister doctor (played by Peter Lorre), and the police, who keep stopping by, just to be sociable. All the while, Mortimer tries to keep everything under control and his aunts' behavior under wraps, with many close calls and misunderstandings. The result is often funny and sometimes hilarious.",

Watch the first half hour and you have a messed up dark comedy that astounding considering when it was made. Cary Grant was good as always and does a good job of slowly going insane as he sees how crazy his aunts are and tries to hide it all because of how crazy it is and after the first 45 minutes, the movie gets even more dark and becomes more of a thriller than a comedy while Cary Grant's character deals with his deranged brother. It does return to comedy often to keep the target audience interested while giving them more than they would've bargained for. Capra's directing also makes this a good movie. When the movie is serious, the lights go out only showing a little light. Then when the lights go back on, you know that you're going to get a good dose of comic relief. The constant switching feels exhausting, but it is a good feeling. The end is arguably the best part as it ties up loose ends in the funniest way possible.",

I always thought that when I grew up and saw more movies, this movie would reduce in importance in my mind. But it didn't. In fact, watching it today, it is quite clearly amazing. It's smart and slapstick at the same time: the gibes between Grant and his aunts, or the slick gags that play out in the background, while we focus on the foreground, the magical inanity of the plot premise: that aunts are poisoning helpless old men, while Grant tries to send them off to the sanatorium, are incredible. the fact is that the movie never descends to outright slapstick, and yet is hilarious, is a tribute to Capra and Grant. This movie should be owned, watched with your family, and watched alone as well: it will never wear out. I remember a lot of the dialog as if it was freshly minted, and the bit players make this movie as much as Grant: the cop who's writing a play, Teddy who thinks he's Teddy Roosevelt, the cab driver patiently waiting outside the mad house....the casting is perfect, and the music is critical, matching the moods of different characters, and ensuring the movie stays tinged with seriousness... This is my favorite comedy of all time.",

Elaine was so upset that the honey moon had been postponed and her showing up at the house every few hours added to the comedy of the movie. Anyone who watches the movie i think can relate to it and think that they have insane people in there family. The movie wasn't so much upbeat but funny and kind of spooky in some scenes.",

Teddy is such an odd character that he really pulls all the insanity to its climax every time he charges up the stairs and breaks the clock.

There is a good use of shadows that adds a lot of mystery to the plot.

The self-contained irony, the black humour, the absurdity, is all suddenly compounded towards the end, when Cary Grant himself accepts the insanity of the entire situation. It is also amazing to see a movie with such honestly dark patches, also be so family safe, a tribute to the great writing, and Frank Capra's direction.Not only is this movie hilarious, but it also has some genuinely horrifying moments. The monstrous Jonathan Brewster, played by Raymond Massey, coupled with his terrible facial scars is an honestly scary figure and has some oddly striking scenes mixed in with the all of the humour. Peter Lorre puts in a great mousy performance, and takes plenty of amusing abuse from all of the characters.Recommended viewing. Especially for fans of Cary Grant.",

I also enjoyed the two aunts. They were sweet, but their voices were almost little kid like and that is something I do not particularly like. I like how every member was crazy in their own right. I first saw the character Jonathon and the doctor I automatically thought of Frankenstein. The setting of the house I thought was ironic being next to a cemetery; seeing as the two aunts \"helped\" old lonely men find peace. One scene in the movie I thought was excellent was when Mortimer is sarcastically telling the story of a murder play. Mortimer himself is the chum who was too thick to realize what he was describing to the doctor was happening to him. It was like two identical stories going on simultaneously. Another part I liked was towards the end of the movie when the cops, doctor, Mortimer and the aunts are all talking at once. The aunts stated that there were twelve bodies in the basement. The chief also insults himself towards the end which I find to be funny. It's when he describes the \"doctor\" and doesn't even realize he's looking at the guilty man.

He did a good job though, just didn't like how he would hold his \"astonished\" face for too long. It was definitely a screwball comedy from the get-go, when Mr. No Marriage is spotted trying to get a marriage license. However, the name of one of his unfinished books was called \"Mind Over Matrimony\" which made me chuckle.

            "content": "Best comedy ever made in Hollywood. Bar none. No exceptions.Remarks in the rear of the comments section belittling \"Arsenic\" are pretentious, seemingly written by film students hoping to become the next Costa-Gravas or Wertmuller. They consistently describe \"Uncle\" Teddy when he is Jonathan's and Mortimer's brother. Another dismisses Capra as a director unfamiliar with comedy. despite \"It Happened One Night\" - the only contender as the funniest film ever made - being the first to win the top five Oscars: Best movie, director, actor, actress and writer.Cary Grant sat on stage one evening reminiscing with the audience. He considered Mortimer Brewster his worst performance. He was wrong and I know why. Cary judged his films by their box office and his performances by the critics. His best films, in his judgment, made a lot of money. Allyn Joslyn, a fine, somewhat prissy, leading man and light comedian on the stage and occasional films, originated the role of \"Mortimer Brewster\" on Broadway. The critics thought him wonderful. It was part of the play's joke that Joslyn played Mortimer completely unruffled by all that beset him, the calm center in a cyclone of larger-than-life performances around him. This was much on the same order as William Gillette, \"the Master of Undercting,\" played Sherlock Holmes in the famous stage play of his own creation in 1899. It worked well on stage - it might not have on film. Capra saw the movie version of the play in the same fast-paced light as the writers, Julius and Philip Epstein. Capra began his Hollywood career as a silent film screenwriter who understood setting up a gag as building one chuckle on another until the last, the \"capper\", set the audience howling with laughter.Another consideration of directing \"Arsenic\" at breakneck speed was to bring it in at under 2 hours, saving money on film prints. Frugality was a virtue at Warners. I first saw \"Arsenic\" in the late 1950s on KCOP, channel 13 in Los Angeles, the least important station of the seven servicing Southern California back then. Because the station management had such a small audience it sold lots of cheap commercial 10-second \"spots\" to local restaurants, re-upholsterers, grocery stores and other small businesses that could never afford a full minute or a 30 second commercial from the six other local stations.Problem was, KCOP trimmed movies badly, very often keeping the projector running under the twelve 10-second spots shown at each break. When returning to the movie, several scenes and a lot of plot had been eliminated. Since the breaks occurred at different times each broadcast it took at least four showings to actually see an entire film.This handicap aside my brothers, sister and I, even as small children, recognized \"Arsenic\" was a side-splitter from beginning to end. Many years later I was honored to be asked to play Teddy in a production of the play and discovered that, as wonderful as the play is, it lacks the pizazz of the film. The reason is the brothers, Julius and Philip Epstein had not written the play. The Epsteins added situations and hilarious lines into the play's dialogue that, even today, make it sparkle even if the jokes are topical: \"And that will be the end of the Roosevelts in the White House\" - \"That's what you think.\" Another line pays a kind of back-handed homage to the Brooklyn Dodgers who had finished leading the league for the first time that year: \"Yes,\" says Aunt Martha, ready to go to Happy Dale. \"The neighborhood's changed so ever since they won that old pennant thing.\" These lead to the hilarious, madcap climax. Mortimer grabs Teddy's bugle and charges up the staircase. The sequence crackles with James Gleason's exasperation, playing Lieut Rooney of \"New York's Finest\" as he looks over the commitment papers only to find, \"These papers aren't any good - he's signed them Theodore Roosevelt.\" In the midst of the chaos following Jonathan's apprehension, Mortimer begs Teddy to sign the papers with his real name, Theodore Brewster. Teddy considers a moment then refuses, \"No, it's chicanery.\" At the end of his rope Mortimer thinks fast, \"Brester is code for Roosevelt.\" This piques Teddy's interest.\"Take the 'B' away from Brewster,\" Mortimer quickly asks Teddy, \"and what do you have?\" Teddy pauses then brightens, \"Rooster!\" \"And what do roosters do?\" \"They crow!\" \"And where do you go hunting in Africa?\"Another moment as Teddy considers then smiles, \"On the Veldt!\" \"There, you have it,\" Mortimer concludes exultantly, \"'Crows-Veldt!'\" The joke's set-up and punchline never fail to break me up.From the first, I was in awe of the thought devoted to, and the cleverness given this hilarity which comes at precisely the right moment to rev up the funny bone for one one-liner after another which has put audiences in stitches for six decades and more.\"Very clever,\" says Teddy, now ready to sign. \"My compliments to the boys in the code department.\" MY compliments to the amazingly brilliant Epstein twins. Aside from writing their own scripts they were known as the best script doctors in Hollywood, often called by producers to goose scripts, competent or weak, into masterpieces.Nevermind sending your kids to the goofy, smutty and always inane summer comedies. Get a DVD of \"Arsenic,\" invite your kids' friends over, pop some (real not microwave) popcorn and don't forget the REAL butter instead of the horrible mineral oil \"golden topping\" so many theatres desecrate popcorn with today. Sit the youngsters in front of the TV. Prepare for the belly-laughter that comes from genuine humor, mirth, merriment and wit.And watch them all JUMP when Jonathan comes through the window!",

I had heard nothing but good things going into the film, so my standards were high. But it met and exceeded my expectations. It takes a fairly normal man and tosses him in with his comically insane family. Cary Grant plays the main character Mortimer, and as always he is phenomenal. Not an extremely elaborate film, I can see how it was adapted from a play. But, it works for the film. Although it deals with insanity and tackles a morbid subject, \"Arsenic and Old Lace\" is immensely funny. I absolutely loved the film, and I would not mind watching it again. It is a necessity for any comedy fan.",

Cary Grant is brilliant as Mortimer Brewster, delivering what I would submit to be the greatest comedic performance of all time. Grant once commented that, like many others, he wished he could be 'Cary Grant', the suave persona he occupied on screen. In 'Arsenic and Old Lace' we watch the Cary Grant persona unravel, revealing, perhaps, more of Archibald Leach than in any other film. Whether this is the case or not, Grant's performance is echoed in Peter Sellers' Mandrake in 'Dr Strangelove', both characters the perfect foils to the absurdity of their stories, even as their own behavior grows absurd. While other Capra film are uneven, 'Arsenic and Old Lace' is directed with economy and fidelity. There is an energy and a rhythm to the film, and, in a simple way, it is beautiful. 'Arsenic and Old Lace' is perfect.",

Not one joke or gag has died over the years. The acting is wonderful, from the two old ladies (reprising their roles from the Broadway play) to (of course) Cary Grant (whether he thinks so or not). This movie is simply a masterly-structured comedy and the way it's set up it practically does feel like a filmed play (but with occasional brief scene changes and that wacky baseball game at the beginning). Anyway, I highly recommend it. I made my high school creative writing teacher show this film to our class and everybody loved it. This film truly goes to show how well a movie can hold up.....except for that lawn jockey. Besides that, it feels like it can very well be present-day.",

Cary Grant is quoted as disliking his acting because of this, but the movie would never have been as good without that quality of being a little too much. All of the characters are meant to be a little too much, and this creates a balance within the movie between the panicked Mortimer, the peaceful aunts and the psychotic Jonathan. I love the descriptive dialogue by both Mortimer and the police officer at the end of the movie foreshadowing what steps Jonathan will take. It is also amusing the way that Mortimer's love story is cast aside in favor of handling the aunts, Teddy and Jonathan.",

            "content": "My only complaint is that sometimes Cary Grant isn't on the screen. The man is just ludicrously charming. \n\nFrank Capra made some incredibly sweet movies, but sometimes he goes so overboard with the faith in humanity, they become sickly sweet; senators overturning decades of corrupt behavior out of guilt, or landlords all of a sudden finding a soul and stop themselves from throwing the old widow out on a snowy wintery night. Arsenic and Old Lace is a refreshingly different story for the beloved director to lend his talents to, a black comedy that technically involves a series of murders and an insance escaped criminal but is relentlessly upbeat; Grant is a screwball comedy master here, with such top-notch timing and insane, cooky energy that you wouldn't expect him to have been one of the most acclaimed leading men of all time. Though the script certainly has all the limitations of a stage adaptation, few scripts that started in the theatre can claim to have this level of unpredictability or free-form humor. It's both consistently funny on the surface level (thanks to some excellent performances from Grant, and both Josephine Hull and Jean Adair as his eccentric aunts), and as a class criticism of old blue blood American families with their oddly twisted ideals; many films of recent years that tackle similar themes (Triangle of Sadness, The Menu, etc.) seem to feel the need to be somber, but Capra adapts a riotous stance to arguably greater effect. Love that you never see a body the entire time, despite about half a dozen opportunities for one to appear. \n\nI feel so bad for Peter Lorre, Hollywood treated him like a monster because he had a slightly distinct appearance and an unusual accent. He had real skill but it got constantly overlooked because of typecasting. Shame Boris Karloff couldn't reprise his stage role here, but the script gives him plenty of callouts. (4/5)",

There are two things that make it clear that comedy is hitting on all cylinders for me: 1) It makes me laugh out loud even when I\u2019m watching all by myself, and 2) It makes me laugh out loud even when I\u2019ve seen it several times before. This movie pulls off both of those things from start to finish. It has all the types of comedy I love including the way it willingly breaks the fourth wall more than once. It all resonates with me, and it\u2019s one of those rare movies that I wish would last even longer so I could keep having fun with it. I don\u2019t care what anyone says about career comedians (like Jim Carrey, Robin Williams, or even Bill Murray) they haven\u2019t got anything on Cary Grant. He can get huge laughs with nothing more than a surprised expression. They surround him with such an amazing cast too. The entire Brewster clan is delightful, particularly Josephine Hull and Jean Adair who play the sweet aunts who are completely oblivious to the error in there ways. In fact, despite the ridiculous nature of all the things happening, every actor plays it straight when the script calls for it. What\u2019s remarkable about Arsenic and Old Lace is that even though it feels so chaotic, there\u2019s a legitimate story going on that makes sense if you can stop laughing long enough to keep track of it. There\u2019s even a creepy menace created by the amazing Raymond Massey and Peter Lorre. Yet even they have comedic moments and show some awareness of the wackiness of everything that is happening around them. I suppose things wrap up a bit too conveniently at the end, but if you\u2019re putting that much critical thought into the story structure then you\u2019re missing out on the fun. I will watch Arsenic and Old Lace at any time and will always love it with all my heart.",

            "content": "ter a summer of enduring a near constant bombardment of blockbuster movies driven more by special effects that the emotional connect emanating from heartfelt performances, I find myself roaming the classic section of my film library. Like Ismail in the iconic opening paragraph of Herman Melville's 'Moby Dick,' I seek to address my cinematic restlessness by immersing myself in something greater. In this case, I find solace in the older films of my catalog, ones that have withstood the test of time by helping to define the means of artistic expression referred to as cinema. I was drawn to a personal favorite genre, the dark comedy. The ability of this type of story to elicit laughter in defiance of the serious, somber themes that encompass hardship, defeat, and death is among the most difficult types of category for a storyteller to master but when achieved the product of such a fertile imagination is a genius. Officially defined as \"a comic style that makes light of subject matter that is considered taboo,\" its very nature mak3s it difficult to present to a general audience. It is certain to undermine some sense of moral integrity, The film that caught my eye and engaged my brain remains a personal favorite and is cited frequently as a significant influence in introducing this genre to mainstream entertainment, 'Arsenic and Old Lace.' Hat its core is a story about a pair of unremorseful serial killers that dispatch men devoid of emotional ties. The plot device of having the murderers be senior women living in a respectable neighborhood in Brooklyn only appears to intensive the heinous nature of the acts routinely performed. The effect sustained by the story is humorous. Despite the amoral connotations instilled in the premise. Released during the height of the human tragedy permeating life through the global horror of World War II, it would seem the absolute most insensitive time to feature such a topic. The contemporary proved to be overwhelmingly positive permitting the film to embrace its historical place in film history.\n\nThe story is concerned with a well-established and respected Brooklyn family, the Brewsters. Since their arrival on the Mayflower, they have retained the status as the epitome of White, Anglo-Saxon Protestants proud of their lineage demonstrated by the images of past generations adorning the walls of the family home. The family member currently in the public eye is Mortimer Brewster (Cary Grant) who has written many several books denouncing marriage as an antiquated superstition. He finds himself in a hypocritical position when he falls in love. The object of his romantic attention is the literal manifestation of one of the oldest stereotypes of a romantic tale, the girl next door, Elaine Harper (Priscilla Lane). They married on October 31st, Halloween day, and before going off for they honeymoon Mortimer wants to stop at the family home to tell his elderly aunts, Abby (Josephine Hull) and Martha (Jean Adair). Mortimer's uncle John (John Alexander) resides there. If the Brewster family were devoid of the financial and social standing they enjoy, John would be considered insane, but such a position in society permits John seen as 'eccentric.' He believes that he is Theodore Roosevelt. As a manifestation of this delusion, he tends to yell \"Charge\" as he runs up the stairs imitating Roosevelt's famous charge up San Juan Hill. The construction of the fundamental elements of a dark comedy is especially crucial due to the fine line between humorous and bad taste. The craftsmanship exhibited in this story set the bar at such a high level that those choosing to follow in this genre would encounter an exceedingly arduous time even approaching the artistry displayed here. Considering the newspapers and radio broadcasts of the time were overwhelmed with the growing tragedy, the prelude to a second global war. This was not an emotional atmosphere conducive to a humorous consideration of death.\n\nMortimer was already experiencing a significant paradigm shift in his publicly known disdain for marriage, his new father-in-law, Reverend Harper (Grant Mitchell), was obviously an enthusiastic supporter of the institution. Returning to his quaint family home to visit his loving elderly aunts held expectations of glad tidings. Much to his shock, he discovers that Martha and Abby held such relationships so vital to continued happiness that when they encountered a bachelor devoid of familiar support they felt the most human action was to ease them out of their isolation with the fatal combination of arsenic and sweet wine. They leveraged Teddy's delusional persona to their best advantage. He dug down there convinced that he was digging the Panama Canal in the basement. He was providing the final resting place for the corporal remains of his aunt's victims. Advertising a spare room for rent was a common practice and guaranteed to attract the demographic, or perhaps more accurately, victim profile, they desired.\n\nWhen audiences think about serial killers the image that comes to mind typically is one of a seriously antisocial man, obviously overwhelmed by a plethora of mental problems. The pair of elderly spinster sisters presents the epitome of harmless eccentricity. Most families had examples of such people with many also embracing a harmlessly delusional relative like 'Teddy.' Back then such benign psychological afflictions were not addressed by institutionalization but directly by the family, the appreciation of these circumstances by modern audiences may be hindered through their belief in the currently approved methods of intervention, but for a long time, the circumstances found in this stately Brooklyn home was commonplace and very relatable.\n\nThe moment that ignites the main motivator plunging Mortimer into the thick of his insane circumstances occurred when he found a dead body in the downstairs window seat. Mr. Grant built his considerable reputation performing in roles of distinction. The usual roles he undertook were debonair, controlled and in charge. The considerable scope of his talents was often best showcased playing against type such as the bewildered executive in Alfred Hitchcock's 'North by Northwest' of a comic part like this. A man that exudes control set in such bizarre, surrealistic circumstances grabs the attention of the audience. An actor of such extraordinary skill as Carey Grant a movie that might have easily spired into ruination became one of the cinema's genre-defining gems. It does help considering that the setting is kept simple. The story unfolds in the familiar surroundings as a parlor among beloved family members. This was made possible by the origins of the story. Before its translation, to the silver screen, it was a highly popular Broadway play. A stage play is favorable to such an intimate feeling. The stage by nature, is simplistic, each detail in place for a specific purpose. When a setting is stripped of extraneous elements, the focus is shifted to the characters more than usual. It enhances the ability for the filmmaker to go to some extremes in the various plot devices. Without this, the ensuing craziness would be unsustainable. Mortimer concisely describes the situation with the memorable quote, \"Insanity runs in my family, practically gallops.\" There is a kinetic component that imbues a slapstick feel that helps to offset the morbid plot points. The police are called in ostensibly in pursuit of Mortimer's brother Johnathan (Raymond Massey). He is a psychopathic criminal accompanied by his alcoholic accomplice, plastic surgeon Dr. Herman Einstein (Peter Lorre). Johnathan is a murdered currently bordered with the problem of disposing of the body of his latest victim. This is a film that must be seen by anyone with a serious infatuation of films. Not only did it help define a genre it is undoubtedly one of the most clever comedies made",

At times his frantic jumping around and shocked facial expressions are funny, such as when he tells his aunts early on that they really oughtn't to be poisoning their visitors by saying \"Look, you can't do things like that!  Now, I don't know how I can explain this to you, but it's not only against the law, its wrong!  It's not a nice thing to do. People wouldn't understand.  He wouldn't understand.  What I mean is, well, this is developing into a very bad habit!\" ... all while hunched over and gesticulating.  This is a loud movie, with one brother believing he's Teddy Roosevelt yelling 'Charge!' as he runs up the stairs and slams his bedroom door repeatedly, characters rapidly entering scenes in a pell-mell confusion of trying to hide bodies, threaten each other, commit others to mental institutions, etc etc. It's also all over the map.  \n\nAt first I thought Capra may have threaded the needle and been able to deliver both a dark comedy and a drama, since Raymond Massey's glowering and Peter Lorre's simpering are quite sinister, and a nice counterpart to Cary Grant and the sweet old ladies played so wonderfully by Josephine Hull and Jean Adair.  However, the movie dragged on, and was far too long at 118 minutes.  Some may like the madcap frenzy Capra created based on the stage play, and I have to say there are some nice moments and lines (\"Insanity runs in my family.  It practically gallops.\"), but overall the movie gets to be a little much, and doesn't stand the test of time, at least for me.",

Now, I've liked screwball comedies before, in fact, Howard Hawks' His Girl Friday is one of my favorite movies from this period, but Arsenic and Old Lace just didn't do much for me.  I'm giving it a 6 because I can't totally dismiss a film that has this much energy and with the inclusion of Peter Lorre and a Frankenstein look-a-like, nor can I deny the immense charm of actor Cary Grant.  However, if I were being honest about how I personally felt watching the movie: I'd probably give it a 5.",

Premise is darkly awesome, but the film (apart from a few creepy scenes of Massey parodying Karloff, and early Peter Lorre) is pure screwball frantic. Some won't like seeing Grant in his panicky \"Bringing Up Baby\" style (as opposed to his more famed debonair grace), but I love the manic, wide-eyed energy he has here. Acting honours belong to Josephine Hull though, as sweet, murderous Aunt Abby, she's a riot and John Alexander as \"Teddy Roosevelt\". Stagey, dated, fun. \"Insanity runs in my family. It practically gallops.\"",

It also starred Grant in the lead role, as well as having a comparable style of haphazard black comedy. Yet this film had much more sinister themes with the bizarre story line of the serial killing elderly aunts, and perhaps more bizarre, the brother Jonathan and his sidekick. The film doesn't drag on, with the plot thickening with a new revelation every few minutes. It could be considered slightly unique in the fact that it is almost entirely set in one room. Although I'm sure there are many others, the only other occurrence of this that springs to mind is 12 Angry Men, and this clearly comes about because it is a play adaption. I gave this 84 out of 100 (4 stars here).\r\n\r\nhttp://toptwofifty.wordpress.com",
