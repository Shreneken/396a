Even for Buster Keaton, this is a tremendous display of comedic and fantasy material.  What's so remarkable is not so much any particularly hilarious gag or gags, as the never-ending stream of amazing and entertaining sights - coming faster and faster as the film proceeds - that seem so off-hand and effortlessly inventive, but that must have involved many hours of painstaking work to perfect.  The film vs. reality theme is also highly suggestive, and makes this great movie one of the most completely satisfying efforts by Keaton or anyone else.The film opens slowly and allows the pace to build gradually.  Buster operates the movie projector at a theater, while trying to study on his own to be a detective.  He is involved in a real-life mystery that involves his girlfriend's family, and which turns out badly for him.  He retreats into the fantasy world of a picture showing at his theater, and from then on you just have to see it to appreciate it.  The creative comedy, the technical skill, and the subtly expressed themes are all remarkable.This is a great experience not to be missed.", "review_date": "2001-07-19", "lang": "en", "source": "imdb"}, {"review_title": "Through the Movie Screen", "content": "Buster Keaton's most surreal movie sprang from his insistence on logic and realism. His tribute to cinema was inspired by stage magic tricks he remembered from his vaudeville career. His most dazzling and original movie is also one of his least formally perfect. All these paradoxes belong naturally to this \"through the looking glass\" work, which examines the dream-like nature of film\u0097or is it the film-like nature of dreams? As Buster told it, the origin of the film lay in his desire to use certain illusionary stunts, like the bewildering dive through a living assistant's stomach, which he had learned the secret of as a child. But he firmly believed that impossible or \"cartoon\" gags were not acceptable in feature films, so he could only include them by making them occur in a dream, which is also a film-within-a-film. This is odd, when you think about it, since what he seems to be saying is that impossible things can happen in a film\u0097but this was the very rule he himself refused to break. By creating an outer film that is \"real\" and an inner film that is \"not real,\" Keaton shows that, while film enables illusions and distortions of reality, the filmmaker has a choice\u0097and a responsibility\u0097to clearly delineate fact from fantasy. In one scene, Keaton uses a camera trick (dissolving a wall) to prove that he's NOT using a camera trick when he dives through a window and comes out disguised as an old woman. Because he was analytical, mechanically-minded, and a stickler for authenticity, Keaton took pleasure in revealing the processes of magic tricks, and camera tricks, rather than using them to fool the audience.Buster plays a hapless cinema projectionist who yearns to be a detective, but is so clueless that his romantic rival manages to frame him for stealing his girlfriend's father's watch. In a dream, he enters the film he's projecting and becomes a great detective who solves a similar crime. While Buster's on-screen character is a schlemiel who can only achieve mastery in his celluloid fantasies, as a director Keaton's grasp of the mechanics of film-making enabled him to control the camera and its imagery as thoroughly and gracefully as he controlled his acrobatic body. SHERLOCK JR. is the most technically advanced film he ever made, including special effects (as when Buster steps through the screen and gets edited from park bench to street to mountain-top to lion's den) that can still leave audiences wondering, \"How in hell did he do that?\" It's often said that Keaton's films inspire gasps rather than laughs. Well, I just saw SHERLOCK JR. with an audience last night, and the laughter was loud and regular as fireworks on the Fourth of July. But it's a particular kind of laughter: surprised, amazed, incredulous laughter.The first half of the movie takes place in the \"real\" world; it begins with some nice small-scale gags involving Buster's attempts to scrounge up money to buy candy for his girl, and his adorably awkward visit to her house. After he has been thrown out due to his rival's machinations, Buster \"shadows\" the man (literally, copying his every motion exactly), but is tricked again and trapped in a freight train. There's a beautiful shot where he runs along the top of the train, staying in the same spot on the screen while the cars zoom by under him in the opposite direction; but I can't watch the stunt where he rides a water-spout down to the tracks without wincing, knowing he fractured his neck doing it.The beginning of the dream sequence is one of the greatest self-reflexive scenes in the history of film, as Buster's ghostly double rises from his sleeping body, picks up his ghostly hat, marches down into the theater and steps into the screen. Haven't we all wanted to do this at some time? Once over his turbulent introduction to the medium, Buster becomes the elegant Sherlock, Jr., investigating a theft of pearls from a mansion. In a marvelous game of billiards, Buster smoothly plays around an exploding 13 ball; he escapes from the thieves' den with one of the neatest tricks you'll ever see; he rides through busy streets on the handlebars of a motorcycle that no one is driving; and he goes for a romantic sail in a floating car. All this is packed into a mere 45 minutes.Significantly cut after poor previews, SHERLOCK JR. has more in common with Keaton's short films than his features. Because of the fractured story-line, it doesn't have the narrative coherence or trajectory of character development that most of Keaton's great features do. His performance is split between the shy, inept projectionist and the suave, infallible detective. He is totally convincing in both roles. When he wakes from his dream, the projectionist finds that all is well: the girl has solved the mystery and come to apologize. He is still timid as ever, so for a romantic denouement he looks to the screen: peeking out of his booth, he copies the actions of the movie hero wooing his leading lady. This is Keaton's most trenchant bit of social satire: whose ideas of kissing and love-making haven't been influenced by what they see at the movies?", "review_date": "2006-09-13", "lang": "en", "source": "imdb"}, {"review_title": "Anything but Elementary...", "content": "You can only marvel at the craft of Buster Keaton.

There are lost dollar bills, things sticking to other things, something stolen, mistaken identities. Our heroine is introduced in a charming scene where they seem terrified to hold hands. Her father is played by Buster's father Joe Keaton, who would appear in many of his son's films.There's a mustachioed cad with slick hair and a sharp suit who is after the girl, a cartoon baddie who the audience instinctively knows deserves a hiss and not a cheer.It is in Junior's other job as a cinema projectionist that the film comes alive. We are watching the film he has set up and then, suddenly, he is part of the action. In a sequence of great inventiveness, we see the film within a film changing scenes and watch with delight as the character adapts to each situation and surrounding.Sherlock Jr is very funny but is also unusual and, in comparison with other comedies of the period, ahead of its time. It includes some excellent stunts that are the equal of anything done by Harold Lloyd in the same period, and, although it has a very short running time, manages to develop a good storyline throughout.Justly feted as a masterpiece of silent comedy, Sherlock Jr represented one of the peaks of Buster Keaton's cinematic career.

The story itself, about a film projectionist who desires to become part of the movies, and then does, by walking right onto the screen, made palpable the desire that we all have to be in the movies: To get the girl, to be an action hero, to outsmart the bad guys.

It's not just the dream-story and the surreality, it's what Keaton does with it and the importance he places on cinema. This film is even rather unique in using montage in a new way, or showing how much film appeals to the imagination as much as an artistic endeavor.Thus, this film itself becomes both wildly imaginative and brilliantly artistic... and best of all, it's FUNNY! Thus, it becomes a film for everyone. There's no hard-found artistic conceit that leads to cries of \"Pretentious!\", but still people can say \"It's amazing.\" There's no comedic conceit that says, \"Bah, just simple slapstick, it's low-culture!\" because it's rather intelligently done.

There ought to be a lot of things, I guess. But anyone who thinks that silent film is nothing more than a crude and unskilled ancestor of today's motion picture need only spend some time on these great comedies to realize that, in this genre at least, the peak was reached in the 20s. Yes, there are funny movies with dialogue, but the humor is generally IN the dialogue...nobody--not the Marx Brothers, or W.C. Fields, or Abbot and Costello or the Three Stooges and nobody since--has achieved the sublime mastery of physical comedy these geniuses did. And the best of them all for pure comedy, to my mind, is Keaton. And the best of his movies is Sherlock, Jr. The dream sequence in which he becomes an actor in the film he's projecting is astonishing; the way in which this movie is a sort of window into a different and appealing age is charming--and the ending of this movie takes the breath away. Keaton made some of the great endings in film, I think. Check out \"College\" some time--just for the last minute or so.

That's the collection of techniques that map some awareness or identification of what the film is, to the story within the film. It isn't just a simple game, but a complex system of juggling representations and reality. It is not unique to film of course -- it has a long literary tradition. But it is one of the few things that characterize film as an agent of our imagination. I have built a database of hundreds of wonderful examples of folded films.It all starts here. Even today, the medium is still young and quickly evolving. But when this was made, film was still indistinct from its siblings: theater and still photography. Griffith had hampered the evolution by introducing one feature (societal scope -- unachievable on stage) by freezing another (ALL of the other conventions of stage).Keaton's notion of a film within a film seems ordinary today. Today, we don't even blink at one of the effects in this film: Keaton (in his film-within persona) is planning an elaborate getaway through a window in a cabin. To see this getaway, you need to see the inside and outside. Since this is explicitly a movie, we see the cabin the way it was built for a movie: with one side missing. Is is, in effect a film within a film within a film. This now common notion all starts here, it seems.Ted's Evaluation -- 4 of 3: Every cineliterate person should experience this", "review_date": "2003-08-12", "lang": "en", "source": "imdb"}, {"review_title": "Footage of laughter, romance and technical audaciousness", "content": "Am somebody who likes humour with wit and sophistication when it comes to comedy (that's why so many pre-1970 comedy appeals a lot to me), while appreciating comedies with a broader style providing it doesn't become too vulgar and the risque kind. Have found though that in recent years that there has been those that are very juvenile, crude and even puerile to the point of offensiveness, which is as one may have guessed appeals to me far less.There are many fine examples of silent film comedy, with Charlie Chaplin and Laurel and Hardy though in both cases it wasn't the case of finding their feet immediately. In both cases the early stuff was fairly hit and miss, but when they did settle their best work was classic. And of course Buster Keaton, who didn't transition as well or smoothly into the sound era (whereas Chaplin made some of his best work in it) but when he was in his prime there was nobody back then, when it came to comedy, more daring in terms of the jaw-dropping stunt-work, or who was able to make deadpan funny and expressive, and actually it is still like that now. Keaton wasn't nicknamed \"The Great Stone Face\" for nothing, and in my mind he was every bit as funny and easy to like as Chaplin and Laurel and Hardy, while also being a bigger risk taker, having bolder material physically and his films being technically in his prime period superior. The reasons for the comparisons being because they were all geniuses in comedy, who started their careers around the same time, a lot of the comedy was physical rather than verbal and their prime periods were in roughly the same time period.'Sherlock Jr' is another one of Keaton's finest, an achievement in pretty much every way. On a technical level, it is one of his most audacious and best-looking along with the slightly more ground-breaking on this front 'The General'. Again, it is beautifully shot and designed and the effects and how they're used stand out, it should be used as an example of how to have effects that still look good and like a lot of effort and care went into them and also use them properly, rather than overusing and abusing them to gratuitous effect with varied at best success as seen frequently now. Films today should learn from this film and the best of Keaton, they really are an example to all in many senses. The direction keeps things moving with control, progressing gradually and always assuredly, and balances everything beautifully.When it comes to the humour, 'Sherlock Jr' is one of Keaton's funniest and most inventive, chockful of hilarious moments timed to absolute perfection. While none of the stunts are quite on the same level of awe-inspiring as for example the climax of 'Steamboat Bill, Jr', they are still incredibly daring. Also found myself surprisingly educated, which makes this film one of Keaton's more interesting films, in learning the trade tricks in editing and effects and some of the most genius use of back projection (often done cheaply and obviously, but inventively done here).Like 'The General' and 'Steamboat Bill, Jr' it is really great to have a story with brains, heart and logic, treating the audience with respect and there is never any trouble following it. In terms of structure it stands out too when it comes to the story elements in Keaton's films and is one of the most interesting. The romantic element that features heavily here is done with more charm and pathos than most comedy when balanced with romance, without being too sentimental or soap-operatic, never does it slow the film down either. As to be expected, Keaton as to be expected is superb here, not only is his comic timing on point but he once again provides a character that's endearing and worth rooting for. His physicality and how he copes with the stunts is awe-inspiring and he is one of not many to make deadpan interesting and entertaining because he still makes it very expressive and nuanced. Don't overlook the rest of the cast though, they may not have as much to do but they are also amusing and charming.In summary, one of the Keaton essentials. 10/10", "review_date": "2019-03-09", "lang": "en", "source": "imdb"}, {"review_title": "Fantastic filmmaking from one of the world's greatest", "content": "Sherlock, Jr. arguably exceeds The General as Buster Keaton's greatest achievement -- it is certainly more magical in its use of extraordinary special effects and unconventionally humorous situations.

He is sending for the world's greatest detective - Sherlock Jr.!\"After watching several of Chaplin's classic films, I decided it was time to give Buster Keaton an opportunity beginning with one of his most revered movies, Sherlock Jr. Keaton and Chaplin dominated the silent movie era, but most people are divisive as to who was the most talented actor-director of that time. So far I'm on Chaplin's side although I still have to give Keaton another shot with The General. Perhaps the problem I had with Sherlock Jr. is that I'm not a big fan of surreal films. I know everyone seems to love this genre, but there are very few surreal movies that work for me. I can see how Buster Keaton garners recognition for his magical work in this film, being one of the first to actually incorporate dream sequences into his movie. Many other films (and especially cartoons) were inspired from several scenes in Sherlock Jr, like the one in which Keaton's character jumps into a movie screen and becomes a character in the movie that is being projected (better known as \"the movie within a movie\" sequence). There are several action scenes including some spectacular chases that make you wonder how Keaton could have shot them way back in 1924. I was more impressed with this wizard like aspect of Keaton than on his comedic performance. His deadpan expressions were outdone by the gadgets he devised to create such advanced special effects. Despite being bored by the story, I have to give Keaton credit for his inventive and magical sequences. At the beginning of this silent film, written by Jean Havez, Joseph Mitchell, and Clyde Bruckman the title card reads: \"There is an old proverb which says: Don't try to do two things at once and expect to do justice to both. This is the story of a boy who tried it. While employed as a moving picture operator in a small town theater he was also studying to be a detective.\" We are then introduced to the projectionist (Buster Keaton) who is reading a detective book instead of cleaning up the theater. After work, he goes to visit his girl (Kathryn McGuire) and buys her a ring. Another man (played by Ward Crane), who is also fighting for the girl's affection happens to be at the house and steals her father's chain watch and incriminates the projectionist. The girl's father (Joe Keaton) kicks him out of his home and tells him never to return again. The projectionist sadly returns to work where he falls asleep and dreams of being a detective in the film that is being projected. In his dreams, he becomes the hero of the film and the adventure begins.Buster Keaton's film has some brilliant and magical sequences, and I think it is a bit unfair to compare him with Chaplin because he has a very different style. Chaplin has a more humane approach, writes his own stories and composes them as well, while Keaton does some impressive work behind the lens using some trickery. As performers they both have different styles, Chaplin uses a lot of physical comedy while Keaton uses deadpan humor and incorporates a lot of action scenes doing some risky stunts (in the train sequence he actually fractured his neck). Depending on which style you like best, you will probably claim Keaton or Chaplin is better, but it would be unfair to say one is less talented than the other because they both proved to be geniuses during the silent era and have left us with a rich legacy. I can see sparks of both in contemporary film making.

We watch a sequence that maybe is not necessary for the overall story but what is a completely entertaining watch as the scenery changes in the movie he is in.

This isn't just to say in the stunts that he executes- sometimes, apparently, to great physical and personal risk- are at big comic peril, but that he's fearless with what he wants to try as a filmmaker and scenarist. Jokes that I thought would never really be fresh are taken in 1924 in ways I didn't think could be funny, but are. Take a small bit where Keaton's character (one of them, anyway) plans to sabotage a nefarious guy with a slip on the banana peel. For a moment this is groan-inducing, but watching how it's executed it becomes something really, really gut-busting. There are little bits like that, and then those huge scenes of choreographed mayhem: a blast by water after hanging off of a moving train, a chase through a town that includes a sudden chance of a road connected, jumps through small holes and windows at the nick of time that are half pure Keaton and half exciting editing.And then Keaton himself, usually a little guy looking shy and quiet and a dreamer in the greatest cinematic sense (this was one of the first, if not the first, films to have a character go into a movie-world right through the screen), and he's always incredibly subtle but not ever lacking appropriate comic timing. And in Sherlock Jr he operates wonderfully on two wavelengths: one is as the character just trying to hold the girl's hand on the couch without much embarrassment, and the other is as the title character, going up in peculiar fashion up to everyone in the room (as is one of the listed things \"to do\" as a detective) and suave with things like an explosive 13 ball on the pool table. Keaton is, as Ebert noticed, the one little guy wandering around in the chaos. Only this time, in such a short running time for a feature (it's just a few minutes short of being a short film), Keaton crams as much as he can to perfect effect.Sherlock Jr should be seen by just about anyone looking for a great example of pure silent-comedy hijinks and stunt work; what Jackie Chan might be for martial arts Buster Keaton is to a crazy pratfall, and you often can't entirely believe it's the guy on screen doing what's being done. And it's also, alongside Steamboat Bill Jr and The General, examples of how Keaton could be an exemplary filmmaker, someone who took film technique and shook it up just a bit (if, admittedly, more-so than Chaplin as just director if not quite as a star), while sticking faithfully to comedy and heart-tugging moments. And if you're tuned into the mania and well-oiled machine of the stunt sequences and classic chase climax it's as pleasurable as anything in comedy history, nevermind just silent film.

Finally, Keaton gives her a cheap engagement ring. Keaton is a mere movie projectionist, who dreams of becoming a detective in the class of Sherlock Holmes........I thought the $1.00 bill caper was cute, if unrealistic. Keaton wants to buy a $3. box of candy for his girl, but he only has $2. Luckily, he finds a $1 bill in his sweepings, also being the theater janitor. Unluckily, a women comes, complaining she lost a $1 bill in the theater, and he gives it to her. Then, another woman shows up claiming she also lost a $1 bill in the theater. Keston gives her his $1 bill. Then a mean-looking man shows up wanting to look through his sweepings. Keaton hands him his last $1. bill, but he refuses. Looking through the trash, he spies a wallet with some greenbacks in it, and goes off with it. Keaton then spreads the trash out, looking for another wallet. But, of course, he doesn't find such. Thus, he goes to the store, and buys the $1. box of candy. However, he converts the $1. price tag into a $4, to impress his girl. But, this deception will return to haunt him........While Keaton is talking to his girl, his competitor(villain) , in the form of Ward Crane, arrives, in a splendid outfit, and bringing a bigger box of candy, as well as a more impressive engagement ring. Keaton is relegated to the hall. Soon, the girl's father reports that his gold watch is missing. The Villain slips the receipt for the watch he hocked at the pawn shop into Keaton's jacket pocket. Then, Keaton says he will act as a detective, and search every one. The Villain requests him to also search himself, and he finds the pawn receipt, which says $4 for the watch., which matches the $4 price tag on the candy box. Keaton is requested by the girl's father to leave and never return. ........Still imagining himself to be a detective, Keaton shadows The Villain, as the most likely suspect, in his mind. Eventually, he winds up in a boxcar, locked in by The Villain. Luckily, there is a hatch in thr roof. Just then, the train pulls out of the station. Keaton runs along the top of the cars to keep him near the water tower. When he runs out of cars, he jumps onto the tower dispenser, which lowers and begins to release water, which practically drowns Keaton(Keaton suffered a serious neck injury in this event.) . He then runs back to his projectionist job, where he soon dozes off.......Meanwhile, his girl goes to the pawn shop with the receipt and asks the pawnbroker what the man who traded the watch looked like. He was tall and had a black moustache, which fit the description of The Villain, but not Keaton. She was satisfied that Keaton was telling the truth that he knew nothing about the watch pawning........Some reviewers say they are confused which events take place in his upcoming dream, and which really happened. According to my notes, the dream begins about the 20min. mark and lasts until the 41min. mark, just a few minutes before the ending. Among other things, Keaton dreams he walks into the movie sceen and interacts a bit with the actors. Then, he is thrust into various odd or dangerous situations, in which his pose at the end of one situation carries over to the beginning of the next situation. ......He dreams that the Villain steals a pearl necklace from his girl's mother. He takes this to a shack where his confederate thieves hideout. Keaton shows up at the hideout. Initially, captured, he breaks loose, and grabs the pearls The Villain is dangling before him, and runs.........The next gag has Keaton cornered in an alley by several of the gang. He jumps into the belly of a tie salesman, standing behind him and disappears. The gang finally find him hiding behind a rotating section of the wood fence behind. He runs, and the gang chases him. A cop on a motorcycle appears and invites him to ride on his handlebars. Soon, the cop is bumped off, without Keaton knowing it, and the cycle negotiates around various obstacles without Keaton's help, until it comes to the shack where Keaton's girl is being held, where it rockets him into the shack, he hitting the guard. Soon, the gang arrives in a car. They trick the gang, and take their car, which ends up in a lake: just the top part, which sails a ways before sinking. Keaton wakes up, and his girl arrives to tell him she believes him innocent of stealing the watch.. The movie on the screen is about to end, with the man hugging and kissing the woman.

Being in the movie gave the former vaudeville actor the opportunity to insert a variety of tricks he performed on the stage years earlier. His writers scripted a plot where his girlfriend's father has his watch stolen, and Buster's love rival frames him. As an aspiring detective, the film projectionist dreams of being the hero of the movie he jumps into. Perfecting each stunt required an inordinate amount of preparation time, so much so it took four months to film, double the normal Keaton production.\"Sherlock Jr.\" offers so many tricks and special effects that it has been studied for decades after its release. Buster jumps into the mid-section of his assistant selling ties to escape villains chasing him. In a jaw-dropping stunt, he dives through a window where he's prepared an old lady's clothes contained in a circular container. An additional film-within-the-film sequence has Buster hurdle from one scene to another, all aligned with the help of a surveyor's instrument to create a seamless jump cut.In one stunt Buster injured himself hanging from a train water chute, only to have the water cascade on him as he fell to the ground. He suffered from migraine headaches for years afterwards. A doctor discovered 10 years later that one of his neck vertebra had been broken from the compression of the tons of water hitting him. But at the time the injury didn't stop Buster from performing other physical stunts, including the motorcycle scene where, as he was riding on a policeman bike's handlebars, the officer fell off. A short time later, Keaton lost his balance, hurdling into the two cameramen recording the scene.To help his friend who introduced him to cinema, Buster hired Roscoe Arbuckle to direct \"Sherlock Jr,\" going under a pseudonym after Fatty had been tried three times and acquitted for a rape and murder charge. Initially things went well, until Keaton tried to correct a mistake Arbuckle made. From then on the former director was abrasive towards Keaton and crew, a marked change in his personality before the case, many claimed. Keaton was sketching a movie well in the future and asked Fatty to spend all his time on that, just to get him off the set.Remarkably, \"Sherlock Jr.\" wasn't the the box-office success he had hoped for, making slightly less than his previous film, \"Three Ages.\" It has proved over the long run, however, to be regarded as one of Keaton's most critically-acclaimed film he ever produced. Time Magazine named it one of its All-Time 100 Best Movies. \"In an age when most comedies are all windup and no punch,\" wrote Time, \"this is the most treasurable of virtues.\" The Motion Pictures Editors Guild ranks it #61 best edited film ever made. A British monthly magazine polled it as the 59th greatest film to be shown on screen. The American Film Institute lists \"Sherlock Jr.\" as the 62nd funniest movie in its 100 Years...100 Laughs listing. And it's one of the '1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die.'Woody Allen adapted Keaton's jump into the theater's screen as the catalyst for his 1985 'The Purple Rose of Cairo.' The stunt Buster used showing his car stop suddenly on the shore of a lake, only to have the vehicle's top half slide into the water as a boat, is updated in the 1987 James Bond film 'The Living Daylights.'", "review_date": "2022-01-11", "lang": "en", "source": "imdb"}, {"review_title": "These jokes stand up 85 plus years later...despite it's age, this is a timeless comedy.", "content": "Director and star of this film Buster Keaton really knew how to get a laugh. This guy's physical jokes were really great, and instead of going for stupid over the top acting, he actually gives a fairly straight performance, relying on the wackiness and humor of the situation to provide his laughs. And despite being a black and white silent film, this thing still stands up today, and it's still genuinely funny!A movie theater projectionist (Buster Keaton) is accused of pawning his girlfriend's father's watch, when in fact it was another one of her suitors who actually pawned it. The projectionist has been reading a book on being a detective, so he tries to solve the case of the missing watch. Along the way he ends up back at work and has a dream relating to his plight.A lot of old movies, including many of those from Charlie Chaplin, were really just a succession of gags with no real plot, but instead just a common theme throughout. This is not the case with this one. Despite a complete 180 turn for the long dream sequence, it plays out well as part of the movie, and actually might include some of the funniest parts of the movie.The acting in this movie is really great! The 1920s, and way onward were known for over the top acting, but the acting here is just perfect. The facial expressions from Buster Keaton are often hysterical, and the other actors hold their own well, especially the evil butler in the dream, who really has physical comedy and facial expressions down pat.There are so many crazy gags in this movie, which makes it even more amazing that it was filmed in the 20s. We have a guy riding on the handles of a motorcycle with no one driving it, and he's on there for a good five minutes! We have the top of a car popping off and flying into water as a boat. There's a guy walking into a movie screen, and perhaps the first channel changing but staying in the same place gag. One of the funniest jokes is the very last joke which produces on of the biggest laughs, and is a perfect way to end the movie.For a movie 80 plus years old, this is still a hilarious and endearing film, with special effects that are great for their time, and stellar acting/directing from Buster Keaton.

He has dreams of becoming a detective and avidly reads up on the subject.

Having been subjected to various dodgy projections and mediocre musical accompaniments, I was beginning to harbour a secret, guilty fear that maybe Keaton's comedy, so skilled at taking an unsuspecting audience by surprise, might be lacking in replay value; having had a couple of disappointing experiences with films I'd originally reckoned to be among his second rank, I was getting a little paranoid at the prospect of re-viewing the ones I'd enjoyed the most in the first place.But I needn't have worried. Take a good print, a superlative accompanist and an audience fizzing with festive excitement, and \"Sherlock Jr\" will replicate the same transports of glee and delight as it inspired when it dropped from on high upon my uninitiated head...The film is a story of the impossible, from the moment that dream-Buster taps his sleeping counterpart urgently on the shoulder, and, failing to wake him, unhooks a dream-hat from the wall and sets out to leap into action himself. For a full-blown feature film, it is exceptionally short. And yet in editing it down, Keaton has crammed together such a kaleidoscope of events that the audience is left with no sense of being either cheated or short-changed: in the course of its five reels, and perhaps due to that very breakneck turn of speed, the viewer is infused with the impression of a whole evening's worth of entertainment. It certainly doesn't come across as lacking in length.That said, my own favourites, I confess, lie among Keaton's comedies of character rather than those of stunts; \"Sherlock Jr\" is a little arbitrary in its attempts to include a good gag by all means possible. When Buster finds himself in the middle of a quick-cut sequence that whisks him from ocean to jungle to desert in the blink of an eye -- only to dump him back in the self-same garden in which he began -- I can't help being aware that there is no reason whatsoever for the film \"Hearts and Pearls\" to contain such a bizarre set of landscapes and cut between them with no characters in sight: for me, the joke loses by the somewhat forced air. Normally, when films contain a dream sequence this reflects back in some manner upon the framing action, providing insights for the dreamer or clues to advance subsequent events -- but again, in \"Sherlock Jr\", in retrospect the dream turns out to have been a disappointingly self-contained device, with no effect at all upon the main 'plot', which simply proceeds in the protagonist's absence: it's an insert just for laughs. (And am I the only viewer cursed with an imagination so literal as to wonder how \"Hearts and Pearls\" can successfully reach its final reel without the projectionist once waking up to switch between the two projectors?) In his later work, Keaton's films would rely less on the fantastic, becoming more integrated.But as ever the delight lies in the detail. In the expressions in the reaction shots -- often, but not always, Keaton's own. In his oh-so-earnest attempt to ensure that the girl gets her chocolates with the price tag discreetly upwards, and his suggestion that her ring might appear more impressive when aided by his magnifying-glass. His instant mimicry of his quarry's every move, extending without even missing a stride to an imitative puff on the antagonist's discarded cigar-butt. The characteristic close-up revealing the car's 'four-wheel braking' in the moment before events force him to brake so fiercely that the chassis continues blithely on its way: Keaton's gags come complete with rationale, and are all the funnier for it. Edited, every shot serves its purpose -- this is essence of comedy, with nothing wasted.Ward Crane and Erwin Connelly make a fine double act as the villainous conspirators, in a send-up of melodrama's conventions. And Keaton himself, as always, is a joy to watch, whether endearingly unsure in his approach to courtship or masterfully suave within his dreams. As an actor he is taken more or less for granted -- but every line of his sturdy small body, every expressive shift in that eloquent face serves to tell the story: not only can you understand every word he's saying, but you can see everything he's thinking into the bargain! As a gifted stuntman or gag-writer alone he would have been memorable; but he was far more than that.The famous set-piece scenes have been praised elsewhere, and those I recalled. But I'll conclude with the little snippets that caught me by surprise all over again into laughter and admiration: the twist on the tired old 'sticky paper on my foot' routine, his little joyous skip up the steps to his sweetheart's house, and the way that the motorbike, miraculously steady, suddenly starts to veer as the character realises that no-one was in control...Rest in peace, Buster.

At the house of his girlfriend, he gives her a tiny ring (along with a magnifying glass) and the small box of chocolates. Then his rival \u2013 a cad with a mustache \u2013 intrudes and cunningly steals a watch from the girl's father's jacket. He goes to the local pawnshop and uses the funds to buy Buster's girl a four-dollar chocolate box. Back at the girl's house, he sneakily slips the pawnshop receipt into Buster's jacket pocket. When the father discovers his missing watch and later the pawnshop receipt in Buster's pocket, he kicks Buster out of his house. Buster, though, shadows his dastardly man real closely until he is discovered and tricked by his adversary. Now we have one of the all-time classic movie scenes. Buster \u2013 without a stunt double \u2013 runs along the tops of moving train boxcars. He leaps and grabs the release cord of a large water tank spout, gets soaked, rides the water stream down to the ground, and runs away. Years later he learned that he had sustained a fracture of one of his neck bones. No wonder he had headaches! Meanwhile, his girl did her own detective work and discovered the real thief. Failing as a detective, Buster is back to his old job as a projectionist. While he is showing the movie, \"Hearts and Pearls,\" Buster falls asleep. His dream takes him in a surreal way into the film; note how he enters the screen. Then, as each movie scenes change, his situations become appropriately precarious. In the theater movie, a cad (same one as the fellow who stole the watch) at a mansion steals a string of pearls and passes them to the butler to conceal. Then it is announced that the world's greatest detective \u2013 Sherlock Jr. \u2013 is assigned to find the pearls. The suave and confident Sherlock Jr. is Hearts and Pearls' alter ego of Buster. All the attempts by the cad and butler to do away with Sherlock fail. (The exploding number 13 pool-ball scene is hilarious.) Before long Sherlock is captured by the cad's gang, setting up several classic Keaton scenes. Of course there is the obligatory road chase. See the motorcyclist jump over the split bridges with the large gap covered only by two box trucks. What skill! Meanwhile, back at the mansion, the butler kidnaps the mansion housekeeper (who looks like his \"real-life\" girl). Sherlock, though, after eluding and then defeating the gang, also rescues the housekeeper from the butler in the process. He awakens from his dream. In the operation's room of the theater Buster's girl catches up with him to say that he is in the clear. Awkward Buster emulates his screen hero to gain pointers at the movie's end. There are rings and kisses with both the theater's movie feature and Buster's \"real life\" situation. Then the next movie-in-a movie setting is fast-forwarded and shows twins of screen Sherlock and the heroine. Buster scratches his head. How will he replicate that situation in real life? The End.Buster Keaton may not have known the definition of surrealism, but \"Sherlock Jr.\" articulates it well. His genius and skills are irrefutable, as the man is a screen legend. Roger Ebert once wrote that he was the most courageous of the silent screen clowns, especially because of his \"grace under pressure,\" one able to combine comedy and extraordinary physical feats. You can see them here. There is no need to go into all of his other attributes, as you know what they are just by watching his performances.

It is a sequence that could never be duplicated in the modern era. Buster plays a theater projectionist with dreams of becoming a master sleuth. When he loses his girl to \"The Local Sheik\" Buster retreats to a dream world where he literally steps into the movie he is screening and becomes the \"world's greatest detective\". As \"Sherlock Jr.\" he dodges exploding billiards, falling blades and poisoned drinks, finally ending up on the motorcycle in what has to be Keaton's best and most unbelievable stunt. As Buster runs down a street he encounters a cop on a motorcycle. The cop threatens to write him a speeding ticket and Buster solicits his help. Jumping on the handlebars they speed along. Why is he running? It doesn't matter. The chase is central to most of Keaton's films. The bike goes over a bump and the cop is bounced, leaving Buster on his own but unaware no one is driving! Attempting to understand how Keaton filmed this sequence is confounding. There are shots in which we can assume he is in control and driving (Keaton's coattails hide his position at one point). There are other shots when the bike is obviously on a truck (a wonderful shot shows Buster racing a train to a crossing). There are still other shots that seem impossible or at least extremely dangerous (Buster speeds along a road as ditch diggers fling dirt in his face). Years later, after an accident, x-rays of his neck revealed spinal fractures that may have been caused by the spills he took shooting this picture.

The videotape version by Kino Films, frankly, sucks. This isn't a word I have often used in describing any film, but it really irritated me that the musical accompaniment on the tape was so bad and so inappropriate. Modern instruments are used and the tempo is way too fast for the film. It was a major distraction--so bad that I had to turn off the sound after a while so I could enjoy the film!

The detective aspect of the film at the beginning didn't work all that well compared to the rest of the film, though a few times it did offer some laughs (such as when the book recommended trailing the suspect--Buster walked only about a foot behind him and followed him move for move!). Instead, what really worked well was when he was the projectionist and fell asleep. Then a surreal dream sequence began and was very creative (and highly reminiscent of Woody Allen's PURPLE ROSE OF CAIRO). Buster walked to the movie screen and literally walked into the film!

See, while the most entertaining aspects of 'Sherlock Jr. (1927)' are, indeed, found within this, frankly, loosely-connected segment, it's the bookending 'real-world' sections that hold all the real narrative weight, as limited as it may be. Without these parts, the picture probably wouldn't be as good because it wouldn't get you connected to its almost instantly likeable protagonist and you wouldn't really have a nicely set-up - though, admittedly, poorly paid-off - conflict to be concerned with. Of course, there is an argument to be made that the affair could have been set entirely within the dream, thereby being a more wholistic film with the conceit that Keaton really is the world's greatest detective. Nevertheless, what we have is a fantastically fun, effortlessly endearing silent action-comedy that moves at a break-neck pace (literally) and is stuffed with more blink-and-you'll-miss-them stunts and special (practical) effects than you can shake a stick at. Seriously, some of the stuff here is almost certifiably insane and Keaton shows it all off so casually, to the point where it just seems... well, easy, I guess. It most certainly isn't. The amount of practice, acrobatic skill, technical knowledge, teamwork, ingenuity and just sheer daring needed to pull even the simplest of this stuff off is nothing short of staggering. You're often on the edge of your seat just watching the shot, hoping Keaton will be okay. In this way, the excitement isn't overly 'manufactured' - though, it obviously is to a degree. The gags aren't just impressive and nerve-racking, though, they're also often funny - whether it's because of their joke-like structure or just because of their straight-up originality. You'll often laugh at the simplest of things, which is a testament to the brilliant physical acting on display. The flick, which plays out like one of Keaton's more traditional shorts (for the better), also moves quickly enough that its story doesn't wear thin, even if it threatens to, and you'll never be even close to bored.

Keaton and his gagmen created bits that I could never imagine; how do you create a scene with a lost dollar bill in a trash pile? How about an exploding pool ball? That scene with the pool table just baffled me. How did he keep from hitting the 13 ball? Did he just glue it in place? Since Keaton plays a projectionist, we get to see the inside of a 1920s movie theater, complete with the little orchestra pit. There's also the climactic bit with Keaton riding on the handlebars of a motorcycle, not knowing that the driver is long gone. After many thrilling stunts (an exploded log, an elevated train track bridged by two trucks, a tug-of-war that goes awry), Keaton finally turns around and finds that he really is driving by the seat of his pants. The finale is a real kicker. And let's not forget the scene where Keaton hangs off the tube connected to the water basin as the water pours out and washes him onto the track (Keaton fractured his neck doing this stunt). Gives new meaning to the warning \"Don't try this at home.\" I've found that Keaton's trademark stone-faced expression really does work for the comedy, as we in the audience can just fill in whatever reaction works in our own minds. I'd also like to give props to the movie's soundtrack on the DVD which, according to the credits, was recorded in 1993. It sounds very jazzy and modern.KEVIN: Sherlock, Jr. was AWESOME!!! It's only our second Buster Keaton film and already one of his best. All the gags in this film are top notch. I still don't know how he did some of that stuff, like the stunt where he dives through the suitcase and disappears. Lots of little pointless special effects going on too, like at the beginning of the dream sequence when he walks into the movie and the scenery keeps changing on him. My favorite gag is the bit on the bicycle, when he finally notices that his partner has fallen off and we see something almost (but not quite) like an expression resembling panic on his deadpan face. Again, Keaton's expression is kind of a marvel, as silent stars in those days had to be extremely expressive, while Keaton went the other way. His minimalist look kind of allows the viewer to fill in the appropriate emotion, which brings the audience in on the joke. One of the unusual things about this film was the musical score, which sounds a little too modern (I think I caught an electric guitar in there) but just barely fits with the film's dreamy story.

It is Buster Keaton taking to the absolute limit the fun you can have with a movie camera, and the movie's viewers are the lucky recipients of Keaton's over-indulgence.As with most Keaton comedies, the premise is fairly simple. Buster is a movie projectionist vying for the hand of a local girl (Kathryn McGuire). But Buster's romantic rival (Ward Crane) steals a valuable watch from the girl's father (Joe Keaton) and gets the rap pinned on Buster. Defeated, Buster returns to his job, where he falls asleep and \"projects\" himself (as \"crime-busting criminologist Sherlock Jr.\") into the melodrama he is projecting on the screen.The set-up is funny enough, with Keaton involved in a number of very funny gags. (One of them included his getting caught in a geyser erupting from a water tower. For years afterward, Keaton suffered blinding headaches for which he had no explanation. Eventually, he discovered he had broken his neck via the water gag.) But once the dream sequence begins, all stops are out. Buster starts by trying to intervene in the melodrama into which he has inserted himself, only to find the scenery changing with his every move. In his book \"The Silent Clowns,\" Walter Kerr reports that movie makers boasted of going to see the movie several times and never being able to discern how Keaton pulled off his photographic stunts. Keaton eventually admitted his secrets to biographer Rudi Blesh, but I have no desire to repeat them here, any more than one would want to divulge how a brilliant magician succeeded in his trickery. Don't try to look for the seams; just glory in the fun.As if that weren't enough, Keaton eventually does one of his most grandiose chase scenes, in which he rides on the handlebars of a driverless motorcycle, resulting in some gasp-inducing shots.(One of the scenes - where Buster narrowly misses getting hit by a train - looks a bit fake; and it is faked, but not in the way you'd expect. Keaton simply filmed the scene in reverse, so that he was in no danger; but Keaton wasn't quite clever enough to make it look un-faked, with the result that the train looks like it's on a rear-projection screen. Still, try to see where else he faked this spectacular chase, and you'll be looking for years.) The final scene, in which the \"real\" Buster wins the girl and then looks to the on-screen movie for romantic guidance, is a perfect closer.Amazingly, \"Sherlock Jr.,\" which has inspired countless filmmakers and was selected for the Library of Congress' National Film Registry in 1991, got only a mixed reception when it was first released. Variety said it was about as funny as \"a hospital operating room.\" It was only with the \"Keaton revival\" in the 1950's and '60s that the movie got the acclaim it deserved and has received ever since.For decades, Freudian reviewers have had a field day deconstructing the movie as an exploration of film, the unconscious mind, and just about any psychological topic you can whip up.

It seemed to me that Keaton's character's life was intentionally made somewhat dull and boring so that the action sequences when he slipped into a dream/the movie he was screening (Another brilliant scene, perfectly set to the sound track of the film) would seem even more thrilling. The 'love story' seemed to be more of an overarching plot that sandwiched the real story and provided an interesting beginning and a happy ending. In the scene where Keaton's character entered the movie, the music controlled the scene rather than the other way around.

He then pratfalls his way through a number of scene changes, remaining in one spot while the action around him hurriedly continues apace. One of the best bits had him nosedive through an open window and into a woman's dress for a stunning visual effect. The question on the tip of your tongue will be 'How did he do that?', or alternatively, 'How can anyone do something like that'?' Another thing I found interesting as a cinema fan was the choice of movie posters one can see as advertising material in the lobby of the theater where Keaton's character is working. One of them was a very early Stan Laurel silent film, \"Mud and Sand\", which demonstrated that Keaton wasn't averse to showing another performer's name in print, even if he might have been a competitor, so to speak. There was another one for a 1923 short titled \"The Fog\", but it appears the movie the projectionist was showing wasn't real. It was called \"Hearts and Pearls or The Lounge Lizard's Lost Love in Five-Parts\". My search on IMDb didn't come up with anything on that one. I know a lot of folks shun silent films because they don't consider them very interesting, but you can do yourself a favor by checking out \"Sherlock Jr.\" Yes, it's black and white, and it's silent, but director and star Buster Keaton is so inventive that you'll come away amazed at the effects he creates.

Before I review the movie proper, I have to admit to being a little self-conscious when I laughed loudly at many of the scenes since the audience didn't seem to laugh as much or at such a volume as I did but then maybe I would have been accused of doing it too much or too loud by some. Anyway, this was indeed mostly hilarious from beginning to end especially when Buster Keaton found himself in a movie as scenes keep changing.

There's a small part of me that would easily believe this was actually made in at least the 40s or 50s, not the 1920s. That's before we consider, of course, the unmistakable visage of Buster Keaton in his cinematic prime, and all the joy that follows therefrom. The storytelling is simpler, and perhaps a little more kitschy, and so is the film-making, yet full of heart and good comedy that truly never gets old. We can always rely on Keaton for robust situational humor and delightful sight gags and performances, if not also outstanding stunts, and that's certainly what we get in 'Sherlock Jr.'With the image quality being so pure every slight detail appears all the more rich and vivid: the production design and art direction, costume design, hair and makeup, stunts and effects, and every expression and gesture. Keaton's smart direction and editing, and Byron Houck and Elgin Lessley's fine cinematography, likewise shine all the brighter under the circumstances. And all this is made more noteworthy still for the somewhat unorthodox and imaginative arrangement of the screenplay concocted between Clyde Bruckman, Jean Havez, and Joseph A. Mitchell, giving us a story that invites a quasi-fantastical element, a dash of surrealism, and the insertion of gags, props, and scenery that we customarily just wouldn't get in any single conventional picture, let alone a Keaton vehicle. Mind you, this is hardly to count out any of the man's other work; the reputation of 'The general' speaks for itself, and timeless as all his movies are, I especially love 'Go west.' Yet there's a quirky, indisputable inventiveness to 'Sherlock Jr.' that is kind of in a class all its own, and I'm just so pleased at how good it still looks almost 100 years later - and how very tall it continues to stand.The cast's acting is top-notch, unremittingly embracing the silliness with all due earnestness. As much of a joy as it is to watch Keaton, he's almost upstaged by Erwin Connelly, whose vibrant mannerisms are themselves just wonderful fun. Every small component of this film just turned out so fabulously well, smart and clever, with even the intertitles lending considerably to the overall entertainment. My first impulse it to say that I don't think it makes as strong a broad impression as other works among Keaton's many silent classics, yet the sheer number of times I laughed while watching suggests otherwise. Moreover, maybe it's just because it's been a hot minute since I watched the man's other features (albeit, only about a year), but I also feel like the stunts, effects, and action sequences in 'Sherlock Jr.' are even more tightly choreographed and remarkable (and giddily ridiculous) than some of their cousins. Yet when all is said and done, no matter how one wishes to him and haw about the minutiae, the fundamental fact remains that this is an exceptional, essential, must-see of greatness, of comedies specifically but also film at large. I really don't think it matters who you are or what your preferences are; if you don't come out of 'Sherlock Jr.' having a smile on your face, then we need to have a long talk.100% recommended for one and all, bar none!", "review_date": "2023-02-02", "lang": "en", "source": "imdb"}, {"review_title": "Buster Keaton, an Andalu Underdog...", "content": "Indeed, I had to praise \"Un Chien Andalou\" as the first surrealist movie, and tried to find matters of philosophical admiration in every paragraph, it was like a bourgeois obligation to appreciate the film despite its rather obscure 'plot' and unsustainable imagery. Bunuel was the iconoclast so bashing his work would be like being the 'sprinkled sprinkler'. I don't regret my ten rating but on that basis, Buster Keaton's \"Sherlock, Jr.\" should go to eleven, for the film not only displays some of the most exquisite bits of cinematic surrealism five years before the pioneer, but without the confusion that can snobbishly pass as intelligence.Yet there's a real intelligence of style in Keaton's achievement, starting with the story, delightfully simple: a cinema projectionist who dreams to become a detective, but he's so wrapped up in his dreams that he can't work properly in both. The film opens with a quote saying that when you try to do two things at once, you don't do justice to both. On that basis, you wonder in which department the failure will operate. As a detective? A projectionist? A lover? The film opens with an incident that deliberately gives you the wrong idea of the track this story is going to take, to better blow your mind when the first special effects will pop up.It starts with rather banal incident involving a watch stolen from the girl's father and Keaton being wrongfully accused (by the thief himself). Following the detective code by the book, he checks everyone's pockets, including his own where the villain previously put an accusing pawnbroker's receipt. He knows he's been framed and with the help of his book, tries to unmask the culprit. At that point of the film, I can't say my eyes were glued to the screen, story of wrongfully accused men aren't my cup of tea, neither are silent romances. Little did I imagine that Keaton had no intention to make this the subject of his film. In a surprising twist, the woman goes to the pawnbroker and asks him about the man who sold the watch, the case is solved before the wannabe Detective did.That's how anticlimactic and dull life can be, and how (by contrast) mesmerizing and entertaining cinema is. The film takes off when Keaton falls asleep during a movie projection and 'dreams' his way into the movies, taking all the protagonists with him, \u00e0 la \"You were there!\" in \"The Wizard of Oz\", as to highlight that in cinema as in dreams, real life writes the plot, and like a foretaste to the many visual delights to come. In one of the film's most famous sequences, Keaton evolves in the movie screen while the images change. Once he tries to rest on a pole, the image shows a jungle and he falls, then he's on a rock under the sea when he plunges, it turns into a mountain and he falls on the snow. He's like entrapped in the frames, in cinema literally, an art that became a world of its own with its own rules, its own wizardry.After this poetic love-letter to the magic of the big screen, Keaton domesticates this world, and becomes part of the story, one that parallels the watch' case and involves a stolen pearl necklace, an evil butler and a thief played by the same villain, and where Keaton is the heroic \"Sherlock Jr\". The two bad guys try to kill him with a few booby traps used in the furniture and explosive billiard bowls, but Sherlock always find a way to elude the traps, playing safe shots and keeping his cool no matter how close to a disaster he came. Actually, the whole Sherlock bit can be seen as a live-action cartoon with the same ludicrous use of law of physics whether when he jumps on his assistant Gillette's box in (no pun intended) a nick of time and gets instantly disguised as an old woman.The sight gag where he literally throw himself inside a man and the climactic ride bike sequence are the stuff Tex Avery's cartoons were made of, especially the moment where he seems to collide with a giant vehicle but when you see it face on, there's a wide space allowing him to go through. The film didn't only pioneer surrealism but the world of animation. If anything, \"Sherlock Jr.\" contradicts the idea that the talking pictures were a revolution, I just watched this film and before it Harold Lloyd's \"Safety Last\" and I can say that in the 1920's, cinema was pretty mature. Maybe the talkies ruined the great premise of cinema in the way they introduced the screwball comedy and relegated the sight gags for animation. Maybe Keaton was a genius ahead of his time, a man with an imagination as infinite as cinema, highlighting its dream-like nature, as a place where no holds were barred and where you could only follow one rule: having an effect on viewers, ideally, laughs. Naturally, all good things come to an end, and the projectionist wakes up in the arm of his girlfriend, life can be happy even in a dull way. She knows the truth, he didn't need to be detective, real life made things much easier and non-entertaining, but the point isn't that cinema and life should be apart, as Sherlock's adventure was influenced by his world, life should take inspiration from cinema, the ending where he tries to imitate the two lovers' kisses and then scratch his head when you see them with a bunch of little ones is the perfect, and hilarious, illustration.

The best parts are probably with the exploding billiard balls. That's about as fun as you would imagine. The funniest part might be when it mentions that Sherlock Jr. solved the case, except everything involved with the case. You can see how this became influential. It even has a pretty sincere main story behind it, with him trying to get with his girlfriend.Could you consider this a Sherlock Holmes movie?

An Artistic and Visual Phenomena which hasn't lost 1% Magic even in its 10th Decade. May god bless Buster Keaton's Soul in heaven for years, a request from me on the behalf of all Movie Lovers. Sherlock Jr. broke the cinematic boundaries and visual effects restrictions even before they were set for Filmmakers. This film is absolute Gem. I am still in shock to accept the fact that such a Visually Spectacular film was made in 1924. Omg.. No comments on that, Speechless. A great writing which still feels mesmerizing in 2020 met with astounding visual achievements and formed a Masterpiece called Sherlock Jr. Buster Keaton's act is hard to believe, hard to follow and hard to imagine. I needed couple of pinches and pauses to believe all the activities he did on screen. The way he expressed his feelings and the way he performed stunts all looked pure and Natural. His directorial efforts are even greater but his own acting overshadowed it somewhere. Nevertheless, I still can't stop gushing over his Direction. The Marvellous work he has done was and is hard to be beat. I liked the formation of the script, it begins with Fun and keeps the flow infact and throws intelligently written conflicts and twists somewhere in between and then Visual Phenomena takes over. The first dream sequence in the film comes out astonishingly when everything happens so smoothly and takes place in the film inside this film. Those abstracting transformation of visuals are so Wonderful that i had to straighten my eyes like Wow but How? The message of goodwill wasn't typical in 1924 so the film ends on a cute Happy Note. In a nutshell, Sherlock Jr. is nothing serious or Mysterious as its title suggests but instead it proves out to be a contrary to the theme as it entertains thoroughly with never before Visual Activities.

There is also a pool game in which Buster makes several trick shots avoiding an explosive ball placed on the table by the villain. One special effect that I've never seen explained is where Buster dives through a suitcase seemingly through his butler and a solid wooden door, turning up on the other side of the door when it is opened.

Buster Keaton was able to create two plots in one movie, one in reality and one in a dream, and wrap both of them up in under 45-minutes. On top of that he was able to keep the viewer intrigued due to the quickness of certain scenes and the thrown in comedy, like the banana peel which is a classic, which prevented the viewer from getting bored. This film is a classic case of mistaken identity. Someone commits a crime and then plants evidence on the protagonist. This main character was then automatically blamed, lost the girl and then told to get out. He attempted to prove his innocence but couldn't find the evidence he needed (because it was planted on him). Now the next part has a bit of a twist. Instead of him finding a way to prove his innocence he goes to work at a movie theater and falls asleep and into a dream. In this dream he's in a movie as \"Sherlock Jr.\" (the detective he always wanted to be). This was a clever turn of events on Buster Keaton's part. He gets called in on a pearl robbery, figures out who stole it, got the pearls back, and saved the girl. When he is abruptly awoken, the girl is there because she was sent by her father with an apology of their incorrect accusation. The transitions between the dream and reality was very well written and performed. It allowed the viewers to understand what was going on without the use of dialogue cards. Factoring in the character expressions and performances, it was clear what was going on without too many intertitles. Which helped keep the film moving. Overall, I would give this film a 9/10 for the overall quality and cinematic cleverness. I personally am not a big fan of these types of movies.

He is sending for the world's greatest detective \u0096 Sherlock Jr.!\"", "content": "Sherlock Jr. (Buster Keaton) is something of a hopeless case. He works clumsily as a cinema projectionist, but instead yearns to be a detective, not unlike the great Sherlock Holmes of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's riveting tales. In the time when he's supposed to be working, he reads books about 'How To Be A Detective' and searches for dollar bills in the piles of rubbish scattered across the theatre floor.Sherlock is also in love with a girl (Kathryn McGuire), though he doesn't really know what to do with her. Their time spent together consists primarily on one person holding out their hand, only to find that the other hasn't got the courage to reach out and take it. Sherlock, being a little low on cash, buys her a $1 present, and changes the marked price on the box to a more respectable $4. He then flips the box over in her hands so that she will notice how monetarily generous he has been. However, when the girl's father's (Joe Keaton) watch is stolen, the devious sheik responsible (Ward Crane) frames Sherlock for the theft, and he is ordered never to return again.A crestfallen Sherlock trudges back to his job at the cinema, and, at the beginning of a detective film, slumbers off to sleep. It is here, as Sherlock awakens into a dream, that he is able to \u0096 in a clever triumph of imagination and visual effects \u0096 step into the detective movie, and become Sherlock Jr. \u0096 the world's greatest detective! The moment in which Sherlock literally steps into the movie screen is a truly inspired piece of optical trickery, with the movie screen being cunningly replaced with a similarly-decorated live stage of actors. This is then followed by a sequence depicting the film's struggle to reject this newly-arrived protagonist, abruptly cutting to different locations, and throwing Sherlock inside a pride of lions, in the midst of thrashing waves, before a speeding train and on the edge of a cliff. Eventually, Keaton is fully assimilated into the film, where he must battle to solve the mystery of the stolen pearls.This is a highly imaginative film, brimming with Keaton's trademark slapstick humour and mind-blowing stunt work. Sherlock Jr. finds himself, at one point, running along the roof of a departing train, before he is forced to seize the large tube connected to a water basin, which promptly lets forth a violent gush of water (Keaton famously fractured his neck whilst performing this stunt, though he didn't realize it until a doctor diagnosed him in the 1930s). Another memorable stunt involves Keaton descending from the roof of a building using a railway barrier, and then landing himself in the back seat of the villain's moving car. An extended motorbike sequence, in which Sherlock sits on the handlebars \u0096 unaware that the rider has fallen off some time ago \u0096 provides various outstanding opportunities for more of Keaton's nail biting stunt work. The billiards sequence, in which the villains deviously substitute the #13 ball with an explosive device, is very memorable, especially as an oblivious Sherlock wins the game, anyway, his shots impossibly avoiding the suspect ball at every hit.This is a highly-entertaining short film from Buster Keaton (at 44 minutes, it is not quite a feature-length film), and it moves along at such a rip-roaring pace that you never find yourself bored or uninterested. Keaton was never afraid to do his own stunt work, and his dedication to the medium was unmistakably evident in his films, rightly making him one of the most popular of all silent film comedy actors.", "review_date": "2007-02-08", "lang": "en", "source": "imdb"}, {"review_title": "The Best Place to Start...", "content": "Though a silent film aficionado, I've only recently been getting into the comedies of the twenties.

Unlike those other stone faces, Keaton is also an action hero, constantly jumping off cliffs, hopping moving trains, riding the handle bars of a speeding bicycle, throwing himself through windows, all without the aid of a stunt double. The seamlessness of the camera trickery is mind-blowing, and the post-modern breaking-the-fourth wall philosophy has been the subject of an entire book published by Cambridge.

The film-within-the-film gave Keaton a chance to play with some experimental camera tricks and visual illusions, often ignoring the storyline altogether, and leading many hack intellectuals to later cite the film as an avant-garde think piece. But what all the egghead analysis fails to mention is how funny it can be, and the range of humor is often startling, even by Keaton's inventive standards.

But it deserves to be celebrated and enjoyed for what it is, a merry farce where bending cinematic rules is just one aspect of a larger game. To celebrate \"Sherlock Jr.\" merely for the trick of seeing a lead character enter a movie and interact with its players is like celebrating \"The Wizard Of Oz\" just for the moment the screen goes from black-and-white to full color.The character Buster plays here is a shy fellow who works at a movie house but dreams of becoming a detective. When he is falsely accused of stealing a pocket watch from the father of his would-be girlfriend, Keaton tries to use his budding detective skills to solve the crime. Then, falling asleep in the projection booth, he imagines himself as the title character in a movie about the theft of a string of pearls.Watching Buster at work in a world created for his amusement is like everything else he ever did, only this time the humor of it is laid out much more boldly, more broadly. Like when \"Sherlock Jr.\" first enters the scene of the crime and shushes the victim by saying: \"Don't bother to explain. This is a simple case for me.\"Then he mugs ferociously while quizzing the suspects, looking them up and down with beady eyes protruding from his famous stone face. Is he parodying \"The Great Profile\" John Barrymore's famous performance as Sherlock Holmes from a few years before? Certainly his abilities at billiards mocks some heroic movie trope; beyond the brilliant technique on display, the gag seems to be that no one can possibly be this good. Yet, when you think about it, he really is that good here. Everything about that sequence is so brilliant in its own right it exists in its own place out of time.As David Kalat points out in the Kino DVD commentary, one odd aspect of the movie is that the real-life crime, meaning the theft of the watch, not the pearls, is actually solved 15 minutes in, no thanks to \"Sherlock.\" Kalat suggests this was done so the audience could relax and enjoy the comedy that follows; I think it was another of Keaton's many meta gags.When you write about things like \"meta-gags,\" you run the risk of consigning \"Sherlock Jr.\" to the art-house icebox, where it doesn't belong. There's a lot of pure pie-in-the-face comedy, including a number of mustache gags that get funnier every time I see them.The only real drawback is the time: Just under 45 minutes. I'm glad they didn't waste more time on the romance between Kathryn McGuire (who is seen to better effect in \"The Navigator\"), but it seems a shame that the concept wasn't stretched out enough. I suspect Keaton understood better than we can how much he had to offer and just how long a time he should ask us to spend on it; still, you end up with a film that is too long for a short by 20 minutes and too short for a regular feature by about as long.But the positive is you get a film that takes the quicker pace and restless imagination of a short and stretches it out into what is, at least for a short, something of epic length.

I really want to watch as much works from Chaplin, Lloyd, the Marx Brothers and Keaton as I can so in that way I had kind of \"forgotten\" Buster Keaton just like I still have the Marx Brothers. I found finally Sherlock Jr. and I watched it immediately. 44 minutes of enjoyment, 44 minutes that will make you laugh and maybe cry, in short Sherlock Jr. is a fantastic gem, it is as good as once can expect from a film that for many is a must see piece of cinema, it is as marvelous as I was expecting since I was going to watch a legendary Buster Keaton picture. Keaton will gain you just by watching the first scene in which he appears that is also the first scene of the film, we watch him in the theater where he works, as the projectionist, reading his little book \"How to be a detective\" and not really taking care of his jobs. I loved Keaton's character, he is a boy whose desire is to become a detective and this desire is interfering with his job. \"Before you clean up any mysteries clean up this theater!\" is what his chief said to him. And for us is very funny his difficult reality and his bad luck but even with everything he will manage to get a $4 present for the girl (Kathryn McGuire), a present that will bring some special situations. First, Keaton's character paid only $1 (all the money he had after a marvelous scene in which he lost a couple of dollars and the chance to get more) for the present but to look like a generous man of course he made the 1 a 4 of course never thinking that this action will bring him some consequences and not pleasant ones. The rival is always there actually he is the villain so the one who stole and later blame our projectionist of his crime. The villain stole something that soon pawned to get a present, for the same girl of course, of $4. Then a mystery for our detective but he can't be the detective and the thief at the same time, the villain was smartest. So now our detective will need to prove who is the real thief if he want to see the girl again but actually we could not have our detective picture with this story, after all the girl found that Keaton's character was not guilty very soon and it was even quite easy for her but she will not see the projectionist again before he had the dream, the dream that was our detective picture! After our projectionist had this awful experience of course he went to work with everything in mind and that will give us another film. The idea was just brilliant and so original, we watch Keaton entering to a screen to experience how in cinema a sequence can be at one place and just one second later we can be watching another part of the world. And for obvious reasons in the mind of Keaton's character are enough elements to get with a detective picture. He is now Sherlock Jr., a terrific detective who in a short time had \"completely solved the mystery, with the exception of locating the pearls and finding the thief\". During that Sherlock Jr. film we enjoy many really memorable sequences mostly after our little Sherlock could recover the pearls and meanwhile he was escaping from the villains. Look when Sherlock Jr. is in a bike! And of course he had the luck to be in danger one moment and the next to be saving the girl! So our projectionist with his dream gave a great, exciting and hilarious film so now cinema will help him, like returning the favor, with the girl. The projectionist will watch and later do the same with the girl but remember that in films sometimes things go really fast!A perfect film; some said that is it very short and they are right but I loved it so much to can write it's lack of minutes as a complaint.

In \"Sherlock Jr.\", there are many moments of intense comedy; for example, the entire segment in which he is at a pool table, seemingly unaware that one of the balls is an explosive. As he continues, the scene gets more and more funny, as well as intense, as he keeps missing that one specific pool ball in ways that are practically impossible. His unawareness of peril provides both laughs and gasps in equal measure, which makes it all the more funnier. If the audience was laughing along with the film while Keaton was in an extremely safe situation with no steaks, then they would not only be less engaged, but less humored. When comedy appears in an intense situation, it is all the more comic, which is what Keaton was able to showcase throughout his entire career, and in this film especially.\"Sherlock Jr.\" is easily my favorite of Keaton's films, which is quite the achievement. It isn't exactly the funniest (that would have to be \"Seven Chances\"), but it IS the most thrilling, entertaining, and surreal. Keaton has no creative boundaries, making this comic masterpiece all the more unpredictable.

The slapstick fails to arouse even a smirk and the story starts off so bad I'm actually sort of insulted by it. It doesn't take a detective to realize he could have just taken the family to the pawn shop very clearly named on the receipt for the watch and had the owner confirm that Keaton was not the thief immediately after being framed. There, mystery solved. Now I understand that this was simply the set up for the Sherlock Jr section of the film, but that just raises the even more important question of why the writers didn't just cut those beginning and ending portions of the film entirely and dedicate all of the 44 minute run time to Sherlock Jr. That section of the film is remarkably better in every aspect, and already had a set up that worked perfectly fine; A pearl necklace is stolen and Buster Keaton's character is called in to solve the case. This part of the film is actually enjoyable, the gags are amusing and work well, the plot is much more intriguing, and this is where all of the impressive scenes are on display.

The plot is simplistic and mundane but that is the least of concerns here. Keaton was well-known for doing all of his own stunts and sometimes the stunts of other people. There is even a scene here where he broke two vertebrae in his neck and didn't notice for years and neither do we.

You got sentiment, love, suspense and oh wow, stunts in form of chases and all are very very original.

In a famous interview, Keaton said of this film that they had been forced to stop doing 'cartoon gags' when they switched to feature films, because they interrupted the narrative flow. The entire bracketing story of 'real' Buster, the projectionist, was written on so they could populate a feature length film with impossible jokes and sight gags.The camera work is seamless, particularly impressive in the earliest scenes of the movie-within-the-movie. Some of the scenes he skipped through were physical stage sets, lit to look like a projected movie, and others were back-projected film. Owing to the limitations of the technology Buster's crew had to work with, you can tell the film segments from the stages, but still a masterful composition.My main problem with Sherlock Jr stems from the tacked-on 'real' beginning and ending. Buster the projectionist starts out with a real-life mystery to solve, but his girlfriend winds up solving it while he daydreams. It makes the ending a bit unsatisfying. In the film-within-a-film, Buster the detective solves the crime and saves the day.The second complaint is certainly not Buster's fault. I just wonder who at Kino video thought that terrible, modern-jazz soundtrack was an appropriate backing for a Keaton film. It detracted a great deal from my viewing experience, especially the James Bond homage during the car chase.

This movie is just more than fantastic it is just flawless with its humour, its direction but also its use of technical cheats to make it look as if Keaton is for example jumping into the cinema screen or the camera work of a rather famous motorcycle scene and it's great to see in a movie made in the 1920's. The reason I think I and I think others can and have connected to this is because it is so simple yet so lovely, it is like a piece of art plastered onto the screen and made to move, a joy to watch and look at and is probably one the smartest ever silent movies.Buster Keaton stars in the movie as the film projectionist at the local cinema and he wants to be a detective, he even carries a little book around with how to take care of the situation should a crime arise. He is also in love with a girl called well, The Girl who is played by Kathryn McGuire and she also has interest from the local Sheik (Ward Crane) who isn't exactly a nice man in this story. Things really become even more crazy yet wonderful when the projectionist dozes off during a viewing and he dreams of himself being Sherlock Jr. When this happens the movie steps out of being a great one and becomes a masterpiece of camera trickery done so well indeed by Byron Houck and Elgin Lessley and that's not to mention the editing which is considered by editors themselves to be some of the best there is in film. The stories dream is magical, Keaton's stunts whilst in his dream and also out of it are mind blowing and done to such a degree that you fall in love with his acting skill.At such a short running time you might expect not much and the chances of you loving this slim, well think again because this is probably the shortest film I have seen where I have already connected with the characters in the first 5 minutes. Keaton is incredible in this; many a fan of his and of silent film will point to \"The General\" as his greatest but for me this is Keaton not just at his stunt doing best, but at his most dramatic best too. Clyde Bruckman and the writers make a story that is ingenious and so well done but also well thought of, it's the kind of little movie that stands the test of time simply because it's so easy to watch but also contains such brilliant moments.As you might guess there isn't a whole lot to say about a movie that by some organisations standards is not even a full feature film, but I think it is, it deserves credit for what it is and I am sure critics who like it would agree with me. I implore anyone to try this, even if you think you dislike silent movies because this is not only short but actually way more than just good, it is an actor at their finest and that's not to forget the technical team at that too.

Having said all this however, I think it's a good thing that the movie only has a 45 minute run time, because I think that cheesy/slapstick comedy is only funny for so long.

With Sherlock Jr. we get a simple tale (which is always a better way to go with silent films) that is delightful in that we root for Keaton who plays the underdog of the story. Sadly, it doesn't live up to the status of The General.As an early silent film, this movie sets a precedent for thinking about film - about half of this film is a dream sequence in which the film projectionist played by Keaton gets intertwined in a \"movie\" about his girlfriend and the man who framed him for stealing her father's pocket watch. Before the story of the dream begins, we have an out-of-body experience from the Keaton character who is interacting with what is presented on the movie screen. This is the greatest sequence of this shorter film in my opinion as it has the audience think about their relation to the film when they go to the movies, and it uses humor by having Keaton's character clumsily fall over various times when the setting of the film changes and he remains constantly on the screen.A shorter film is great since its focus is simple and doesn't leave the audience bored with unnecessary content, but I feel this film was actually lacking content. I know this was released in the very early days of narrative cinema, but more character development could have helped this story as well as just a little bit more complexity in the plot. This film has its moments with great humor, but it is not one of the better silent comedies.3.0/4.0", "review_date": "2015-09-04", "lang": "en", "source": "imdb"}, {"review_title": "Surprisingly enjoyable for a silent movie!", "content": "I'm currently a student at university and one of my modules I am studying is introduction to film. The topic I have been studying for the last few weeks has been The Origins of Cinema and how films have established themselves with the technology available to film companies and directors at that time. I watched a couple of silent, black and white movies from the early 1900s, one which included The Great Train Robbery and two weeks ago I watched this Sherlock Junior, which to be honest I wasn't really looking forward to.My review may seem prejudice seeming as how I was born and grew up in contemporary Western society and am used to seeing films with sound and colour and much more advanced technology with deeper characterisation though I'm sure there are people out there who though weren't born in the era of silent movies may love them all the same, but I just was never interested in watching films as old as that though I have seen a couple of John Wayne Westerns from the 1960s and they were good but they were with sound and colour.So when my lecturer put on Sherlock Junior I wasn't expecting to like it much if at all. It was only forty five minutes I thought to myself but as I was watching it I started to enjoy it and at the end I thought it was good and quite enjoyable.After watching this movie it has now made me appreciate the silent movie era and what they had for that time was great. What makes this movie special for me was that despite it was outdated and I live in a different time it appealed to me.What I did like was the narrative and the actor Buster Keaton who plays Sherlock Junior conveyed wonderful facial expressions on screen, which were very convincing, the action scenes were also exciting to watch and there were plenty of elements of comic relief which I laughed at making me feel relaxed. Maybe I should give this movie higher than a rating of six but for me it wasn't spectacular as I am just too used to the films we have now with the better technology and resources available. Maybe if I had been alive during that time I would have given this a nine or a ten, but I still enjoyed this and the forty five minutes were well spent. The question is would I watch this again? And the answer is yes I would. I could certainly think of a lot things worse doing than watching this small movie, which had a huge impact on me for forty five minutes again. It's a thumbs up from a twenty year old contemporary film critic who is never normally a fan of films this old.", "review_date": "2009-10-30", "lang": "en", "source": "imdb"}, {"review_title": "Through the Movie Screen", "content": "Buster Keaton's most surreal movie sprang from his insistence on logic and realism. His tribute to cinema was inspired by stage magic tricks he remembered from his vaudeville career. His most dazzling and original movie is also one of his least formally perfect. All these paradoxes belong naturally to this \"through the looking glass\" work, which examines the dream-like nature of film-or is it the film-like nature of dreams?As Buster told it, the origin of the film lay in his desire to use certain illusionary stunts, like the bewildering dive through a living assistant's stomach, which he had learned the secret of as a child. But he firmly believed that impossible or \"cartoon\" gags were not acceptable in feature films, so he could only include them by making them occur in a dream, which is also a film-within-a-film. This is odd, when you think about it, since what he seems to be saying is that impossible things can happen in a film-but this was the very rule he himself refused to break. By creating an outer film that is \"real\" and an inner film that is \"not real,\" Keaton shows that, while film enables illusions and distortions of reality, the filmmaker has a choice-and a responsibility-to clearly delineate fact from fantasy. In one scene, Keaton uses a camera trick (dissolving a wall) to prove that he's NOT using a camera trick when he dives through a window and comes out disguised as an old woman. Because he was analytical, mechanically-minded, and a stickler for authenticity, Keaton took pleasure in revealing the processes of magic tricks, and camera tricks, rather than using them to fool the audience.Buster plays a hapless cinema projectionist who yearns to be a detective, but is so clueless that his romantic rival manages to frame him for stealing his girlfriend's father's watch. In a dream, he enters the film he's projecting and becomes a great detective who solves a similar crime. While Buster's on-screen character is a schlemiel who can only achieve mastery in his celluloid fantasies, as a director Keaton's grasp of the mechanics of film-making enabled him to control the camera and its imagery as thoroughly and gracefully as he controlled his acrobatic body. SHERLOCK JR. is the most technically advanced film he ever made, including special effects (as when Buster steps through the screen and gets edited from park bench to street to mountain-top to lion's den) that can still leave audiences wondering, \"How in hell did he do that?\" It's often said that Keaton's films inspire gasps rather than laughs. Well, I just saw SHERLOCK JR. with an audience last night, and the laughter was loud and regular as fireworks on the Fourth of July. But it's a particular kind of laughter: surprised, amazed, incredulous laughter.The first half of the movie takes place in the \"real\" world; it begins with some nice small-scale gags involving Buster's attempts to scrounge up money to buy candy for his girl, and his adorably awkward visit to her house. After he has been thrown out due to his rival's machinations, Buster \"shadows\" the man (literally, copying his every motion exactly), but is tricked again and trapped in a freight train. There's a beautiful shot where he runs along the top of the train, staying in the same spot on the screen while the cars zoom by under him in the opposite direction; but I can't watch the stunt where he rides a water-spout down to the tracks without wincing, knowing he fractured his neck doing it.The beginning of the dream sequence is one of the greatest self-reflexive scenes in the history of film, as Buster's ghostly double rises from his sleeping body, picks up his ghostly hat, marches down into the theater and steps into the screen. Haven't we all wanted to do this at some time? Once over his turbulent introduction to the medium, Buster becomes the elegant Sherlock, Jr., investigating a theft of pearls from a mansion. In a marvelous game of billiards, Buster smoothly plays around an exploding 13 ball; he escapes from the thieves' den with one of the neatest tricks you'll ever see; he rides through busy streets on the handlebars of a motorcycle that no one is driving; and he goes for a romantic sail in a floating car. All this is packed into a mere 45 minutes.Significantly cut after poor previews, SHERLOCK JR. has more in common with Keaton's short films than his features. Because of the fractured story-line, it doesn't have the narrative coherence or trajectory of character development that most of Keaton's great features do. His performance is split between the shy, inept projectionist and the suave, infallible detective. He is totally convincing in both roles. When he wakes from his dream, the projectionist finds that all is well: the girl has solved the mystery and come to apologize. He is still timid as ever, so for a romantic denouement he looks to the screen: peeking out of his booth, he copies the actions of the movie hero wooing his leading lady.

His favorite pastime activity is reading books about said topic; \"how to become a detective\". When the father of his romantic interest lost his watch he applied himself by trying to figure out who stole it. By a twist of fate he ends up being accused/framed for the crime. With the now blemishing reputation he has all the more reason to reveal the real thief.The first thing that you'll notice is the movie's brevity. With a running time of only 45 minutes this movie is among the shorter ones (even for the silent film genre). It is a silent film so there is no actual \"spoken\" dialogue. If you're not accustomed to this type of genre it may take some getting used to.The great thing with the film scores for silent movies is that they're continuous. Unlike in contemporary movies where the film score only kicks in every now and then to accentuate certain scenes or to blend in with the uneventful scenes. So yes, even though they're called silent films they're anything but silent. Quite to the contrary; they feature more music than regular movies. I myself have a rather impressive collection of projection reels of silent movies; the only problem being that I'd need a full-blown orchestra to accompany it. So unfortunately for me my movies are truly silent. How ironic.... I know.The second half of the movie is basically the projectionist's daydream in which he \"solves the crime\". The billiard scene was rather hilarious. I wonder how many times they had to film those scenes to get it just right. Either that or Buster Keaton was seriously skilled in the art of trickshotting.To conclude:\nThe movie was actually quite enjoyable once the protagonists entered his daydream. But for me personally the beginning felt a little bit like a drag.\nIf once considers that all the action happens in his dream it becomes clear why the first half of the movie should've been kept shorter. So yes, pacing-wise the movie feels a little bit slow in the beginning.All the classical Sherlock Holmes themes were explored with the exception of Bartitsu. Sherlock Jr. wasn't a skilled fighter but rather the kind of fellow who'd run away from a fight, even in his dreams.It's a decent movie but definitely not one of Buster Keaton's best. \nBut that's just my personal opinion.

It makes me incredibly unsatisfied as an audience member because the film sets up Keaton as a movie projectionist who aspires to be a detective. However, when he fails as a detective in real life, he decides to take a nap in the theater, and imagine what it would be like to be successful as that detective.

Knowing that this film was made in 1924, well before digital manipulation, makes the physical stunts and gags very impressive to watch throughout. For all Charlie Chaplin fans out there, Keaton is just as good as him in this slapstick performance if not better.The movie opens with a theater projectionist, played by Keaton, sitting reading his book, \"How to be a Detective\" to the dismay of the theater manager. Later, the projectionist is wooing a girl at her house but is in competition with another suitor, the Sheik. The Sheik steals the girl's father's watch, pawns it, and buys a deluxe candy box for the girl. The father (played by Keaton's real life father) announces his stolen watch status to those in the household, which includes the father's handyman. The Sheik sets up the projectionist to take the fall for the theft thereby thwarting the projectionist's attempt to play detective. The projectionist is told never to return. Back in the theater, the depressed projectionist falls asleep while manning the projector that is running a film. A dream sequence follows where the projectionist inserts himself into the film. The combination of scene changes from actual sets to film scenes where the projectionist stays in the same position between changes is cleverly done. The sequence continues as the projectionist, his boss, the girl, the girl's father, the father's hired hand, and the Sheik replace the characters in the theater film. The Sheik, now as the villain, steals the father's pearls and the father phones Sherlock Jr. (Keaton) to solve the crime. Worth watching are the billiard ball scene where Sherlock Jr. doesn't hit the unlucky 13 ball, and the motorbike ride filled with jaw dropping stunts and Sherlock Jr. riding on the handlebars all the while thinking everything is in control.Keaton's performance as the mild mannered projectionist contrasts perfectly with his performance as the can-do-no-wrong Sherlock Jr. The projectionist is at the mercy of everyone while Sherlock Jr. defies all the odds. The only two other performances worth mentioning are the father's hired hand and the theater manager. During the dream sequence both play parts opposite their characters seen in the first segment. The trusted hired hand is the butler in on the pearl theft while the theater manager goes from being the annoyed boss to Sherlock Jr.'s quick costume changing assistant Gillette much like Artemus Gordon in the 'Wild Wild West' TV show.

It starts off showing Junior rummaging through the garbage outside the theater looking for money. The scene keeps flashing from the local store, to the theater. Junior wants to buy his girlfriend a box of chocolate to impress her and her family. The comedic part of this scene is that when he finds a dollar bill in the trash, to his luck, this old woman comes crying back to him saying she lost her dollar bill. He asks her to describe the dollar bill (also a very humorous part). In the end of the scene since he is such a kind man, he attempts to give his own personal money away to those who claim to be missing theirs.I think to have a successful silent film, all the comedic and humorous actions have to be demonstrated through the characters facial expressions, postures, poses, and actions. I think that Keaton has beyond succeeded this. He has a way of capturing Junior's desires and dreams, who is just a young and in love local film projectionist, to become a well renown detective of his time. The end of the film shows the girlfriend going back to Junior, while he is at work, and apologizing for accusing him of stealing from her family. He is so unsure of what to do. BUT!

Keaton, conditioned by the vaudeville acts of his childhood, is actually on those handlebars alone, no film tricks, he goes through that window and appears on the other side in a dress, HE JUMPS THROUGH THE MIDDLE OF HIS ASSISTANT. What do you expect though, Harry Houdini was a family friend and a fellow act on the Keatons traveling show. You will watch, pause, rewind, and watch again a few times during this movie, trust me. An excellent start in some ways to the \"Silent Slapstick\" genre, but in other ways, a bad start - you may begin to make unfair comparisons to other movies of the same persuasion. Kino has released all of his work, so if you want more Buster, it's there for the taking. Also, if you can get your hands on it, a special that ran for 13 episodes called \"Hollywood: A Celebration Of The American Silent Film\" in 1980 on the BBC has many clips, both video and audio (gasp!) of Keaton, plus a biography.

Notably the content and special effects exceed that of other silent films from the 1920's (that I have seen). In comparison to a film such as Charlie Chaplin's \"The Circus\"; Sherlock Jr. has overwhelmingly more depth where The Circus, like a lot of silent films, is much more frivolous in my opinion. In regards to the content there is a lot to admire about Sherlock Jr. Buster Keaton plays a hilariously graceless film projectionist who is accused of theft by his loves father. He then attempts to be and then daydreams about being a detective and acquitting himself of the guilt. As he tries to tale the man he believes to be the thief he runs into several comical obstacles. For instance at one point the man Keaton is tailing leads him into a train car and then proceeds to lock him inside of it. The wannabe detective is then forced to run atop the train cars until he can lower himself to safety via a water tower hose that inevitably gets him wet. Sherlock Jr. features many different humorous scenes similar to this one. In my opinion, unlike the circus the comedy in this movie is more subtle and less childish allowing the viewer to maintain more respect for the main character (Buster Keaton). In regards to special effects this film is nothing short of exceptional for the silent film era. There are several different stunts and scenes that are comparable to ones featured in movies that proceeded the 1920's. The car that is driven by Keaton into the river and then used as a boat once in the water is the best example of the high quality special effects in this film. As a viewer it leaves me wondering; how did they do that? and when you can ask yourself that question you have usually just witnessed a successful special effects stunt. Again, I am not a fan of silent films but I'd be doing an injustice if I did not acknowledge the aspects of Sherlock Jr. that deserve positive recognition. Initially I did find the film slightly difficult to follow however, that may have been due to a lack of interest.

The scene of him leaving his sleeping body and get trapped in the movie were very entertaining. Also when the main character dives out a window and is in disguise as an elderly woman was genius. This scene would still amaze me if it were in a movie today its so clever and would actually fool anyone with how quick and smooth it was . The other mentionable scene was when the protagonist dove through a brief case and a person. I still have no idea how this was done. Overall I would recommend this to anyone.

The \"proposal\" scene was especially hilarious, her reaction to the size of the diamond that he gives her would be indicative of a woman who was not poor during this time period. Although Keaton, in my opinion, is not nearly as over the top, or entertaining as his counterpart Chaplin was, he still does a good enough job at catching the viewers attention, and making the viewer laugh without the use of any words. Strictly by the use of body language and facial expression; not an easy feat by any means. This film also had a film within a film element to it, which reminds me of the popular film Inception.

One thing that surprised me about this movie was how he was able to deliver such stunts during this time period (1924). One example stunt being the motorcycle scene, when the main character rides throughout town on this motorcycle with no driver yet avoids all obstacles, the trucks driving under the bridge at the perfect time, just missing the train and more. Along with all the laughs and stunts the movie also had a great deal of verisimilitude.

At the end of the film I found myself pondering the overall message of it. It certainly wasn't related to the intro of the film. I think perhaps it is lost in the little escapade our protagonist transitions into as he naps on the job, which kind of ignites the turning point of the film. I completely understand that this transition into his fantasy is important in the sense of him being in a place where things go right and perhaps he has far more control over his current ordeal. I just think this overshadows if not buries the goal of the film (whatever that might be.) Unless I am missing a clue here Mr. Sherlock Jr. I did notice however that Jr was much older in the beginning of the film, reading what seemed like the same book as he had throughout the entire story which in this scene was clearly older and a bit dirty and tattered.

Only 45 minutes in length makes the story feel a little rushed due to the lack of character development but at the same time it kept me from becoming distracted since silent films can get a little boring sometimes.

This is my very first Keaton movie I've ever seen, and after seeing it, I can now see why Keaton is viewed to be one of the greatest slapstick comedians not only in cinematic history but in comedic history too (along with Charlie Chaplin, Harold Lloyd, and the Three Stooges). The plot is simple: a movie theater film projectionist (played by Keaton himself) dreams of becoming a detective. He knows everything on the subject (including how to act like one and what you should do to solve a mystery), but can't seem to find much work around town. Than one day, after an attempt to help his love interest's father find his stolen beloved pocket-watch goes horribly awry, he returns to the theater and dreams that he is in the mystery movie that he is currently showing at the theater and, better yet, that he's THE detective in the mystery movie helping to solve the crime. The plot works great on two different levels. 1. It offers moviegoers a sense of joyous wish fulfillment. I'm pretty sure lots of general everyday people, even back in 1924, wanted to star in movies, even if they knew little about the profession. So 'Sherlock Jr.,' with its plot line about a random guy becoming a part of a movie, manages to fulfill his wish all these people had. And to see this wish be seen acted-out on screen must have been a really cool experience for moviegoers back in 1924. Especially when they saw the groundbreaking sequence where the hero's \"dream-self' enters the \"movie\" by literally walking into the screen. In this scene the movie's cinematography and special effects were on full display and while it may not look like much today, back in 1924 it was simply amazing. The funny thing about this story is that it's a commonplace story in media today. So 'Sherlock Jr.' really was ahead of its time with its story of joyous wish fulfillment and will forever have its legacy on the plot device. The story also utilizes a sort of film-within-a-film gimmick that is also commonplace in today's media and can be seen in everything from the TV series '30 Rock' to the movie 'The Truman Show.' The cool thing though is that 'Sherlock Jr.' was probably the first piece of media in history to utilize this surreal gimmick, and even though it is actually a dream sequence and not an actual full-blown \"fantasy thingy,\" 'Sherlock Jr.' nonetheless was still pretty much the first piece of entertainment media to use this plot device (or a rough draft of the plot device, more like it) and will forever have its legacy imprinted on it. Plus, the film vs. reality theme that appears in the movie is really funny. When Keaton's character's wakes-up from his dream back into the real world you can't help but have a tragic laugh at his expense. Keaton's performance is also great. He manages to convey the role of the everyman with a big dream perfectly with that constantly glum look on his face- the result of reality wearing-down on him. And he's also funny to watch as he reacts to every situation he is put through. Now on to the comedy seen in the movie. Today, slapstick comedy has been reduced to a type of comedy only seen in crude kids movies. All the life has been sucked out of it. After 'Jackass: The Movie,' it seems like nobody can do nothing new with it. But in the 20s and 30s, slapstick was all the rage. Charlie Chaplin, Keaton, the Three Stooges, Harold Lloyd. and the Marx Brothers did wonders with it. And this movie is an example of slapstick at its finest. From the famous water-tower scene (which actually caused Keaton to fracture his neck, though he ended-up okay) to the suspenseful, trick-shot-filled, game of pool scene to the \"tail your man closely\" scene, the slapstick in 'Sherlock Jr.' is simply marvelous. And it just enters a new realm of quality once you remember that a lot of actors in this movie (including Keaton himself) did most of their own stunts. The movie is also full to the brim with lots of hilarious gags too, such as the introductory scene of \"Sherlock Jr.'s\" assistant Gillette, which is packed with wry jokes about shaving companies and the scene where the hero first meets his love interest and finds that they both keep on trying awkwardly to hold hands and the tour-de-force of gags that is the grand finale car chase scene where everything humorously keeps going the hero's way- until he realizes that his car has only two breaks and the tires on his car require four breaks to stop. The humor in this movie, looking back, is also a great example of the incongruity theory of humor, which states that most basic comedy is created out of a defiance of expectation (the game of pool scene is a great example of this) as the hero humorously never manages to hit the trick explosive ball the villains have planted for him but instead keeps on making trick shots). Now, before I close this review, I would like to talk about three more good things that this movie has: special effects, editing, and cinematography. The special effects in this movie are simply breathtaking. From seeing the hero's dream self leave his body to the scene where the hero magically jumps through Gillette's dress (he's dressed-up as an old woman) into a sliding door, special effects supervisor for this film Elgin Lessley managed to push the technological boundaries for movies at the time with the ahead-of-their-time special effects seen in this movie, which somehow still amaze to this day. He also managed to introduce several new types of special effects to the movie industry. And while the cinematography and editing in this movie aren't nearly as impressive as the special effects, they are still impressive. The wide-open-shots seen during the scene where the hero's \"dream self\" enters the \"movie\" are dimply breathtaking and the frantic, fast-paced shots of camera seen during the grand finale chase scene create a sense of, albeit comedic, suspense and intrigue. And the equally fast-paced, precise, top-notch editing makes sure that audiences are never worn-down by the amount of action happening in front of them. In conclusion, 'Sherlock Jr.' is a great, charming silent-era film with a simple yet timeless story that was also the first Hollywood movie to offer audiences joyous wish fulfillment while also utilizing an at-the-time new surreal yet entertaining film-within-a-film structure. And it keeps the entertainment up with classic slapstick, a charming, funny lead in the form of Buster Keaton, fast-paced, hilarious gags, at-the-time technologically groundbreaking, fun-to-watch special effects, fast-paced, frantic cinematography, and slick, precise editing. It is a must-see for movie-buffs, comedy-buffs, or for families who just want to find a good movie to watch for movie night.", "review_date": "2019-08-14", "lang": "en", "source": "imdb"}, {"review_title": "A DEREKtor's Take on \"Sherlock Jr.\"", "content": "Sherlock Jr. Was a great and funny story. And while there may have been some parts that felt out of place and a little boring or extra, it was still an entertaining comedy.The use of symmetrical shots at the beginning was great to imply that this is not your average detective, and this story will not unfold like any other typical detective story. The way Buster Keaton portrays his character is wonderful. It takes what one might expect from a detective named \"Sherlock Jr.\" and he subverts their expectations in a comedic way.There was a very good introduction to the conflict. A watch has been stolen, and he must find it in order to impress the girl of his dreams. But once he is framed, he now must clear his name in order to regain the respect of the entire family.It was a great use of irony for the murder attempts. It was very silly and cartoonish. And it was really creative in the theater to have him interact with the film, interfering with the characters on screen, and being fully concious as the scenes are cutting on him, leaving him stranded.The use of wide angles to capture the entire scene felt very theatrical and almost like it were a stage production. And the quick and sudden actions really go hand in hand with the very wide shots, because it is sudden, and and the way it surprises you out of nowhere is what makes it funny. Like when he jumps out of the window of the building into the dress, or when he flies off the bike at 80mph and kicks the guy at the end of the table.The ending was a little disappointing where it was revealed to be all a dream.

After a series of gags related to money, Buster, despite his bad financial condition, buys a cheap ring for the woman he is infatuated with, Kathryn McGuire (who plays herself), lying on the actual price of the article to pretend to be rich. However, the woman presents a rival in love that hinders Buster, even being accused for the theft of a watch, that the antagonist has actually committed. Then Keaton gets kicked out and returns to his work, where he dows and dreams of being a great and infallible detective: Sherlock Jr. \nEnd of spoilers.Comment:It is very difficult to find the right words that can describe in a comprehensive way this unattainable masterpiece. The technical level of the film is extraordinary and becomes unimaginable if it is contextualized in the release period: many scenes have an incredible impact on the spectator, Keaton can literally make possible the impossible and play to flip everything . The harmless becomes the danger, the adversities become supports that help him, what is not possible to think is physically expressed by breaking the limits of reality. The dreamlike dimension that succeeds in staging is really ingenious and supported by gags and situations that do not feel the slightest weight of the nearly 100 years that they carry, still proving hilarious even today. This film embodies the concept of \"immortal film\" like no other and is the ancestor not only with regard to the onirism (and therefore surrealism) but it is also one of the first movies (if not the first one) to approach the metacinema in a very deep way (which Keaton will face again a few years later as an actor, in \"The cameraman\" of E. Sedwick). In addition, it faces a immense variety of themes (such as love, ambition not fulfilled by fortune, poverty and many, many others) and enjoys a narrative structure very complex and hectic: in fact, you are dragged more and more by events in an increasing visual pleasure. It is entertainment in the true sense of the term, the one that rips the eyeballs and presses them strongly against the screen, bringing you to the end of the film in tears of sadness mixed with joy for the displeasure of the fact that, unfortunately, it has an end, demonstrating that no one has to dress up superhero's costumes, shoot laser beams or explode to entertain effectively and, why not, be also a bit original and refined. In addition, although it belongs to the comic genre, it also manages to have a rather serious vision and pessimistic of reality, this mainly due to the fact that the character of Keaton (like all his other movies) embodies the unfortunate man par excellence, although not everything in his misfortune ends up harming, and it is therefore clear the enormous influence that helped create donald duck, appeared for the first time only 10 years later. This is also a fact that consists of one of the main differences between the characters played by Keaton and the Charlot of Chaplin (often wrongly approached) and therefore also of their own way of making cinema, although both are perfectionists up to maniacal levels. Several times during the movie you will find yourself saying sentences like \"here the stuntman has really risked his life\" and know that it is always Keaton to do them, without a stunt. \nIn conclusion it is a necessary film, every cinephile must forcibly see it at least once in life (lasts 44 minutes and you can also find it on Youtube, so finding excuses for not doing it is impossible). It is the apex of the metacinema directed by his own father and most likely it is thanks to him (and Lumi\u00e8re brothers, too) if today we can taste directors like Lynch and films like \"The player\" of Robert altman, in addition to the similarities about the approach to the metacinema of Monty Phyton (especially In \"the meaning of life\").

The camera was on a track which allowed the shoot to follow the two walking. Most shots that I've seen from silent movies are shot without the camera moving.

The slapstick and deadpan humor is perfectly portrayed by Keaton and kept me laughing throughout all 45 minutes of this film. The entire cast fell into their acting roles impeccably but to me, Keaton was the shining star. A real original stuntman, Keaton performed the stunts himself on screen which could become quite dangerous such as the ladder scene underneath the water basin on the railroad tracks which, according to Dennis Schwartz, fractured his neck and often gave him migraines in the subsequent years. Keaton also performed stunts from his vaudeville days that i was truly marveled by. The use of these vaudeville acts and new camera tricks created, in my unofficial opinion, Keaton's magnum opus for an early silent film despite its original success being lackluster.

I really liked the creativity that Keaton used. At first the film was off to a slow start, but then gradually builds up. The way he used his imagination to have Keaton's character exit his own body while he was sleeping was really cool and it helped tell a story.

I noticed that while Chaplin decided to use a faster pace during chase scenes, Buster did not increase it nearly as much. Chaplin's speed is intentionally comical but in this film, slight speed was used to show urgency. I believe the greatest source of humor comes from the creativity of the detective.

So long as our amusement remains high enough to light his comedic fires, anything is possible.  As one of comedy's utmost pioneering figures, an aficionado of physical dares and frenetic sight gags, there's an agelessness, and an undying vitality, to be found in Keaton's finest works.  Though his heyday was at its most powerful long before John Wayne even made his film debut and long before Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers ever took their first steps together, his best efforts don't feel as though they're nearly a century old.  Innovative and spryly funny, they're cultural relics that also play as if they were made yesterday.\n\tSuch is the case with 1924's faultless \"Sherlock Jr.,\" among Keaton's greatest headliners and among the funniest silent comedies ever produced.  Only forty-five minutes in length, not a single moment is wasted; it's a bombshell of Keaton's special inflictions of deadpan expression and adrenaline laced (and gaspingly humorous) stunt work.  Though not an unparalleled success upon release - audiences were too smitten with the regal beauty of Rudolf Valentino and Pola Negri to flock to Keaton's astounding product obsessively - \"Sherlock Jr.'s\" rep has, understandably, only amassed in its respectability with the sands of time.\n\tIn the picture, Keaton, who also directs, stars as an unnamed theater projectionist clamoring to win the heart of a brunette society girl (Kathryn McGuire) with a sweet disposition.  Having little to his name, The Projectionist has, regardless of his background, mostly been successful in courtship, using his everyman charm to make up for the visible class differences between him and his lady.\n\tBut problems arise when a handsome scoundrel (Ward Crane) threatens to steal The Girl away from our hero.  A snaky bastard he is: he's not in the love with our leading lady - just her status - and is a scheming low-life with a weakness for pawning.  Early in the movie does he steal The Girl's father's (Joe Keaton) pocket watch and pin the blame on The Projectionist.  \n\tThe rest of \"Sherlock Jr.\" finds Keaton's character doing everything he can to clear his name and unmask his rival for what he truly is.  But the film hardly seems to be remembered for its inconsequential, \"real-world\" romance; what it's remembered for, after some ninety-two years of notoriety, is its dream sequence, which takes up most of \"Sherlock Jr.'s\" length.  In it, Keaton is sucked into the world of the movie he's projecting, which is a mystery not unlike the one he's experiencing currently.  But he's propelled from passivity to leading man status, given the confidence of the Detective Holmes he's emulating.  That's when the movie goes from cutesy rom-com to daring comedy - the action involves a gag featuring an exploding billiards ball and an insane (especially for its time) motorcycle chase - and, in the process, we metamorphose into a speechless audience instead of an acquiescent one.\n\tAnd there's an elatedness that comes along with being thrilled by a comedy, and \"Sherlock Jr.\" holds up.  Part of me wants it to be longer than forty-five minutes, considering just how much of a lovable pleaser it is, but it also seems about right for a picture that moves faster than the speed of light.  To stretch its running time would diminish the tightly wound perfection of Keaton's style.  He suffered as a result of its magnificence - he served as stunt double for every single one of his actors and was afflicted with the aftereffects of his injuries for years - but \"Sherlock Jr.,\" so awe-inspiring, is art worth suffering for.", "review_date": "2016-07-23", "source": "rt", "lang": "en"}, {"content": "Utterly charming and hilarious.", "review_date": "2016-04-20", "source": "rt", "lang": "en"}, {"content": "Far and wide legend Buster Keaton's best feature film, however only being 45m long.

This movie is just more than fantastic it is just flawless with its humour, its direction but also its use of technical cheats to make it look as if Keaton is for example jumping into the cinema screen or the camera work of a rather famous motorcycle scene and it's great to see in a movie made in the 1920's. The reason I think I and I think others can and have connected to this is because it is so simple yet so lovely, it is like a piece of art plastered onto the screen and made to move, a joy to watch and look at and is probably one the smartest ever silent movies.\n\nBuster Keaton stars in the movie as the film projectionist at the local cinema and he wants to be a detective, he even carries a little book around with how to take care of the situation should a crime arise. He is also in love with a girl called well, The Girl who is played by Kathryn McGuire and she also has interest from the local Sheik (Ward Crane) who isn't exactly a nice man in this story. Things really become even more crazy yet wonderful when the projectionist dozes off during a viewing and he dreams of himself being Sherlock Jr. When this happens the movie steps out of being a great one and becomes a masterpiece of camera trickery done so well indeed by Byron Houck and Elgin Lessley and that's not to mention the editing which is considered by editors themselves to be some of the best there is in film. The stories dream is magical, Keaton's stunts whilst in his dream and also out of it are mind blowing and done to such a degree that you fall in love with his acting skill.\n\nAt such a short running time you might expect not much and the chances of you loving this slim, well think again because this is probably the shortest film I have seen where I have already connected with the characters in the first 5 minutes. Keaton is incredible in this; many a fan of his and of silent film will point to \"The General\" as his greatest but for me this is Keaton not just at his stunt doing best, but at his most dramatic best too. Clyde Bruckman and the writers make a story that is ingenious and so well done but also well thought of, it's the kind of little movie that stands the test of time simply because it's so easy to watch but also contains such brilliant moments.\n\nAs you might guess there isn't a whole lot to say about a movie that by some organisations standards is not even a full feature film, but I think it is, it deserves credit for what it is and I am sure critics who like it would agree with me. I implore anyone to try this, even if you think you dislike silent movies because this is not only short but actually way more than just good, it is an actor at their finest and that's not to forget the technical team at that too. So overall I just felt Sherlock Jr. was a fine movie worthy of its praise and it's not often I feel such a perfect movie comes along from so long ago that even today is in my opinion an astounding picture, and one that I personally really loved.", "review_date": "2015-09-13", "source": "rt", "lang": "en"}, {"content": "Sherlock Jr. is a beautiful film.

With Sherlock Jr. we get a simple tale (which is always a better way to go with silent films) that is delightful in that we root for Keaton who plays the underdog of the story. Sadly, it doesn't live up to the status of The General.\n\nAs an early silent film, this movie sets a precedent for thinking about film - about half of this film is a dream sequence in which the film projectionist played by Keaton gets intertwined in a \"movie\" about his girlfriend and the man who framed him for stealing her father's pocket watch. Before the story of the dream begins, we have an out-of-body experience from the Keaton character who is interacting with what is presented on the movie screen.  This is the greatest sequence of this shorter film in my opinion as it has the audience think about their relation to the film when they go to the movies, and it uses humor by having Keaton's character clumsily fall over various times when the setting of the film changes and he remains constantly on the screen.\n\nA shorter film is great since its focus is simple and doesn't leave the audience bored with unnecessary content, but I feel this film was actually lacking content. I know this was released in the very early days of narrative cinema, but more character development could have helped this story as well as just a little bit more complexity in the plot.

So far I'm on Chaplin's side although I still have to give Keaton another shot with The General. Perhaps the problem I had with Sherlock Jr. is that I'm not a big fan of surreal films. I know everyone seems to love this genre, but there are very few surreal movies that work for me. I can see how Buster Keaton garners recognition for his magical work in this film, being one of the first to actually incorporate dream sequences into his movie. Many other films (and especially cartoons) were inspired from several scenes in Sherlock Jr, like the one in which Keaton's character jumps into a movie screen and becomes a character in the movie that is being projected (better known as \"the movie within a movie\" sequence). There are several action scenes including some spectacular chases that make you wonder how Keaton could have shot them way back in 1924. I was more impressed with this wizard like aspect of Keaton than on his comedic performance. His deadpan expressions were outdone by the gadgets he devised to create such advanced special effects. Despite being bored by the story, I have to give Keaton credit for his inventive and magical sequences.  \n\nAt the beginning of this silent film, written by Jean Havez, Joseph Mitchell, and Clyde Bruckman the title card reads: \"There is an old proverb which says: Don't try to do two things at once and expect to do justice to both. This is the story of a boy who tried it. While employed as a moving picture operator in a small town theater he was also studying to be a detective.\" We are then introduced to the projectionist (Buster Keaton) who is reading a detective book instead of cleaning up the theater. After work, he goes to visit his girl (Kathryn McGuire) and buys her a ring. Another man (played by Ward Crane), who is also fighting for the girl's affection happens to be at the house and steals her father's chain watch and incriminates the projectionist. The girl's father (Joe Keaton) kicks him out of his home and tells him never to return again. The projectionist sadly returns to work where he falls asleep and dreams of being a detective in the film that is being projected. In his dreams, he becomes the hero of the film and the adventure begins.\n\nBuster Keaton's film has some brilliant and magical sequences, and I think it is a bit unfair to compare him with Chaplin because he has a very different style. Chaplin has a more humane approach, writes his own stories and composes them as well, while Keaton does some impressive work behind the lens using some trickery. As performers they both have different styles, Chaplin uses a lot of physical comedy while Keaton uses deadpan humor and incorporates a lot of action scenes doing some risky stunts (in the train sequence he actually fractured his neck). Depending on which style you like best, you will probably claim Keaton or Chaplin is better, but it would be unfair to say one is less talented than the other because they both proved to be geniuses during the silent era and have left us with a rich legacy.

Open the champagne, cue the music, bring on the dancing horses!!!!!!!!!! In honor of this rare and very monumental occasion I decided to write a review of a great film by the beloved Buster Keaton. \"Sherlock Jr.\" is a silent era poster child for a brilliantly crafted film. Keaton, unlike many of his famous peers, seemed to push the envelope just a bit further and had an affinity for edge of your seat visual stunts that could have nearly killed him during filming. His projects had a tendency to go over budget, but it was well worth it considering you can watch a film like \"Sherlock Jr.\" and still be impressed 90 years later! \"Sherlock Jr.\" along with many of Keaton's other directorial projects is ahead of its time in many ways. The visual effects, stunts and cinematography was very progressive for the time and looked fantastic. The story is fun, witty and includes lots of physical humor (To be expected in a silent film!) Keaton shines as a star and simultaneously as a director. The risks he took performing death defying stunts for the audience's entertainment is shocking yet very admirable.

But while Chaplin successfully combined pathos with comedy, Buster has mastered the art of the straight face and stunt work. Keaton has had lots a great work (e.g. The General) but I believe that his greatest accomplishment would be his short comedy Sherlock Jr. \r\n\r\nSherlock does not feature the famous Doyle detective to which the name derives. The movie is instead about a film projectionist (Buster Keaton) who dreams of becoming a detective. He tries to woo the woman of his dreams with material object, though he is so down on his luck. \r\nBut then he is framed by a fellow suitor for the crime of stealing and pawning the watch of the girl's father. Depressed, the projectionist retreats to a movie fantasy world, where he is Sherlock Jr., the greatest detective in the world, who investigates a \"simple\" case of the theft of a necklace, with the help of his sidekick Gillette (\"a gem of a character ever ready in a scrape\"). \r\n\r\nThe movie features impossible-looking effects, stunts and magic tricks, entertain the viewer from start to finish. Its gags are bar none. For example, when Buster decides to \"closely\" shadow his suspect, or when Sherlock Jr. rides a bike driverless all the way to the criminal's location, passing by tons of obstacles on the way, a hilarious road scene that would not be equaled until W.C.
