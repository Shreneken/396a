            "content": "\"Pink Floyd The Wall\" is a great film, based on the already great album by Pink Floyd!  I was stunned by the use of imagery, combined with the great soundtrack of the album, which gave us a strange, drugged up vision of what a burnt out rock star would see.  It's really crazy!  Yet it shows how these famous rock stars are bombarded with fame and applause, and how insane it can drive an already disturbed person.  \"The Wall\" itself, is the isolation and separation from society and saneness, which is a place that can easily be avoided if only people gave us a fair chance to.  The depressing part about the film is that none of this is the rock star's fault.  He was driven to it by loneliness in his growing up years(since he lost his father to the war), along with psychological torment by his teachers, parents, and above all, his sexually controlling wife.  The movie is twisted because this is how the lead character sees the world.  Worse yet, after he has already been driven to the edge of his own sanity, in his mind, the people who drove him to that edge, come back to testify against him.  It's weird the first time you watch it, and looks a lot like a crazy music video that was pulled out of MTV.  The only difference is that this one is telling a story, and has been transferred to the big wide screen.  Alan Parker has directed the film, but Roger Waters seems to be in charge here, because it's his album, his story, and his conception.  All that's really been done here is transforming the album to celluloid.  I in some ways, like this better than the album, because now we have images to reinforce the songs and the story.  I wish I could have seen this on the big screen, because the variety of images and the loud music seem compressed and compacted on a small TV set.  You might not understand this the first time, especially if you haven't heard the album yet.  But it really is a great film, and it actually has a story and a point that most music videos today unfortunately lack!  I think that this film will teach people the reasons why these talented individuals suffer and lose their minds.  The people that have guided and taken care of them while they grew up, often take away their ability to happily and normally function on their own.  And the album and film's lesson is for not only the people who drove him to his wall to back off, but for him to pull himself out.",

As Plato said \" Only the dead have seen the end of war \" and that is bitterly true , man will always be man and man will always kill man until the end of time Pink goes to school and education is a double edged sword . It has the potential to educate young humans but as often happens these young humans find themselves being used as victims of whatever mood the teacher is in . Someone must pay for authorities inaquequacies Pink leaves school and falls in love , but love is the sharpest and most double edged sword in all of creation . It inspires but it also destroys us . Despite hundreds of millions of human beings being killed in wars , genocide and purges there is nothing so personally painful or as cruel as the betrayal by a lover . The darkest pits of Hell can not be as hellish or as sadistic as infidelity As Pink descends further into his personal madness we see him take his revenge . Humans are sexual beings and perhaps this is what makes us both demons and avenging angels . Irony is to the fore as he stops becoming a victim and turns into unfeeling fascist dictator . Someone must pay for all the wrongs Pink has endured and it's the innocent that must suffer You could go to the planet Nietsche with all the written works of every human philosopher who ever lived and that still wouldn't be enough to explain what it's like to be human . As it stands Alan Parker and Roger Waters have made a cogent film explaining why humans are the way they are and how they react to the surrounding universe . It's a film whose soundtrack is every bit as powerful as the human condition",

            "content": "Wow. this is truly a work of art. No, that isn't doing this movie justice. This is a masterpiece. No other rock opera, or most movies in general, can top the insanity that is this movie. This movie peers into the mind of an over protected, reclusive, and sometimes violent rock star, who has taken enough of life and the people in it. This is the story of Pink, poor old Pink, who's father left him one morning in black 44', and who's mother was so protective she smothered him with her love and all of her fears; who's wife tried so hard to open his heart, but found that nobody was home; and who eventually built a wall so high that he could not break free, and eventually his seclusion from the outside world brought out a side of Pink that he, nor the rest of the world, would wish to ever see. Soon his sadistic, Hitler-esc side takes control of the world, with help from his zombie like fans who follow any command that is thrown at them.But by the time the dictator is mentally faded away by Pink, and he is able to see that shielding himself from the world with his now endless wall is only driving him crazier, it could be too late. So goes the quote above, taken from \"The Trial\", which is the end of the Wall, and Pink's last chance for freedom from his Wall. This is just an outstanding movie. Everything works in this movie, the twisted live action, the animation that probably is what being insane is like, and, most of all, the music that is, in my opinion, the greatest album ever created (to Hell with Dark Side of the Moon, it was good, but it doesn't even compare to \"The Wall\"). Pink Floyd is my favorite band (along with The Who and The Rolling Stones, an odd combination, I know), and when their best album was made into a movie, I knew that Hollywood had at least a little common sense, even though Hollywood shunned it, and most of the reviews I've read here are negative, but I don't care, I'm watching it and enjoying for me, and no other opinion matters. My favorite songs off of this movie/album are \"Mother\", \"One of My Turns\", \"There's Nobody Home\", \"Comfortably Numb\" (probably my favorite song, actually), and, of course, \"The Trial\".  One last thing, if you are ever in a position where you have to choose between this and \"Tommy\", pick this, because \"Tommy\" wasn't very good. In-fact, if it didn't have the great music of The Who in it, I would say it blew. Just a quick reminder. 10/10",

            "content": "I have seen the movie several times now and every time I watch it I see something new, something I haven't seen or heard before. Some unsung line, some lost message... Every time I watch the movie I seem to dig deeper into this complex work of art.However, I cannot tell you how disappointed I am that this movie is so underestimated, and, above all, misunderstood. How many times have you heard someone say something like: \"You can't watch 'The Wall' unless you're really drunk or really high\" ? I have heard this line probably from every single person that has seen the movie and it hurts me so much that nobody really tries to understand the movie.The key to understanding the movie is in the lyrics. The movie is not just a long series of video clips that accompany the album. The images are just a final piece of the puzzle, the final touch on a magnificent piece of art.The first time I saw this movie I felt very embarassed. Yes, embarassed, because I felt like a fool for hearing the album so many times and not realizing what it was about. The movie made me appreciate the lyrics of a rock song for the first time in my life.The week after seeing \"The Wall\" for the first time I bought Pink Floyd's \"The Final Cut\". Do you know what was the first thing I did when I opened the CD case? I read the lyrics, from the first to the last word. And I actually tried to understand what the album was about.\"The Wall\" is so much more than you think it is. The only solution to not understaning the movie is watching it again and paying more attention. Once you get it, you will never forget it.",

            "content": "The opening tracking shot of a hotel hallway that resembles a prison should clue you in as to what awaits. There are so many things to like and be fascinated by in this movie. And for all of its avant-garde leanings, this is actually a very classically designed story. An iconoclastic music star, Pink Floyd, tries/tries not to think about his past and how he got to where he is, which is borderline psychotic. And because he's so disturbed, he can't even think in a linear way, so the journey we take into his mind is necessarily whacked-out.We also get to see how fascism is born from misdirected hate and idolatry. As a rock star, Floyd has seen the adulation of his audiences, so he's familiar with the phenomenon. But at the same time, he detests them for buying into his act. It's like the old Groucho Marx joke about refusing membership to any group who would let you in. He knows he's a fake (his teachers and people like his wife have told him so), so everyone else who thinks he's real must be fakes also. It's a big cyclic game. So he can't let any of them in, behind his wall, because they are, by definition, phony.It's interesting, also, to think about how he has turned full circle into fascism. It's just part of his dream and how he deals with his anger, but it's also an interesting reaction to the absent father. Had there been no homosexuals or Jews etc., there would have been no need for a Hitler, and therefore there would have been no need for his father to die. But instead of hating Nazis, he hates the people that \"provoked\" the Nazis. (I could go on for days with stuff like this, but I'll stop here.)Just watch the movie and be impressed with the way it works on so many levels.",

            "content": "Alan Parker has always had a gift for the integration of music and film, and his efforts over the years have reflected that. Movies like \"Fame\" & \"The Commitments\" have made him a director more remembered for his music video skills than his storytelling, even though he directed gripping controversial more seriously films, like \"Midnight Express,\" and \"Mississippi Burning.\" \"The Wall\" tells the account of a rock star's breakdown, Pink Floyd slowing down into madness... Pink's madness is illustrated with living flashbacks of his life... He has visions of his childhood from a baby held in the cradle to his present moment... We have little Pink suffering from alienation for the death of his father in the war, and taken under the care of his mother... We have also rock and roll star Pink, who is destroyed by his evident insanity and is driven over the edge by his wife's infidelity and we have a blown insane Pink, a Nazi dictator under the Hammer Regime leading a series of occurrences like raping, breaking and pillaging...Alan Parker translates the music into memorable images that are insensible to love or pity... All of Pink's life is projected on the screen... We see and hear songs altered from an abstract concept into a disgusting vision of students being thrown into a meat grinder...Pink constructs the wall by building up tension... In mixing up sexuality and violence, he creates a new window into Pink's character... The animated sequences that reflected Pink's foolishness are important and influential...Alan Parker's direction moves the story cleverly from the present into the past and into a possible future, drawing a warning, but still contemplating traumas of a child with hurtful effects on the fully grown man... The result is a mad piece of cinema, a kind of a bad dream becoming even worse than usual...The film exploits great special effects, some frightful and impossible to understand... The music praises the film so well from declaring noisy rock and roll music to quiet ballads of insanity...Bob Geldof is amazing as Pink, the British rock star broken in pieces under the psychological pressure of an American Tour...Pink Floyd-The Wall is a bizarre animation reinforcing its vision of an insane, inhumane, unjust and cruel world, not easy to follow...The film stands out as one of the classic in the teenage scene, specially teenagers who take or receive narcotic and due to its psychedelic nature leaves you greatly depressed...",

Maybe it's more enjoyable baked or drunk but what isn't? If you're under the age of 30 and over the age of 12 and haven't seen it feel free to join your generation anytime now. What you missing is a great movie about isolation, depression, and anger. And for those of you too baked for any amount of attention span put the movie on anyways cause the soundtrack rules. However if you ever run across a chance to see it at a theater, as a midnite matinee or just a run of old movies, pay any amount for admission it'll be worth it. For those of you who enjoy getting stoned and watching movies see Story Of Ricky. It's nearly as good as this. For those of you looking for insanity on video see Taxi Driver.",

Now he becomes a violent dictator and goes on trial in his mind, and tries to destroy the wall he built.\"The Wall\" is a depressive and touching film by Roger Waters from The Pink Floyd and directed by Alan Parker. The screenplay is fantastic and each time the viewer sees this film, he or she will certainly discover new details that have not paid attention. The cast is excellent, highlighting the presence of the cult-actress Jenny Wright in the role of a groupie. The outstanding music score by Pink Floyd completes this masterpiece.

To me, Roger Water's ability to express himself is outrageously smart. He is a genius. His English is masterful and the way he expresses how he feels is just mind-blowing. I am sure that every one of us has felt exactly the same as Pink/Roger felt at some point of our life but have never been able to successfully explain it. It is therefore my opinion that the lyrics are what make this film great. As a movie, it also translates those feelings well. All the actors were superb. Alan Parker managed to pull the whole thing together cleverly and all in all it is an excellent choice for a late night stoner's kick back - brilliant.",

Told with practically no dialogue, the only guide to the bizarre, frightening, and strange images is the incredible music by Pink Floyd, from their equally good double album. A considerable number of the songs were re-recorded for this movie, and one song (the heart-wrenching \"When the Tigers Broke Free\") was added. The new versions of the songs are sometimes worse than the album (Waiting for the Worms), and sometimes better (Mother, In the Flesh).\"The Wall\" isn't a pleasant movie, nor is it a simplistic or banal movie. It is brutal, cynical, and disturbing, but it has moments of flesh-tingling beauty and an uplifting message in the end, if you persevere. I recommend both it and the album to anyone who enjoys a powerful movie. In my opinion, \"The Wall,\" along with a few other albums, represents the pinnacle of rock music.",

Told in a non-linear fashion we see how he is effected by the loss of the father he never knew in the war; cruel teachers; a wife who leaves him; the adulation of his fans and too many drugs and finally how he grows to see himself as a fascist demagogue.This is a far from conventional film; there is a minimal amount of dialogue. Instead the story is told through the images we see and the music of Pink Floyd. The images are a mix of conventional live action shots of Pink's life; images of war and animation designed by Gerald Scarfe. This is sometimes tragic and sometimes brutally disturbing. The scenes we see perfectly match the music; adding something to what isn't there on the album in a way that makes it hard to just listen without recalling the imagery. The animated sequences demand separate mention; they are creative and shocking in a way one doesn't expect in western animation; they contain a sense of bleakness, brutality and even flowers that border on pornographic! Overall I'd say that this is a must see for fans of Pink Floyd and for those looking for something different who don't mind being disturbed.",

Though the viewer is sometimes left to sort out obscure animations and confusing images, it is not without direction. Subsequent viewings of this film reveal substance that only a genius could imbue in his writing. Character development through such subtle action in places casts a light upon Roger Waters as a person who understands the frailty of the human mind. The main character, Pink, portrays angles of the human condition we all face at some point by embodying a victimized character: sick over the loss of his father to the war; negatively spotlighted at school for talents that are apparently unfavorable at the time; unable or just unwilling to relate to his wife; and ultimately shut off from effectively relating to others because of an inability to express himself in ways that others understand.Not only is the story captivating, but the music is such that it will always be noted as not only ahead of its time, but timeless.The Wall is a masterpiece of storytelling, but not in the traditional sense. One must not watch this film expecting everything on a silver platter. Symbolism and metaphors abound, leaving a great deal of interpretation and adaptation to the viewer.

            "review_title": "Can you withstand The Wall",
            "content": "How to describe Pink Floyd The Wall? Feature length music video? Bad acid trip? Good acid trip? The Wall is one of those interesting experiments where I can imagine many people walking away, shaking their head, and saying \"What the hell was that?!?\" It is not a traditional narrative film by any definition, and yet it is not without some power from it's combination of images and music. It is difficult to define whether this is a film someone should check out or not, but it should mostly be based on your willingness to accept a movie that does not operate within the typical confines of standard cinema.The backstory to this project was formed when rock group Pink Floyd was wrapping up a major US tour in the 1970s and lead singer Roger Waters felt disconnection and contempt for his audience, going so far as to spit on a fan during the tour's final show. As a result of this experience, he conceived the concept album The Wall, a tale of isolation and the building of barriers between Waters and those around him. The album was later adapted into a major multimedia concert experience and finally, a film. Waters had originally wanted to film the concert, but director Alan Parker convinced him that that was a bad idea and instead pushed for an original film telling the story of the album in visuals. What emerged is an interesting collection of moments that do tell a tale of sorts, if a somewhat disjointed one.The basic outline of the film, as far as I can tell, is this: Pink (Bob Geldof), a rock singer, has isolated himself in a hotel suite and is slowly going insane. He remembers moments of his childhood, his father's perishing in World War II, his mother trying to fill the gaps, his education, etc. He later reminisces about his marriage and how he tries to push his wife away. He eventually snaps, trashing his hotel room and shaving off all his body hair in the process. When he is finally pulled out of his hotel room by his entourage, he envisions himself as a fascist dictator, bringing death and mayhem to all those around him.The above description is one interpretation of The Wall, I am sure there are others. The film is very much a tale about cutting oneself off from the world, retreating into the individual until there is nothing left for the mind to feed on but your own paranoia and unhappiness. Much of this material resonates, giving us a glimpse at ourselves at times. Parker's imagery, accompanied by animation by Gerald Scarfe, is surrealistic and difficult to penetrate at times, but The Wall eventually builds on you until you find yourself understanding more than you might think.Of course, the centerpiece of the film is the music by Pink Floyd. The Wall is often referred to as their greatest album, and it works well as a complement to the visuals. The music replaces dialogue in telling the tale, although, as with many rock albums, some of the lyrics are open for interpretation and if you are unfamiliar with the material, The Wall might prove more difficult to follow.Can I give The Wall a recommendation? To a certain extent, yes. It does have the ability to move you and some of the film's message is powerful and insightful. At the same time, is it easy to follow and without confusion? Not at all, and many people are just not comfortable with that kind of film. I would say that Pink Floyd The Wall is an acquired taste that may or may not be suitable for your palette.",

            "content": "Just saw the film a few weeks ago for the first time on DVD. The film looks good, sounds good, and it's still holding up not only with the passage of time but the passage of my own personal life. There are times when I pick up \"The Wall\" (the album), give it a listen and think to myself \"god, what a self-absorbed person this is\". But I realize in my better moments that Roger Waters was just letting us in on some of his deep personal issues. I used to not understand how politics and the whole fascist angle related to the rest of the film, but at this point it all makes sense to me. Waters is saying that the \"walls\" that we build up individually in our lives to protect ourselves and separate ourselves from others are just miniature versions of the political and social walls built up by people who rule over others through fear and intimidation.On a technical level, only the scenes which integrate animation with live action have aged somewhat poorly. The film still has a striking and unique visual style, even after all these years of MTV that have followed.Geldorf is sufficient as \"Pink\", though he doesn't get many lines or much to do except sit in that room.All in all, a great film for Floyd fans but it might leave some non fans scratching their heads, because it's a film you have to see a few times and think about if you really want to \"get\" it. I know this film was panned by a lot of critics and also a lot of them said the film's stance was insulting to the Floyd's core audience. I couldn't disagree more, I think the Floyd never made the mistake of under-estimating their audience's intelligence and that they were here making a personal statement not only about their own lives (primarily Waters' and Barrett's) but about the changes in how they interact with their fans.I agree though with Waters' comments on the documentary -- the film's great weakness is that it lacks humor, even the biting or negative humor of Floyd songs like \"Have a Cigar\". I think possibly doing part of the film in a less documentary style, especially \"Young Lust\" would have helped here.",

            "content": "I recently rented and re-watched Pink Floyd The Wall for the 200th time, and I had forgotten, over the years, why this is my favorite movie. Surprisingly, the reason it is so good has little to do with a rock star having a mental breakdown. Pink being a rock star is almost incidental to the real message of the film. It seems as if director Parker took the initial idea of Pink Floyd's album and ran away with it. The film serves less as a study of one celebrity individual, instead serving as a cinematic indictment of all of our worst aspects as human beings: cruelty, brutality, insanity, herd mentality, fascism--all the most negative traits of twentieth century man are splashed upon the movie screen, as if the Director was asking the audience \"Why?\" This is a film in rebellion against the status quo. Funny then, that it should be driven by the music of a major rock and roll band. But, all in all, that is besides the point. The film of the Wall begins and ends with scenes of oppression by authoritarian figures (police men, skinheads, teachers, etc.)It is almost as if the entire sub textual content of the film is drawing a parallel between the internal alienation of a single individual and the social and global alienation that fostered the cruelties of World War 2, the holocaust, ad infinitum. Pinks degeneration is the degeneration of Everyman, confronted by a world that is (still) spinning increasingly out of control, away from the light, further behind the wall of its own nihilistic will toward self-obliteration. The violence of the imagery, the final \"Trial\", and the psychic attack of the final montage of disturbing images (masked children put into a meat grinder, cartoon teachers becoming hammers, neo-Nazis on a rampage) as the scene fades into a blank grey wall, are grand, satirical, operatic \"Theater of Cruelty\" in a cinematic framework. But it is the final lyric (sung by a repulsive, animated \"Judge\") that puts the entire scope of this picture into focus: \"I sentence you to be EXPOSED before your peers...\" The Judge , of course, is not merely talking to the fictional \"Pink\", but to the viewers of the film, and well, the entire world, for all that, and again, the Director has, seemingly, high jacked the \"rock opera\" format, and used it as a vehicle to ask that ultimate question: why is mankind so mutually interested in its own self-destruction? Why do nations and civilized cultures slide easily into fascistic thinking? How many war orphans are we still, to this day, creating?I am not, now, a fan of Pink Floyd's music, although all of the music in this film is beyond excellent. Oddly enough, I am the farthest thing from the dope-smoking \"hippy\" that is supposed to be a Pink Floyd fan. I am an Industrial musician and a writer. My favorite music, at this point, is anything by NON, Throbbing Gristle, etc. This film has, over the years though, shaped my own artistic outlook in ways I am probably not even aware of. One does not need to smoke dope, or even be a Pink Floyd fan, to be affected quite deeply by this film. Roger Ebert once said that Star Wars was, to him at least \"a perfect film\". Well, Pink Floyd The Wall, to myself, is a perfect film, whether you are a pothead or no. I have given this film ten stars, but it is a little beyond that. If it was simply a rock movie, it could be rated in a conventional manner. But Allan Parker has done something here that is beyond even the concept of the bestselling album that this movie is based upon. He has crafted a surreal essay on the madness and self-destruction that lurks within the human spirit. And he has created one of the most sobering, angry, and dizzying satirical pieces ever committed to celluloid. In short, this film is a work of sheer, jaundiced brilliance.",

            "content": "I think the story of the film is amazing. At Los Angeles, in a hotel room, a rock star whose name is Pink decides to build a wall made of bricks after he took stock of his life. He wants to build it for several reasons: a lot of people made him suffer, especially his mother his wife and his teacher, he wants to protect his identity because school made him faceless and he feels frustrated by his past life. But  when he's going crazy, he is taken to a concert but he's still travelling  through his fears and his dreams. The wall is in himself and he'll have to tear it down and come back to reality. I saw this film when I was fifteen and it enchanted me because I'm a big fan of Pink Floyd. I saw it recently and curiously It left me unsatisfied. Alan Parker and Roger Waters have made an audacious and seductive film and this one features some clever visual and ringing brainwaves. Moreover Bob Geldof is quite convincing in the main role of this helpless and outraged man; and the animation sequences are very successful and they epitomize Pink's inner universe, particularly the last sequence with the hideous judge. However the screenplay of the film is very repetitive: when a lot of pictures are passing by very quickly, the film looks like a huge clip and this one is multiplying the flashy effects. As a conclusion, even if this film isn't a masterpiece, it's probably Parker's best musical film, at least better than the boring \"The Commitments\"",

The film was made when the fears expressed in the novel 1984 were still a threat, (as an aside, while the film was being made in England there was a political campaign comparing the then conservative government of M. Thatcher to the Orwellian fascist world of 1984.)But, as much as I and other members of my generation can relate to this film, does it have a message for today's youth.  I think that it definitely does.  The issues today may be different from those of the late 70's, but, the sentiment and the dangers are the same.  We have huge segments of alienated people, we have bigotry and hate, and we have governments which operate in secret.  We have movements that preach rigid conformity and hate, we have religions that have lost the message of caring and we have schools that only want to turn out mindless corporate robots.In fact, I think that this film, and therefore the message behind the music, is MORE important today.  The issues we as a society face now are far more dangerous to personal freedoms than when it was first released.",

Parker's expressionistic visuals, Gerald Scarfe's surreal animation and Floyd's pounding music make for an extraordinary experience in sensory overload, and manage to overcome lyricist Roger Waters's often off-putting self-indulgence.  While never really becoming more than a feature length music video, it's still a great film and has developed a vigorous cult following.  Waters has a cameo as one of the witnesses in the wedding scene.  Nell Campbell (aka Little Nell, from The Rocky Horror Picture Show) and Joanne Whalley appear briefly as groupies.

Something about devil worship that someone at school told me.\nAs time passed, I discovered \"Dark Side of the Moon\", thanks in part to the engineering credits (I love everything Alan Parsons has done). The incredible workmanship of the album drew me closer to the group. And even then, \"The Wall\" was the last album I bought. Then, when the deluxe DVD edition came out, I jumped at it.What can I say? I watched the movie 3 times, and I couldn't still fully understand it. I loved the animations and became intrigued by the inner motivations of the main character, although there were some parts of the movie I just couldn't make anything of it. Then I decided to watch the extra materials that came with the DVD, including the running commentary by Roger Waters. And it all made sense. This is one powerful movie, an interesting rebellion against rock stardom and its perks. It's completely unexpected, since we are listening to all of this from a rock star himself, which makes it all too real. The groupies, the drugs, the alienation, the feeling of being sick and fed up with it all. This is not an uplifting movie by any means. In fact, Roger Waters summed it up pretty well describing it as \"a sour 2 hours\". And the fact that Mr. Waters has never been able to fully recover from the loss of his father makes it even worse (almost every Pink Floyd album - and a complete album, The Final Cut - has a song about his death in WWII). Even with this cons, the film is a must see for the animation sequences. And Bob Geldof proves he can act.",

When it came time to turn the album into a film, I don't think the end result was as great but there's still quite a bit to admire in this Alan Parker film. The film centers on rock star Pink (Bob Geldof) who is losing a battle with his own paranoid mind where through flashbacks we see the loss of his father, his relationship with his mother and everything leading up to him being alone in a hotel room. PINK FLOYD: THE WALL isn't a complete success but at the same time you really have to respect Roger Waters and director Parker for doing as well as they did. For starters, this could have just been one music video after another but both men went the extra mile to make sure there was some sort of structure going on with the story. There are so many now legendary images that one is rather amazed that so much great footage was able to come out of this thing. There's the terrific WWII footage but also the scenes in the hotel room and especially a sequence there where Pink just rips the room apart. The way the slow motion is used helps build up the atmosphere but we also have some terrific animated sequences that are perfectly used and quite creative. The album itself was one great song after another and for the most part they're transfered over to the big screen quite well. The most popular song on the album is without question \"Another Brick in the Wall Part 2\" and it's also the highlight here. I'm sure quite a few people have lit up a joint during this song and the video here but even without the grass the thing is quite effective. \"Young Lust\" has always been one of my favorites and the sexuality of the song certainly comes out here. Other staples like \"Hey You\" and \"Comfortably Numb\" are also well handled but so are other tracks like \"The Happiest Days of Our Lives.\" There's no question that the music is just right for our ears and the visuals just right for our eyes but I do think the film starts to lose a little as it goes on. After a while the film starts to get a tad bit dry but there's still no question that it's an important film and one that does the album justice.",

In it he follows the mental disintegration of a rock star named Pink (Bob Geldof). We see his whole life--his childhood, having an unnatural affection for his mom, his failed marriage, his drug abuse, his feelings of being all alone...and Pink completely explodes. I saw it opening night in Boston--I HATED it! The stereo sound blasted my ears out and the film keeps hitting you with morbid images of death, sex and some truly disturbing animation paired with Pink Floyd's ear-splitting music. Critics hated it too--they didn't review it seriously and just acted like it was a MTV movie video (!!!!) It died over here in America.Seeing it years later I realized I was totally wrong. I was ready this time for the non-stop depressing imagery and was absolutely fascinated. This movie has a lot to say about society, education and war. It's not an easy film to watch (it got a R rating back then--it would easily get an NC-17 today) and it will leave you incredibly depressed. Still it's fascinating to watch.

Even Gerald Scarfe's animated sequences are a disaster. Roger Waters needs to get over himself. The Pink Floyd were the ultimate reclusive rock band of the 70s, their increasingly pompous records only building higher the edifice that Waters wants us to believe is so burdensome. The Wall is also filled with pathetic victimology: it's my father's fault! the headmaster did it to me! my mother smothered me! the government is bad! One could even make the case that Roger is jealous of his old chum Syd Barrett, who simply turned on, tuned in and dropped out to avoid the oh so heavy mantle that Waters now wears.There are two or three decent David Gilmour songs in this film.

The loss of his father, his relationship with his mother and wife, the teachers at the public school he attended and the burdens of rock stardom, all fit together to form his wall, that will eventually isolate him from society.

Scarfe's hallucinatory animation brings to life many songs from the album and gives the film a feel unlike any other.  Parker directs the live action with fire. One of the best sequences in the film is in the beginning.  As the housekeeper fiddles with Pink's door, we see in his mind a door locked with a chain move slightly.  Then, when the door opens and is stopped by the chain, the doors in Pink's mind fly open and thousands of fans rush in.  Then, Parker cuts to soldiers charging over beachheads as explosions scorch the land.  All of this is set to In The Flesh, the first track off of the album.

Nobody forces people to buy Pink Floyd's albums and subscribe to the school of thought that promotes blaming others for your problems. \"The Wall\" is the epitome of that school. \"The Wall\" the album, a collection of boring burlesque and pop numbers, is all about blaming others. Blame your parents, blame the school, blame your peers, blame the drugs, blame the government. Waters tries to steer you clear of all the responsibility.\"The Wall\" the movie is also about blaming others, but it is about bad acting, bad cinematography and bad direction as well. It's mostly about cheap symbolism (regarding totalitarianism), plainly obvious to anybody that has read a book or two (that is, educated himself).

This film primarily focuses on the fascism and destruction of WWII, told through the eyes of a drugged out rock star.This film is definitely about more than just Pink Floyd's great music. Pink goes through a metamorphosis in the course of the movie. Pink starts as drugged out zombie rock star that feels nothing, not even for his beautiful and sexy wife who he once loved deeply. There is a message to be had throughout this film, if you can look past the music and drugs commonly associated with Pink Floyd.Slowly Pink's emotions build until the only way to control them is to let them loose as he hits rock bottom, realizing in many ways he has given up everything for nothing. As he regroups, he becomes cold and calculating, 'there can be no exceptions'. This conflict is meant to show how often the pendulum swings from one extreme right to the opposite extreme. By the end of the film, Pink has figured out what it means to be normal.If you've never seen The Wall, I'd recommend you see it. It's not for children, it's rated R. If you identify with many societal problems, for example the problems with public schools, you'll probably identify with most of the movie. At the same time, some of these parts are a little slow and some might find them boring or pointless. If you like Pink Floyd's music, then you really shouldn't find any parts of the movie too painful.This movie basically covers most of the songs in The Wall album which were redone for this production. It also features some songs from Pink Floyd's The Final Cut album.

Growing up fatherless during the second world war, he tries to gain some sense of freedom with friends or family but feels his surroundings are entangling around his neck like a noose. Upon reaching stardom with his music, most of the time he spends alone watching old war programs, possibly wanting to see his father in some of the old reels. On top of that, his wife leaving him for an activist, leaving him completely alone. With his unbinding success as a rock star, his level of comprehension begins to fade away into something else, with the help of alcohol and drugs. His persona breaking down into a faded memory, culminating with past memories that continue to drown his reasoning, he metamorphosis's to what he hates the most. A self preserving ego maniac with a fascist complex. The artistry and music blended so well with his psychotic breakdown that he could not tell if he was dreaming or awake. This film will remain one of the most important classics to show what fame and fortune can do to a mans head. And why it is so important to the music industry today. From what I know the album (Dark side of the moon) has not left the charts for nearly thirty years for albums sold. Making this group (Pink Floyd) the most influential bands of all time. Excellent film, beautiful music.",

He is scarred by many things: the death of his father, a rough childhood, his overprotective mother, a failed marriage, and the rigors of the rock and roll lifestyle. His mind is packed with weird and chilling images: the horrors of war, visions of a fascist world, and the darkness in his own soul. He sees a horrible place where everyone is just a brick in the wall. This surreal rock video is a wonderful product from the lunatics in the heads of composer Roger Waters, director Alan Parker and designer Gerald Scarfe. The music is accompanied by many strange and unsettling scenes. Scarfe's animations add to the weirdness. Call \"The Wall\" a masterpiece or a nightmare. But you will see the strength that made this movie a cult classic.",

This movie helps you to appreciate the album even more. The movie its visuals support the lyrics from the songs from the album and helps you to understand what the lyrics are all truly about. It makes the movie work both as a rock/music movie and as a statement.The movie features lots of 'beautiful' visuals and is filled with symbolism and deeper meanings. It's really one of those movies in which you discover new things, you hadn't noticed before, on every viewing. The movie uses both live action footage and animated sequences. Both styles mix really well and especially the animated sequences are something truly unforgettable. A real piece of art! Especially the in my opinion, classic ending is a true pleasure to watch.The movie has lots of criticism on society and features elements such as; Relationships, childhood, WWII drug abuse, sex and fascism. It clearly is not a movie for just everyone. Most people will most likely find this movie just too 'odd' for their taste. Yes, visually it is an odd movie but the lyrics helps you to understand what this movie is truly about. I shall not pretend as if I fully understood every element of the movie but like I said before, you'll discover some new things every time you watch this movie.In my opinion everyone should give this movie a chance, at least once but it's recommended to watch this movie several times before judging it.10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

            "content": "(Hullo, Esteryosi! E-mail me.)Before I saw this \"legendary\" musical drama, the only song I ever knew from the album was \"Another Brick In The Wall\", a very good song with a terrific guitar solo. Surprise, surprise: it turned out to be by far the only good piece of music from the album/movie. \"The Wall\" is full of awful wailing (singing?) by Waters (or is it Gilmour? I really couldn't care less who was responsible for these ear-killing off-key vocals), and songs so forgettable I wouldn't even use them as fillers for far worse bands such as R.E.M. Even Michael Stipe deserves better filler songs! So much for the music.The movie is like a 90-minute MTV video. It is pretentious, confusing, and muddled, quite clearly conceived by an inferior mind who fancies himself a genius. (Plus, vague images lend themselves quite well to free interpretation, don't they?) Roger Waters: the man, the legend, the total and utter fool. Apparently, in order to catch all of Waters's trite \"messages\", one needs to have read the lyrics sheet beforehand. The singing, apart from being terrible, also requires subtitles. I've heard death metal bands whose lyrics are more audible. \"Shroovederr gooblred a blatt on the hrunkchgrbr...\" Huh? \"The Wall\" is basically a messy concoction of images that are intended to shock and provoke ANY kind of emotional reaction which would then lead the viewer to \"think\", speculate. To think very deeply. Oh-so veeery deeply about the amazingly deeeep messages: the kind of political and social babble one has become used to hearing from rock stars of questionable intelligence. Nazism comes out of personal frustrations? Sure, but perhaps it also comes from sheer psychopathy, i.e. has nothing to do with the up-bringing? I have always hated this idea that all tyrants and murderers had sad childhoods: what malarkey. That's the kind of rationalizing utilized by people too weak to face the cold realities of life. Besides, doesn't the extreme Left draw just as many lunatics into its own ranks? Not according to Waters, I'm sure. We will rarely or never see Communists being used as symbols of evil, in spite of the incredible amount of damage that ideology has inflicted in less than a century all over the globe. Instead, some left-wing viewers even see Geldoff's Nazi Party as a sort of \"clever\" jab at Thatcher's government, which is just the sort of nonsensical thinking one could expect from a band such as Pink Floyd. (Musicians, not thinkers - whatever they might think of themselves.) Speaking of symbolism, you'd think that the makers of this film would have realized that using a double hammer as the Nazi motif would be rather ironic because of the Communist hammer & sickle. I'm certain this was NOT intentional, because there was absolutely nothing about the way the Nazis were portrayed to suggest that this Party was supposed to have elements of the extreme Left in it, as well. It exposes how little intelligent thought went into the making of this dull movie.I am also annoyed by the general premise: a rock star, very annoyingly called Pink Floyd, can't come to terms with his father's death, the way the teachers treated him, that his wife cheated him, etc, hence falls into some emotional abyss that leads him into political extremism. The poor dear: everyone is to blame for his misery except himself. The fact that this unappealing, whining character is played by Bob Geldoff only makes things worse. However, it is fitting. Geldoff is just as arrogant and self-righteous as Roger Waters and his merry band of pretentious \"pomp rockers\".The movie has an ugly visual look to boot. Real-life scenes alternate with rather unoriginal, hippie-like animation, but the two never gel properly; it's as if they came from two different movies/projects.I love Waters's hypocrisy: in one song/scene there is criticism made of the materialistic pursuits of the modern world - just the kind of rubbish we often get from anti-Capitalist elitists. This, coming from a rock star who would rather have his legs amputated than rid himself of all his villas, yachts, fast cars and tons of cocaine??... Unbelievable. I love those jet-set \"humanitarians\".For more of my music-world rants, go to: http://rateyourmusic.com/collection/Fedor8/1",

I don't know if that can be said about other people, too, though. The movie is more or less a chain of good looking pictures, animation sequences with music. The story is somewhere \"hidden\" in the background. If I hadn't read about \"The Wall\" before, I probably wouldn't have had the foggiest idea what was going on. Also, non-Floyd fans or people who never heard anything about \"The Wall\" may be annoyed by Roger Water's rather arbitrary critizism on parenthood, teachers, politics and society in general.The movie represents everything the album stands for and gives us a pretty good vision of the pictures Roger Waters wants us to see when we listen to the music. It's all very artsy fartsy and pretentious but it really couldn't have been done any other way. Seeing how other great concept albums were turned into terrible movies (\"Tommy\"!) one must say that \"The Wall\" is one of the best Rock-movies there is. The Who's \"Quadrophenia\" is still my favourite, though.",

He only comes to life when a bunch of people have to give him a drug injection so he can perform a concert show.The movie is based on Pink Floyd's super-hit album \"The Wall\", though one song is referenced that wasn't in the album. But what does the movie represent? Pink has as much character as a department store mannequin, and we don't really find out anything about him, or why he is such a passive character.

It's really metaphorical, has hardly any dialogue, and if you do know and like the album, you'll absolutely adore it.Because this isn't a traditional musical, it's more akin to a 90 minute music video, with not much time spent not listening to the songs from the album, so if you do like the album, then like me, you'll probably be over the moon at having a version of it with visuals added.And what an amazing visual experience it is. The directing and cinematography are pitch perfect, the production design is great, and the symbolism is mind-blowing...most of the time.Every so often it gets a little full of itself, like with the flowers having sex (I've thought about it, and if anyone has a damn clue what that means, please enlighten me), or with that minute long scene of people looting a shop that has nothing to do with anything, but man, the story this tells aside from that is bloody amazing.Structured perfectly, has aged almost perfectly, and its central character is one of the best examples of the tortured rockstar ever, and all with virtually no dialogue, this is just about as perfect of an adaptation as you could ask for if you're a fan of the album.Although I must protest the fact they cut out Hey You, that's one of my favourite songs on the album and has basically the same meaning as the next song, that they kept, except it's worse.Also I can only imagine the look on Roger Waters' face when Alan Parker told him he couldn't play the main character in a film he wrote, based on an album he wrote, because he wasn't a good enough actor, and then got another rockstar to play the role instead.That's more than just another brick in the wall at that point, that's an entire wall's worth of cement.",

The animation is terrific, and would be great as separate music videos, but being part of the film they don't really fit with the plot (However they do add to the altogether strangeness which might have been what they were going for).

He cannot reproduce the differing of a mad man, and his voice struggles to convey bombastic Waters' songs. The film is so sickly gory and slow that I started yawning after 20 minutes.

            "content": "I'll try my best to sum up the plot of a movie which really doesn't follow any regular conventions. Basically, it's about the rock star Pink, who in later years has isolated himself so much from people he's continuously going insane, either sitting in a cathatonic state in front of the TV, or having violent outbursts. This is accompanied mostly through visuals, and almost exclusively dialogue and music taken from Pink Floyd's album The Wall.I always like to watch a movie sometimes which challenges my senses. Which really takes you on a ride and never lets go. Having read only the one-line summary about the film, I didn't know what to expect. At first, I'll admit I was a little confused. Is it supposed to be like this the whole time? The dialogue was weirdly low at times, while the music was MUCH louder by comparison. I was starting to get a bit worried this would be one of those movies everyone else loves, but I don't get. My least favorite kind of disappointment.And then... It suddenly clicked for me.I don't know what it was, but I reached a certain point where I gained a much better understanding of what the film was trying to communicate, how the heavy reliance on lyrics for telling a story actually enhanced it instead of hindered it. It's not even just the lyrics which make it work so well, but the actual mechanics of at which moments a certain song is used as well. The dreary kind of music used in scenes where the police is mercilessly beating people down and even going so far as to rape some of them. And whenever you reach a shocking moment (that bear in mind, you're never prepared for), the music sounds panicky and invoke a sense of terror. I don't think I ever startled more than when a groupie enters Pink's room, and he sits there completely motionless, only blinking when he stares at the TV. Not even when she oddly enough sucks his fingers he gives any sort of reaction, outside of maybe a small hand gesture for her to leave him alone. He doesn't say a single word either. And then just SUDDENLY, HE STANDS UP! And starts screaming, throwing and turning over objects, trying to hurt her just for being there, and finally throws out his good ol' tube. Interestingly enough, his line when throwing out the TV set is the only line he had that was written specifically for the movie. And even though you're wondering what he means when he says it, it really emphasizes the craziness of the whole situation.Fortunately, there are some explanations provided for why he has reached a mental state where he's trapped inside himself, and won't let anyone in. As a child, he was rejected and had a mother who didn't care about him, a school which nothing more than reprimanded him, a father who died in the war, and had to witness the destruction of all things good, tons of lives lost to a cause worth nothing. And the relentless school teacher? That's his step father. His life has been a nightmare all along, and we see him trying to connect with other people but never going anywhere. The TV which he mindlessly watches becomes his only comfort in life.But one can't go without mentioning the beautiful animated sequences, which overflow with such creativity and unforgettable visuals. There is the iconic scene where two flowers carefully approach the other, with relatively calm music playing. And then, as they violently f\u00f9ck each other the sound gets louder, and it's suddenly kinda scary to watch. I don't even know why it is, but something about it is so bizzarre you are taken aback. The album cover and poster for The Wall are represented as well.The poster shows up as a screaming face emerging from the wall, and even though it's brief all three times, it's just as terrifying as you would imagine it. That poster still makes the list of one of the scariest posters I've seen next to Zazie. As for the album cover, it manifests itself in several forms. First as unbreakable, a wall which Pink tries to get through, but just won't relent no matter how much he tries, and then at the end when he finally breaks the wall, as a symbol of freedom. He's finally broken the evil circle, he will no longer stay isolated from everyone.I have to applaud the bravery of Alan Parker for taking on this project. Nobody understood it at the time it came out, and sadly, Parker himself thinks he failed as well. Don't worry, Parker. We understand now what you were trying to do, and if you ask me, you succeeded.",

Let it be known and heard that the band's cult film Pink Floyd: The Wall has more knowledgeable and thought-provoking things to say than anything any of those circles ever said.The film is a deafening, absolutely incomparable movie-experience and an aesthetic and narrative breakthrough for music-documentaries. The film doesn't assume the basic qualities of conventional rock-documentaries, not becoming a concert-film or profiling a band and getting down to what makes them unique and noteworthy. It destroys conventionality within the genre, assuming the qualities of startling and powerful impressionistic and expressionistic cinema simultaneously.The Wall assumes a loose narrative, following Pink (Bob Geldof), the increasingly detached narrator of the film who has wicked, often explicit hallucinations. His hallucinations feature violent depictions of war, disturbing videos of children singing harmoniously to music, and many others that I do not want to spoil. The film is only disjointed if that's how you choose to view it, meaning if you seek to find meaning and piece together its small vignettes into something larger and more universal, you'll have an effective picture in terms or thematic relevance. If you watch the film solely for the images, sound, music, and content, then you get the expressionism I spoke of earlier.Ultimately, the film's central theme - at least in my eyes - is self-destruction, from a domestic and global perspective in addition to a more personal one. Its constant images of violence, torment, and the dehumanization of children can effectively state that the film's central ideas deal with that of destruction from the inside rather than outside forces. Combined with these live-action and animated clips (brilliantly directed by Gerald Scarfe) are the songs of Floyd's enigmatic masterwork of an album The Wall, which was released in 1979.Rarely has rock music achieved heights these high. Rarely have themes such as isolation, desperation, and self-destruction been so prominent and affecting on the viewer. At ninety-five minutes long, Pink Floyd: The Wall has the impact of an epic, and works on levels from an excellent portrait of a rock album to a compelling and elusive tone-poem on the state of the America and the common man.Starring: Bob Geldof.

After that Roger felt that a wall was built between he and the public, and that incident became the concept of Pink Floyd's future album The Wall, released in 1979. The album was a huge hit, and some of their great classics songs were present in that album such as \"Another Brick in the Wall\", \"Run Like Hell\", \"Comfortably Numb\" and many others. But the story doesn't end here. In 1982, Roger wrote an screenplay based on the album's songs and once again the concept was the wall dividing the artist and the crowd. Finally Alan Parker was brought to direct \"Pink Floyd The Wall\" in what later he would call as \"the most expensive student film ever made.\" To explain the story of the movie is to reduce its greatness, its magical moments, the metaphorical aspects of such a masterpiece yet to be understood. With almost no kind of dialogs and filled with Pink Floyd's songs, the movie tells the story of Pink, a depressed rock star (played by The Boomtown Rats lead singer Bob Geldof), cloistered in a hotel room, or as he thinks, a wall that kept him safe of everything and everyone. The movie then flashes back to Pink's childhood during the war years when his father died, his repressed school days (the \"Another Brick in the Wall\" moment), and then move forward to his marriage with an groupie, his rock n'roll days, and his Neo-Nazi hallucinations when Pink thinks he's a leader of a Nazi group (their symbol is a hammer) that eliminates ethnic minorities. In short, it is the rise and fall of Pink's metaphorical wall and the way he deals with it. When I watched it five years ago I wasn't a Pink Floyd fan and I only watched because it was an Alan Parker film and people said that this was an acclaimed film. I watched it, enjoyed most of it, really liked it but I didn't understood almost anything of what this movie was about. Then I watched again and I really felt that this is really a very good film, very enjoyable, one of those movies that it only gets better the more you watch over and over again. It's a work that leaves the audience takes their own conclusions about the story through images, animations, and of course, the great poetry present in the musics. It's an experience like everything involving Pink Floyd but it's also a cinematic experience for anyone who enjoys movies. Some people may leave it after a few minutes because it's not an conventional movie with a developed storyline, it has many flashbacks, it is more like an long video clip but with a story. Those who doesn't like metaphors, ideological concepts stay out and go watch \"Scary Movie\". But if you're an Pink Floyd fan watch it, and even better buy it if you can. To see the songs along with the incredible music of David Gilmour, Richard Wright, Nick Mason and Roger Waters is an very pleasant experience. You're definitely going to sing along with the movie. The best scenes in the movie are: the animated sequence when it's played \"Goodbye Blue Sky\" (remind me of Todd McFarland's work); Pink being rescued by medics and his manager (Bob Hoskins), the song played is \"Comfortably Numb\"; \"Run Like Hell\" played in the Nazi attacks; Pink remembering strange moments with his mother (the song played is \"Mother\")and the most awaited scene, the huge hit \"Another Brick in the wall\", when Pink's at the school being insulted by the teacher because he writes poems (the song \"Money\") during class. This scene is very well-known because later MTV would used as the official video for the song back in 1980's. It may not have any great performances, and it's visual sets will remind you of \"A Clockwork Orange\", but it's a wonderful movie. Highly recommended as one of Alan Parker's masterpieces along with \"Mississippi Burning\" and \"The Commitments\". I hope that someday someone transforms Pink Floyd's album \"The Dark Side of the Moon\" into a movie. That would be excellent! 10/10",

            "content": "Some people have told me that they didn't like this movie because they didn't understand it. Well, the first time I saw it, I understood it perfectly. This movie is excellent, is my favorite movie. Pink Floyd made an excellent work here. The movie is about a non-existent singer called Pink Floyd (as the real band). In the beginning, it shows Pink in his hotel, and then it comes to Pink's childhood. It shows Pink as a child and his mother, and how he loved her. After this, it shows Pink's terrible life at school. In the school \"there were certain teachers who would harm the children anyway they could\". With this life and the fact that the father died in World War II, it starts to make Pink insane. He, in his mind, starts to imagine things, and to create \"his own world\". This \"world\" is, in some way, the real world, but represented in another way. In this world, the faces of the children are masks, meaning that the teachers don't let the children see what is happening really, but hiding everything, and doing everything as the teachers want. In his imagination, Pink burns the school with other children, perfectly singing \"We don't need no education...\". But nothing really happens, is just in his mind. At the beginning, the links between the past, far-away past and present are very present. But later it stays in the present, and it shows Pink's life, with his wife. Because of this sad childhood, Pink is really depressive. So his wife goes with another man. And this is just \"another brick in the wall\". The wall is what Pink was creating since he was a child, that is, his own world, in his mind. In various parts of the movie we hear \"this is just another brick in the wall\", that is, another reason for Pink to continue doing the wall. After his wife leaves him, Pink goes with another woman, because he \"needs a dirty woman\". But this is just to prove that his wife's choice doesn't hurt him, because he's going with another woman. But he really doesn't do anything with her. Instead of that, he destroys his apartment. That's how the wall works. Everything after that are just bricks in the wall. And then, in fact, it shows a wall. This movie has various representations and we have to interpret it. That wall, completed, represents that Pink's world is complete in his mind. Now he just has to use it. Pink's life is confusing after this. It shows again links to the past, and then returning to the present. It all ends when Pink's manager discovers him drugged, and he takes him to the hospital. But in his way, Pink, in his wall, imagines that he has transformed in someone like Hitler. And that's how the wall works. The Hitler group, instead of be called \"Nazi\", are called \"Hammer\", but are with the same colors. Then he goes everywhere with this group, and is really a Nazi group, following \"the queers and the coons and the reds and the Jews\". But this is just in his mind, nothing of that is really happening. But then he realizes that everything's wrong, that he wants a break of the wall. What is happening really is, maybe, that he's in the hospital (after all the drugs that he has as we see before). How he says that he wants a break? In this way: before it was mentioned that he has \"a little black book with his poems in\" (also seen in his school). Well, in his mind, he's reading a poem (that is really a Pink Floyd's song), called Stop, and he says, \"I wanna go home, take of this uniform and leave the show... I'm waiting in this cell because I have to know, have I been guilty all this time...?\". Guilty of making all that stuff like Hitler, in his mind. In the wall, this is good, but in the real world, this is bad. So he is not sure that what he's doing. Really, he's saying \"What I do, is good or bad?\". But because he has entered the wall, and now he has put a doubt about it, he goes into trial. In the trial, he's found guilty. And he's expelled of the wall. What is really happening? Pink's world is over. Pink has died (probably in the hospital), and this is confirmed by his last scream (when the wall explodes). The last scene shows children picking some stuff from the ground. That is how the world will end. A great movie. If you haven't seen it, see it now. The album is also great. Some tracks have changed. The movie is incredible-good-narrated with Pink Floyd's songs.",

Because Roger Waters (former leader of Pink Floyd) forgot that he was a songwriter and not a screenwriter, this eroding feature film version of the band's blockbuster concept album follows the album to a T, proving itself undeniably predictable. \"The Wall\" (fantastic as an album) tells the story of Pink (Bob Geldof), a rock star who is traumatized by memories of an overprotective mother, wicked schoolteachers, a cheating wife, and a father he never knew. The poor, amateur script leaves no character exploration or that much of a plot for that matter. Geldof does little more than some singing and tantrum throwing, and when he's not doing that, he's staring into space in his hotel room. Parker's expertise was wasted on this \"movie\"...the term is is used loosely, seeing as how \"The Wall\" is basically a two hour promo. Political cartoonist Gerald Scarfe's animation sequences are somewhat worthwhile, and the great music of Pink Floyd is always great to enjoy, but the film is just plain bad. Though it does remind the audience how awful it must be to be a famous, rich rock star.",

The overall execution is uneven, but the messages do get through. It is worth watching, if it is possible, with subtitles, in order than one understands all the lyrics, as they fit the imagery well. There is not much of a story here, and some segments are perhaps a tad excessive, but there are a lot of good points about this production, including a good sound design and smart editing. It is a video clip to Pink Floyd's album The Wall too, and some say it is the longest video clip ever filmed. Either way, it is certainly a unique cinematic experience at least.",

Also, Waters' original vision is found in the album without being filtered through the likes of Parsons and Scarfe, although they in my opinion did and excellent job. Finally, to get the full effect of music in a narrative form, such as THE WALL, one must create their own images of the music, for if you view someone else's interpretation first, it takes away the interactive aspect for the fans.

Also there are flashbacks to the fifties of how Pink, well Waters really, became a rock star by writing lyrics to what would become Pink Floyd songs during school lessons to the dismay of his teachers, who are shown up as sadistic buffoons.Later in the film Pink, high on drugs, descends into madness and smashes up his hotel room and attacks a groupie. When he is sedated and drifts into a deep sleep, Bob Hoskins has a decent cameo as his manager, Pink dreams he has become a fascist leader at a mass rally similar to a huge concert, but with the difference that the music is inciting hatred and violence. ( While you might wonder what this has to do with a left leaning figure like Waters, he was highly critical of the extreme Right and nationalism on The Wall). Finally the film ends with Pink being trapped behind a huge wall.OK non fans will hate it, as you have to have a deep understanding of Roger Waters mindset in 1979 and what inspired the film and album, but for all fans of Waters and Pink Floyd, The Wall is a must see film.",

Well, like so many of my generation, I grew up hearing Pink Floyd ad nauseam on the radio, never thinking much about it; their music was bizarre, otherworldly, and dreamlike, but nonetheless heard too often to be really appreciated. Fast forward to about 19. One of their songs from Dark Side of the Moon entered my head. Music always enters when I awake, even something I haven't heard in many years.So I sat down and listened, for the first time, really listened. It was like hearing Pink Floyd for the first time. The lyrics were... I couldn't believe it. Disillusioned with society, the narrator sees through all the stupid games, meaningless rituals and trappings that amount to an ultimately meaningless existence. Money, time... all a poison for the soul and the world that most people drift through without a second glance is a nightmare to anyone who sees it with these cold eyes. It was all spelled out there, as if straight from my mind but more clear and complete. So Dark Side of the Moon suddenly made sense, was completely profound and profoundly personal I had a similar experience with The Wall. This too was heard endlessly on the radio without thinking much of it, even after my aforementioned revelation. Only when I saw this film did it really fall into place, and in a major way. Pink Floyd: The Wall is many things to me. Depressing it certainly is, and a dangerous film for anyone battling depression. It broadens the world view introduced on Dark Side, adding to the bleakness, only this time the insanity flirted with on \"Brain Damage\" is explored in full.I haven't gone through absolutely everything that Pink experiences in the film (and I hope no one has to), but many of the scenes are a bit too real. They hit hard, and that's one thing about these Pink Floyd albums: they're profound and potentially beneficial, but far from easy to digest. I guess that's why I don't listen to them often; they're for special occasions when I'm truly ready for the trip.The Wall is indeed personal; I envisioned making this kind of movie years before I saw it. I'm a lover of the surreal and this movie certainly has that, not only in the excellently twisted animation of Gerald Scarfe but the central narrative in general. The animations, of course, complete the music like its missing half. These also create the most disturbing moments, the parts of the film that will really stay with you.The acting is great; I love the spontaneity and risks taken to ensure its realness - I certainly noticed that. The masks are appropriate, there's no other word for it, and the school children walking in unison was a great nod to Metropolis. Anyway, the way the visuals accompany the music is sometimes sad, or discomforting, but always completely fitting. Maybe I'll write more later. Right now I'm deliriously tired.",

PINK FLOYD: THE WALL is the movie of the album that hit us right between the teens, embedded in the darkest crouch of our gargoyle brains.A welcome ominous pleasure to see that the movie retained the frantic darkness of the album, Roger Waters' layered vision of psychological crippling through parents, teachers and society brought to primal screaming life by director Alan Parker channeling Ken Russell. As one of the greatest - if not THE greatest - Pink Floyd albums provides the soundtrack, we follow little Pink from his youth as a fatherless 5-year-old, hungering for human contact when his mother leaves him to the loneliness of the schoolyard, holding the hand of any strange parent that happens by. Like The Who's Tommy, whose father was lost to a World War, so too was Pink's, described in the tear-welling epic, When the Tigers Broke Free; through grade school where his noisome teacher (Alex McEvoy) scolds him publicly for writing poetry (and reads out the lyrics to Money); onto his eventual consecration as a disillusioned rock star (Bob Geldof, playing the adult Pink with fascist brio), addled by painkillers, uppers, downers, dumb bitches with smooth ta-tas and delusions of Messianic grandeur. The Wall alluded to passim is the psychological shield that Pink constructs from youth to guard himself from the pain of love, life and death. That's about everything, innit? That's why we all have Walls. That's why we were hit between the shoulder blades like a target was painted there, by the genius of Roger Waters.THE WALL is violent, grisly, disturbing; part live action and part scarring cartoons (by British caricaturist Gerald Scarfe, whose work resembles another Brit his same age, Ralph Steadman, Hunter S. Thompson's faithful liege); school kids with putty visages marching into a sausage-maker; double-hammers marching - a truly frightening metaphor; mating dances of flowers, garish nightmare peoploids... The visuals are not in any way sanitized for wide audiences; it is pure teen angst dire enough to choke the worms eating into your brain. Of course, the single, Another Brick in The Wall (Part II) dominates the sensibilities - it was so huge, I got sick of hearing it at the time of its release. Only within the context of its surrounding masterworks can I tolerate this song. It is serendipitous that Waters' voice sounds like it might be Geldof's. (At this point, Geldof was still the lead vocalist for The Boomtown Rats, not the Live Aid Saint he would transmorph into very shortly.) Geldof re-recorded his own voice for In The Flesh? and In The Flesh, and Parker used real neo-Nazis for the crowd scenes. I'd wager none of them realized the movie was ANTI-fascist and a sarcastic stab to their religion. The grandest irony that Roger Waters worked into this masterpiece is the fact that if constructing The Wall to hide from society is a handicap, then tearing down the Wall should be the solution to an open, rewarding life - \"there must have been a door there in the wall for when I came in\" (The Trial). Instead, by existing behind that Wall for so long, tearing it down actually becomes a punishment, an unwanted exposure! The Worm Judge, infuriated with Pink \"caught red-handed showing feelings of an almost human nature\" sentences him not to imprisonment - but to \"tear down the Wall\"! O Roger, thou mistress of pithy parody!I have become Comfortably Numb.",

When a book is made into a movie, the movie usually dictates the point of view they WANT you to see it from. Same story goes here with The Wall.Going by the movie, everything you may have thought was correct about The Wall must have been wrong since they had to sell out and couldn't make enough money without a multi-platinum album. The biggest one comes with drugs. The movie makes out the main character as if he's a junkie, while the album had nothing to do with drugs up until Comfortably Numb. That's a joke here. The other largest plot hole that is reversed in the album is \"Young Lust\" according to the album I'm pretty sure that he found out his wife was cheating on him, BEFORE he started sleeping around. In the movie it's the other way around.If you're a real fan and want to see the real way The Wall was meant to be told, check out \"Is There Anybody Out There? The Wall Live\". The live theatrical performance is far more mind blowing and entertaining than anything in this film. The Wall is easily one of the greatest stories ever told in music but also the true breaking point of Pink Floyd. For my money I wouldn't say it's their best album (Think Dark Side of the Moon or Wish You Were Here) but it is a statement of how over blown Roger Waters ego had become. This is more of Roger's album than the band, which is why I don't consider it their best work. When they work together as a band you got better albums.This film really should be an example of why albums should never ever be even considered to be made into films. There is a great number of concept albums in this world that really are touching besides The Wall that have not been ruined by films. After watching this movie, I got the point why David Bowie never wanted Ziggy Stardust to be a movie character. It totally ruins the story and concept as a whole.",

Indeed, he represents all of humanity. We all have our walls, his was just larger. We are all afraid on some level of being exposed before our peers. His defense of being so exposed isolated him and drove him insane. The film is a lesson that we should be careful when building our walls that we do not cut ourselves off as Pink did.\nAnother way to take the movie is as a way of hypothesizing about the rationales in WWII. In the movie and the album, there are undeniable references to the war and the Holocaust. \"Vera Lynn,\" \"In the Flesh,\" and \"The Trial\" are all songs in which direct Holocaust referencing is used. Perhaps Hitler had a wall as well?\nOf course, there are a myriad interpretations and levels upon which the film can be viewed. I hope that for years to come, no one forgets this film and the lasting impression it leaves.",

See, in the 70s and 80s, \"artists\" figured out that if you just threw enough images and references into something -- like tons -- the audience would do the rest of the work trying to make sense of it. That's The Wall. It features a good soundtrack but a baroque narrative, if you could call it that.There's some hoity-toity rock n' roll claptrap about a musician descending into madness because of his social isolation, which is, of course, supposed to be ironic given he's idolized by millions. Everything is available -- sex, drugs, drink, money, adulation. But he's burned out by it all. Oh, and women's breasts.There's a lot of juvenile psychological subtext, all going back to his childhood, the oppression of the British education in the 50s or whatever, and on and on. About the only thing profound -- but not so much -- is all the self-indulgence and self-importance leads to fascist ninnies who want to burn the world down while thinking they're going to live forever.Look, the biggest reason to watch this is the music, and it's Pink Floyd, whose simple but satisfying chords are like if the James Bond composer did rock songs with lyrics that I'm sure are preachy and insightful in some ways but really you don't need to pay attention to to enjoy the songs.The rest of this is just over-the-top self importance of the mostly emotionally flat variety. For years I heard what a great movie this was, but in the end, it just seems like an MTV (back when they played music) video stretched out more than an hour too long.",

            "content": "I give this DVD an 8 out of 10.  I give the film itself a  7. The DVD adheres to Pink Floyd's standards,  very creative and thorough. One of the best features is an off-the-cuff commentary by Roger Waters and Gerald Scarfe,  who are obviously good friends.  Being an ardent Pink Floyd fan all my life,  there are poignant bits of Waters' personal history discussed in relation to the semi-autobiographical film.  For instance,  I never really knew that most of the album `Wish you were here' was about Water's loss of his friend and former band-mate Syd Barrett.  Waters also starts joking during a scene where Bob Geldof is up against the large brick wall in the film,  eluding to the IRA.   The film itself looks great,  with `the Wall' soundtrack,  mostly remixed and re-recorded for the film, providing a great aural experience.   There are 2 documentaries,  one produced around the time it was made,  and a recent retrospect.  These also provide insight into the concepts and execution of the film.  Also featured is the deleted `Hey You',  which was cut from the film to move the story along,  despite it being one of the more popular songs from the album. Scarfe's striking artwork and movie stills are also included. The film itself really is like an extended music video.  The imagery eludes to Water's childhood,  complimented by psychotic animation produced by Scarfe.   It also falls victim to some of the trappings of an MTV video. Such as a hall full of skinheads doing dance moves (hokey!),  or major characters in weird makeup looking into the camera.  The main themes repeat themselves throughout the film,  mainly because the music itself wallows in it's loneliness.  I saw this film 3 times when it came out while I was in high school.  After watching it again about 18 years later,  I realise that I should be aware of the materialistic aspect of barricading yourself behind the wall of toys available these days, (`13 channels of sh*t' now is 123 channels of sh*t).  With things like the internet,  we are increasingly living virtual lives instead of real ones.",

            "content": "There actually was a time (and it wasn't that long ago) when Roger Waters' lyrics to The Wall truly impressed me. Yeah. I thought that his words were some of the most intelligent and insightful that I had ever-ever heard in the genre of Rock'n'Roll (or in any other genre of music, for that matter) since the beginning of time.Now, don't get me wrong here, Waters' lyrics are supremely clever. And it's pretty damn obvious, indeed, that he certainly put some genuine thought into what he said (which is a hell of a lot more than I can say for about 95% of the lyrics of most Pop/Rock music), but, being the psycho-cynic that I am, there's just one, or two, itty-bitty things that Waters says that irks me off, big time, and I just feel like commenting about them here.First off - I wanna do some beefing about that most famous line of Waters' in The Wall that goes - \"We don't need no education. We don't need no thought-control.\" Yeah. I think we all know that one.Now, I don't have any qualms, per se, about Waters saying stuff like that. I mean, he can say that sort of crap all he wants. But, for me, it's one thing for Waters to be telling us all what we 'don't' need - But my problem is - Waters isn't telling us what we 'do' need. He isn't.So, if he goes around telling us that we don't need things like education and thought-control, then I wanna know what he thinks we do need. But Waters never does clue us into what we do need. I mean, he must think that we do need something other than education/thought-control.And, so, in my opinion, with this 'don't need/do need' equation being left incomplete, or imbalanced, this renders Waters' words (that I would otherwise consider intelligent) to be completely useless and lame. I find what Waters says to be absolutely unsatisfactory.Now, I realize that this whole complaint of mine may not seem like a big deal to most people - And, in reality it isn't anything to get too excited about - But, all the same, I am now viewing Waters' rants and raves as no frickin' better than the utter crap that he's so adamantly complaining about and so hatefully voicing his disapproval of.And according to Waters - There may be 13 (or whatever) channels of s.h.i.t on the TV to choose from, but that also goes double for the amount of crap that's available on the radio, too, including stations that play Pink Floyd's music.So, let's face it - All-in-All - Waters' words are just another brick in the wall, too.Yeah.By the way - I couldn't help but notice how painfully devoid of humor the movie The Wall was. It's true. I mean, even with The Exorcist there were actually a few moments of levity thrown in between all of the goo and glop. But not so in The Wall.I think that Director Alan Parker, with all of his impressively bleak and dour visions, hopelessly missed the point of a lot of Waters' lyrics. Surely Waters had intended for his little musical project to contain a least a modicum of humor in it.",

This is a bad film, but it's of historical interest.  Marilyn Manson and Rob Zombie probably love it.\"The Wall\" was one of rock's few gems of the last 25 years, particularly after the last 15 years of sonic trash.  Floyd's work is not about the story and lyrics, but about the sound.  The layering of tempo, music, sound effects, dialog, and tone made it unique.  So that  Alan Parker got to direct this is disastrous, he effectively gutted the source material of its energy.I can see why producers chose Parker, he'd made two popular musicals and one successful-yet-downbeat film (\"Midnight Express\"), but here he  failed miserably.  True vision rests in knowing WHAT we see, HOW we see it, and WHY we see it.  Parker only understands the first one.  He wants 'Apocalypse Now', but gets 'The Thing'.  This superficial, commercial amazement isn't powerful.Parker's 'Wall' isn't extreme enough (part of that comes from butchering the source music).  The war, riots, sex, and desolation is all too clean.  Just look at the mundane \"fat and psychopathic wives\".  The only useful thing Parker made was an Anti-Harry Potter representation of British magic and managing time & space, but that's thanks to the only real artist here.Gerald Scarfe creates the real images here.  From \"Goodbye Blue Sky\" through \"What Shall We Do Now\", his work is flawless.  His detail here is something lacking in anime, I think Stone should have used him for 'Killers' instead. While everything in Parker's world is covered with a bland sameness, Scarfe takes risks.  Parker barely manages to get the time jumbling right (notice the clock motif), but Scarfe gets the (empty) spaces across right, watch the morphing.They should rebuild 'The Wall'.  For starters, get our best depressing/video director.  Yes, I mean David Fincher.  If not then use Burton, Lynch, or Luhrmann.  Put either Burum or Khondji on camera, keep Scarfe for animation, and get H.R. Giger as production designer.  Now THAT would be cool.  Think of that next time you watch this.

            "content": "\"We don't need no education.......We don't need no thought-control.\".... So, proclaims the lyrics of songwriter, Roger Waters.Well, if Waters really thinks we don't need these things, then I'd like to know what the heck this joker thinks we 'do' need. This movie, nor the rest of Waters' lyrics give me any clue.I don't know why Waters is belly-aching so much about education and thought-control. It looks like he did pretty well by them. He's rich. He's famous. Does anyone realistically believe that if Waters didn't have any education and/or if he wasn't subjected to some form of thought-control that he would be in the same boat that he is right now!!?? I seriously doubt it. But who knows.And speaking about 'education' & 'thought-control'.....The way I look at it, Waters' lyrics and music are just that. His words are, in a sense, a type of (informal) education and, along with his lyrics, the hypnotic effect of some of his music could, in its own way, induce some honest-to-goodness thought-control. Well, it could. At least I think so.Uh.....I know this really isn't turning into much of a movie review (I'll get to that business soon enough. I promise), but before I veer off this tangent, I've got one more thing to say about another segment of Waters' lyrics.\"When we were kids and went to school there were 'certain' teachers who would hurt the kids in any way they could.\" Well, I don't know about where Waters went to school, but where I was educated (middle-class, suburbia) it wasn't so much the teachers (yeah, there were some real arseholes) that would hurt the kids in any way, it was 'the other kids' who were putting each other thru' pure hell in any way they could. I ain't joking.All the relentless teasing, and betrayals, and pushing, and shoving, and bullying (on & on, year after year) that went on at my schools was enough to turn any sensitive, little tyke into a professional wall-builder in no time at all. The biggest bricks for his or her wall would come directly from their classmates, not from their ass-wipe instructors. (No Good! Do It Again!!) Anyway, enough of that, onto my movie review. I'll make it short and sweet.I don't think anyone would argue that bringing 'The Wall' to the big screen was an incredible undertaking for any director, even Alan Parker. I certainly give Parker and his film crew a lot of credit for their efforts to fuse dynamite-imagery with explosive rock music. This dazzlingly choreographed combination works surprisingly well most of the time.But, personally, I think Parker should have left 'The Wall' alone. He surely could have presented us with something just as impressive without the confines of Waters' cynical lyrics and the audiences' preconceived idea of how everything should have appeared thru' their mind's eye.Oh,well......\"I have become comfortably numb!\"",

This sums up the view of the authors: The pop audience are stupid and will follow anyone and anything - as long as they deliver a tune.(Even star Bob Geldof stated this was stupid in his autobiography.) \nThe tone is depressing and downbeat throughout - which is strange, I thought rock music should be an escape from boredom and reality?\nFinal warning: I wouldn't recommend you view this movie in a cinema - because the authors believe you should be deafened by the soundtrack.

During Pink's childhood, he was overprotected by his mother, and then was severely punished by his abusive teachers at school. He mentally builds a wall around himself to isolate him from the troubles he is facing, unaware that this will strongly affect him later in life. When he grows up, the movie combines live action and animation to show how drug abuse, neo fascism, and relationships affect his life, his music career, and eventually lead to madness. The animation sequences in the movie are very creative, mesmerizing, and at times, disturbing. The Wall is very successful at telling a story, making it dramatic, and combining visually interesting images to catch the viewer's attention. All of these elements are perfectly accentuated by the music of the 1979 album \"The Wall.\"As a fan of Pink Floyd, I really enjoyed this movie. It is a good movie, and at times, it is like a really bizarre music video. Those of you who aren't fans of Pink Floyd may not enjoy this as much. For those who are fans of Pink Floyd, or their album \"The Wall,\" I highly recommend this movie. If you enjoyed this movie's surreal qualities and unique images, another movie I would recommend is David Lynch's cult classic Eraserhead.

The storyline is rather simple: A boy (\"Pink\") who loses his father in WWII, becomes dominated by his mother, and as he grows up he starts to gradually become completely isolated from the outside world thus living inside a psychological \"Wall\".Simple the storyline might be, yet the way it is presented is absolutely impressive: The fantastic music is blended perfectly with the story, whereas the live action is immaculately fused with cartoon scenes. The film was created in the early 80's, but it was definitely well ahead of its time.The movie deals with the issues that haunt Pink and finally drive him into madness: The death of his father, his dominant mother, the problematic relationship with his wife. On the same time, the movie critiques the weaknesses of the system in general: Education that produces fools, war that devastates societies, broken relationships, drugs, fascism, and others. It is amazing though that all these are shown in context in which there are few conversations, but much (and beautiful) music instead.In my opinion, one cannot the grasp the movie by watching it once. There are frequent flash-backs, and since the story is presented in the special way that I explained above, it needs at least a second viewing in order to comprehend it fully. Moreover, it is a movie that is not made for the \"mass\" audience, as it is something between a video-clip, a social movie, and an independent production.

Especially with a catatonic protagonist who as a youngster was virtually devoid of all human contact following the death of his father, who then built a proverbial 'wall' to shelter himself from the rest of humankind as an adult. It's kind of a depressing film actually, putting form to what was an immensely popular album of the era. Can't believe it's over thirty years old already, that was another big shock to my system when I pulled it up here on IMDb.There's a lot of symbolism utilized in the picture, probably a lot that got by me as well. That scene of the faceless school kids being extruded through a meat grinder might be truer than a lot of us would like to believe and a severe indictment of modern public education. Funny, but somehow I had a sense of that meaning to the lyrics before ever stumbling across this flick.The Nazi symbolism and crossed hammers - I didn't quite know what to make of all that, but the FQA section on the main page here answers that question. Turns out it was Pink's hallucination induced by the intravenous drug injection. I wouldn't have come up with that on my own the first time around, and it's pretty doubtful there will be a second time.I don't know if being a Pink Floyd fan would have any bearing on one's reaction to this film. I found their music to be OK but they're not favorites of mine. For what it's worth, Geldof did a fine job portraying the zoned out rock star lost in his own mind, but I'd understand if someone watching this wound up banging their head against a wall.",

            "content": "Have you ever had a nightmare that was so disturbing and surreal that you wanted it to end but then when you wake up you cannot wait to tell your friends about it? Have you ever had a dream so outlandish that you know it could not have actually happened but you remember it like a real memory? That nightmare is Alan Parker's Pink Floyd's The Wall. This movie is the closest I have ever seen to an actual nightmare. This movie was quoted as being the most unpleasant experience of Alan Parker's life, it caused much tension between Roger Waters and the rest of Pink Floyd and Roger Waters did not like the end result. Although all of this is unfortunate for those involved, what came out of this misery was a fantastic film. The almost complete lack of dialogue, the excellent usage of Pink Floyd's captivating album, and the surreal animation sections of the film makes this film a visual and auditory experience. The film hits the themes of the aftermath that war left on people and Britain, corrupt teachers (excellent and infamous \"Another Brick in The Wall Part 2\" scene), marriage, fascism as an allegory for fame, and the events in life that snowball into human isolation; the building of The Wall. I pulled a one nighter (new term I made up) and listened to the whole album of The Wall then watched the film. I expected disturbing, screwed up, and rock and roll fueled anger and sorrow and I did get it, but one emotion I did not expected accumulated from this listening and viewing; sadness. Both the film and the album are practically the story of a man secluded himself from everyone and it is a very alienating and depressing experience. Through all of the violent imagery and all out bizarreness, there is a deep human message at the center-most brick of The Wall. That is why it seems like a plausible nightmare. The Wall is not always easy to watch and most won't even like it, but it is hard to admit that it is not oddly fascinating.Ultimately everything about this movie surprised me. The direction, the animation, the narrative, the cinematography (incredibly ahead of it's time); all amazing!!! One of the most surprising aspects of this movie is the performance as the troubled rock star and protagonist, Pink, by Boomtown Rat's Bob Geldoff. Geldoff was not an actor. He did not like Pink Floyd. He could not be more different than Pink (in fact, violence makes Geldoff sick) but casting Geldoff for some weird reason, was genius. Geldoff pulls off a convincing, wordless performance as Pink. Final tidbit: Although I am a lover of film, I tend to get easily distracted by social media and other things during films. I did not pause this film once. For better or for worse, it hooks you in the whole time. Once you start building', there is no way back.",

The film exposes numerous factors that contribute to this wall. Bob Geldof plays a cynical rock star found overdosed on drugs in his trashed hotel room. Flashbacks indicate his lonely childhood, mockery at school, an overbearing mother, his failed marriage, and his father's death in the war. His rage takes full effect as a groupie hovers in a corner as he trashes the room and sends a TV crashing to the ground below. Pink Floyd's title track brings conviction as a classroom becomes a slaughterhouse to faceless students marching in matching uniforms. Tremendous direction by Alan Parker aided by Pink Floyd whose lyrics fuel the story. It is also highlighted with exquisite animated segments. Geldof is ideal and dead to the world as his mind conjures up images of death, destruction and a possible ray of hope in the final scene. Christine Hargreaves plays his mother who neglects him. Jenny Wright plays a groupie who gets more than she bargained for in her attempt to seduce. Eleanor David plays his wife who answers neglect with an affair. Alex McAvoy as the strict teacher who spews a famous quote from the film. Visual masterpiece about breaking through to sanity again. Score: 10 / 10",

            "content": "When I first watched this film in my teenage years I really didn't get it, but then again the only reason that I watched it was because it was Pink Floyd. I then lent the movie to my boss and never saw it again (the moral of this story being \u2013 never lend a movie to your boss). Anyway, there is so much in this film that it is impossible to actually talk about it in the limited space on an IMDb review, however you can always go to Wikipedia, look at the discussion boards, or even visit my blog (sarkology.net) if you want to find out more about what is going on \u2013 especially if you are like me in my teenage years in that you loved the music, but the film simply went over your head.Anyway, I recently saw it again and surprisingly it made a lot more sense (probably because I am a lot older, and have seen quite a few weird and wonderful films such as this). You could say that it is basically an extended video clip of the entire Pink Floyd album The Wall, however it is much more than that (but if you do like the music then why not \u2013 watch it as an extended video clip). The film itself is very dark, and actually quite disturbing \u2013 especially if you are in the music industry, but then again Pink Floyd never shied away from attacking the music industry in their songs. According to Wikipedia, the production of the film eventually led to the split between Roger Waters and David Gilmor (and thus the end of what I considered the classic age of Pink Floyd).The film itself sticks closely, but not strictly, to the unity of time and place. If you have seen the film you may ask how, and my suggestion is that the film appears to take place over the period of a day, and most of the action occurs in the head of the protagonist, the rock musician Pink Floyd. The film opens with him sitting in a grungy hotel room watching television, and then goes through a series of flashbacks where we learn about the death of his father in World War II, his time as a child in the fifties, his failed marriage, and his descent into madness. We then cut back to the real world where his managers break down the door, inject him with amphetamines and drag him onto the stage where we are then thrown back into his hallucinatory world where he is a fascist dictator roaming the streets of London.The film touches on a lot of areas of modern society, such as the horror of war and how it not only tears apart families, but destroys the lives of innocent people; the modern education system that turns individuals into clones; the emptiness of the modern technological society; and the realities of the rock and roll lifestyle in that it is not as fulfilling as the media makes it out to be. The Wall is certainly a very confronting and challenging movie, and certainly deserves the accolades that it received (including the number 3 box office spot behind ET and An Officer and a Gentleman \u2013 but they were going to be really hard to beat \u2013 still, it is now a cult classic where as the two the beat it are quaint movies from the Eighties).",

I must admit that this movie is a true piece of art and interesting for any fan of avantgarde cinema no matter if he or she likes the music or not.The first part of the movie shows us in many flashbacks how and why the main character has become what he is. The reasons of his social isolation and mental decay are shown in many short but intense scenes.The second part of the movie shows the state of mind of the main character. He isn't able anymore to get the difference between illusion and reality and becomes paranoid and haunted by its own past as the wall he build around itself seems finally crushed down which leaves us with a multitude of interpretations throughout and especially in the end of the movie.What I admire about this movie is that he works very well with imagery, sounds and little artistic details. There are almost no spoken word passages in this movies as the pictures and the songs are strong enough to tell us a puzzled and yet intriguing story. The cartoon passages are as weird as they are original and perfectly fit to the madness of the disturbing main character. This movie and the way it works with different time lines and ways of filming is as progressive as the music of Pink Floyd has always been. And in addition to the movie, the album of the same name gets a whole new sense and meaning and becomes way more interesting and diversified as I have ever seen it. One can understand the movie without knowing the album but not vice versa.All in all, this is a surreal voyage of the grandest kind and worth a try for any fan of avantgarde or weird movies. Concerning movies that are dominated by music, I would only prefer the \"Rocky Horror Picture Show\" to this little gem.",

Pink feels alienated from his fans, and from the world in general. And \"the wall\" represents that alienation, or disconnect.The visuals are more interesting than the story, which can be interpreted only in reference to the various songs. \"The Little Boy That Santa Claus Forgot\", \"Goodbye Blue Sky\", and especially \"Another Brick In The Wall\" are among the best songs. Part live action and part animation, the film presents viewers with what amounts to an extended music video before music videos existed.The artistic animation is terrific. A hideous looking flying creature spreads its metallic wings over England as a symbol of war. Flowers turn into barbwire. A woman's silhouette morphs into a praying mantis. And among the most potent animated scenes are those red and black marching hammers near the end, a symbol of Nazi fascism. The film resembles a nightmare, deadly serious and dour.What we get here with all these grotesque, exaggerated images is a sense of the irrational, the psychopathic, characteristic of a disturbed mind. The film has a lot to say, metaphorically of course, about war, politics, education, violence, modern society in general, and how these cultural stimuli affect the individual.With a script of only about 45 pages and containing virtually no dialogue, \"Pink Floyd The Wall\" is mostly a musical with some good songs and kaleidoscopic images. The film is highly stylistic and operatic. It gets points for its uniqueness, its inventiveness, and its artistic vision. But it is also frenzied, hyper, and complex. Viewers with an artistic temperament, who are comfortable with disorder, are more likely to find the film engaging. Others will be frustrated or exasperated.",

            "content": "Being no stranger to musicals having previously directed the more mainstream 1976 musical-gangster-comedy Bugsy Malone, and being the auteur that he is; Pink Floyd - The Wall represented enough of a departure for Alan Parker thematically and stylistically to set it apart from what he had done before. Best described as a surrealist rock opera more akin to The Who's, Tommy the movie centers around Pink (An infinitely dour-faced Bob Geldof in his one and only cinematic role). An emotionally distant musician and now junkie who due to his lonely childhood, the untimely death of his father robbing him of any male role model, an overbearing mother, and the verbal abuse he endures from his teacher. The intent of this is to stifle his attempts at creative poetry and isolate Pink from the rest of the world. From there on in the then contemporary nineteen-eighties world, he exists in he proceeds to hallucinate while high on drugs, and simultaneously looks back on his childhood.That more or less sums up the premise of the movie which consists of a combination of animated and live-action set-pieces, all of which are which are a blend of unconscious psychological imagery and memories of the past interspersed with those of the present. What it all amounts to is something of a muddled, incomprehensible pretentious wallowing in the troubled psyche of a young man who feels alienated from the rest of the world and has surrounded himself with the figurative wall of the film's title. The movie's screenwriter and Pink Floyd front-man Roger Waters used it to illustrate his own feelings of alienation towards his audiences. This is not to mention that it is semi-autobiographical in so much as Waters himself lost his father at an early age and had marital problems as did its lead character. Now a rock star who along with his fellow band-mates and their entourage indulges in sexual promiscuity with young shallow groupies dazzled by the band's fame rather than their talent or so the implication is made. It proves that the film does have some level of coherency.However while at times visually distinctive Alan Parker at times creating an Orwellian-influenced metaphysical nightmare world. One where impressionable children march through a grim, grey factory where they are manufactured transfigured, or reprogrammed into faceless, human automatons. It never the less suffers due to Waters's own self-serving self-importance. His own political allegories of a pseudo-nazi imperialist state that Pink imagines with himself it's fascist figurehead symbolizing the Thatcherite government and its foreign policy. Its message is however ultimately obscured by its lack of artistic clarity and is therefore rather glib.It's a ramshackle affair with Parker's directorial and stylistic ingenuity being the glue that manages to hold it all together. There's little in the way of spoken dialogue which means it relies more on Waters' musical lyrics, and while simplistic they are occasionally remarkable when they aren't the peevish ramblings of a crybaby. It's thankfully partially to the inspired potency of the animation dreamed up by political cartoonist, Gerald Scarfe that any interest in proceedings on screen is retained.Heavily flawed but with still enough visual, and artistic aptitude and the odd moment of genuine cogent eloquence, Pink Floyd - The Wall is undeserving of its cult status and nothing more than an acceptable curiosity. With choice scenes of it watched individually on their own merit they're quite marvelous, but as a cohesive whole, it just doesn't hit the mark quite like Waters intended to.",

I was at a cousins house over the summer and they were talking about The Wall and Pink Floyd and i was like OK. later i was in my dads old room (we were visiting his parents) and i wanted to be antisocial so i started listening to music. i decided to try out the Wall. it took me two days to listen to for the first time but it was and still is the best album i have ever heard. i have listened to pink Floyd almost nonstop since then. This happened at the beginning of the summer, by now i can tell you what everything symbolizes. The wall is (obviously) a metaphor of isolating himself, the album/movie is split into thirds. 1/3= In The Flesh?-Empty Spaces (in the movie the order is fed up but the story stays the same) 2/4 Young Lust-Goodbye Cruel World 3/4- Hey You-Comfortably Numb 4/4- The Show Must Go On-Outside The Wallusing this we will look into symbolism -Worms are common. this is symbolizing death and its usually implying he is waiting to die. -Hammer! this Symbolizes Neo-Nazis and Worms are used as another word for the hammer-skins because Fascism and death are often correlated and worms represent death Wall- isolation and that's all the most crucial stuffhere is the story (some is from movie some is from album)quarter 1 tells the story of pinks life as a child during WWII, Goodbye Blue Sky sings of the London Bombings. Mother is about his overprotective mother. his dad dies in the war (another brick 1), his teachers were incredibly abusive (Happiest Days, Another Brick 2), and then he grows up.Quarter 2 is about his adult and love life. After the girl he fell in love with in Quarter 1 cheats on him he gets sad and so he is in a trailer. he is a rock star now by the way. A girl comes and knocks him off his feet (Young Lust), as the years progress things get harder and eventually Pink becomes abusive and crashes up an apartment, throwing things at his wife (One Of My Turns), she leaves and he starts grieving about the mess (Dont Leave Me Now), he decides he doesn't need anything and is going behind his wall (Another Brick 3), He completes this in Goodbye Cruel WorldQuarter 3 starts off with Hey You which is either him trying to escape or see if hes alive. throughout he gets more and more desperate realizing he is stuck. he goes into a deep depression and starts doing drugs and going deeper into depression. eventually he just passes out and starts remembering (Nobodys home), he remembers when he was young and went to look for his dad at the train station after the war in the heart wrenching Vera/Bring The Boys Back Home. in comfortably numb some people give him drugs and he starts hallucinatingQuarter 4 is him on a drug trip where he fantasizes about fascism and then throws a trial for himself (the ending Trial/Outside the wall). In The Show Must Go On he is preparing for a show. In The Flesh he sings and finds out who is gay/black/Jewish, then Run Like Hell, Waiting for the worms are intense sequences of fascism then at the end of Worms is stop. stop leads into the trial. the trial is probably the most intense and amazing song. Pink is testified against by, The Schoolmaster, His Wife, and the Judge. These are all rage filled songs. His mother wants him to be safe and not in trouble. then at the end the wall is destroyed and if you see the movie you can tell he didn't make it. outside the wall is people cleaning up after the wall. the lyrics probably imply the funeral after Pinks suicide (the destruction of the wall)Thanks for reading, watch the movie and listen to the album and this will make more since, also FOR PARENTS i will add that the movie does contain multiple scenes with boobs during quarter 3 and also we see Pink and the wife having sex in Don't Leave Me Now but this is portrayed in a more disturbing manner. the movie is incredibly disturbing, and violent even though the worst of the violence is animated. recommended 14+also listen to the album first",

            "review_title": "Pink Floyd's Experimental Roller Coaster of a Movie",
            "content": "40 years ago, the iconic British rock band Pink Floyd had broken out into cinema with a film adaptation of their eleventh studio album, The Wall. Conceived and written by Pink Floyd vocalist and bassist Roger Waters and directed by Alan Parker, along with some animation direction from illustrator Gerald Scarfe, the film was controversial during its making and release. Despite a lot of creative clashes between the filmmakers, the film went on to become a critical and commercial success and remains a cult classic to date. So looking back on this odd experimental psychological flick, what makes it so beloved and hated today?The main storyline follows a rock star named Pink (Bob Geldof), who ends up constructing a physical and emotional wall to protect himself from the depression and insanity brought on from the death of his father. Throughout the movie, Pink reflects heavily on what happens in his life, from his shoddy relation with his educational upbringing, to creative burnout, to a decaying marriage and being used as a prop in the music industry. As basic as a lot of that sounds, these all shape the emotional bricks in the wall that Pink uses to distance himself from the world, albeit with maddening results. While one could argue that this could be nothing more than an ego trip from Roger Waters, a lot of the negative emotions that breathe from the feature feel very reasonable. Admittedly, the presentation is very abstract, relying heavily on interpretive imagery instead of a conventional narrative. It's hard to say whether the film is completely similar to just Waters' own upbringing, but the ambitious execution leads one to believe it comes from a place of heart, albeit a crazy one.As far as handling multiple themes in just under 100 minutes, the movie pinballs between war, classism, civilian violence, youth criminalization, generational trauma and even home-grown fascism fluidly enough. As incoherent as the film's tone might feel at points, the underlying anger it shouts is most sincere by taking an abstract form of its components in lieu of a literal explanation. This is where the incredible animation led by Gerald Scarfe comes in, by displaying a lot of disturbingly gruesome and vile depictions of hand on hand brutality and beauty turned into waste. As a partial anti-war film that attacks the betrayal from the system, the artists pulled no punches in even visually demonstrating English nationalism as merely blood in the gutter. On top of everything shown on screen, the album itself and the additional score from Bob Ezrin and Michael Kamen help aid the intentionally chaotic editing and tonal whiplashes, recreating quite a fever dream unlike anything ever put to film before and even after. It's safe to say that the risks taken seemed to pay off pretty well.That all said and done, as impressive as the abstract execution seems at first, it does also go against the film for the worse. Despite the hard work shown on screen, a lot of the imagery feels too pretentious and showy for its own good, almost as if it demands us take it seriously rather than grasp it all at once. It doesn't help that once the film is nearly over, whatever purpose might have originally been intended feels almost lost in the film's shallow representation of its angry tone. It's always good for viewers to interpret things in their own way, but considering how dissatisfied the filmmakers were in the final cut, it's really difficult to determine how much those interpretations even matter in the long run. Not to mention, it might go without saying that the film's symbolism may have done more harm than good, especially when its intent on showing the consequences of contemporary fascism led to a lot of violent hate groups in real life. Art imitates life more than the other way around, and yet somehow, the exceptions come up when the suppressed youth are finally given a challenge.In the end, while it might be a little too wrapped up in its own delusions of emotional turmoil, there's no denying how much effort and craft went into bringing Pink Floyd's The Wall onto the big screen. To this very day, there has never been a rock musical this cherished and this offensive all at once, almost as if its existence alone has been both a blessing and a curse since its release in 1982. As a flawed yet truthful human story tackling both spiraling isolation and societal hypocrisies, there is just enough to recommend for viewers as there is to be cautious of. After all, we're all just bricks in the wall.",

            "review_title": "Arthouse at its most musical",
            "content": "Pink Floyd is, to me, the musical interpretation of arthouse cinema. While their music does, indeed, sound like classic rock you hear on the radio, it has a complexity to it that goes beyond most rock from that era. The Dark of the Moon and The Wall are not albums you'll understand on your first listening unless you go into them having been told what they're about beforehand. That both begin and end in ways that encourage the listener to listen to the album again seems to emphasize to me that the band knew this.The Wall, as a movie, on the other hand, cannot be described so easily. You can call it an extended music video, a musical of sorts, or whatever, but none can fully describe the experience this film provides. This is the type of film that was destined to attain a cult following, and for a good reason: to say this film isn't for everyone is a massive understatement. Calling it a musical gives the impression that the music is sparse but expressive enough to move along the plot, while calling it a music video makes it seem as if it's a vapid experience bereft of any substantial artistic merit. Though it isn't just The Wall for every minute of it's over an-hour-and-a-half runtime, the moments where the pictures aren't being backed by music are few and far between. This film is better described, in my opinion, as an effective companion piece to the album that inspired it. Whether or not you'll enjoy it depends on how you listen to that album. If you see it as music and not the art it's intended to be seen as, there's a fair chance the most you'll get out of this film is a set of surreal images that loosely convey a hard to follow plot. If you listen to Pink Floyd to get stoned, on the other hand... I mean, you clearly aren't here for anything artistic.Either way, The Wall is a haunting, striking, and often times gut wrenching portrayal of loneliness, isolation, childhood abandonment, and madness. Despite not having more than a few lines of dialog, there's something endearing human about the bitter, depressing thematic nature of it all. This is, by all means, a difficult watch -- even for those invested in the material for what I would consider to be 'the right reason'. I don't know if I can honestly say I recommend it, but for those who will probably dig this type of thing, it's certainly something to check out.",

I knew it was going to feel forced, too. I like a a good deal of Pink Floyd. I can handle obscene and bizarre imagery and whatnot, in fact, I love it. It wasn't as extreme as I expected (it was quite mild), but I believe you can't make a good bizarre film using forced and often stupid weird things. Roger Waters was hoping David Lynch would like this film, considering \"Eraserhead\" is known for being one of his favorites. Well, Lynch doesn't like interpretations for films and since this entire movie is an interpretation of the album, you get the point. To sum it all up, this a stupid film that COULD ruin the album for you and this film is not complex, even if there is some hidden meaning behind it (who cares, anyway).",

Granted, it's filled with a whole bunch of great and beautiful songs, but there's too much filler and the story is given no chance at really being told, seeing as the lyircs as ridiculously metaphorical and internalized. The movie, however, puts images and words to the music and what it is that they were trying to say not only makes sense but is enhanced and you really get to see the power and raw emotion in this terribly yet beautifully tragic story about internal descent. The story behind the movie is: Our protagonist is a rock star, whose tragic life and personal excess has been getting to him, eventually leading to a reflection of his memories, eventually leading to him imagining himself as a fascist dictator. The \"Wall\" refers to a wall he figuratively built around himself to psychologically protect himself. With obsession over parental figures and the horrors of war, you'd have to imagine that this movie would be perfect for psychological education. The format of the film is a series of either painfully realistic or surreal or both sequences shown with the song that that would represent it in the album. The production values are at times inconsistent, but the power of the film as a whole is amazing. This really is an piece art at its best. The album is the soundtrack to the movie.",

It is a visual illumination of what we are taught to think and believe from the very start of our lives to the culmination of the ultimate truth; that what we think is real is not real...our thoughts are only a glimpse of what truly exist. All we see are shadows on the wall. The more we try to make them real, the less real we become. We may realize this truth and awaken, our we may sink into our mind and allow the last brick of the wall to be laid.Fame does not make us real, nor sex nor power. These fleeting transient primordial manifestations of crude and separatist thought are masterfully illustrated in this work. Pink the child is taught to memorialize and believe in the symbology and ceremony of war. His intimacy with the subject is further intensified and rooted in, his father having served and been killed in action. The model of his identity was a man destroyed by and ideology. The seed of his insanity began with his identification with it though the coaxing of his elders and so thus the foundation of the wall began to take place.As we begin to realize the truth, we begin to see cracks in the wall. Soon the cracks become bigger and we may see what truly is there. At this moment we can choose to accept what is, or we can capitulate to the instinct to create an identity and start the process all over again. Though this may allow us o function in a periodicity that most may seem as normal, the bricks of several rebuilt walls amount to that of one large one. In a pragmatic society, this allows many to function as normal. Both are false. Both are insanity. One is accepted and even idolized as Pink became Floyd, the quasi Hitler adored for is super sized identity. But neither is truth.As our generation may be forced to play out the recycling dramas of a collective mind energy that has taken mass control of the planet, the hope of rebirth and the inevitable evolution of our species points to the hope that sooner rather than later, our mess will begin to be cleared. And so the movie ends with the children clearing the horrible rubble and debris of what one generation left.Our realization that we are not what people tell us, that there is more than what we see, that the separation between mass and energy time and space and all conventions of thought are imperfect, that the one truth and interconnectedness lies with in us, separate form our minds, brings us closer as a society to truth.

            "content": "I've spent the last hour reading users's comments on this movie and I am dissatisfied with what I read. I watched \"The Wall\" and understood very little of it. Yes, I got that little Pink was very upset with the death of his father, yes, I understood that he had a stressed and sarcastic teacher which spilled his frustrations on kids and that his wife cheated on him(yet these are all obvious, and not so meaningful - aka I wouldn't make a movie based upon such events). But I guess I always expect a movie that seems too difficult to understand to be a masterpiece that my simple mind can't quite cope with. And so I hoped that others may enlighten me... I learned that this movie is about Pink Floyd which had a sad childhood due to his father's death and his teacher that made fun of his artistic talent and persecuted him and also due to his overprotecting mother. Then he found the courage to express himself and broke free from his home (I suppose, cause the movie lacks this part..anyway, otherwise how could a sad, overprotected kid get in a rock band??). He got married and also became this famous rock-star. But his wife is now cheating on him - a heavy hit on the man. All in all he figures out that the best thing for him to do is create a defense WALL(and that's...\"the wall\") around him, in order to never get hurt again. So he becomes a sort of a schizophrenic, and one suffering from drug abuse too - he didn't talk to anybody and only stood like a vegetable and watched TV. Occasionally he would devastate his apartment.. I also read that he would have had a double personality - the man on stage and the frightened isolated schizophrenic. Oh well, or so you people say...But why would this movie be considered a masterpiece? Why is the character so great? He is a poor guy who lost his dad, OK, like many others, and whose wife is cheating on him, like many other wives do. And OK, if you say so, he is talented too... But something doesn't quite fit.If he was such a great artist and his poems were brilliant and meaningful, how come he let himself, a genius, go mad over a normal man's problems? What kind of a \"superior man\" was he? Why should people have listened to him (he thinks of him as a Nazi-like leader, controlling people's minds, right?) - are people really that stupid? I really don't see the greatness of this character (so as to make a movie about his life anyway...). He's not even a symbol of the ordinary man - I could have found myself in him if he were and the movie would have meant something to me.I wished really hard that this movie would be philosophical and I waited for the revealing of the symbols. First I though that maybe people are bricks in the wall and that the movie criticizes the mechanism of society(or maybe a sort of political regime or a specific country's society - the USA or England). But to accept this is a movie about a drunken, failure of a rock-star and that others agree to this and score the movie with a ten...is what is truly depressing!Oh and also the idea of getting stoned before seeing it... Only losers need to get stoned to be able to do something. I really hope the people who comment on IMDb are smart guys...so please don't say things like \"you need to get stoned to understand this movie\"From my point of view it totally lacks content compared to what everyone says - unfortunately I have nothing to learn from it.",

So we all thought it was written for us. But its so not. Floyd was winding down when they finally got this album out and were virtually done as an act, by the time the movie was released. So they were old men comparatively speaking, and really should have been speaking to my parent's generation \u0096 and would have, if they had not had enough of all this stuff in the 60s. I guess we were the last crowd to bear the angst of the European WWII experience as told through rock music. Tommy, this...but we were a bad audience for it, the anti-war, anti modernization messages I think went completely over all our pointed little heads. As a generation, we had been squeezed in between the disasters of the 60s, and the reawakening of the 80s. For some reason I remember this album and the Iran hostage thing, happening concurrently. The mood of the times was quiet desperation, bordering on bloodlust for justice. We were just tired of being weak. But we were kids, and liked seeing other kids smash up a school, and have someone other than ourselves speak up for Individualism. Lord knows, my generation has since raised Individualism to an art formAs for the movie critically, I think the animation now looks real real bush, and Parker falls into the deep end with \"artsy\" banality. Viewing it now, I find myself getting nauseous especially with the gorily, disturbing animation. But I still love the music, and listen to the record often. So my advice is to do likewise. Bag the movie, and just dig on the CD.  I think given the age of the film, and modern irrelevance of the message the film tries to impart, your better off not wasting your time watching it. We all know war is bad, but I think we've come to terms with the validity of wiping out the Nazis, even if Roger Waters hasn't.

You don't need to be a Pink Floyd fan to enjoy this one; all you gotta do is like great movies.I used to watch this religiously when I was younger, liked to alter my mind and played in a band. I purchased it recently, now 10 years later and watched it totally sober with my girlfriend. She asked me what it was about and I had a hard time explaining it to her so I just said- 'It's about life.' By the end of the movie, she was crying and I was reminded of the power of this amazing film. It can be viewed by anyone with a heart and it will accomplish the task of affecting the viewer. It's disturbing in parts and heart-wrenching in others. It never slows down and it remains gripping until the final scene.Turn it up really really loud, turn off all the lights and enjoy it on a big screen TV, it hasn't lost any of it's power since it came out. \"Pink Floyd The Wall\" is really timeless and 100% genuine.10 out of 10, kids.",

            "content": "Some people remark here that Pink is \"mad\" but to me it is obvious that he \"just\" has a very severe depression. A depression caused by the sorrow of growing up without a father, of the school-system and his failed love... it is an excellent... almost astonishingly accurate description of how it is like to be depressed. It is true that we see a \"mad\" pink meeting himself as a boy. But that is only a vision and the real pink we see is the one sits in front of the television. I think also it is brilliant how this inner-neo-nazi is described as a sort of \"wall\" to control the sorrow and anger and deal with other people. Everything has contributed to building the wall: his mother, his dead father, the school-system, politics, sexuality... it is really quite touching... it really has nothing to do with drugs and rock'n'roll... it is rather a time-typical portrait of depression in a post-war scenario. In the end the wall is apparently broken down. A very difficult and scary thing to do. And Pink is \"exposed to his peers\"... Naked... this is truly an epic film and a must-see for anyone.",

            "review_title": "A rather ramshackle construction",
            "content": "I guess whether you derive any enjoyment out of the film version of The Wall depends on whether you like the album. If you think the album is a bunch of pretentious whining nonsense, then you'll probably think the film is that tenfold. But if you like the record then you might well find something to enjoy.Personally, liking the album a great deal, I think the film is passable enough. There are certainly some great moments. But there are also some dodgy ones. And as a whole the film is nothing more than a shallow exercise in visualising exactly what's happening in the music \u0096 the film doesn't interpret, it regurgitates. Therefore it's nothing more than an extended music video.Part of the effect of this lack of imagination is that it makes the whole experience rather bland. It doesn't show you anything that you weren't able to think up for yourself while listening to the album. For instance, 'Comfortably Numb' features Pink (Bob Geldof) getting jabbed by doctors and shows him as a kid with a fever \u0096 the filmmakers slavishly follow the lyrics. And then with 'Young Lust' you have groupies getting their clothes off and with 'One of My Turns' you have Pink, well,\u0085having a turn. It doesn't really add anything to the music.But even though the examples given don't really add anything to the record, at least they don't detract, which unfortunately happens later on. The first half of the film, while often lacking in imagination, is at least well filmed (sometimes beautifully so). The second half, though, is tedious and rather dull \u0096 songs like 'In the Flesh', 'Run Like Hell' and 'Waiting For the Worms' are rendered almost laughable by singing and dancing Nazis, who are more camp than threatening. And then in 'Is There Anybody Out There?' you just have Geldof banging himself against a wall and in 'Nobody Home' you have a young Pink wandering about in some trenches. It doesn't make for inspiring viewing.But despite this, the film does occasionally proffer a surprise, one that builds upon the basis of the album. For instance, 'The Thin Ice', rather than doing the blatantly obvious with the lyrics, instead juxtaposes them against dead, injured and dying soldiers. It adds a whole layer of emotion to lyrics like 'Momma loves her baby\u0085' while this is played against soldiers dragging dead bodies from a beach. And I also like the way that halfway through the song you cut to Pink alone in a hotel swimming pool \u0096 the association is subtly conveyed; Pink's isolation can be traced all the way back to his father's death in the Second World War.Another minor success in the film is 'In the Flesh?'. I like the way the battlefield of war is cut against the battlefield of teenage idolatry \u0096 the kids rushing to get a seat, trampling each other underfoot, is mirrored in the way soldiers try and attack the enemy. However, the song is spoiled somewhat when Geldof opens his mouth. He sings the song like an Irish Johnny Rotten \u0096 the words sound like someone scratching a blackboard.Likewise, the second version of 'In the Flesh' is also spoiled by Geldof's singing \u0096 the insults he throws out to the audience are delivered like the camp policeman in Withnail and I whose only line was 'Get in the back of the van!!' But the song is also spoiled by a Nazi brass band playing the music. It lacks the aggression of the recorded song and instead makes it rather laughable and ridiculous.Something else that doesn't always work are the animated sequences. As well made as they are, and as much as they appeal to potheads, they're not always well integrated into the film, making it even more painfully obvious that the film is only about style \u0096 don't watch The Wall for substance. But even though they make the film disjointed, they're worth it for the copulating flowers and the planes that turn into flying crucifixes \u0096 they're a couple of wonderful visual flourishes.Other visuals that work are the children going to school in a cattle truck, the rather disturbing scenes where Pink shaves all his body hair off, the way that a slightly routine version of 'Comfortably Numb' turns into something of a horror film with Pink's rebirth and the scene in the swimming pool where Pink drowns in blood. But as is always the case with this film, amongst this you have to endure a lifeless version of 'Mother' (the song is one of the highlights on the live album), a goofy visualisation of 'Bring the Boys Back Home' and lots of failed attempts at profundity. Honestly, the best way to experience Roger Waters' story is to stick with the live album, Is There Anybody Out There. It's a million times better than this film and a lot fuller and richer than the slightly anti-septic studio version.",

From his bullying teacher, who just wants to make children 'another brick in the wall' meaning they should only work to improve the rest of society and not be their own individual, to his overprotective mother. The idea that he is struggling not to become another brick in the wall like everybody else was a brilliant concept to me and overall this movie was far better than I could've ever expected.Also bonus points for the incredible Pink Floyd soundtrack that just makes the film all the more better.",

            "content": "This is one of many movies that were 'prescribed' to me by my shrink who believed in their effectiveness in therapy. At first I could not understand the connection between a film and a psychological problem. But then it became clear that both are about a 'fantasy'. Almost everyone in society is living a fantasy that can be as far removed or as close to reality as the person wishes. Of course, if the that person is a head of state dragging his country into war or running after Utopian dreams then the harm done is that much more greater.Now a film is also a fantasy, but it is the very exact and deliberate fantasy of the director. When we see a movie we are transported into that fantasy and we live it in vivid detail and color in all our visual and mental senses. We also live it in our subconscious senses as well, and herein lies its value. Seeing what has been thus far deeply embedded and intertwined inside us now on screen and out in the open helps begin the separation process (between reality and fantasy). Since the distinction between the fantasy of the movie and your current reality is very clear, and since you willingly entered the movie fantasy by your own choice until it overlapped with your inner similar fantasy; you can get to experience the willful 'exiting' of the movie fantasy that would subsequently help you to 'exit' your inner fantasy in the future. Well, it's a little more complicated than that, but this isn't the best place to discuss in deep psychotherapy techniques.Of course I'm not suggesting that, in and of its self, a movie would cure anybody of anything; that has to be the work of a professional, and it's his or her decision as to whether or not to incorporate it into the therapy process. But I am curious as to whether anyone else has ever 'used' movies in this sense or at least experienced their psychological effect either consciously or subconsciously.",

You might still be shaken by what you see even if you're a Pink Floyd fan.  The animation by Gerald Scarfe and the soundtrack featuring Pink Floyd and Bob Geldof is still haunting to this day.Ironically, one year after the movie was released, Pink Floyd recorded The Final Cut, their last album with Waters.  The album was based around the themes of war and armageddon, and was dedicated to Waters' father.  Although Waters believed in the album, the other members of Pink Floyd were not as supportive.  The album was not the huge hit the band had expected and tensions between Waters and the other members led to his permanent departure from the band in 1984.Rating:  ** out of ****",

Though, even with that, The Wall is still an amazing version of the album, capturing the horror and surreal nature of Pink Floyd.\nThe story is rather simple: Pink is a rockstar that starts to build a mental Wall made out of bricks, each brick is a fear or a trauma, though, as the Wall starts to get higher and higher, Pink\u00b4s insanity starts to grow.\nThat\u00b4s basically everything, the power of \"The Wall\" isn\u00b4t in a strong story, it all lies in the emotional Journey and the alucinations of our RockStar. Bob Geldof really captures that Druggedoutofhishead character, even though his singing can be Hit or Miss, but you dont really need an amazing singer for this movie, you just need a more theatrical approach, in that sense, Geldof is probably the perfect Pink.\nNow, the best aspect of the film besides the amazing Music and Acting, it\u00b4s the animated sequences, though some of them are stripped from the original Projection of the concerts, that really doesnt matter, besides, some of them are expanded, \"What shall we do Now\" finished with the Rose turning on a monster, in the Movie, it continues, seeing that The Wall is not only made from Fears, it\u00b4s also made out of greed and lust. \"Goodbye Bluesky\" didnt had an animation, and it\u00b4s one of the movie\u00b4s most iconic scenes next to \"In the Flesh\" and \"Don\u00b4t leave me now\" All of the characters being designed by the amazing Gerard Scarfe.\nNow, the main problem for me, it\u00b4s the scenes where Alan Parker tried to ground the movie a bit more, you can sense it in some of the scenes like \"Young Lust\" but that doesnt mean he cant stage Pink\u00b4s Madness, \"Dont Leave me now\" and \"Thin Ice\" are visual master pieces, even though it includes lots of characters from Popular stuff, it actually helps to portray Pink as a lost creature, though it\u00b4s obvious that this Film is the personal Project of Roger Waters.\nThe only problem in general, are the more grounded moments of the film and the tendecy to reuse scenes, this also means cutting some of the animations from the Show (Waiting for the Worms just has the Marching Hammers, when it also had a segments of the Hammers in a small British Town, this was changed to Live Action Material) and some of the scenes that dont really add up (After What shall we do now, there\u00b4s a scene that doesnt really match with the tone of the film or the visuals, after that until \"One of my Turns\" the movie really hits the breaks)\nThis film is really a hit or miss, but even so, it\u00b4s really an amazing visual and sound spectacle, the animations, the sets, the Wall (Not the album, there\u00b4s actually a huge set that is just a Wall that seems endless, it doesnt have anything else, but it really helps to show how huge are Pink\u00b4s Mental Problems) the music, the acting, there\u00b4s nothing else to say, Watch this film, it\u00b4s not the best thing in the universe, but trust me, this isnt another brick in the wall.",

            "content": "Roger Waters didn't like it. The director Alan Parker didn't like it. Animation designer Gerald Scarfe didn't like it. David Gilmour didn't like it as much as the album and the concert. So is Pink Floyd The Wall bad? No. Is it good then? Sort of. It certainly isn't great. This live-action/animated musical follows Pink, a rock star, who isolates himself from the world and slowly goes mad. The first thing you notice about the movie is that its strange narrative structure was clearly influenced by the whole surrealist movement. While this fits some parts of the whole The Wall concept perfectly, some parts are also rather messy \u2013 especially in the first act. In spite of it being fairly messy (direction wise) Pink Floyd The Wall isn't hard to follow, particularly if you're familiar with the album. It doesn't take a genius to understand the movie.Let's just take the musical aspect of the movie out of the way. The music is undoubtedly good, after all it is one of the most famous Pink Floyd albums. But if you're interested in the music, one might ask why not just listen to the album instead of watching the movie. One may also argue that the The Wall concept is pretty detailed on the album and that this story doesn't need to be told through another medium. That being said, I didn't like some songs in the movie. And by some songs I primarily mean the usage of When the Tigers Broke Free. During the segments that use this song, I couldn't shake the feeling that this song was written simply to tie the movie together. I know that it was written at the same time as The Wall, but I couldn't help to feel otherwise \u2013 the song was narrating what was happening in the movie. I found that to be sloppy and unnecessary. I don't need narrative exposition for something I can see with my own eyes. Also, the main actor Bob Geldof, who is the lead singer of The Boomtown Rats, couldn't do a satisfying Waters impression throughout his singing parts. So that's another reason to just listen to the album instead.Considering the whole movie is pretty much a 90 minute music video for the album and that everyone who listens to Pink Floyd (the movie's primary audience) is acquainted with The Wall concept, I won't spend much time analyzing the story. I'll just say I fully agree with Waters when he said that the movie doesn't let the audience sympathize with Pink. It's also very strange that the movie has so many anti war elements when the album hasn't. The Final Cut, the album which came out a year after this movie, has much more anti war propaganda than The Wall. Anyway, as I said, much of the story is being told through Pink Floyd songs. Since the movie isn't so story driven, I should mention the visuals. The animation is perfect, it's full of beautifully twisted pictures that often resemble an LSD trip. The cinematography is also stunning, mostly during the Another Brick in The Wall Pt 2 segment. Basically, the movie is worth watching based on visuals alone. And if you're a big Pink Floyd fan you'll enjoy this strange experience that is Pink Floyd The Wall even more.Rating: 7/10 Read more at passpopcorn.wordpress.com",

            "content": "The medium of film is such that it can outdo almost all other forms of art, because it can include them all, and mix them to boot. Anything photography can do film can do, but if it wishes, it can expand on it. It can include music, but if it wishes, it can add visuals to enrich the musical experience. It can do anything that theatre does, but without the physical restrictions that theatre has. And so on... One of the few areas where another artform is superior to film is literature (including poetry, off course). Literature can (because it DESCRIBES rather than merely SHOWS) describe the inner workings of the human mind at a depth that film can not reach. It is a current fashion in \"Art Films\", especially European ones, to have many long, lingering shots on characters' faces while they undergo strong emotional experiences. That's fine, but you're still just looking at an actor's face. You can try and guess on what's inside, but that's not the same as been described, in detail, on what exactly is going on inside, and why it is that the character has such or other facial expressions. So many of the best literature is literature which does just this: describes exactly what is happening in the mind and in the soul. That is, after all, one of the major accomplishments of the artist: to convey what is happening in her (or her character's) mind and soul. In other words, film is good medium for most things, but it simply is not a good medium of storytelling - literature is much better suited to storytelling. For some reason, many decades ago, someone decided that people should use the medium of film to tell stories, and that's what 99% of filmmakers have done ever since - and have left the many other possibilities of film to rot away into inexistence. However, there are a number of films which have tried to tell a story, yet overcome this inherent shortcoming of film as a storytelling medium (the films of Tarkovsky, Denis, Lynch, and Fellini's \"8 1/2\" spring to mind). Yet none that I have seen have succeeded as much as \"Pink Floyd The Wall\". No film that I have ever seen takes you for such a deep, relentess ride within the character's psyche as \"Pink Floyd The Wall\". Proving that dialogue is all but unneccessary, this film takes you deeper into the character's mind than perhaps you wanted to go - because it makes you so clearly understand and feel what he's going through. While watching the film, you are put almost literally in his shoes - in his mind - whether you like it or not. This is why, whether you enjoy the film or not, this film has got to be one of the greatest artistic achievements of film - you are within the character's world, as ugly and offputting as the experience might be.  And yes, the animated sequences are the best I have ever seen (perhaps not technically, but creatively speaking). (the flower sequence is phenomenal) P.S.

It shows problems that real life can face. the music is absolutely brilliant (especially the \"Another Brick in the wall\" trilogy) which helps progress the movie which had very little dialogue. The images is very very weird: the clip of children marching along and falling into a blender (i think its a blender) and coming out as what looks like mince meat is a scene that will remain in my mind for most of my life. The animation by Gerald Scarfe was very clever, he showed simple images but with the music, it became in image that nearly everyone will recognise.Apart from all the descriptions, this is a brilliant movie that is sorely underrated. I recommend that you see it.10/10",

I've listened to each album from Meddle to Final Cut 1000 times each (Dark side of the moon has to be in the 10's of 1000's of times).That being said the first time I watched this movie at 22 in 1985 on a TV it was hard to follow. I loved the visuals that goes with the master piece of the album the \"The Wall\". But if you only watch this movie once then your are not going to get it.I've seen it now maybe 10+ times and after about the fifth time I really like the flow of the movie. I really understand the lyrics and how the time line fits together. The animation is wild and weird, but fits great with the tone of the music. The animation of the guy tumbling into a leaf during the trial is one of the coolest things I've ever seen.Once you get the whole idea that the \"bricks in the wall\" are his over bearing mother, his cheating wife, the death of his dad, power crazy teachers, the love of rock fans, drugs, growing up in WWII england , insanity and TV you see the wall built in the first half of the movie, while the second half is how he deals with being isolated from the world, goes insane, comments on how being a rock star is like being a fascist dictator, so the final trial is how he comes to the realization that he is blame for how he had delt with all the problems life has dumped on him and he needs to come of his shell and \"tear down the wall\" then you will watch this film and enjoy it a lot more.

I know it didn't tell the story of the album in full (some songs were left out and some that weren't on the original album were left out), but as a whole, it was artistically brilliant. Despite some flaws, the visualisations of the film tend to fit very well with the songs. Gerald Scarfe gave us powerful animation scenes for \"Goodbye Blue Sky\" (which in this movie occurred between \"When the Tigers Broke Free, Part 2\" and \"The Happiest Days of Our Lives\", while on the original album it occurs between \"Mother\" and \"Empty Spaces\") and \"The Trial\" (which happens to be one of my favourite scenes in the movie), and both expressed the mood of the song really well. Bob Geldof was also a good choice to play Pink, yet he didn't deliver the notes of the two \"In The Flesh\" the way the original songs did. Yet he did capture the insanity of the character. In fact, the Pink character kind of reminds me of myself. We both found school bad (mostly primary school for me as other kids constantly picked on me and bashed me up. I also found the teachers just as bad), we both suffered mental breakdowns, we both tend to daydream, we both blame everyone for being screwed up, and we both tend to want to overpower everyone (which Pink got when he was having his hallucination late in the movie).Yet despite all the effort, the film crew and band were quite disappointed with the movie, maybe for the way the movie didn't tell the story of the album well. My rating: 10/10.Note: The original album can also be used as an alternative soundtrack for the 1951 Disney animated classic Alice in Wonderland. To sync the album with the movie, stick in Disc 1 of The Wall when you load up Alice in Wonderland on VHS or DVD. Have the movie on mute too. Press play when the movie starts. When Disc 1 finishes, pause the movie and put in Disc 2 and play both at the same time. \"Comfortably Numb\" must be skipped on Disc 2 and if you look on the back cover of the remastered CD set, you'll noticed a minus sign between the song time and song title. If you get this right, some bits will freak you out. Both album and movie should end at the same time. The titles to both works are also said to link with each other. The thing below proves it.

I love The Wall, I love Dark Side of the Moon. This movie is worth watching for a Pink Floyd fan, especially if they liked The Wall. The story mostly relies on visual aspects, and the songs themselves in the movie. Just about every song from the album is in the movie. There isn't really much dialogue in the film. All of the interactions between the characters is more communicated in the lyrics of the songs. Especially in \"Comfortably Numb\", and \"In the Flesh\". This movie is very interesting. Some of the songs are really personified in this film. They are given new meaning. I think this movie is more of a cult film, than anything. I don't think it has much mainstream appeal. It's very abstract and would probably only appeal to people who like Pink Floyd. I don't even think the viewer would understand it unless they really listened to the wall. I think this movie should be watched by true Pink Floyd fans. A lot of the film is very depressing. Actually the whole movie kind of is. I also had some problems with the animation scenes. The animation during \"Goodbye Blue Sky\" was okay, but animation while \"The Trial\" was playing was kind of annoying. Despite the depressing mood of the movie, and the weird animation scenes, I thought it was a good movie. It's very different though. I don't think I've ever seen anything quite like it, and I've seen some weird movies before. I enjoyed it though. I actually bought it, and plan to watch it again sometime.",

The incredibly eclectic Alan Parker, who can't seem to settle in a genre, does a brilliant job of bringing Roger Waters' masterpiece to life. Bob Geldof, with almost no spoken lines, creates one of the most disturbing portraits of madness and isolation I've ever seen. And of course, there's the music; haunting, dark, and so deeply personal, you almost feel like a voyeur hearing it. What almost takes over the film, though, is Gerald Scarfe's incredible free-flowing animation, melting from one disturbing image to another, then segueing into his great production designs until you can't tell what's real anymore.",

On my last viewing of the movie I had the pleasure to listen to Roger Waters (the screen and songs writer of this movie) and Gerald Scarfe (the designer of the movie and creator of the animations) commentaries which came with the DVD release. Both definitely shed light on some of the concepts and ideas intended behind some of the scenes. I personally found them very interesting. You can see (hear) Roger being very relaxed as sometimes even making fun of himself while looking at his creation after more than 17 years. This movie for most of the part is autobiographical as Roger Waters recounts. It is a story of a young man and his inability to cope with life. Having grown without a father, an overprotected mother, the torture from his schoolteachers, and his failure to have a family life are all bricks in the psychological wall that he has built around himself during the course of the years. The final brick is his frustration in his job-the incapability to get satisfaction from what he does. However, Roger Waters found a very elegant way out of this situation by leaving Pink Floyd unlike another suchlike persona Kurt Cobain who dealt with the issue in a more, to my opinion, drastic way. Anyway, I don\u0081ft think that there are any big Pink Floyd fans left out there not having seen this movie yet. For the rest of you I can just say that if you wanna see how one of the biggest creations in the music ... OK, rock music history look and not just sounds like, you have to see this one. I suggest you hook up the VCR or better DVD player to your stereo and let the neighbors enjoy it with you.",

For starters Bob Geldof's acting is so horribly, embarrassingly bad. It's laughable. It's clear that he is out of his element and has no idea what he doing as an actor. But of course the film is such a muddled mess, Geldof's amateurish acting is sometimes hidden. For those of you who say you love this movie go back and focus just on Geldof. I've done this & find myself giggling at him. The director knows Geldof has no range, so there are often a series of fast cover edits so Geldof is not on screen very long. Because Geldof is so atrocious and not believable, the film is a mockery and dishonest.Just because some people saw this film in altered state as teenagers, and liked it, doesn't make it a good movie. Think about it.On the other hand the album is great on so many levels. But when I think of this music in conjunction with the movie, it doesn't seem as good. The music literally becomes cartoonish, a caricature which I think is ashame. The familiar themes the film tries to cover have been conveyed in more thoughtful and creative ways elsewhere.The playwright Samuel Beckett had the habit of never talking about his writing, his art \u2013 he left it for people to interpret it themselves & come to their own conclusions. I feel that Pink Floyd would been better served in this case to let the music speak for itself. The movie is a distraction from the real art.",

So Alan Parker and Waters took a different approach, tho few could have guessed that the answer to the time-worn query \"Which one's Pink?\" would turn out to be Boomtown Rats singer (and future Live Aid/Live-8 architect) Bob Geldof.The irony of course is that Geldof used to tell anyone who'd listen how much he HATED Pink Floyd. The Rats were all about punk deconstructing bloated stadium rockers like Floyd - of course, over two decades after the Wall movie came and went, Geldof talked the four surviving members of Pink Floyd into reuniting to perform their last-ever set as a foursome before the death of keyboardist Richard Wright. Clearly, Geldof has embraced his inner Pink ----",

Several psychedelic illustrations in combination with the awesome sound of Pink Floyd is sure to give you a drug trip that you will never forget.

            "content": "Contrary to popular belief, The Wall (and not The Dark Side Of The Moon) is Pink Floyd's biggest commercial success to date, and it is unlikely that the band will ever top it. The Wall  was a weird, unconventional, and sometimes misunderstood opera, a monumental and undeniably ambitious piece of work that came out on double album and yet had to leave out something.Quite probably, it was also the band's album that split opinions the most. In fact, The Wall was controversial from the ground up. Some thought that it was one of the most brilliant and intriguing records ever published; others claimed that it was crushed by the weight of its own ambitions; others accused the band of promoting questionable ideas with a song like the famous Another Brick In the Wall, part 2, or were disturbed by the contents of In the Flesh. Add to that the band went through a difficult time while composing and recording the album (to this day there are some not-so-friendly feelings between Roger Waters and the rest of Pink Floyd about what happened during the recording sessions), and you see where I am going.What is undeniable, however, is that although some criticism against it probably never disappeared, The Wall is now celebrated as a classic of rock history, one that has never grown old with time. Composed mainly by Roger Waters, it is a concept album that mixes different rock styles and even opera-like sound to immerse the listener in a real journey into insanity.In 1982, The Wall was put into a movie on the Alan Parker-directed Pink Floyd: The Wall. While the movie never achieved -- nor probably ever tried to achieve -- the absolute classic status of the album, it can definitely be a worthy experience and a fine companion to it.Be advised, though: Pink Floyd: The Wall is not what I would call a pleasant movie experience. The tone is constantly downbeat, the images are often creepy and disturbing, and the film can be frustrating if taken with the wrong approach. If you are not much into Pink Floyd but you were fascinated by the beautiful lights and visuals of a live show you saw on TV, I assure you this is not quite the same. A song like Comfortably Numb looks beautiful with the laser lights and colors of their concerts (especially the ones Pink Floyd put out in the last few years) but here it is accompanied with dark imagery and a mood that can be quite depressing.The story behind Pink Floyd: The Wall is one of a man's descent into madness, partially based on Roger Water's autobiography, in particular on his childhood memories, and partially inspired by former band member Syd Barrett's experience (Syd Barrett, the former leader and creative mind behind Pink Floyd, went into schizophrenia and to this day lives secluded from the outside world).The protagonist is Pink (played by Kevin McKeon and singer Bob Geldof). As a child, Pink lost his father in WWII (Another Brick in the Wall, part 1 and especially the heartbreaking sequence of When The Tigers Broke Free) and was raised by an overprotective mother (Mother); in school, his teachers denied him the possibility of expressing his own creativity (The Happiest Days of Our Lives, Another Brick in the Wall, part 2). Growing older, Pink starts playing in a rock band that leads him to popularity; but popularity and money work only on a superficial level and for his inability to cope with his own past and frustrations he seeks refuge into drugs. Mind-altering drugs only accelerate his mental detachment from the outside world, and when he discovers that his wife is cheating on him (Empty Spaces) -- not that much of a surprise, since Pink is by now quite disturbed and not paying much attention to her -- he puts \"the final pieces\" into a mental \"wall\" he allows his own mind to build as an escape from the real world (Another Brick in the Wall, part 3, Goodbye Cruel World).However, when the wall is built, Pink realizes that he is not able to come back to reality, no matter how hard he tries (Is There Anybody Out There?). Desperate and angered, Pink fantasizes of becoming a loathsome dictator to inflict punishment on the outside world that did wrong to him (In the Flesh, Run Like Hell, Waiting for the Worms). At this point, all the borders between reality and psychosis are confused, and we don't know how much his fantasies are a distorted vision of reality: the nazi-looking followers could be fans at a concert who are foolishly following his orders and seeing him as a godlike figure, or maybe he just thinks they are; then again, it could be that the whole thing is in his mind.Repulsed by the pathetic and loathsome figure he has become, Pink turns all the blame onto himself (The Trial) and sentences himself as \"guilty\" for all that happened to him. The film ends in a way that can lead to in multiple interpretations, as we don't know whether Pink really gets free from the chains of insanity. However, there is a strong hint of hope in the ending, and the film manages to put a touching feel to it.Now, if you think I missed something outlining the story, you are certainly right. It is very hard to point out all the contents of this rock opera without getting into personal interpretations, and that's also the reason why I did not list all the songs. Just like the album, Pink Floyd: The Wall signifies little on the surface and a lot if we analyze it in depth.Although the acting is virtually without any spoken line, Bob Geldof gives a good performance as adult Pink, and the same can be said about Kevin McKeon as young Pink. But of course, it is the imagery that really makes this movie: from the surreal animations by Gerald Scarfe, to the realism of the war sequences, to the visual punch delivered through colorful or gritty images of Pink's madness, there is plenty of memorable shots. The film uses multiple flashbacks to draw a parallelism between the real-life experiences of young Pink and the mental ones of adult Pink (again, it is left to the viewer to make sense out of it, so I won't delve into that). The music fits with the images almost seamlessly, and it never sounds out of place; if anything, in a couple of occasions it seems a little bit redundant.There are claims that this is a \"stoner\" movie. For the life of me, I have no idea of the reasons of such claims. Sure, Pink Floyd put out some albums that might be even more enjoyable under the influence of something, but this is hardly true for The Wall, and especially it couldn't be farther from the truth for the movie Pink Floyd: The Wall; this is not a motion picture of slow and trippy images, it is a true attack to the senses that might leave a viewer depressed or a little bit shocked, and I have the impression that under the influence of drugs the experience could be rightdown too much to take.Pink Floyd: The Wall gets my recommendation, especially to those who listened to the album and want to make sense out of its contents. This film doesn't speak out all the meanings behind it, but it can be helpful and it is certainly a worthy experience.8/10",

What exactly LEAD into this? A simple embarrassment in front of the class.And there's Geldof himself-it's alright when he doesn't talk, but his voice-and his grotesque face-just don't fit the tone of the movie. This said, it's actually pretty funny to see him scream \"STO-OP!\".Like I said, it's just not a faithful adaptation of the album.

It's better than other feature length rock musicals like TOMMY or EVITA.  This movie has everything but the kitchen sink (but it does have a bathroom sink).  Based on Pink Floyd's concept album, the film stars Bob Geldof as a successful rock star who has a mental breakdown in a hotel room and begins to question the meaning of his life, both in the past and the future.  The film contains many striking scenes and images, including some remarkable animated clips by Gerald Scarfe.  All of the songs on the album are included at various lengths except for \"Hey You\".  Joanne Whalley-Kilmer is listed in the credits, but I couldn't spot her.  Alan Parker's direction is excellent, especially with scenes involving large crowds.

Most people aren't going to have the patience to make sense of it; you can't really blame them, it's easier to let the images wash over you (which are pretty unpleasant). Trying to really get into this is like the scene with Pink rearranging hotel room debris in schizo patterns...would you really *want* to understand? There's definitely a method to the madness, though. Its not as incoherent as it seems. The album is like listening to a musical suicide note & the movie is like being inside a suicide's brain, every run on thought & recollection recreated in kaleidscopic detail. Along with Gerald Scarfe's delirious cartoons it's an epic montage of misery; words can't really describe it. In the end you can forgive it's miserablism, its earned & most others on the same wavelength don't have the same sheer visual inventiveness, anyway. It's possibly the greatest music video ever made. Mental disintegration is the perfect topic for this medium.THE WALL is about a depressed rock star, reviewing his life through a drugged out haze in every ugly detail.The kind of life summary someone hitting rock bottom makes. Everything is pain & darkness, fresh trauma waiting around every corner. It's the visual equivalent of Edvard Munch's Scream painting (which the movie poster riffs on). One long wail of despair, it's only interested in the hellish depths, the kind of flick you don't put on often. Negating everything is the first step to accepting everything, however. Here, the journey through Pink's subconscious is set to song.It's Roger Water's MTV therapy session & would be a total waste of time if he wasn't so masochistically honest about what a f*cked up human being he/we are. It's so harsh that it denies the truth of anything except pain, sweeping up much in its wake- mothers/lovers school fascism war - the whole convoluted system that sends people into these suicidal spirals by trying to mold them from day 1. They're not separable. It's in that spirit of total negation that someone can really bare to look closely at these things...paint it black.What stands out in this operatic fever dream? Sarcastic schoolyard anthems, masked children on conveyor belts ground to paste, cruel teachers, self mutilating rock stars laying waste to mankind, screwing flowers, towering walls, trials & talking asses, explosions, worms, dead staring eyes- Its amazing how everything gets a call-out, a big summing up. It's all here. Fatherless boys & castrating mothers, goose stepping & falling bombs...this stuff is great. Roger Waters is a d*ick but Roger Waters also has balls to be retracing his steps through the labyrinth like he does here, It's not either/or. Exposing your inner dictator isn't a walk in the park. I'm really glad for movies like this, not only does it recreate what a nervous breakdown can feel like but goes further & holistically ties it back into society with the totalitarian stuff. Pink is a microcosm.The wall itself makes me think of Wilhelm Reich's body armor idea, the muscular shielding people build to live in emotional war zones which quickly deadens them to *any* feeling. That in turn leads to things like shooting heroin, screwing groupies & committing mass murder to feel alive again (its utterly perfect how after the wall crashes only children are left, scrounging through wreckage). Critics who complained the film lacked resolution are dead wrong.It's great that someone made the connection for rock audiences between pop stardom & fascist demagoguery, too. It's done in a way where you're not sure whether to chuckle or quake. The hammer & sickle pageant that erupts into rioting while an exhilarating melody plays has to be the most jaw dropping moment I've seen in a musical. You feel guilty for getting into the tune with beatings & rapes on-screen, the racial slurs & skinned heads. Its blood curdling & absurd. Way to turn a cherished form inside out & shovel its steaming guts in the faces of the fans you hate, Roger. That's entertainment!There's worse sins than trying to shovel everything & the kitchen sink in but the album/movie wants to articulate the agony of it all so completely that it gets numbing quick, a constant bludgeon of horror & despair, the ultimate bad trip flick. It can be overwhelming if you're not prepared. The music provides the characters, the story, everything else is really just a framework for an apocalyptic day dream.I love Pink Floyd. Along with Radiohead they made the scariest rock music I've heard. I never connected much with pop until I heard these guys. THE WALL is the last album where the group was firing even close to all cylinders, half brilliant & half awful. I don't need these kind of pitch black tunes as much now but it was sure comforting when I did. Standout image: hard to choose just one but probably the flower devouring her mate. Best song: again hard but likely 'Comfortably Numb', which oughta be the rock anthem of the whole 20th century",

But then again, I can find a biblical or other kind of reference to anything.\nThere are many things written in the lyrics that are not in the actual songs. For example: \"The Trial\"-The only thing I couldn't understand in the whole film was who the hell the red headed monster in the trial scene was. But on more viewings I realize that it was in more scenes. But when I read the Lyrics it said: \"Call the wife\", and even more odd, they included that in their live shows as well.\nAnother thing to know, if you don't own the album, get it! you WILL like it. And you shall understand the story alot better.This film is a story about all of us. Roger Water's story of mental destruction and blocking yourself from the outside world, hence creating a WALL.All of us have a \"wall\", but some haven't finished it yet. Don't finish it. And if you do, tear it down. That is the message in this film. No matter how bad life is, do not let those bad things get to you. No matter what.All of us have a little Pink in us, but some just tend to not show it. Which is a bad thing, because you have already built a Wall blocking your real self.

Alan Parker does a great job at blending the scenes with the music and brings forward, Roger Waters' original vision to the screen, perfectly. Another highlight is the cinematography.

It (as well as the set- decoration and Bob Geldof's depressing performance) truly adds to the mood of the film.Probably the best scenes for me was the In the Flesh/Run Like Hell/Waiting For The Worms scenes.

I could say it was a long music video but when you listen to Pink Floyd's albums you would notice there's always a story through whole an album as a conceptual album.

However, there's much more to this movie than that. The Wall represents everything in Waters' life that once was pure and now is isolated and desolate. For one, he felt that a wall had been built between him and his fans: that nobody understood the meaning of Pink Floyd anymore and they'd all become animals (masterfully represented in the opening scenes) that just wanted a glimpse of stardom and a release from their own boring lives. He also inserted all of his own personal troubles, such as not having a father and putting up with the big life and the drugs involved. As the movies progresses, Pink (Waters' representation of himself) transforms into a Hitler of sorts, who represents every evil feeling he feels towards his fans and himself. By the time \"Comfortably Numb\" is through, this transformation is complete - as said by the \"new\" Pink in \"In the Flesh?\": \"Pink isn't well, he stayed back at the hotel and they sent us along as a surrogate band... we're gonna find out where you fans really stand!\" There's a lot of Syd Barret references as well, as Pink goes crazy he turns into what Roger saw Syd as after his deterioration.

The content is exceptionally well-plotted, and the pacing, while suffering from many of the same lapses that all long-form/concept rock pieces do, is still far above average. With the film, Waters had a chance to add more subtlety, a revision of the album as it were (including extra, and revised, songs); also, he had a chance to depict visually the things that were ambiguous in lyric. The temptation would be to oversimplify the psychological complexity, but Waters and director Alan Parker keep the same impressionist, almost dada feel to the images that appears in the album. A tour-de-force of music, images, and torture. Very highly recommended, and on my personal top 100 of all time list.",

Highly surreal, this movie is a \"what we have become- comfortably numb\" reflection of Roger Waters psyche in the late 70's.Parker's finest hour- Bob Geldof is a strange choice for Pink, but it somehow works. He's quite compelling to look at, and I found myself in complete sympathy with his plight. The world is cruel, where is the hope? \"Mother do you think we'll drop the bomb\" is another killer sequence. The music is perfect for the images, which morph into surreal animation from time to time.Hard-hitting, emotional, beautiful, classic- these are words which fit this film. I've seen it many times, and will see it many more.",

This picture is a one-of-a-kind experience. No other rock opera, or most movies in general, can top the insanity that is this movie. Viewing it now, I find myself getting nauseous especially with the gorily, disturbing animation. Most of the film is shot in the style of a music video, which some people have put down but I think this is one of those instances where it works. There is very little dialogue but a story is still told by Water's meloncholy songs and Gerald Scarfe's amazing and potent animation. There are some intense and violent metaphors in both the animation and live action sequences that illustrate not only personal illnesses, but social as well. This movie takes you on a wild journey through the world of a rock star named Pink. The movie takes you through so many emotions that you really have to watch it again to get the full effect.   It shifts in time and space (not to mention live action and cartoon) With no warning. There is no real dialogue, no real character development, and to a first time viewer no real plot and Only the central Character, Pink, has a name. there is violence, suffering and insanity mixed in with strange beauty and art. This movie is not your mama's musical with nazis, giant talking ass's and some other wild creations this is not a family film. The music is truly the star of this film the sounds evoke great images and the animation realizes these dreams/nightmares. ---------------------------------------------- Much of this is autobiographical material married of two members of the original band: Syd Barrett and Roger Waters. The results are a compelling story that peers into the mind of an over protected, reclusive, and sometimes violent rock star named Pink, who's father left him one morning in black 44', and who's mother was so protective she smothered him with her love and all of her fears; who's wife tried so hard to open his heart, but found that nobody was home; and who eventually built a wall so high that he could not break free, and eventually his seclusion from the outside world brought out a side of Pink that he, nor the rest of the world, would wish to ever see. Soon his sadistic, Hitler-esc side takes control of the world, with help from his zombie like fans who follow any command that is thrown at them.But by the time the dictator is mentally faded away by Pink, and he is able to see that shielding himself from the world with his now endless wall is only driving him crazier, it could be too late. So goes the quote above, taken from \"The Trial\", which is the end of the Wall, and Pink's last chance for freedom from his Wall. The tone is depressing and downbeat throughout - which is strange, I thought rock music should be an escape from boredom and reality?All in all The Wall is a great movie.",

In my own opinion Pink Floyd are my favorite band with the only close runner up being David Bowie and I'm not one of those guys that thinks \"The 80's music is better than everything every made\" however Pink Floyd as a fact are one of the greatest bands ever and the film is a great representative of their musical talents.

It is important to remember that when this film was made, there still was a wall separating Berlin and to think about how strange that sounds today shows how we are always inclined to do stupid things. Anyway, the movie traces a very important parallel between this political situation with the \"walls\" we are always creating in our personal lives what makes it eternally up-to-date and still very much worth seeing\u0085 The animated scenes elaborated by Gerald Scarfe are still impressive and Bob Geldorf's performance as Pink is perfect. This movie is a classic for who was young at that period, like me, but it is also a must for anybody else who likes the junction of music and cinema.",

The Wall uses both mediums to interweave Pink's neuroses, addictions, childhood abuse, fears and desires.rock-n-roller sex symbol \"Pink,\" played to perfection by Boomtown RatsOnce the money-making potential of Pink becomes realized by the exploiters in his life, Pink ceased being human and became a cash cow. Parasites feeding upon his talent provided insight into the same fame monster which oft befalls entertainers.Pink finds acceptance of himself, a visage of empty and ill-spent young adulthood, through traditional escapism: alcohol, sex and narcotics. As Pink collapses inwardly, he realizes that in order to find himself he must confront fears and extricate himself from the addictions to which he's become \"comfortably numb.\" The Wall is brilliant in its horrifying multiple realities, its complex music and its blending of various visual mediums. With Pink Floyd holding so many milestones throughout their 50+ year career, The Wall is oft regarded as the band's crowning achievement; a contribution to, and celebration of, themselves.So then, why is this movie still so culturally significant? Amongst art, film and music societies, The Wall is widely regarded as the last great, truly iconic hand-created animation \"super film\", akin to its 1960s Beatles-infused cousin, Yellow Submarine.As personal computer animation, stop-frame animation and Henson oriented puppets began saturating 1980s movies, The Wall officially ushered out handcrafted movie art, which stepped aside (or, more aptly, was pushed aside) for what became the CGI revolution.The Wall was a bridge between our cultural past and visionary glimpses of our supposed future. The Wall is an example of the powerful imagery and the moving beauty that hand-rendered artwork can (still) command...Yeah... Even in this 21st Century digital downloadable society.Technical nirvana is great and all but there really is something a wee bit satisfying about coming across a film that cannot -and will not ever- be replicated.And, oh, by the way... which one's Pink?",

The kind of alienation from anyone, regardless of age, race, sex, or anything because they truly are the same (F***ing human beings!)?  Where even the ones up high (the so-called \"civilized\") who've had everything handed to them on a silver platter (both metaphorically and literally) are such utter scum that you can't tell the difference between them and the so-called lowest, who have to dig in the dumpster for the day's food and scrounge your hard-earned money so they can drink or take drugs to numb the indignity of their situation?Have you ever been lied to for practically your entire life by almost everyone around you?  Not only by the bullies in your school/s, but even by your teachers, by the \"Highly educated and therefore qualified\" doctors who analyzed you, and even by the relatives you thought you could depend on who treated you like you were some kind of incompetent or invalid?  And then you found out you were actually the exact opposite (not just above the \"average\" but even PAST that), and therefore you have trouble trusting the opinions or anything those around you may say or suggest?Have you ever made the mistake of listening to people's views on anything whatsoever and then found out that their actions were totally contradictory to what they said they believed in?And, if you're a performer of any kind whatsoever (let alone a famous one, be you a musician, comedian, actor, etc.), have you ever felt that kind of alienation from those who dig your stuff?  When most people take your material totally differently from what it's supposed to mean?  Like, when you're being serious, they're taking it as the latest trend or maybe you're satirizing what you're really feeling?  Or, on the other hand, you can't stand your audiences anymore because you've gotten to that point when they're so drone-like to you that it seems like they'd jump off a high building if you said for them to do so?Have you ever felt that kind of alienation where you can't trust anyone, not doctors, not religion, not your family, not even the hobbies you'd taken up since childhood, and even the drugs or alcohol (perscription or otherwise) you took to cloud the pain while dealing with all this doesn't work anymore?You can't feel anything anymore, not for anything or anyone in the world, except maybe contempt, to say the least.  And so you shut everyone out. EVERYONE AND EVERYTHING!!!  (Goodbye Cruel World)But, in the process, you're so shut in that you can't talk to anyone and no one can talk to you because THE WALL you've built is too thick for anyone to get through and too thick for you to break through as well.  And, even worse, when you're tired of the alienation and you want to come back, even for a visit, you feel like you can't; not only because THE WALL is too thick to break through, but also because you don't feel anyone will understand what had happened to you. (Is There Anybody ... Out There?)Well, if you've never felt these things, I'm not sure if you can really understand this movie on a personal level.  But, at least the main character finally breaks through, so there's a happy note.  Another happy note is that the makers of this film are concrete evidence that you're not the only one feeling that way.That's how I take this film and the album anyway.  Excellent!!!P.S.

The movie grabbed something in me I had never felt. And I became a faithful desendant of Pink Floyd forever. It was the only music I ever listened to for a long time. These feelings are still stirred in me when I hear the songs or see a part of the movie. Its no coincidence, to me, that this movie was released the week I was born.\nThis movie is powerful, and disturbing. There is really nothing like it. it is totally uncomparable to anything.

There is no real dialogue, no real character development, and to a first time viewer no real plot and Only the central Character, Pink, has a name. there is violence beyond beleif, horrifying images of the holocaust and nazis, suffering and insanity mixed in with strange beauty and art. The story however is not that hard to understand.Pink Floyd the Wall is essentially about the rockstar Pink who is decending into madness. He is unable to cope with his fathers death in world war 2, his mother paid little or no attention to him, his \"conveyor belt\" schooling of facelessness, all the women in his life leeching off him, top it off with alot of drugs. Enough to drive anyone mad. These themes are all from things in the lives of the members of Pink Floyd. Syd Barret and Roger Waters fathers died in world war two. Roger Waters composed, and sang  the whole album with full intetion of eventually turning it in to the biggest stage show ever and then a movie.Why? Mainly because Pink Floyd was out of money because of a banking error. The stage show was amazing but it was only preformed something like 4 times and included a 500 ft. inflatable women and a 2000 cardboard box wall .The last show was in Berlin at the site of, of coarse, the Berlin wall. For the movie Roger Waters was to play Pink but, he was too close to the material. Bob Geldof was chosen. He would later go on to organize Live Aid in 86'. The Wall is not the only Pink Floyd album about madness however. The Darkside of The Moon also touches on the subject, and did all of its 200 weeks on the charts, and still does. In The Wall, Pink's teacher snatches a poem away from him and reads it. The poem is an excert of the song Money, from Darkside. Need anymore Wall trivia? Don't miss Bob Hoskins (of Who Framed Roger Rabbit fame)as Pinks manager, in the scene where Pink is shook awake and dragged away.",

Raised in the long shadow of the Greatest Generation, messed up by parents themselves scarred by war, many Baby Boomers do seem obsessively self-protective and self-centred (it's no coincidence that Trumps' signature project is a wall).What strikes me most about The Wall though, is the way it almost unintentionally shows us just how violent the 20th century was. From the wars that ultimately create the Pink Floyd character, to the corporal punishment at school, various riots and neo-Fascist insurrections depicted, Pinks' violence against women and even the casual racism of the old films he constantly watches - the 20th was an incredibly brutal century and this is, if nothing else, a piece of 20th century art.

I noticed the Oedipal Complex when Pink equates his girlfriend with his mother, I noticed the Vagina Dentata in several cartoons-from-the-void. But they were lacked depth and were unconnected to the Wall. What was the point?-I am not sure what ten-year olds should be doing if not sitting behind desks at school: bleeding heart liberals decided that children are not quite ready for the coal mines, to the dismay of conservatives who recognized the ability of children to squeeze into small spaces and get the really good coal. If schools are such dungeons, perhaps Waters would like to submit a paper to Pedagogy Today and suggest some improvements, such as requiring twelve credits of Poetry in order to graduate. That would be more productive that yelling \"TEACHER! LEAVE THOSE KIDS ALONE\" into a microphone. Somehow, I don't think educators were challenged, and replied \"no\" to the screaming idiot on the radio before returning their attention to their coffee.The kids in Waters' movie throw their books into a bonfire and dance like Germans in 1936. But 'Pink' would dress up as a neo-Nazi later on, so it works. Or not.-I am suspicious of anyone who comes across as excessively cheerful or negative. It smacks of self-indulgence and obstinacy.

Watching it again (now a 40 year old movie) and it stands the test of time. It is a musical, but fret not, it's more of Pink Floyd music with various videos played in the back, that tied together create a storyline. Probably too late for you to see the concert at this point, but that was great too and Roger Waters released that on DVD also and I recommend that as well. If you haven't watched it yet and are a Pink Floyd fan, this is a must see.",

Many might argue \"it's not a musical\" but do musicals need to have dancing? Is dancing the definition of musicals?I'm not a fan of musicals because of dancing, but this film is not a musical without dancing. It's not Broadway and it's not show tunes. It is a rock musical, with a completely different kind of music. The songs are sadder, angrier, more depressed and the picture follows the music.Show tunes about love make for soapy and sappy films. Sad and angry songs result in a much darker picture.There are some things I don't like about this film. In the album Pink cheats on his wife, then she leaves him for someone else. This makes Pink the architect of his own misery. In the film, however, Pink first learns of his wife's unfaithfulness before he starts sleeping with groupies. This makes him a victim. But he's already a victim of many things - overprotective mother, school system, lack of father. We don't need another element for his victimhood. They could've used that to give us another side to Pink's personality rather than hammer in the idea of him being a victim.I also don't like some of the animation. Some of it is great, but the trial, particularly the judge, is a miss.The additional songs and re-recorded pieces are great. What Shall We Do Now? is one of my favorite Pink Floyd songs.I wish they would make more films like this, either entirely live action or animated.This is what musicals should be. 9/10.",

The most notable of which is the end, when they show the still picture of the \"wall\" for about 20 seconds. Sober, it appears what it is, a common concrete wall. When high if you stare at the wall, you can make out the football field he played on as a kid, you see the animated woman with saggy breasts, you more or less see, a small portion of every scene in the movie, hidden somewhere in the brickwork and shadows. I swear before god, you can try and see it sober, and the closest you will get is if you stand back you can make out a slight shadow line about 3/4 of the way down the wall, that is the football field. to see anything more you'll definitely need drugs. not pot, pot doesn't make you hallucinate and it certainly doesn't open your pupils or your mind. try something different however and you'll see Pink Floyd \"The Wall\" for the first time all over again.",

            "content": "The Wall, a musical about what happens to a troubled youth when he becomes an adult, is a visually astounding masterpiece that redefines what a musical should be.Taken from the album The Wall by Pink Floyd, and written by Roger Waters (lead vocals and bass for the band), the film has turned people away who thought it was only for Pink Floyd fans.  On the contrary, the film is for anybody who wants to see a real movie.  The story is told through images and wide angled sets that are comparable to the cinematography in a Kubrick Film.  In the very opening scene (which is one of the most beautiful works of cinematography/set direction ever), you are immediately pulled into the movie and after that you feel like you're floating above your couch.  Make sure there are no distractions, because if the phone rings you'll have to take a moment to realize that you're in your living room, like waking from a dream.  There is very little dialogue.  Instead, The Wall goes by the slogan that invented movies in the first place: A picture is worth a thousand words.  It is in this sense that The Wall is a real movie.  Anyone seriously considering a career in film should watch this film as it goes back to the roots of cinema.Now, the music.  The Wall is one of the best albums ever recorded.  The dark moods, emotional depth and trance-like rock music is in its own category. The music is remastered for the film, and some music not previously released makes its debut here (eg. When the Tigers Broke Free).  If you liked this film, go home and synchronize Dark Side of the Moon with The Wizard of Oz.The Green Saga's Rating: 10 out of 10.",

He's closed in himself, trying to get over the incredible panic, anger, and pure madness, rising in his soul. to protect himself, he builds a wall around himself that'll keep all the bad people out of his world and prevent them from harming him.I really understand him, all of his actions - why he does them, how does he feel.

            "content": "As an album, Pink Floyd's \"The Wall\" thrust on the music world an opus with the towering angst of a burnt-out rock star cursing his environment for causing him to build a \"wall\" against it and its tortures, both trivial and relevant. Now, the film version provides a backdrop for the popular album as the literal adaptation by director Alan Parker assaults the senses by entering the mind of a character driven to the border between genius and madness by the pressures of reality.Except for substituting \"When the Tigers Broke Free\" for \"Hey You,\" the album's material is complete. Many of the tracks have been reworked, a tad slower and much richer than the originals, revealing all the nuances that the film's crisp sound uncovers.Roger Waters, bass player for Pink Floyd as well as the film's maestro, knew exactly how his audience would react toward his film even as he designed the poster art, which offers vivid snatches of several scenes scattered around the autistic main character. He is right: one doesn't remember the film as a whole so much as one is more inclined to remember a bombastic series of vignettes that have somehow surrounded Pink (played by Bob Geldof, lead singer of the Boomtown Rats).The images, however, do reflect a kind of demented poetry to them. Blood, whether it's dripping into a pool or a sink full of shaving cream, looks exquisite on film, just as light in the form of a match and a fluorescent bulb can appear to bring warmth as well as an oppressive glare to different scenes.Reviewing \"The Wall\" is entirely different from reviewing other movies made from albums, like \"Quadrophenia\" or \"Sgt. Pepper,\" because \"The Wall\" is meant as a piece of didactic art as opposed to a conventional rendition of an album, explaining the album's concept and themes rather than attempt to dramatize the 1.The universal themes of love, sex, war and oppression link each scene as Pink attempts to provide some sort of rationale for his world. In several scenes one can almost hear Waters describing how he wants the scene shot in order to bring about this or that type of symbolism.\"In the lyrics it says 'his fat and psychopathic wife,\" Waters might have explained to Parker, \"but that's just his warped perception of her. Actually, she is just an average wife who uses her stern facade to instill in him the perfect behavior he lacks. Get it? Okay, let's shoot it from the ground looking up so she looks bigger than life and gives her a little more respect.\"\"The Wall\" as a story is so lyrically tight that the album by contrast can't be pinned down to an examination of definite meanings. The film maintains this cornucopia of interpretations by painting numerous layers through images that sometimes flow, sometimes collide with each other. For example, Gerald Scarfe's animations can metamorphose a dove into a symbol of Nazi Germany, the Royal Air Force and finally the ruins of England, reversing any Phoenix myths.Scarfe also triumphs with the visual accompaniment to the lengthened version of \"Empty Spaces\" as the path of \"Shooting superstars\" is sarcastically examined. And a tender love scene between two flowers erupts into a violent rape as pistil and stamen battle each other mercilessly.The central point of the film is that Waters, or any other rock star, has the ability to become a fascist dictator in relatively the same kind of war that destroyed his father, the cornerstone of his wall. And that rock and roll has become a religion (or Reich) that has the same hierarchy and rituals as a socialistic society. The audience, however, is oblivious to it all, even as it enjoys it, and has for thirty some years.\"The Wall\" has the potential to be either a depressing hour-and-a-half of celluloid or a brilliantly colored, insightful tool to see just how far we will let out entertainers rule our lives, and vice versa. As I stepped out of the theater after viewing the film, one teenage girl remarked to her friends that it was the dumbest movie she had seen since \"Altered States.\" Ironically, she is the audience that Waters aimed the film at.",

I even read somewhere  that the film turns a critical eye toward Pink Floyd's own potentially crazed fans; and I believe it.  But it is bound together by the very personal and human, albeit tragic, journey of the main character.  After seeing this film a few times, it has all become quite clear to me what sets him off, and generally why. In the end, it doesn't excuse any of the horrors, disappointments or hang-ups of life, nor does it excuse his main reaction to them (building the mental wall to protect himself/eliminate the source of pain.)  It does grasp a bit at a bitter-sweet hope at the end in a way I only wish the tormented masses of the world could.All in all a harrowing, but satisfying journey through a part of the psychological landscape we often would rather not see, but must face at one time or another.Pretty amazing for a rock opera, I think.",

Rock star goes insane because of his dad dying in the war, his controlling mom, his suppressive teacher, his unfaithful girlfriend, and the pressure of fame in general.

Aside from the excellent quality of the animation, is the wonderfully disturbed imagery. Deformed humanoids, large birds, planes, and marching hammers, all merging shifting to the sounds of pink Floyd.

Everything that was true of the album (perhaps the greatest in rock history) in auditory terms is true of the movie visually. The incredibly eclectic Alan Parker, who can't seem to settle in a genre, does a brilliant job of bringing Roger Waters' masterpiece to life.  Bob Geldof, with almost no spoken lines, creates one of the most disturbing portraits of madness and isolation I've ever seen. And of course, there's the music; haunting, dark, and so deeply personal, you almost feel like voyeur hearing it.  What almost takes over the film, though, is Gerald Scarfe's incredible free-flowing animation, melting from one disturbing image to another, then segueing into his great production designs until you can't tell what's real anymore.Side note: buy the DVD! The extra features alone make it worth the purchase.",

            "content": "A massively symbolic film version of the album by the same name, this is cinematic brilliance for anybody who's a fan of either the band, or of audio-visual symbolism. The visuals always match the audio perfectly, down to tempo, timing, mood, and emotion (such as the hectic Run Like Hell or violently introspective and massively depressing Comfortably Numb [also quite possibly the best Pink Floyd song of all time])The film uses music and visuals (with the occasional dialogue as what would normally be 'incidental' music) to tell the story of Pink Floyd (before any pedants harass me, his last name is mentioned directly by the telephone operator,) a strung-out rocker who is partial fiction, and partially autobiographical of Roger Waters. Pink is on the verge of a nervous breakdown, and he goes from seeing himself as a victimised boy to a victimising fascist demagogue. The film, like the album, relies heavily on the contrasts of peace and violence, as well as a cyclical set up. For example, the album creates a loop by opening with the lines \"... we came in\" and finishing with \"isn't this where...\" The movie does much of the same, in that it examines the cycles of hatred, power, and the usual lot. A fine example of this is the teacher who is abused at home by his \"fat and psychopathic wife\" and then takes his powerlessness away by excercising power over the pupils, one of whom (Pink) grows up to envision himself excercising his own power over the weak.Another fantastic use of symbolism and imagery are the masks. To again return to the school montage (which is set to two well-known and well-done Floyd songs, Happiest Days and Brick in the Wall p2) the students all sit obediently wearing masks of conformity. However, they rip off these masks to show their true feelings which lie beneath. As can be expected, this film also relies heavily on the use walls as symbolism, and they can range from blatantly obvious to severely subtle.On top of all this, the film makes a very good statement about the masses blindly following their idols (something which might slightly deflate your opinion of Waters' ego)All in all, this film is a must see for any of the following types of people: Pink Floyd fans, fans of poetry, fans of cult films, fans of avante-garde movies, or just a casual moviegoer with an hour and a half to kill and a couple bucks to spare. Check it out, you won't be disappointed.",

It's the revolutionary film of the ugly decade of 80's. At the same time it's a poetic and strongly deep film with a touch of humanity. Waters and Parker attack with powerful elements to the English way of thinking at the period. We are bricks. If we don't break our personal wall we will remain bricks. We are human creatures when we try to break the Wall. The animation scenes are more than art and the messages of the film give to the audience the opportunity to think. Anti- War, Anti- Nazi, deep sensitive film and a rock star with the name Pink. The real name of him is Mr. Isolation. I loved it. A real masterpiece and cinematic experience.",

I have been watching \"The Wall\" in theatres (ain't midnite movies great!), at home on video cassette, and now on the Special Edition DVD (which I highly recommend!)  I bought an audio copy the day it was released in 1979, and several more since!Music is a special art.  Through it, imho, emotions can be stirred as no other medium can.  \"The Wall\" is as impressive with only sound as it is with images.  Being a true opera (no dialogue), the video only enhances the music.  Another example of Rock Opera is \"Tommy\" by The Who.  In that case, however, there is too much dialogue, and if you listen only to the audio it sounds like a collection of great music but not a story.The exception is Gerald Scarfe's animation.  \"Goodbye Blue Skies\", \"Empty Spaces\" and \"The Trial\" scenes are absolutely amazing (or gut-wrenching -- depending on your perspective).  Watching these sequences (which were produced by Roger Waters himself) adds a new dimension to what was a truly incredible beginning.My recommendation is, get a copy of the lyrics or get the Special Edition DVD and turn the lyrics on (if you don't already have them committed to memory).  Wait till you are home alone late at night.  STAY SOBER! Alcohol and drugs will only lessen the impact, trust me.  Now crank up your stereo, and allow absolutely no interruptions.  Immerse yourself in the experience that is \"The Wall\".",

Also the subject is one of the best ever used: The wall people build and the mask they wear to protect themselves from being hurt by the the dangers of social contact. I like the story being so complex that it can be interpreted in many ways, especially the part were Pink is behaving like a dictator. I think this part is still happening in his head only, that he's being a dictator to his feelings, his longing to have contact with the outside world again. For suppressing his feelings and thus neglecting the people who try to love him, he's being judged in the end. Anyway, that's just an opinion, there's lots more to this film.

            "content": "The Wall is probably my favourite album, so naturally I was very interested in seeing the film - having finally got round to owning the DVD, I can say I found it strange to say the least.Of course the music is largely intact, with a few things added ('When The Tigers Broke Free', 'What Shall We Do Now'), a few things taken away ('Empty Spaces', 'Hey You'), and a few things given an interesting re-recording ('Mother', 'In The Flesh', 'Outside The Wall'). You could see it as the world's most elaborate music video, if you wanted to think of it that way, and it's fascinating to see how they've decided to bring some of the classics to life on screen - special note must go to Gerald Scarfe's animation, the sequences he provides (particularly for 'Goodbye Blue Sky') are the most stunning and memorable in the film.So what's my problem with the film that stops me enjoying it as much as I did the album? For one thing, I didn't feel the character of Pink (played by Bob Geldof) come across as much, and never really understood why I should sympathise with him - things just didn't seem as neatly wrapped up as they did in the album, perhaps a result of the scatter-shot spectrum of scenes and imagery. Besides the decreased cohesiveness, it is also a tiring film to watch - even Roger Waters himself called it a 'slog' on the DVD, mentioning that the streak of humour in the album had somehow vanished from the film, making it hard viewing. Also, I find it hard to imagine anyone who isn't interested in Pink Floyd getting much out of this movie (especially with the scattering of in-jokes to be found).Nevertheless, for anyone who's fond of the album, I'd recommend checking this out at least once - particularly the DVD version, which has a wonderful commentary by Roger Waters and Gerald Scarfe that makes the movie a lot easier to understand.

            "content": "I must agree with the users here who have spoken out about the ignorance surrounding this movie, the works of Pink Floyd, and progressive/psychedelic music in general.This album was inspired by Roger Waters being incredibly sick of idiot arena concert goers who were there to drink a lot of beer and not give a damn about the music or it's related meaning. He actually spit on one of them at a show and then was taken aback with his own actions, since this was not the impetus that began Pink Floyd back in the summer of love.Careful looks at Pink Floyd's work will see how the spectre of Syd Barrett's mental breakdown - from a well-adjusted bright young lad and friend to a vacant burned out husk who was unrecognizable as his former self - informs their work. A commentary about the things in the business world that crush the spirit of innocent artists, and the band's own guilt at not trying to take a hand in preventing it.This, coupled with Roger Water's own feelings about the death of his father in World War II and how this affected him led to the creation of the character \"Pink\" - an amalgam of Waters' and Barrett's lives.From here, one can follow along with each stage of psychology - The Mother Imprint, The Father Imprint, School Experiences, and how this ultimately leads to an incapacity for healthy Social Interaction with his peers and wife.This leads to addiction, and the over-reactive need for control.The movie is not glorifying the damaged rock-musician clich\u00e9 - nor is it trying to be a neato psychedelic movie to watch under the influence of hallucinogens, though these overtones are there.It is a movie describing the different psychological \"bricks\" that build up a wall between an artist and the rest of the world - a cry out to the rest of humanity to be humane and recognize the factors that are driving sensitive people all around us into dysfunction.At the end, the children are left to pick up the pieces...",

This movie is brutally harsh and makes virtually no attempt to tell the watchers things don't always go this bad in life. In fact, it seems to go out of it's way to drill into your head just how horrible life is.That said, onto the review. The movie depicts the descent into madness of a fictional rock star named Pink Floyd. The events that lead up to this mental breakdown are depicted through confused, random, and fairly hallucinogenic memories of the aforementioned rock star. There is very little actual dialogue in the film but the story instead is unfolded through the songs of the Pink Floyd CD The Wall. The movie requires the introspection of the viewer to truly understand the symbolism and messages being sent throughout the film.There are very few actors in the movie that are not cameo roles as well, the only truly constant actors are Pink, the schoolmaster, Pink's wife, Pink's mother, and young Pink. While the movie cannot be called taxing to a person's acting talent (pretty much they either stood their, smashed something, or walked from point A to point B) they were enjoyable to watch and you developed a feeling for them. What the feeling was definitely varies from person to person (was Pink a victim of his upbringing or was the building of the \"wall\" solely his own fault?).The movie utilizes several key symbols throughout the film. The main symbol was the wall- the mental wall we build in our mind to keep out the hurt of the outside world. Another is the rag doll- used to express facelessness and defenselessness. There is a third even more important symbol in the film too- the marching hammers but that symbol is something so integral to the very thread of the movie that until you watch the film it is pointless to explain it.",

He locks himself in a room and recalls many depressing moments of his life. At the end of it, in a heroin induced psychosis, he sends \"marching hammers\" to destroy east London.This movie goes from live-action to animation and the story is told from the music of the album of the band by the same name.

            "content": "After years of not viewing this film, I purchased the DVD and find myself even more impressed with it this time around. Perhaps when I was younger I wasn't picking out some of the subtleties and metaphoric connections that it was trying to show audiences when it first came out.This is not just a self-indulgent film shot off by some self-loathing rock star created solely to gain sympathy from fans. Much of this is autobiographical material married of two members of the original band: Syd Barrett and Roger Waters. The results are a compelling story of a man who cannot break free of the psychological chains that have held him for years, and how it affects the longevity of relationships in his life.Most of the film is shot in the style of a music video, which some people have put down but I think this is one of those instances where it works. There is very little dialogue but a story is still told by Water's meloncholy songs and Gerald Scarfe's amazing and potent animation. There are some intense and violent metaphors in both the animation and live action sequences that illustrate not only personal illnesses, but social as well.This film, like the album, is a work of art that stands alone in both the music and film genres. It is very dark and psychological and will probably be enjoyed most by those who are open to the art of self-analysis.It also helps if you're a fan of the music, because if you are put off by the original album, there is simply no point in you seeing it at all.",

No men not have all the package, even a insane person. \"PINK\" represents a social character, the disgrace of a entire generation in all the possible forms, there are represented: WAR, DEAD, SEXUAL BEHAVIOR, DRUGS, RETROGRADE EDUCATION, POLITICAL Oppression, FASCISM, REBELION, MARRIAGE, INFIDELITY, BAD MANAGEMENT OF THE SUCCESS, DEPRESION, ETC. ETC.,...We all are guilty of living in this time, so at the end, we all are stoned in the WALL, because is the price for living in this crazy world.

There is no doubt that Alan Parker did a great work assembling all the different and complex elements of this material; making a very original artwork. One mistake that I find in the story is that the character was very (in excess) enclosed in his proper world, which makes the story less enriched.

I felt that, unlike the film version of 'Tommy', this film would do the associated album justice. However, I was partially wrong.Beginning with the positives. Most of the songs in the film are taken straight from 'The Wall', untouched with the exception of those focusing on the main character of Pink, a drug-fuelled rock star driven over the edge (portrayed by punk singer Bob Geldof in a powerhouse performance). The visuals are absolutely stunning! Alan Parker the director (of Bugsy Malone fame) and Gerald Scarfe the artist together made some of the most iconic images in music and movie history, most notably the marching hammers sequence.This brings me to my biggest negative with the film. It would work perfectly as a totally visual piece with music as I feel that the small scenes of dialogue (in the school, before 'Comfortably Numb' and so on) stilt the film's pace, something that doesn't occur on the album. Some of the images can also be quite disturbing and do not fit into the narrative, such as Pink's transformation into the neo-Nazi Pink and the aftermath of the wall's destruction for Pink himself, although these are just minor problems.Overall, 'Pink Floyd The Wall' is a fascinating experiment in taking a rock opera and interpreting it visually and, while it works on many levels, it falls short on others. With that said, I would still recommend this film as it can be very enjoyable... just prepare yourself for it!",

The film was filled with psychotic characters and trippy images, almost good enough to rank with Stanley Kubrick. And of course, the soundtrack is great in all its psychedelic glory.I liked how the movie got you inside the head of Pink, the main character. The film allows you to watch him from his imperfect childhood to his mental breakdown. The film uses a lot of surreal and trippy images to get you to understand what's going on inside Pink's brain.The film is also in a way a political satire. As Pink goes through his mental breakdown, he is transformed into a facist dictator reminisent of Hitler. During the \"In the Flesh\", the people praise Pink, wave insignia, and cheer.  The song \"In the Flesh\" is Pink's facist party's national anthem.  That, and the segment during \"The Trail\" are probably the most exciting moments in the film.It was filled with probably the greatest surreal images in the history of movies. Most of the time when a film uses surrealism, the plot becomes hard to understand. I think the director wanted you to see it through Pink's eyes and not from a third person perspective. That's where the surrealism comes in handy. It adds mystery and gives the film a more eerie premise. One problem people have about surrealism it that they don't understand it. I think surrealism was not to be understood.",

The most important aspect to look at isn't necessarily the societal implications. Yes, it sounds artsy and intelligent to talk about how the movie related to Orwell's 1984 (which it did) and the way it bashed capitalism (it did that too); in my opinion, the great triumph of this film was in its portrayal of insanity and the descent of Pink, the main character, into it. The visuals and animation, while at first grisly and disturbing, are also beautifully symbolic of the turmoil faced by Pink. It is in this area that impressive strides were made into areas rarely explored (to any effect) in film. When coupled with the soundtrack (which anyone of taste would agree is fantastic and emotionally moving) it makes for one of the most impressive music-based films ever conceived. The raw emotion captured is something rarely found in cinema. It is my sincere belief that this film succeeded completely in bringing The Wall to life.",

            "content": "I, personally, am a big Pink Floyd fan and \"The Wall\" has to be my favorite album of theirs.  The album, being two LPs or CDs long, follows one long story of a rock star named Pink Floyd.  When Pink is very young, his father is killed in WWII and he is raised by an overprotective mother and ridiculed at school.  He grows up to become a rock musician, but amidst his depression, he turns to alcohol and drugs.  The whole idea of \"the wall\" is that Pink builds a mental wall around himself to protect himself from the chaos of the outside world.  But \"the wall\" becomes too isolating for him and he tries to get out of it.  When he can't, he turns to violence and becomes a dictator-like character, in order to hide his former personality. Roger Waters (lead singer and bassist for Pink Floyd) did a great job of turning \"The Wall\" into a motion picture.The movie itself is very incredible.  Because of the fact that there is very little dialogue in this movie (only a few lines) and the story is told by Pink Floyd's music, you really need to know the whole story of \"The Wall\" (album) before you see the movie.  The acting in the movie is a little shaky.  I personally don't feel that Bob Geldof was the best choice for the lead role.  Two of the songs from the album are re-sung by Geldof in the movie and he really doesn't have the best singing voice (well, not at all as good as Roger Waters).  The animation in the movie is awesome, though. Gerald Scarfe does an incredible job with all of the animation.  It is so powerful and it amplifies the movie much more.  Who could forget the scenes of the marching hammers?  The hammers are one of the symbols of the movie (they are used as symbols of power and destruction by Pink when he becomes a dictator).  This movie combines many different aspects of art by putting together great music, awesome animation and spectacular filmmaking.  I recommend this movie to anyone that wants to see a powerful, immense and fantastic film.",

On my scale of 1-10 I give an it an 11.This movie recounts the story of a fictional Rock Star named Pink Floyd (played by Bob Geldof who is fantastic at this role); who goes crazy because of a scarring childhood, and a hellish adult-life. The tantrum Pink throws, was acted really well, and was an important part of figuring out just what the songs of Pink Floyd (the band) really mean. Take The Wall for instance- the line \"We Don't need no education\" does not mean all education in general, but just the darker part of education. The miserable teacher side of education, is all it means.This picture is loaded with some exquisite Animations which make the movie a one-of-a-kind experience, and has little dialogue.It was also written by Pink Floyd Bassist Roger Walters who went crazy in real life and was placed in a mental institution for skitzophrenia.\nThis is the kind of movie you will either love or hate... but definately a must-see.This is clearly one of the greatest pieces of film making in history of man kind.",

The album The Wall is one of the greatest albums of all time. It's also one of the last albums that Roger Waters and David Gilmore worked on together. It's the story of a rock star named Pink Floyd slowly fading into insanity. His insanity is brought on by his teacher, his fathers death in WW2, his overprotective mother, and many other factors. I give this movie a 4 out of 10 because it has two redeeming qualities. The WW2 scenes are awesome and the music is Pink Floyd. The WW2 scenes are realistic, graphic, and well put together. The music is great simply because it's Pink Floyd. That being said, they didn't utilize all the songs on the Wall. They left out one of my personal favorites (Hey You)which impacts my views of the movie a little bit, but the animation and the constant sexual tones are my biggest problems. Sex has nothing to do with insanity. Last time I checked, it was supposed to be a good thing. The plants that appeared to be reproductive organs was weird, the characters in the Trial scene were all sexual organs of some form which was unnecessary and just plain stupid. The animation is just bizarre. It's too sexual towards the later parts of the movie. The WW2 stuff is awesome though. My last problem with it is that it's extremely forgettable. I watched it and two minutes later I could barely remember anything about it except for Neo-Nazis and strange animation. If you like Pink Floyd and absolutely must watch the movie, it's whatever. Just don't be surprised if you're extremely disappointed.",

            "content": "***LOTS OF SPOILERS*** \"Pink Floyd The Wall\" is the most expensive art film ever made. It's a feature length music video (filmed in an era when those were something a bit more interesting than the video wallpaper we see today)that tells the story of Pink, a rock star who is really an amalgam of Pink Floyd's founding members Syd Barrett and Roger Waters, as well as some other rock stars Waters had met or heard about. It begins in a hotel room where Pink is thinking about his life. The first half of the movie concerns itself with a childhood that was full of regret, having lost his father in WWII (Waters lost his father in a similar way), struggling to get out from under the thumb of an overprotective mother, and a stifling school system where students are kept in line through fear and intimidation to keep them on the path to \"success\". It turns out we're watching Pink disintegrate before a scheduled concert that he really would rather skip. He drugs himself into a stupor and has to be roused by his manager, who drags him on stage, where he imagines himself a fascist who curses his fans (fans who, of course, mindlessly go along with the whole thing). By the end of the show, he comes to his senses, and \"judges\" himself during a wonderful animated sequence by Gerald Scarfe called \"The Trial\". This is a great rock and roll movie, but it's also something else: Waters was inspired to write \"The Wall\" after a disastrous show in Pink Floyd's \"Animals\" tour where he found himself unable to connect with the audience, and, in a moment he immediately regretted, spat in the face of one of the audience members. Faced with questions of what was happening to him, he fashioned a musical apology to this one fan, summed up with the album's final track, \"Outside The Wall\". The movie is about the walls we build to protect ourselves, but it's also about how, once our walls are torn down, we have to contend with the walls of others. Much of the humor Waters intended with this satire is missing in the film, which concerns itself with a very dark tone, but there's no denying the power of the imagery, or the painterly eye that Alan Parker exhibits with the camera. Gerald Scarfe deserves much of the credit also for the movie's look. There is much more going on in this film than the average review of \"great movie to watch while you're stoned\" would lead you to believe. One of the best rock and roll movies out there.",

            "content": "Pink Floyd's The Wall is already an overrated album with plenty of songs that are filler, some good songs have weak lyrics and some great lyrics use weak music just to convey the message. The film takes all that, keeping all the filler, and adding even weaker pieces like When the Tigers Broke Free 1 and 2.Some of the weaknesses of the Wall's story are amplified even more. The horrors of WWII are shown even though the boy had no way of knowing. It is presented as if the boy himself were a war veteran, suffering from a case of contagious PTSD, perhaps by touching his father's medals or uniform. The album alludes to the Luftwaffe's raids, but the film makes it seem as if it the boy experienced the war on the front line first hand, which is laughable.The film, with its completely new songs, reordered playlist and freedom to add scenes with no music, does not address the transformation of Pink from rock star to neo-fascist leader. It's just a hole in the plot that is left to our imagination. Fine for an audio album, not for a visual film.Some of the things look theatrical and comic - the headmaster in the tunnel looked like a clown, the neo-fascist rally's synchronized dancing was less \"Triumph of the Will\" and more Macarena.The animation goes from beautiful (Goodbye Blue Sky, Empty Spaces) to ridiculous - The Trial with a talking buttocks as presiding judge.A lot of mistakes were done. If I were Pink Floyd (or if I were Waters), just as the protagonist was a composite character, so should the album be a composite, not loyal to The Wall, but taking the best of Pink Floyd to make something larger than life. The song Money would've been a great piece, Pink as a rock star enjoying his riches, then the dissatisfaction with the political system, shown via Animals, would've made the transition from rock star to fascist leader a great one.It all boils down to this - did they want to make a great Pink Floyd-based, The Wall film or make a long music video for The Wall? It is not a binary issue, but a gradient, since they already changed the order of events, added new songs and reworked original songs, so this was not a pure \"The Wall\" film. My opinion is that they should've added things from their past, reworked if needed, to tell a better story, to make a better film rather than one truer to the album.Perhaps that's an idea for the remake.",

This film, as with all of Pink Floyd's music, should be an inspiration to us all. However, the film is not quite as effective on the small screen, as it was in the cinema.

            "review_title": "Another DVD on the Wall",
            "content": "Just finished watching THE WALL on DVD.  And it was quite good.Firstly, as all of you know it is presented in widescreen, which afforded me a view of those sights that were previously hidden in the pan and scan full frame version.  The picture is very clear, with only a trace of those pubic hair like things every now and then.  To my slight dismay, I got a digital pixel blip that I have never experienced with my DVD player.  It was near the beginning and did not reappear to my knowledge.The sound is wonderful.  I don't have a huge sound set up in my living room, but my TV does have surround sound and I thought it was a dramatic improvement over the VHS.  Although I've listened to these songs more times than what's probably considered healthy, they almost sounded like brand new songs.The running commentary track with Roger Waters and animator Gerald Scarfe was extremely entertaining.  Not only did Waters and Scarfe discuss bits of film trivia, but they also wax a fair amount of philosophic.  In places Waters reminisces at length about his childhood and while some of it is stuff we've read or heard in past interviews, it's still fascinating. Scarfe, of course, talks mostly about the animation, but his commentary is engaging as well.  Oh, and there are moments in the commentary that are very, very funny.  I was unprepared for this and almost laughed myself to tears at some of his comments.  While the film itself might be very grim stuff, Waters himself is extremely witty with a gut busting sense of humor.There are two documentaries on the DVD.  The first one looks old and appears to have been made shortly after the movie.  I only watched half of it as it was a trifle repetitive, filling in alot of screen time with clip after clip from the movie itself.  The second documentary, divided into two parts for some reason, is alot better.  It looks quite recent and features lengthy interviews of Roger Waters, Gerald Scarfe, Alan Parker, and others.  All of them are very fun to listen to.  Being a fan of Waters, I naturally liked his interviews best.  Unlike other persons in the rock n roll industry, Roger Waters on film is sort of a rarity.  It was neat to see him talking and telling stories.Among the extra bonus features on the DVD is the inclusion of the previously unreleased HEY YOU reel.  While it's in black and white and the sound is somewhat raw, it is a welcome addition to the DVD.  After watching this footage, it was clearer to me why, of all songs, this one was deleted and why I never really missed it.  I can see how it would have made the narrative bog down a little.Next in the list of bonus features is a crude music video for ANOTHER BRICK IN THE WALL PART II.  In the commentary,  I believe it is Gerald Scarfe who says that when this song was first released as a single, a video was hastily put together using animation from the WALL live shows along with some footage of kids milling about and lip synching the words.  It looks like an extremely early MTV video, shot on a budget of about fifty dollars.The third bonus feature, titled PROMO, takes you to another menu where you can watch the trailer, look at still production photos (some of which I have never seen), or leaf through a gallery of conceptual drawings and artwork by Gerald Scarfe.The menus are interesting at first but get tedious once you've had to sit through them a time or two.  It is clear that time and care went into their design, but certain menus are bordering on cheesy, particular the one for sound set up, in which the selections look like red pie plates for some reason.  I would have loved to see some clips of live WALL footage as a bonus feature but with all that WAS included, I can't complain.  Except for the design on the DVD case.  I think people will agree with me that the original blue screaming head on the old VHS box and movie poster was a more classic looking design.Aside from those tiny gripes, this is a top notch DVD.",

All the images are cliches which makes it not so disturbing (which is Roger Water's intention). It's hard to be frightened by teeny-boppers shouting \"heil pink\"At the same time, I loved it. I don't know if it is 'cause I'm a Pink Floyd fan but I couldn't get enough of it. This is best music/album film ever because it has no concert footage (which is not much considering \"Stop Making Sense\" is the second best) Perhaps the conversion of an album to a film is just too limiting. Hopefully somebody will eventually prove me wrong.",

The movie helps to answer some, not all, of the questions. But it's all about the music. If you watch the DVD be sure to check out all the extra stuff on the DVD. There is an interview with Roger Waters and lots of behind the scenes. Not bad for a movie that was made in 1982.Enjoy.",

Pink doesn't take responsibility for his decisions and move on, instead he blames society, liberalism,and the lack of structure (i.e. democratic freedom).He turns towards Fascism as the solution. The state dictates how to live, preventing pain and disorder that was his life, whilst deluding himself with power and a false sense of superiority, bolstered by a tunnel visioned goal of domination.In the end he is a wasted soul, finding out that control and order are not the makings of happiness. Pink becomes a victim of his own machine, again reiterating the fact that One's decisions are their responsibility to the end.Basically this is about a person who blames everyone but themselves for their problems, and reaps the consequences.",

Although I was keeping a lot inside, my older brother, who was 16 at the time, sensed my emotional turmoil and was kind enough to drag me along with his friends to the midnight movies, part of the social experience of being a teenager in the 1980s. The midnight movie was Pink Floyd The Wall. My brother also knew how much I loved that album because I practically wore out the cassette tape. Watching that film as a 12 year old was probably more than I should be able to handle given it\u2019s dark themes, violent images, some sexual imagery and seeing the hedonist and sometimes very ugly side of rock and roll culture. However, the film completely blew my young 12 year old mind. As I had previously been listening to the album on cassette, I already had some imagery my mind created from the music itself and now I was actually seeing someone else\u2019s idea of that imagery on the big screen! My imagination was a flame with delight. While the imagery I had created in my head was different, of course, it was strange how some of it seemed familiar to me or close to how I was previously imagining what was going on in that concept album. At a time in my young life where my own personal bricks were being added to the persona of my wall, I had a kind, caring older brother who introduced me to an incredible piece of artwork that has left a positive mark on my soul. Some may say it is just a film or some may say it is a sloppy film or an overtly, self-indulgent music video that goes on too long for its own good. However, i\u2019ve had such a personal experience with it that it remains one of my favorite movies.",

I think anyone who is or is not a fan will have an interesting and unique experience. Any sort of character development comes through the music, which itself tells the whole story. This will be the closest we will ever come to examine Roger Waters mindset and feelings.\n\nThe songs themselves are not only amazing, but brilliantly expressed and unequal compared to other bands.

It stars Pink, a rock star suffering through many hardships through his life, like the absence of his father, an unfaithful wife, and his total mental isolation from the outside world. It's definitely not a movie for everyone, with mental illness, loneliness and war all being main themes prevalent throughout the film. It's a film filled with imagery and symbolism, most of which is dark and ominous to reflect the downward spiral of Pink's sanity. The film has very little dialogue as well, choosing more to rely on silence and the music from 'The Wall' album, which also makes it enjoyable for any Pink Floyd fan. While being a unique and interesting film, it definitely fills you feel a sense of despair while viewing. As that is the point of the movie, it shouldn't be counted against it, but if depressing or disturbing movies aren't your thing, stay away from it. If not, it's a truly thought provoking movie and you should give it a try.",

The living quarters looks like purgatory or some kind of prison giving you the feeling that everyone is the same and living through the same hell and no one is different or unique. The old time music gives me 'The Shining' vibe. Really great how they build the tension. \n\nLoving the use of metaphors in this movie like the whole 'hammers' propaganda representing the Nazi's. I like the comparison of war on the battlefield and war on the streets. It's pretty clever how they used the songs from The Wall to tell the story as dialogue instead of the characters really talking much. \n\nHere's a guy who has completely lost himself and has lost reason to live. These animations are amazing especially given that it's the 80's and nothing could be easily computerized. Pretty great writing and metaphors. The old child self is trying to find out where everything went to shit and why everything went to shit in his grown self. Those are some pretty terrifying visuals when he's transforming. \n\nPretty dark stuff in this movie. Leave it to Roger Waters to leave the viewer with a feeling of hopelessness and feeling of emptiness inside. It's like where the fuck is hope? Where the fuck is optimism? He's way too much of a cynical person to give you a somewhat hopeful ending message. It almost feels like at times that Waters got really personal and emotional and tied himself into the story. Some parts were kind of obscure with what the message was. Such as why Pink hallucinated that he was a Neo Nazi leader. Maybe in his mind, he felt like he was conforming and dead inside or the injection could have been a metaphor for Western medicine which sometimes makes things worse instead of helping. But overall great movie. \n\nVery impactful with the topics and it's messages. I liked it even more when I saw the aesthetic and feel kind of reminded me of Terry Gilliam's style. Even though the movie is inspired by one of y favorite Pink Floyd albums, I have to say the material is way too  serious for me to want to watch again. I'll watch it again in a couple of years.",

He grows up, but has so blocked out his feelings that he can't express them to his wife (and he also seems to be heavily addicted to drugs, though these aren't expressly seen other than what may be some hash) so she looks for emotional comfort elsewhere. He starts to grow so much hatred within himself that he envisions a group of hate that can destroy everything, very similar to the Nazis, and maybe an ode to the theory of how if Hitler had been encouraged to be an artist he never would have been the mass murderer we know him as. Finally at the end he is writing a song, and at this point he is ordered, perhaps by himself, to tear the wall down, which is what the artist often does when they turn to songwriting. In fact, the song Pages by Three Doors Down discusses this pretty well. Overall, the movie was by no means dull and was visually very interesting, though the graphics were much too sexualized and hallucinogenic for my taste. Also, there are a lot of genital monsters in the film, which is kinda weird. Interesting movie, and I don't think it's bad, but I probably won't be watching it again.",

Does anyone have a message? \n\nWhen watching the 1982 rock opera \"Pink Floyd The Wall\", I thought to myself, \"wow, we will never see anything like this ever again.\" I think I can hold onto that statement until the day I die, and it will most likely still be true. \"The Wall\" was a 1979 Pink Floyd album which was later adapted into this movie, using their music, obviously. It was released at a time when musical artists were still worthy of being called musical artists. It was also at a time when music served as a larger part of society, a time when music always had a message.\n\n\"Pink Floyd The Wall\" is about a lot of things. It's about embracing inner expression, issues with education, and makes many more strong political statements. If you're a fan of Pink Floyd, well, that just helps. The music, in my opinion, is fantastic. I'm a fan of Pink Floyd, and have been for quite some time. It's haunting and almost spiritual, and the story told in this film is one of many complex levels with complex emotions. \n\nThe main character, a rockstar named Pink, sits in his hotel room in Los Angeles, thinking about the past and dwelling on his current problems while avoiding them. Less than half of the film consists of powerful and expertly designed animation. The animation in the film serves a bigger purpose than to entertain, like most Pink Floyd music does, and like the rest of the movie does, and unlike modern music does. \n\nPink dwells on his past; he thinks of his overprotective mother, his dad who died in WWII, the Missile Crisis, and the lack of freedom of expression in his school. In his current, drugged and numb state, he slowly goes crazy in his own mind, by himself. This is very powerful and imaginative stuff, especially when we know it's coming from the mind of Roger Waters. I don't think a time will ever come that I watch this film and I don't think to myself, \"what could this mean?\" Because \"Pink Floyd The Wall\" is one of those open-ended films that you'll always learn more and more about each time you watch it. \n\nDuring one of the scenes in Pink's childhood, we see children being led in a line, wearing the same face, being marched into a grinder. Pay attention to the lyrics: \"all in all it's just another brick in the wall.... We don't need no education.\" Not only is it haunting, but it's very powerful, and I believe it has been brought to life perfectly with one of the most powerful scenes in the movie. \n\nThe animation, like I said earlier, is masterfully made. Some of it is appropriately disturbing, some is haunting, some is bizarre, but all of it is powerful. For you to figure out is the true meaning behind all of it. I'm not entirely sure if it means something different to everyone, but I do know this: everyone will find something different when they watch it, whether it be personal feelings or altered understandings of each scene.",

Have you ever had a dream so outlandish that you know it could not have actually happened but you remember it like a real memory? That nightmare is Alan Parker's Pink Floyd's The Wall. This movie is the closest I have ever seen to an actual nightmare. This movie was quoted as being the most unpleasant experience of Alan Parker's life, it caused much tension between Roger Waters and the rest of Pink Floyd and Roger Waters did not like the end result. Although all of this is unfortunate for those involved, what came out of this misery was a fantastic film. The almost complete lack of dialogue, the excellent usage of Pink Floyd's captivating album, and the surreal animation sections of the film makes this film a visual and auditory experience. The film hits the themes of the aftermath that war left on people and Britain, corrupt teachers (excellent and infamous \"Another Brick in The Wall Part 2\" scene), marriage, fascism as an allegory for fame, and the events in life that snowball into human isolation; the building of The Wall. I pulled a one nighter (new term I made up) and listened to the whole album of The Wall then watched the film. I expected disturbing, screwed up, and rock and roll fueled anger and sorrow and I did get it, but one emotion I did not expected accumulated from this listening and viewing; sadness. Both the film and the album are practically the story of a man secluded himself from everyone and it is a very alienating and depressing experience. Through all of the violent imagery and all out bizarreness, there is a deep human message at the center-most brick of The Wall. That is why it seems like a plausible nightmare. The Wall is not always easy to watch and most won't even like it, but it is hard to admit that it is not oddly fascinating.\n\nUltimately everything about this movie surprised me. The direction, the animation, the narrative, the cinematography (incredibly ahead of it's time); all amazing!!! One of the most surprising aspects of this movie is the performance as the troubled rock star and protagonist, Pink, by Boomtown Rat's Bob Geldoff. Geldoff was not an actor. He did not like Pink Floyd. He could not be more different than Pink (in fact, violence makes Geldoff sick) but casting Geldoff for some weird reason, was genius. Geldoff pulls off a convincing, wordless performance as Pink.\n\nFinal tidbit: Although I am a lover of film, I tend to get easily distracted by social media and other things during films. I did not pause this film once. For better or for worse, it hooks you in the whole time. Once you start building', there is no way back.",

As you'd expect, this is basically Pink Floyd's album \"The Wall\" as a feature film, complete with most of the tracks, though sometimes, they changed the order in which the songs are played. I can't help but think that changing order in which the songs are played kind of messed up the context of the story. There's little to no dialogue in the entire movie, and no, David Gilmour's singing voice doesn't count. On the one hand, this means there's no bad acting, but without any dialogue, there's almost nothing stringing the plot along besides the music and imagery. Ultimately, my biggest criticism of this movie is that you have to have listened to the album first in order to get it, and sometimes I still don't, and actually listened to the full album. It's not all bad. Gerald Scarfe's animation sequences are really good, providing inventive, rich imagery to the film. However, the only thing that would be better is if the entire film were animated. It's not that bad, but it seems rather inconsistent. In layman's terms, I'd stick to the album.",

Bob Geldof plays Pink a lonely boy who grows up to be an alienated rock star and then a fascist.  My problem with the movie, which has very little dialogue and advances (plot-wise) through music, is that the songs by Pink Floyd are 80% boring.  The two or three songs that became hits are, in fact, the stand-outs, but even on those tracks the lyrics are blunt and anything but poetic.  A bit tortured, sometimes gruesome, rather sexual in places, but only intermittently of interest.",

            "content": "Only a complete simpleton would at this point in time argue Pink Floyd's The Wall isn't a classic album, the music is undeniably incredible and indeed one of the greatest records in rock history. Some, though not I, may even argue it was the high watermark for the legendary band as they finally exploded into epic rock opera territory with a double LP telling a distinct and clearly personal story. Where the need for commentary and discussion comes into play here is how necessary it was to turn such a dense and narrative heavy album into a film in the first place, especially since the film not unreasonably actually cuts out material from the album despite running an average hour and a half in length. The film has since its release only been a modest cult hit, developing a devoted following especially in recent years but being divisive and downright ignored by most upon its release. Still with Roger Waters writing the film itself, Alan Parker lending his customary insane visuals, illustrator and frequent Floyd collaborator Gerald Scarfe providing the animation and music industry legend Bob Geldof starring as Pink surely this movie couldn't have gone but so wrong? Well let's take am up against the wall look.\r\n\r\nThe film adheres strictly to the music and tells the tale of presumably autobiographic cult rocker Pink Floyd (Geldof) an emotionally stunted and disturbed drug addict on the verge of a nervous breakdown. Pink grew up under the reign of an overbearing single mother (his father died in the war), an oppressive regime of teachers and a total sense of isolation from other children which leads to his fractured mental state. Finally one night he snaps, attacks a groupie, decimates his hotel, shaves all the hair off his body and barricades himself in the room the night before the show. When his greedy manager (Bob Hoskins) finds him in a near catatonic state he forcibly revives him with uppers and forces him on stage causing Floyd to totally snap. He begins playing the part of a genocidal dictator and promotes views of hate and intolerance causing riots of hate crimes throughout England. He is eventually thrown in a mental asylum where he must either live out the rest of his life or confront and tear down the wall his childhood has caused him to build around himself.\r\n\r\nI almost don't want to delve into the story itself, this is a classic album and its power and quality speaks for itself. The music is incredible, the lyrics powerful even more than thirty years later and its a thematically devastating and powerful story. I like so many others could not love the ALBUM more from how effectively and yet with so little information it builds the character of Pink, how gut wrenchingly it connects with the feeling of loneliness even when you're adored by millions and living the dream without being self pitying and over indulgent and I've always loved and defended how Pink's fate once his outer wall is brought down is never revealed. But if this was just essentially going to be an hour and a half music video of the whole album I'd want more or less nothing to do with it I have my own images of what it should look like in my head. So thankfully it's not. It goes above blandly portraying the story by also providing stark visuals and showing dramatized scenes from Roger Waters childhood that enrich and add to our preexisting knowledge of the story. The film is a powerful supplement to the album that also serves as a stand alone abstract film and musical and rather than trying to further cash in on the album's success actually tries to provide even more to it. This could have gone horribly wrong and is I think a little to abstract and reliant on the viewer being knowledgeable and well versed on the album but as a whole it ends up being a top form success aided by different interpretations of many of the songs, some insanely creative and stylized animated sequences and Geldof's ballsy and bare all performance. The end result is a passionate exploration further into the recesses of Water's and the rest of the artist's psyche that still holds up today.\r\n\r\nI think the movie and album wonderfully exist separately and on their own terms and can be enjoyed individually each in their own right but nonetheless they strengthen each other in a wholly unique to create an ultimately stronger product together. Some highlights include the nightmarish vision of life during the Battle of Britain in the animated sequence accompanying \"Goodbye Blue Sky\", the children being fed into the societal machine in \"Another Brick in the Wall Part 2\", the visceral room trashing tantrum to \"One of My Turns\" and Hoskins Manager character getting him hauled from his comatose state onto the stage amid flashbacks to the album highlight \"Comfortably Numb.\" If you're a fan of emotional and unique film making and Pink Floyd you need to see this and if you could take of leave these things than you don't it's that simple.",
