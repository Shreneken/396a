            "content": "I saw \"The Verdict\" when it was released in 1982 and just watched it again. It is amazing what of the film I retained in memory. Most of what I remembered was the sheer brilliance of Paul Newman. In seeing it the second time, I'm 24 years older, I've worked for attorneys, I've had an experience with the justice system. And still, what I take away from \"The Verdict\" is the sheer brilliance of Paul Newman. After Matthew McConnaughey made \"A Time to Kill,\" he asked his agents if he could meet Paul Newman. I guess someone told him they were similar. Newman said to him, \"This is a time to not take yourself seriously and your work very seriously.\" When Matthew McConnaughey has a 50+ year career, you'll talk (I'll be gone) - but it's evident that Paul Newman takes his work very seriously indeed.\"The Verdict\" is an old story - the drunken attorney who takes a case -think \"The People Against O'Hara\" for one - but this one has a stunning cast which includes Jack Warden, James Mason, Charlotte Rampling and Lindsay Crouse. And it asks one of life's great questions - what do you do when losing is just not an option? Drunken, disillusioned, ambulance-chasing Frank Galvin takes a slam-dunk hospital negligence case thrown to him by an investigator friend (Warden). His expert witness tells him he can win. So Galvin doesn't tell his client about a lowball offer, takes the thing to trial, loses his star witness, hires a pathetic expert, is reported by his client for failing to give them the offer they would have happily taken - simply put, there's no paddle but if he doesn't get down the river, any hope of reconstituting his life is over. Gone. David Mamet's script stacks everything against Frank but when you're fighting for your life, failure is not an option.Newman is a wonder with his loser posture and hyperventilation and his desperateness. It's in his voice, it's on his face, it's in his smile, it's in his shaking hands. He's up against James Mason and his huge law firm, a smug, well-dressed bunch who will stop at nothing to win. One might think this type of firm is a clich\u00e9; it isn't. One of the characters says it best - \"You have no loyalty to anyone, you don't care who you hurt. You're all whores.\" Unfortunately in real life, all attorneys are pretty much the same, but at least in film we occasionally are shown a decent one. When this film was made, the public had not yet been subjected to the Dream Team, the Robert Blake Case, the Menendez Brothers. But even today, knowing better, you can't help but buy into Newman's frantic sincerity.The rest of the cast is uniformly excellent, with top honors going to Mason's smooth Concannon and Lindsay Crouse, who gives us the most powerful five minutes of the film with her magnificent performance as the admission nurse.Is it a manipulative film? As hell. Is it feel good? You betcha. But take it from someone who knows an unfortunate truth - that justice is for the rich who pull in favors and have the money to fight, everyone lies their teeth off, and the jury system is sad - if I can be swept away by \"The Verdict\" and by Paul Newman's performance (another Oscar he was cheated out of) - you're gonna eat it up.",

His friend and former professor Mickey Morrissey (Jack Warden) brings one client to Frank, Deborah Ann Kaye (Susan Benenson), who reports that her sister lost her baby in the delivery and had brain damage in the St. Catherine Labour\u00e9 Hospital due to the medical malpractice.Frank meets Dr. Gruber (Lewis Stadlen), who tells that the woman received wrong anesthetic and drown in her own vomit due to negligence of Dr. Marx and the anesthetist Dr. Towler (Wesley Addy). Further, he offers to witness in court and Frank sees the chance of going to trial against the Archdiocese of Boston and win the case. Frank goes to the hospital to take pictures of Deborah's sister and he is affected by the vegetative state of the woman. Out of the blue, Bishop Brophy (Edward Binns) summons Frank and offers an endowment of US$ 210,000.00 to drop the case. However Frank sees the chance to bring justice to the family; save his career and earn respect and he does not accept the small fortune.Frank calls Mickey to help him in the investigation, but he finds difficulties, since his unethical opponent Ed Concannon (James Mason) anticipates his actions and Dr. Gruber mysteriously travels to the Caribbean to spend a week on vacation and Judge Hoyle (Milo O'Shea) tries to force him to accept the settling. Meanwhile Frank meets the gorgeous Laura Fischer (Charlotte Rampling) in a bar and they have a love affair. But when Mickey seeks cigarette in her purse, he makes a discovery that will hurt Frank.\"The Verdict\" is one of the best courtroom dramas of cinema history with one of the best performances of Paul Newman. Directed by Sidney Lumet, \"The Verdict\" is also the third work of the talented David Mamet that wrote the great screenplay with an unusual (open) end for an American movie.I saw this film in the 80's in the movie theater; than on VHS and today I have just seen on DVD and I realize that after almost thirty years, this film has not aged. The magnificent cast has top-notch performances and I love Charlotte Rampling in this film, who is also very elegant and beautiful. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): \"O Veredicto\" (\"The Verdict\")",

            "content": "The Verdict (1982) **** (out of 4) Disgraced, alcoholic lawyer Frank Galvin (Paul Newman) is handed his best case in years and in return all he has to do is collect the settlement. Instead of doing so Frank sees this case at a shot at redemption so he takes it to trial against one of the best defense lawyers (James Mason).THE VERDICT is without question one of the greatest courtroom dramas that you're ever going to see. I'd argue that it's also one of the greatest films of the decade. I'd even go a step further and say it's one of the greatest and most powerful films ever made. I will even add more praise in saying that it contains perhaps the greatest ensemble acting that you're ever going to witness. Is all of this too much praise to throw on a film? No when it's for a film like THE VERDICT.Obviously everything here begins and ends with Newman who gives one of the greatest performances that you're ever going to witness. I always said that Marlon Brando's performance in LAST TANGO IN Paris is the greatest performance i have ever seen but this one by Newman is close. Just take a look at the sequence before the trial where his character has a panic attack. Just see the fear in eyes, his movement and the fear in his voice. Watch his final speech to the jury. Check out a twist, which I won't ruin, but deals with him being betrayed. A lot of times a music score and editing help \"make\" a performance but in all of these scenes there are none of that. Instead it's just Newman delivering a performance and often it's shown in one take.Not only is the lead terrific but so are all the supporting players. Jack Warden is terrific in his role as the assistant. Charlotte Rampling is as calm and cold as you can get. As for Mason, did you ever doubt that you were watching a brilliant lawyer work his magic? Milo O'Shea will have your blood boiling in the role of the judge. All of the important characters are brought to life through terrific performances but even the small roles are flawlessly acted. Edward Binns as the Bishop. Lindsay Crouse as an important witness.James Handy and Roxanne Hart as the suffering family members.THE VERDICT is one of the most grim and dark movies that you're ever going to see. The character study of a drunk and a loser makes for some very dark moments and director Sidney Lumet perfectly sets everything up during the opening sequence where we learn everything we need to know. His direction throughout is flawless. The film is slow-paced but it's done for a reason and it's impact is certainly felt in the end. The story is a rather simple one about redemption but the movie offers up so much drama and suspense that it works just like a thriller.THE VERDICT is a film that deserves all the praise one can give it.",

They're quite a few of them in The Verdict.This has always been my favorite Paul Newman film, it's the one he should have won the Oscar for. His Frank Galvin is not the noblest of creatures, he's a once promising attorney now an alcoholic ambulance chaser. But the skills are still there and he shows them battling tremendous odds. Thirty years earlier Frank Capra could easily have made this the subject of one of his populist dramas.Newman gets great support from an outstanding cast. James Mason, Jack Warden, Charlotte Rampling, Joe Seneca deliver some outstanding performances. The one I particularly liked here was Milo O'Shea as the corrupt and biased judge. Most of the great courtroom dramas have been about criminal cases. The Verdict was a landmark film that set the stage for the success of other great films about civil cases, including A Civil Action and Erin Brockovich. Those I don't think would have been made but for the critical and popular success of The Verdict.Paul Newman was never better on screen.",

When a routine malpractice case is thrown his way, Frank gets one last chance to prove himself. Initially he simply goes through the motions, but when he meets the victim, a young woman who has suffered complications during childbirth and is now reduced to a permanently comatose state, he approaches the case with newfound resolve.Rejecting a Catholic hospital's offer of a financial settlement, Frank decides to take the case to court. Here he battles both for his client's rights and for his own dignity.Three big names elevate the film: David Mamet, Paul Newman and Sidney Lumet. Newman gives a great performance and the film is littered with 3 or 4 amazingly acted scenes, all of which play on Frank's sense of shame. Meanwhile, David Mamet provides a suspenseful screenplay, which somehow manages to lift itself above the clich\u00e9s. Finally, Lumet's direction is beautifully low key. The film is slow during its first half hour, but things quickly pick up pace.8/10 - Not as good as Lumet's \"12 Angry Men\" or \"The Pawnbroker\", but still an excellent courtroom movie. The film has no fancy pyrotechnics, courtroom standoffs, set pieces or monologues, relying instead on quiet dialogue. The film benefits from a familiarity with some of Newman's younger roles.

            "content": "The title of this movie is deceiving.  THE VERDICT suggests a courtroom drama, something like TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD, or INHERIT THE WIND.  It does have some riveting court scenes, but what happens outside of court and to Paul Newman is the real attraction here.  The title not only refers to the inevitable decision of the important case of the film, but also to how the Newman character is going to live the rest of his life. Should he sell out and take the easy settlement, or take the highly regarded archdiocese of Boston to court for real justice.  These are the questions Newman must face in this profound drama that seems more like a picture of the 70's than an 80's film.Director Sidney Lumet has dealt with the legal system before in his first film, 12 ANGRY MEN.  He takes it to a more personal level and Paul Newman, one of the finest actors of the past 40 years, is the person to do it.  He is a legend and he bares his soul as attorney Frank Galvin, a lonely, corrupt drunk whose license to practice law is hanging by a thread.  Jack Warden plays his trusty assistant who gets him a case that could help Frank change his life.  Warden, however, has had enough.Newman plays an excellent drunk, even cracking an egg into an 8am beer to start his day.  This is a dim looking movie, shot during a cold winter in Boston.  There are no great shots, or even any emotionally-rousing speeches, but this is Lumet's style.  It is plodding and we see into the life of a lawyer on the ropes.  James Mason is perfect as the slimy defense lawyer. Newman is constantly underestimated because of past failures. He is a drunk, but he still has some tricks up his sleeve.NOTE: Look closely at the closing argument given by Newman.  In the background, you can glimpse a then-unknown Bruce Willis.",

He managed to come out smelling like a rose through luck and skill as a lawyer. Newman was superb!

            "content": "I have seen this movie, on screen and as a video, many times.  Each time, it gets better.   This is no doubt the best acting by Paul Newman in his career.   Why he didn't get the Oscar for this role, but instead got it for the lackluster \"The Color of Money\", is beyond me.  The movie is actually about redemption, or the attempt to be redeemed.His interpretation of Frank Galvin, a desperate, conniving, down-to-the-last-case attorney, is fascinating and totally convincing.   And he has a fantastic supporting cast -- from Jack Warden as his partner, Charlotte Rampling as his chance for romantic redemption, Milo O'Shea as the corrupt judge, Lindsay Crouse as his surprising ace-up-his-sleeve, and most of all, in a landmark supporting actor role, James Mason as the seemingly distinguished and respected defense attorney.And I found the direction by Sidney Lumet to be, once again, outstanding. Lumet has such a long list of great movies that you wonder why he has never won an Oscar or been given an AFI Lifetime Achievement award.  \nThis is a riveting movie -- about the law, but mainly about the flawed nature of the human beings who are entrusted with it.   Please hear Newman, as Frank Galvin, on his last, crippled, despairing leg, give the summation to the case.   It needs to be carved in marble somewhere. David Mamet, who wrote the screenplay, deserves accolades for how he was able to hand Paul Newman such a moving summation.  The summation is about life, not just the law.  It is a masterpiece, worth seeing the entire movie for.Most of all, it is Newman's Finest Hour.",

            "content": "This one really isn't to be missed, certainly among the best of the courtroom dramas. The acting. Well, first of all, nobody is bad. The most nearly negligible performance is by Wesley Addy, who at least looks the part of the elegant doctor and who is a competent actor. The other principals are outstanding. Charlotte Rampling with that odd face -- sultriness imposed kicking and screaming upon boniness -- is unusually good and even manages to project a kind of believable guilty remorse, which has never been her strong suit. James Mason is (almost)unflappable as Concannon, attorney for the defense. Marvelous, the way he puts quotation marks around the word \"expert\" while questioning the plaintiff's witness. Edward Binns is stolid as the savvy but moral bishop who wants to wrap things up without making waves. \"What is the truth?\", he asks Newman. Jack Warden is plumply likable, as always. He's seems to have aged more than Binns, with whom he'd worked a quarter of a century earlier in \"Twelve Angry Men.\" Lindsay Crouse in a small but crucial role is appealingly Irish. Milo O'Shea is sliminess itself. I don't know why, perhaps his impish accent, but there is always something amusing about him, as if unable to quite shake what Erving Goffman called \"role distance,\" the knowledge that he's playing a part accompanied by an awareness of the absurdity of doing so. Even Bruce Willis is in this, playing a visitor to the courtroom. I was an atmosphere person in a Boston courtroom too, in \"From the Hip\" -- a far superior movie. (Ask anybody. Ask my mother.) And Paul Newman is flawless. Robert Redford was supposed to play Frankie Galvin, but he wouldn't have been up to the part. The role requires the compelling anguish that Newman brings to it, and he does it perfectly. Redford is much too cool for that. I will mention just one scene of Newman's that is emblematic. He stands in his darkened office -- Warden watching soundlessly from the background -- and calls the defendants' law firm about a settlement they have already withdrawn. He paces around talking into the phone, hardly able to breathe, congested with not just mucous but self hatred, cajoling them, pounding on the desk with his knuckles, filled with an empty bravado. Redford couldn't do it. Practically nobody could do it.Almost everything fits together perfectly in this film. Sidney Lumet opens with a shot of Newman alone in silhouette playing a pinball machine in a Boston bar, drinking beer. The pinball game serves as a token for the trajectory of his life during the course of the film. Wardrobe: first-rate. How \"New England.\" Multi-layered dark clothing, (in Newman's case black), woolly and fussy. Sound: excellent. Little noises, hardly noticeable, form almost a background score. The old wooden floors creak when people step on them. An example of one or two good creaks: the scene in Concannon's office when he is welcoming Laura back to the law. Twirled-up telephone lines squeak when someone pulls on them. The tinkling of ice cubes in liquor glasses. The heavy breathing of nervous or defeated people. The slamming of ancient desk drawers. Garbage trucks groaning and whining in the city streets at dawn. Production design: as good as it gets. Everything looks old, as if it has been used and lived in for years, not shabby but burnished with age, all mahogany wood and scarlet carpets. Lighting and photography: up there with the best. Most scenes are dark -- it's midwinter in Boston -- but not too dark, cleverly lighted. The snow in the streets is literally blue, as if it had just leaped out of an impressionist landscape. Tree branches glisten with moisture on slick night-time streets. Tinsel draped along a bar ceiling twinkles with fraudulent joy. The weakness? The movie is so good I hate to mention it, but the script leaves something to be desired. It almost betrays the characters. I don't mind the legal absurdities so much. Okay, so things would never really happen this way. The judge would have to grant a continuance and so forth. It's not so much that as the motivation and the set speeches that are bothersome, especially Newman's, and they're critical. The banter and small talk are fine. But Newman's conversion from a drunken, cynical ambulance chaser to a principled attorney of reawakened morals in the course of two-minute photo session with a comatose patient is patently unbelievable. Where did all that conscience (if that's what it is?) suddenly come from? He flops backwards as if stunned. Why? The script does its best to back up his epiphany. The images of his patient develop as a real person, not just a dollar sign, on the Polaroid photos, a mirror image of what's going on in his mind. But as Warden repeatedly points out, his job is to win some money for his clients so they can leave their comatose sister in good care and get on with their lives in Tucson. Instead he turns down the church's offer because he sees a trial as a challenge to his personal pride, as a \"means of redemption\". (Is that kind of pride a mortal or a venial sin?) He loses sight of what the whole legal process is about because of this self-involvement. It wouldn't be so bad if he realized this but in fact he never gives it a thought.Finally, Newman's summation: it sounds as if it had been put together by some high school kid whose homework assignment was to write an essay (of at least two hundred words) about \"what life means to me.\" \"I believe there is justice in our hearts,\" says Newman, more to himself than to the jury. No kidding.None of this criticism can subtract from all the other virtues of the film. It's among the best of its kind.",

            "content": "\"The Verdict\" is simply one of the best legal dramas ever done. Of course much of what happens in the movie is unrealistic and wouldn't happen in a real case but the movie isn't a study in courtroom procedure (watch the fantastic \"Anatomy of a Murder\" for that) it is a study about redemption and in that respect it excels.This movie captures Paul Newman's finest screen performance and that alone makes it an important movie. The scenes where Newman hardly says anything show how great an actor he is---his look of self-loathing when he's thrown out of the funeral home, his palsied hand and lost look when he's trying to drink his whiskey, his panic when Charlotte Rampling lambastes him for being a failure. Then throw into that his terrific courtroom scenes, his arguments with the judge in chambers, it is just a sensational performance all around.The level of acting is high all around in this movie. James Mason was Oscar nominated for playing the silky smooth, totally corrupt defense attorney. Jack Warden shines as Frank Galvin's world-weary former law partner. Lindsey Crouse has a small role as a nurse but is given the most powerful and dramatic moment in the entire movie. Her cross-examination by James Mason is where the movie really shines and shows that Paul Newman can keep his ego in check. How many movies give the most powerful and dramatic moment of the film to one of the secondary players? How many lead actors would be willing to just sit there quiet in a chair while a bit player and the second male lead share the big moment? It was a bold decision by both Newman, director Sidney Lumet and writer David Mamet and it is unforgettable.The movie shows the two extremes of the practice of law. James Mason's win-at-all-costs cheating and Paul Newman getting so emotionally wrapped up in the case that he is no longer protecting his client's interests and instead is out to settle his own personal scores.

            "content": "Before we launch into my full review, I have something of a shameful confession to make. Paul Newman is considered one of the finest actors that Hollywood has ever produced, his long career producing a great abundance of terrific films and stunning performances. And now for the confession: 'The Verdict (1982)' is the earliest film in which I've seen Paul Newman. Having seen his solid performances in 'The Hudsucker Proxy (1994)' and especially 'Road to Perdition (2002),' I already have great respect for his talents, but it'd be ignorant to deny that I'm still yet to experience his finest hours. In Sidney Lumet's 1982 courtroom drama, Newman plays Frank Galvin an aging, alcoholic lawyer who, a long time ago, lost whatever confidence and self-respect he once had. The film also boasts an impressive supporting cast, including James Mason, Jack Warden and Charlotte Rampling.Newman really is superb in the film's main role. His Frank Galvin is a tortured character: once an honest and successful lawyer, Frank's career and marriage were ruined after his employers framed him for jury-tampering, reducing him to a disheartened, immoral \"ambulance-chaser\" in order to survive. His good friend and colleague, Mickey Morrissey (Jack Warden), is dismayed at his deterioration, but nonetheless agrees to offer Frank one final case, which is sure to be settled easily outside court. However, after visiting his comatose client \u0096 her life forever destroyed by the negligence of the hospital doctors \u0096 Frank spies redemption within his grasp, and so resolves to achieve justice at any cost. Rounding off the perfect triangle of veteran performers (each of whom had worked with director Sidney Lumet previously) is Jason Mason, who plays respected lawyer Ed Concannon with such composure and acumen that you're almost willing to declare him the winner of the case.When it comes to discussing 'The Verdict,' Lumet's cinematic debut '12 Angry Men (1957)' seems the natural comparison, though that's yet another classic that I haven't seen {Sidney Lumet has recently become my director-to-watch, after producing one of the most thrilling movies ever made, 'Fail-Safe (1964)'}. Lumet gives the entire film a wintry, coldly-detached tone, with the camera often settled in the distance and making effective use of long shots. The script was penned by David Mamet from a novel by Barry Reed, cruelly placing obstacle after obstacle on Frank Galvin's path to redemption, until his self-esteem is all but destroyed. It is only through the encouragement of Mickey Morrissey and recent-girlfriend Laura Fischer (Charlotte Rampling) that Frank can find the strength to continue the trial, though the latter also plays a more sinister role in the unfolding of the case.'The Verdict' is certainly one of the top ten most compelling legal dramas I've come across. Though Newman's final address to the jury is not quite as rousing as the equivalents in 'To Kill a Mockingbird (1962)' or 'Breaker Morant (1980),' for example, the film is held aloft by three superb veteran performances and its admirable sense of moral justice. Though the infinitely-shrewd Ed Concannon manages to convince the biased judge (Milo O'Shea) to completely disregard the damning testimony of the admitting nurse, Kaitlin Costello (Lindsay Crouse), he can't convince the honest jurors to forget what they have heard. In strict legal terms, Ed Concannon mounted the perfect case, but simple human decency directed the jury to reach a verdict that was morally just.",

Newman plays an alcoholic has-been lawyer who has pretty much given up on making a difference. He is an \"ambulance chaser\" whose only goal is to arrange a quick settlement--regardless of whether or not his clients deserve more or nothing at all (a \"nuisance lawyer\"). He plays this role exceptionally well and the writing and directing much also be credited.Out of the blue, he takes a case where the client has a really good case and deserves a very large judgment. However, Newman is planning on just making a quick settlement regardless of whether or not it was fair for anyone. However, over time, for once, he has a hard time living with himself and eventually decides to fight. However, the archdiocese being sued hires a team of top-rate lawyers and Newman finally refuses to back down and take a settlement.You MUST watch this movie!!!",

            "review_title": "maybe not one of the very best I've seen from Lumet, but from Newman...",
            "content": "Sidney Lumet reaches into a certain style in this film that took me a few minutes to, if the word is right, adjust to. One might almost think the way he keeps the camera on a character or goes for the shots keeping the characters far away (long-shots) or in dark spaces (when not in the courtroom) or seemingly small in the scope of the areas around then, as detached. It is, but there-in lies his talents as a director, by letting the acting- slow but very sturdy and all based on David Mamet's script (also not one of his very best, but then again different from his plays). It's not a great film by the director as some have gone to lengths to write about, but it is one that is resonating further as I write this, and does successfully dig into further what it means to be a lawyer, or just trying to live, when odds are stacked against you. I'm almost reminded of a European director here, searching under the obvious in the story- points of which in the case that could just as well be on an OK episode of Law & Order- doing more of a character study than a full-on courtroom drama.It helps, however, that Paul Newman is at the top of his game here, giving a performance that is textured, if that's a word to use as well, and kind of sad. He's playing Frank Gavin as much of a tragic figure as a real human being here, and there's a scene where he is in his office at a big moment of doubt \"there is no other case, there is no other case\". Newman is able to tap into what Lumet and Mamet have in the material superlatively, as if he knows how this character thinks. The early scenes show him as a low-level guy, ambulance chaser, who gets a case of a malpractice of a woman. In one of the most crucial and successful scenes in the film (for both director, writer and star), Gavin takes a couple of Polaroids of the girl in the hospital, seemingly just doing his work, but then has a pause, and the photos come into focus. This kind of change-of-thought has been done in other dramas to be sure, but here it really clicks with the pace, the mood and timing from Newman, and how this situation is given room to breathe.If the rest of the film doesn't follow this same pattern it's not necessarily a full-on crutch. The courtroom scenes themselves are very good, with James Mason (among other British character actors) convincing in their roles of the more 'weighty' side of the court. Jack Warden adds some presence too as Gavin's partner (and adds a memory of Lumet's own classic 12 Angry Men). Only the sub-plot between Newman and Rampling seems just slightly off. Her character is necessary for the film, and there are one or two excellent scenes with her in it (particularly the one with him feeling most shaky before the trial). But her part is that of a more conventional picture, and her motivations are only made so clear as to not be totally believable. The final scene between her and Newman is maybe the best out of all of them, but it goes without saying that it's mainly a credit to him and Lumet, a kind of catharsis that is laid on that does add a fine point.The Verdict is not really one of those films that is \"over-rated\" in the scope of things, and it's possibly more of the deserved Oscar nominated turns for Newman when compared to The Color of Money (good, not great there). It's worth seeing again, even as it is a different kind of courtroom picture, where the good and evil in man is not as revealed as in Lumet's first feature, but there are some poignant scenes of the need of redemption for a broken person.",

            "content": "The man is a failure ... he's a failure because circumstances made him so. He's no different than you and me. He's just unlucky. And you know how it is. Adversity calls adversity. You lose your job, your wife leaves you, you start drinking, you can't have another job back and like that, you're labeled as a failure, a loser. Frank Galvin, played by Paul Newman, is one of them. A loser. A Boston lawyer, he became what they call an \"ambulance chaser\". A man who gives you a card during your father's funeral to tell you he was a friend of him. The first scenes of Lumet's \"The Verdict\" clearly announces the character as a man who's not your typical Paul Newman's character, he's no Hud, no Cool Hand Luke, no Eddie Felson, yet it's one of the most brilliant and masterful performances from the late actor.Frank Galvin hasn't solved a case in years. He hasn't won anything. He developed a 'brilliant' reputation that totally discredited him in the profession. Obviously, something must change in his life and Galvin, although not much appreciated, has one true friend : Mick, played by the late Jack Warden, who manages to get him a golden case to get back on the rails. A guaranteed win if Galvin accepts. He does, but for selfish reasons, at least at first. He cares for people, he cares for the case, but something is burning inside him: he cares for himself. There is a profound desire of redemption calling from the bottom of his soul, he tries to find the right way and this case is the promised land for him. A young mother condemned to coma for the rest of her life, for what appears to be a medical error. Obviously, Galvin can't fail.BUT. What is failure? and what is success? That's the genius of the film. When Galvin takes snapshots of the poor victim, he realizes one thing he didn't quite get at the beginning. She's a victim of a criminal injustice. It's clear. Any other thing is a lie, any other attempt to silence the truth is criminal, and anyone who accepts that is accomplice. Anyone who accepts anything he believes against, whether because it is untrue or unjust, is a weak. The weak is the one who doesn't believe in his own principles, by not following them. The weak can win if he joins the liars, the cheaters, the winners, to win by default, but he'll always be weak, because he doesn't believe in himself, and will forever live with that. There's no salvation for the weak even if he wins. Galvin might be a loser, but he's not weak. Galvin is flawed, indeed. He has many weaknesses, alcohol being the biggest one, but his evolution all through the movie is a great example of an inspiring character study, from the brilliant director, Sidney Lumet (who, in 1982, had an already impressive and qualitative filmography). Galvin shows how justice is an abstract but powerful idea that can only live through our deep faith in our success in the quest for truth, because what is true, implies justice. Justice's blindness is a noble concept except when the blindness is deliberate. That is corruption, blinding justice, disguising it, using influence to silence it. Galvin despises this kind of corruption, refuses the generous offer from the opposite side, who like the people he defends, doesn't want a trial and prefers an out-of-court settlement. But HIS mission is personal, though he doesn't fight for selfish reasons anymore, but for his idea of justice. And hell yes, they'll go to trial.It's quite ironic that the movie lost the Best Picture Award to \"Gandhi\", when Galvin is almost a Gandhi-like figure when you examine his ideas and beliefs. Everything is against him, yet he believes he's right. Gandhi said \"Even if you are a minority of one, the truth is the truth\", this is Galvin's spirit. He believes in himself, he's given a mission that will redeem him, by bringing justice to the unfortunate couple, to a family devastated by the loss of a young woman. In this case, the opposite side is defended by the powerful, suave, charmingly villainous, Ed Concannon, brilliantly portrayed by James Mason. Concannon practices law with such perfectionism and obedience, the case is like David vs. Goliath. Evertyhing seems lost, everyone is against Galvin, including a memorable one-sided judge. But he goes on, despite his fears, his mistakes, his clumsiness, the way he seems so unsure of his words ... Frank Galvin doesn't have the phlegm of Atticus Finch, nor the flamboyance of Hans Rolfe, or the charisma of Arthur Kirkland, but his weaknesses make him 'strong' and the case 'personal' in the noblest sense of the word. This movie is probably one of the greatest courtroom dramas ever directed, because it gives its true meaning to the word 'justice'. Justice is not about values, it's about faith, it's a blind faith which makes us take all the risks, because ironically, justice can only be accomplished through 'illegal' ways when the opposite side buries important elements under obscure judiciary concepts and in these cases, when the system is against Justice. Frank Galvin was against the system, and believed in Justice. He's a hero. Frank Galvin fought for an idea of Justice threatened by the system, men like the judge or Concannon, who make justice, sometimes, unfair. \"The Verdict\" is the greatest courtroom drama because it is the one that gives you the greatest faith in justice ...",

            "content": "\"The Verdict\" has to be called one of the finest courtroom-law dramas of all time, certainly a movie which deserves more recognition than it actually received over the course of the years since its publication. While the plot itself remains rather grounded and straight-forward without any particularly groundbreaking elements, Paul Newman's masterful performance as well as the great supporting actors and actresses are what helps this drama in succeeding at depicting what it aims to depict.Newman plays an attorney who needs to pull himself together from his drinking problem in order to win a lawsuit surrounding the case of a woman suffering severe brain damage at a hospital. It should come as no surprise that Newman completely immerses himself in the role in a way only Paul Newman can be expected to. The dialogues are another main part of the movie's most intriguing aspects, flowing so well together that it's almost impossible to lose attention of what's happening. At its heart, the movie is not just a courtroom drama, it's about humans dealing with their personal conditions and problems, and it's a movie which knows how to form a bond with viewers and keep them connected to the characters.Sadly, the movie has not reached a status as a classic of the 1980's. Perhaps it simply was not memorable enough to most viewers, or perhaps it is too fine a movie in a decade remembered mostly for action movies, horror flicks or comedies. However, if you love watching a great performance in a great movie, then \"The Verdict\" cannot be recommended highly enough.",

Luckily those high expectations were met.Not quite top 3 Lumet like '12 Angry Men', 'Network' and 'Dog Day Afternoon', but it is very close ('The Wiz' being his weakest by considerable distance), while Paul Newman's role here in 'The Verdict' is one of his long and great career's crowning achievements. Being constantly shown Galvin's drunkenness and self-disgust occasionally got a little heavy-going for my tastes and one is not hugely surprised by the case's outcome.On the other hand, 'The Verdict' is a superbly made film, the dark and gritty visual works so well and complements the subject equally so. Lumet directs subtly but in a way that still feels skillful and engaging. The music is suitably atmospheric, and the script is wordy but still taut and compelling, avoiding sentiment and clich\u00e9s and not dragging the film down into too much exposition while still making the characters interesting.The story does have a slow start but compels ceaselessly from the twenty five minute or so mark, succeeding as a quiet yet still edge-of-your-seat courtroom drama and even more so as a character study, with Galvin a fascinating character. There are great scenes here, especially the movingly powerful summation and the whole of Lindsay Crouse's appearance. While not the biggest fan of ambiguous endings, the ambiguity and open-interpretation of the ending didn't bother me here at all and Galvin's change was believable to me and wasn't that sudden.As hoped, Newman dominates the film and his powerful performance (like when he shuts himself in the bathroom, a master class of verbal-less acting) is one of his best and deservedly nominated for an Oscar (losing to Ben Kingsley in a strong and tough competition in that category that year). The supporting cast are more than up to his level, James Mason especially is on splendidly silky smooth yet quietly menacing form, as is a touching Lindsay Crouse, a charming Jack Warden, a blood-boilingly good Milo O'Shea and emotive Charlotte Rampling.In summary, helped primarily by the performance of Newman 'The Verdict' is one engrossing last chance at a big case. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

I think so.In The Verdict, Paul Newman plays a lawyer who once had a future in a prestigious law firm. Now, he's a washed up alcoholic, chasing ambulances for clients. He's given one last chance to bring a big case to court, but can he get and keep his act together and win? With a running time of over two hours, it feels a little slow. But courtroom dramas can be notoriously slow, especially in the 80s, so it's not the end of the world.

Lumet does the same thing he does with 12 Angry Men in this film, he simply, without any tricks or fancy work expose us to the flaws of the law and justice, and how the rich nearly always gain the upper hand, but not always as this film shows. As Frank Galvin (Newman) says the court gives the poor and powerless a chance and sometimes they can walk out with something.Paul Newman proves in 'The Verdict' why his name stands amongst the Hollywood elite; his performance is truly magnificent. He plays a drunk, divorced, washed up Boston lawyer with a losing streak who gets a second chance to redeem himself. His boss/partner brings him a case so easy to settle out of court that he could make a bunch of money and not worry about a thing; about a Boston Catholic Hospital who administered the wrong anaesthetic to a young woman and destroyed her life; she is in a coma; deprived of speech, sound and vision. Galvin visits the Catholic bishop in relation to St. Catherine's hospital for a quick settlement, but on his way there he goes to see the girl; he sees the pain, destruction of a life... Galvin rejects $210,000 ($70,000) which would go straight in his pockets. Why? He can't be paid off to look the other way while a girl is paralysed and dying on a hospital bed. He takes them to court, despite disbelief from both the opposition and the judge himself.The story follows, as the powerful, defence attorney team rattle Newman's cage, through a variety of ways, leaving him with no ideas; but he fights, he does not surrender, he has a truth to fight for, he wants real justice, he wants redemption, and he gets it eventually... He wins the case not on masterful inquisitiveness of the law, but working as a decent human being relying on the humanity of the jurors to see beyond all the smoke and mirrors of the defence...The Verdict has great qualities; its the kind of film that is cathartic, satisfying while entertaining and superbly acted.9/10",

            "content": "Courtroom dramas outside of murder mysteries are a mixed bag, and some are incredibly boring. That is far from the case in this case, a medical malpractice suit where a woman goes into the hospital to have a baby and ends up in a lingering coma. Ambulance chaser attorney Paul Newman is on the verge of an alcoholic breakdown and is haunting funerals hoping to get a client. His actions are a disgrace, an embarrassment to watch, and when he takes on the case of the comatose woman from her sister, he seems to have crossed the line into callous immorality. But a sudden visit to the hospital opens his eyes, and after visiting the local cardinal whose diocese runs the hospital, he becomes determined to take the case to court rather than just accept a pricey settlement.After his showy performance in \"Absence of Malice\", Newman tops it, playing a greatly flawed man whose ethics have unexpectedly disappeared. But there's more to him than meets the bar exam and the bar tabs, and it comes down to a beautiful stranger (Charlotte Rampling) he meets to bring out those vulnerabilities that he's kept hidden. Jack Warden as Newman's veteran attorney mentor, James Mason as the head of the defense team and Milo O'Shea as the tough talking judge round out the cast of famous names, with Wesley Addy as a specialist on the case and Joe Seneca as an important witness give powerful performances as well. Seneca, known to\"Golden Girls\" as the man suffering from Alzheimer's whom Estelle Getty's character briefly befriended, is particularly memorable in his gentle characterization.Now a 35 year old modern classic, this is still timely because of legal ethics, medical malpractice issues still prevalent today, and is the type of film that really makes you think. I think had it not been for \"Ghandi\" the year that this came out, this may have been a front runner for Newman to win his first Oscar. I only find some of the Charlotte Rampling scenes to be out of place, even with the twist I saw coming long before it did. It's both a reunion for Warden and director Sidney Lumet from 1957's \"Twelve Angry Men\" and for Warden and Mason from \"Heaven Can Wait\". You'd have to be a pretty savvy New Yorker to recognize some of the locations for this Boston set film, but like the Charlotte Rampling issues, those factors are minor.",

We are surprised by how strict he can be in his behavior and belief systems during the case he takes. He is intently alert, always putting his own needs ahead of any responsibility to others. A lonely man, he stays far from the maddening crowd. For him, life is a burdened practice, not to be wasted away idly, which is precisely what is happening to his life as the film opens, finding him going from funeral to funeral attempting to con the bereaved into believing that he knew the deceased loved ones and wants to make sure they're represented by someone who cares. Every day he gropes drunkenly to apprehend it and wring as much profit as he can.The reason such a premise works so well is because of the wisdom and mechanics of David Mamet's writing. The internal problem that begins the story, which is an adaptation of a bestselling novel by American trial lawyer Barry Reed, Newman's hopelessness, is succeeded by the external predicament, the highly lucrative case which embodies all the murky details of medical, clerical and legal procedure. Jack Warden, Charlotte Rampling and James Mason are introduced, and our hero Paul Newman finds himself with the decision to fight all- encompassing immorality, for which he is no match, or to accept it, which screams with the practical leverage he needs to get his life back together. He rejects to take the juicy settlement, which compels us into the upsetting second section of the film.Like many traditional stories after the turning point, this one splits into two parts, the arrangement and the decisive moment at which the outcome seems to be clear. Mamet constructs his scenes so that they correspond to the arrangements for the trial, juxtaposing the enormous legal cart James Mason is mounting, under whose wheels devotees would throw themselves to be smashed, counter to the disorganized, hit or miss undertaking Galvin's running. Characteristically, the stronger the opponent and the weaker the hero, the more pungent the drama and the more severe the ascending friction.At the point at which things are at their lowest, the scenes have amassed in a callous, inescapable direction. The only element that seems to come from left field is the signature Mamet revelation, which is held back from Newman but not from the audience. It's delicate letting the audience ahead of the hero, because it takes the big chance of making the hero out to be misunderstood by us as stupid, but Mamet had no other place to set the scene, one that if you are familiar enough with his work can clearly see that he could not help but use, and skillfully uses it to make things seem even gloomier to us than they do to the protagonist. It generates sympathy for him, not condescension.The Verdict is a tribute to classic structure, which determines that character is plot. Ideally, if you're going to have a character arrive on the scene in a story long enough to tell someone how to go to the bathroom, this individual had better be full enough that we can almost assume where they were before the story happened upon them.Not one scene is needless or redundant. It is film composition at its most succinct, with each scene leading crisply and unavoidably into the next with a story development that is hardnosed in its importance. Sidney Lumet's old-fashioned sense of being a movie director has served him well, especially early in his career, as he hides the presence behind the camera and manipulates what is in front of it and how long it takes to show it. He leaves the gist of things to the screenwriter. His masterpiece Network was one of the few films one can truly say was a writer's movie. Frankly, I think The Verdict is also a writer's movie, because Lumet's perspective of film direction is letting the writer create the story so that the director can tell it.A true testament to this is that Lumet conserves the essential task of a movie, a succession of images contrasting so that the difference between them triggers the story to broaden within the position of the viewer. Once we get the point of a scene, whether the action within it is finished or not, the film moves on. This is precisely what Mamet would come to do when he began directing his own films.",

            "content": "The Verdict (1982)A Sidney Lumet gem, tightly worked out, and with some superb acting, especially Paul Newman and Jack Warden as underdog lawyers. The movie succeeds despite its slightly worn story line--the down and out lawyer with an alcohol problem takes on the case of his life against all the odds. But it's a story where you know whose side you have to be on. The well-financed opposing lawyer is a brilliant James Mason. And there is Charlotte Rampling, sharp and stoic, on the fringes, a bit mysterious and maybe underused, but a key player in one way that can't be talked about until you've seen it.You might say this is an old-fashioned film. It's methodical, building up our sympathy, making the characters believable. It's not filmed with any real panache, but visually the job gets done, and so we focus on the events, and the acting. Indeed, we often focus just on Newman, who is intense without overdoing it, pulling out some of his best subtle, moody brooding and even angst. Boston, as the backdrop, is refreshing. You end up just enjoying getting sucked into the scenes and watching as the courtroom battle gets under way, with its inevitable twists.",

It's safe to say that I love the court room genre and The Verdict is right out of the top draw with bells on.It offers more than a straight forward right against wrong film because it features a terrific core of a man fighting to regain his dignity, a fight to respect himself after years of drink problems and wasted opportunities. Paul Newman is Frank Galvin, all his demons are laid out for us to see, he has fallen so far down the lawyer ladder he is given a case that is deemed un-winnable, it's purely a favour for him to get some money for old rope.The case is a malpractice one, a young expectant mother falls into a coma whilst having her baby, her family believe it's the fault of the anaesthesiologist and sue for malpractice. Yet this is the top doctors from a top hospital that are under the microscope, and firmly behind them is the might of the catholic church since it's their hospital the case involves. Fully expecting to just make a quick earner, Galvin has a change of heart after visiting the coma victim in hospital, he decides to take the case all the way whilst stripping himself bare for all to see.The writing here from David Mamet is wonderful, it could so easily of been a run of the mill genre piece, but it takes little turns at regular intervals to fill the film with interesting depth. Director Sidney Lumet doesn't waste any film either, all scenes are crucial to the case and the main players involved, and Paul Newman gives an incredible performance that was rightly nominated in the best actor category at the academy awards.Cracking drama all round, 9/10.",

As a character study it is superlative, and there are no wasted moments - just like Training Day there is not one wasted moment in the film. The way he is chastised by the sister and her husband for being 'Just like all the others' when in fact he isn't, he actually knows that it is an occasion to really address the issue properly, yet risks all by doing so - shows the kind of contradiction that rarely is shown in films.

            "content": "Having recently read 'Paul Newman, A Life' by Shawn Levy, I was fascinated by the idea of Newman, himself a functional alcoholic at the time the picture was made, portraying a functional alcoholic attorney. You can doubt me on this but you can check it, Newman was knocking down a case of beer a day whether he was working or not. However shortly before making this film, Newman found a new energy by getting involved in car racing, and he brought a renewed sense of enthusiasm and spirit to his acting. Director Sidney Lumet challenged Newman to really let go and find himself in the character of Frank Galvin, and the result was outstanding.As far as courtroom drama goes, there's not much of it in a film with a title like \"The Verdict\". It's more about the story of one man's attempt at finding redemption after being set up for failure a few years earlier. Newman is at his finest as he wrestles his inner demons trying to do 'the right thing' by his client. Moments of doubt enter, and it's the see-saw swings in Newman's performance that make this one of his finest roles.Of course the movie takes liberties in the writing department; it seemed unbelievable to me that the judge (Milo O'Shea) would interject himself into the proceedings the way he did by coming out against Newman's character. I guess that's why you have to watch these pictures as entertainment rather than a representation of real life drama. Still, the story will have you rooting for the underdog attorney who rises to the occasion to make good on his promise - \"The weak have gotta have somebody fight for 'em.\"",

And the performance from Paul Newman is top notch maybe one of his best. All legal dramas are always interesting with the usual twist and turns of a case and the drama on the courtroom witness stand is always revealing and compelling and this 1982 film has all of those moments to occur.Set in Boston Paul Newman is Frankie Galvin an ambulance chasing lawyer who's on the downside of his work and his life. Frankie has lost three or four cases in a row, and he's divorced and he's became an alcoholic as his battle with the bottle is now a daily obsession in the form of many shots and glasses of whiskey. And much of Frankie's time in the free is conducted with him playing pinball at the local bar. Really a sad life for a lawyer it's like a midlife crisis. Only all of a sudden dumped in Frankie's lap is a dream case a medical malpractice case that seems impossible to win, yet Frankie is determined to fight the hospital and doctor's who negligence put a young woman in a coma for the rest of her life. As Frankie owes answers and money and justice to the family of this young lady. And you guessed it the determined Frankie wants to get his game back as he refuses settlement and instead takes the case to court.And in somewhat of a subplot Frankie has a fling somewhat of a one night stand with a divorced lady(played clever and elegantly by Charlotte Rampling)as with life the case has ups and downs still the film becomes a powerful drama as the entire legal system seems like it's put on trial in the courtroom. \"The Verdict\" is a film that searches for answers and it finds the truth leading to justice and most of all it's a moral and life and job awakening of a man named Frankie Galvin.",

Perhaps he thought this story had the potential to be another \"Death of a Salesman\", but unfortunately it's closer to a well-heeled movie-of-the-week (sprinkled with expletives). Paul Newman was at precisely the right age to tackle the role of Frank Galvin, the little guy who takes on the system in a case against a hospital owned by the Archdiocese of Boston, and Mamet stacks the deck against him...even the judge has ties to the Church! Still, the film has an anti-climactic feel; there's very little emotion expended--in court or out--and really no suspense. Director Sidney Lumet sets the pace at a workmanlike even-keel, though it might have been more effective had he instructed his cinematographer, Andrzej Bartkowiak, to keep the camera active instead of inert. Opening near the end of 1982, the filmmakers clearly saw this as prestigious Oscar-material, but, aside from Newman's solid work, it isn't very extraordinary. **1/2 from ****",

            "content": "It is one rare film on a court case that may make us believe in the justness of jury justice. Frank Galvin, played by Paul Newman, is an alcoholic, and not an anonymous one at all. He nearly was debarred for it. He has a case that has all characteristics of a lost case. It is against well considered doctors, even authorities in their field, working for a Catholic hospital and ruining the life of a pregnant poor woman by sheer negligence, and then trying to cover it up by making the admitting nurse in the delivery room perjure herself and falsify the admittance document. The point is that this nurse is covered by the other nurse in the operating room and the first nurse has been forced to resign from her position and even her profession, then move out of the state of Massachusetts to get another job. The trick in this court case is that the judge is hostile to Frank Galvin and yet somewhere in his mind he has some kind of sense of justice. He will emphasize the testimony of that fired nurse when accepting the objection of the defense counselor and having the testimony struck off the record. And the jury will of course have heard and will of course keep in mind that testimony and the defense will lose their case, and the doctors will be found guilty of negligence and Frank Galvin will win the case for the sister of the wasted patient and that sister's husband. We should rethink jury justice because there are too many cases where the jury is not just at all and then there are enormous numbers of appeals, and even some executions of innocent people. Some may say that jury justice is the least bad system, and we should consider that is not good enough. The appeal procedures should be reexamined and no irreversible sentence, like the death penalty, should be allowed of any crime at all. Better have a criminal rot in jail than an innocent person executed. All documents whatsoever have to be admissible in court, especially since if a testimony is refused in one court it can never be used again in any other court. Then we have to find procedures to verify and validate testimonies or documents, but they must not be crossed out, especially by one single judge on the basis of eventually one other anterior judge's decision. Jurisprudence is also fine and dandy but there too there should be some fair and just procedures to assess such elements and their validity in any posterior case. This film is a great film that shows all the short comings of jury justice even if the outcome is positive. It is rarely so, or it is too often the reverse.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Cr\u00e9teil, CEGID",

She can do plenty with just a single word; in one scene Newman asks her if she'd like a drink, and she instantly says yes reflexively, flatly, without emotion.

She really wanted to talk to him, and never had a chance. All the big characters got to be winners, she got cast off like old news.

Frank Galvin (Paul Newman) views life through a miasma of alcoholic intent. His only friend is Mickey (Jack Warden), an older attorney who was once his partner. Mickey is a lifeline and a relic of a long-gone past.Mickey steers the occasional client to Frank, including a malpractice case resulting from an operation that left a young woman comatose. It's an easy settlement, but the case stirs something deep within Frank, and he decides to go to trial. Along the way, he picks up another helper, Laura (Charlotte Rampling), who seems as damaged as Frank.The film is a story of corruption and power. Lumet places the action in a dingy representation of Boston, including age-worn institutional buildings with labyrinthine corridors and stairways of marble. The knowing eye can see that justice and money are co-masters in these decaying halls.James Mason plays the part of Ed Concannon, head of a ruthless legal firm with ties to all the city's agents of influence. Watch for Wesley Addy as Dr. Towler, the anesthesiologist; he gives his role perfectly-shaded levels of nuance as a witness who is quick to learn the lessons that Concannon can teach.David Mamet co-wrote the screenplay, and his wife, Lindsay Crouse, plays a critical role in the film.This is regarded as one of Newman's best performances.

The witness herself did an excellent job. This movie was rich in layers of acting, and totally believable. The scene with one of the Catholic bishops speaking with others over tea near the end of the film was also very well presented. If you like quiet, rich movies, with very realistic performances, and also a sense of subtle spirituality, you should like this excellent movie.",

            "content": "25 years after directed the greatest courtroom drama ever made in \"12 Angry Men,\" acclaimed director Sidney Lumet returns with \"The Verdict.\" Starring Paul Newman in a performance best described as straight from the core, the film flips the idea of justice on its head and reveals the enduring human spirit that lies within the tireless pursuit of it.Frank Galvin (Newman) is a lawyer and alcoholic resigned to checking the obituaries for possible cases and dropping his card off at wakes. When a colleague hands him a medical malpractice case that's a shoo-in for a lucrative settlement outside of court, Galvin decides that there's a good chance to win the case before a jury and decides to take on the hospital's crack legal team (led by James Mason) without his client's permission in attempt to seek true justice and resurrect his career.Lumet's film is the opposite of melodramatic, something to which a courtroom movie is quite susceptible. There's barely a single bit of scoring and the characters express intense emotions with a respectable amount of reservation. One might think this undermines the impact of the David Mamet's thought-provoking script, but in an unexpected way it really grounds the film. It's not an emotional crusade against injustice or your typical underdog story. Instead, it's about the harsh realities of the justice system despite our every effort to believe in a higher moral authority by which all men and women are bound, one that will right all wrongs.Newman's Oscar-nominated performance owes a lot to Lumet, the master of wide shots, long takes and careful zooms and pans. Without a heightened sense of drama and suspense from the camera-work, Newman would be hung out to dry. So much of his acting is occurring below the skin and inside the mind that only a top-notch director could show the audience inside of it. The single take starting with a wide courtroom shot during Frank's closing statement and ending with him sitting down as if there was nothing else he could do might be the best example of Lumet and Newman working in incredible harmony.Lumet gets that caliber of performance out of everyone from co-star Charlotte Rampling to James Mason's unbreakable defense attorney. It says so much more about a film when it's as effective without dialogue as it is with it. The quiet opening shot of Frank with a beer and cigarette playing his favorite pub pinball machine sets the tone right away that the audience is to infer mostly from this film. It's a bit more work than usual, but \"The Verdict\" is a rare version of the timeless story about going on when the odds are stacked against you.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com",

Mr. Newman freely admitted that he was not as naturally gifted as were his contemporaries Marlon Brando and Montgomery Clift and that he had to work harder at it. He is in his late fifties here with forty or so films behind him and is 'no longer reaching for the emotion' as he himself called it. In particular his heartfelt summation to the jury epitomises the effectiveness of 'non-acting'. Overlooked once again at the Oscars his subtly shaded portrayal at least won him a David di Donatello.Good writing makes good actors even better of course and the cast here is well-served by the script of David Mamet and the strangely uncredited Jay Presson Allen. The film also benefits greatly from the muted palette employed by cinematographer Andrzej Bartkoviak in the first of his collaborations with this director.The calibre of the cast is exceptional. Jack Warden and Edward Binns, two of Sidney Lumet's 'Twelve Angry Men'; Milo O'Shea, Charlotte Rampling and Mamet's spouse at the time, Lindsay Crouse. The later films of James Mason are something of a mixed bag but he had a fruitful working relationship with Lumet and is on top form here as a character described in true Mamet fashion as the 'Prince of ******* Darkness'. (The expletive is necessarily deleted here as it is bound not to meet IMDb guidelines)Critic David Thomson has most unfairly called this film 'simple-minded and self-righteous' but he has failed to appreciate that this is essentially an idealistic tale in which Fortune for once does not favour the big battalions.",

She was born in NYC in the Depression, worked her way through college, and later became the chairman of the foreign language department at a small women's college in upstate New York. The lady had only one weakness:Paul NewmanBeing dragged to Paul Newman movies wasn't so bad when I was a kid, when it was stuff like BUTCH CASSSIDY & THE SUNDANCE KID or THE STING. But by the time I was in college, Newman's movies had really started to slide, and sag, and smell like dead fish wrapped up in old socks. This movie was so melodramatic, so dishonest, so sentimental about all the ugliest, dumbest aspects of the male mystique in America. Newman plays a drunken Irish lawyer who's down and out. Note well that David Mamet really plays up the drunkenness as if it's some noble affliction, proof of a pure heart, not a disease that ruins peoples lives. Well, Newman does his best to make this loser into a tragic hero. Even with a bad script, Paul Newman finds some pain that's real and connects to it on screen. So then, the drunk with the heart of gold gets the chance to make a comeback in the courtroom. He's got a can't lose case, about some mother who's brain-dead, or brain- damaged, because of corrupt and uncaring Catholic doctors at a hospital run by priests and bishops. Only the nurses are pure and true! There are so many warped assumptions in this film, about motherhood, and womanhood, and the tendency to both put women on pedestals and treat them like three year old toddlers. The whole thing is very Catholic, very male, very sick, very David Mamet. Oh, and the drunken hero Frank has a lady assistant (Charlotte Rampling, much too classy and sexy for this drunken boor) and of course she's no good and needs to get punched in the face. Women are okay when they're making babies, you see, but when a woman tries to compete in a man's world she needs to get smacked in the face and sent right back to the kitchen!David Mamet wrote this stinker, and he's a real horse's ass from Chicago.

Paul Newman must have salivated over this role, because it entails him hogging the camera throughout almost the entire movie, and boy does he love the limelight. Like Kirk Douglas and some others I could mention, he is a SLOW actor, operating under the assumption that pace equates with shallowness, and slowness equates with profundity. Big mistake. I agree with some other posters that TWELVE ANGRY MEN was far superior as a courtroom drama, if that's what you want to call THE VERDICT, since only a very small proportion of the movie takes place in the courtroom. Most of it is a superficial critique of the legal profession. A better plot and less self-indulgent direction might have salvaged this tedium-fest.",

            "content": "When I first saw The Verdict back in 1983 I thought it was a gripping, thought provoking legal drama with outstanding performances by Paul Newman, James Mason, Jack Warden and Milo O'Shea. Had I written a review back then, I would have given a 9. However, I was a teenager back then with a naive and inexperienced worldview. Now 36 years later, when I went back and watched it again I really see all the flaws with the film. While the performances still are the best part of the movie, Im bothered by all the plot holes.1 - The film drags on about Newman's drinking and ambulance chasing in funeral homes. Not enough explanation is given on how he got to this place in his life, except for a couple of brief scenes. Flashbacks to his experience standing up to corruption at his previous law firm would have pulled the story together more cohesively and garnered more sympathy and emotional connection to Newman's character, Frank Galvin. We are left to pretty much draw our own conclusions about Newman's path to this state of despair.2. Why in the world would Frank turn down an offer of 200k and not at least consult with his clients? I'm no lawyer but how is that even possible in the real world, couldn't he lose his law license over That? That would be like me selling a house and getting an offer from a buyer but turning it down without even telling them.3 How in the hell is that judge (O'Shea) and defense lawyer so obviously chummy that Mason got to hang up his coat in the judge's closet but Newman had to hold his coat. Are judge's supposed to be that blatantly biased, the whole thing smacked of a conflict of interest but Newman never reported him, he seemed like he was on the take from the start. Perhaps this was to make the audience feel for the corruption, the David and Goliath thing our leading man was up against.4 If the Charlotte Rampling character was a lawyer at a firm in New York, why did she have to sleep with Paul Newman and spy on him for a $1,500 check from Mason, why not just get a job somewhere. And why did Mason pay her by check anyway so it could be traced? Why did Jack Warden put the check back in her pocketbook, why the hell wouldn't you keep it as evidence of bribery?5 The scene where Newman punches Rampling in the face to the point she fell down and was bleeding was gratuitous and excessive even back then. That's not the first time Newman used unnecessary violence against women in his movies.6 Newman just never convinced me he was a great lawyer throughout the entire movie, if anything, Mason was a legal scholar. Either you use the law to help your client or you do something else for a living, go work in a homeless shelter. The ending was just 12 jurors decided to do the right thing even tho legally they weren't supposed to consider the surprise witness. That's great Hollywood but it doesn't make Newman the terrific lawyer who lost his way which is the premise of the whole movie.Movies are about suspension of disbelief and a lot of viewers may feel differently when watching but this movie didnt age well, for me anyway.",

However, when Galvin witnesses first hand what the hospital have done to the poor woman, his conscience kicks in and he refuses to accept a fairly substantial 'out of court' settlement and decides to take the 'big corporation' to trial despite losing numerous cases in the past and being a bit rusty as a defence attorney... The Verdict is another 'little man' versus 'big corporation' film and narratives of this nature are very easy to get swept up in - after all who doesn't want to see the little man wiping the smiles off the faces of the much bigger fish? Therefore despite the film suffering from a rather uneven pace (the first half is a little laborious and I felt that Lumet could have got to the 'meat' of the film a little quicker) I did still find it a fairly involving affair...Once we arrive in the second half of the film (the courtroom section) then the film rarely disappoints and this is where Lumet really shines - he tends to be good at creating tension when his narratives are mostly confined to one location (think 12 Angry Men or Dog Day Afternoon). Whereas The Verdict isn't quite a match for those 2 films it does come pretty close.As far as performances go then this film really does belong to Paul Newman; he's been terrific in everything I've seen him in, but this is probably one of his strongest performances. He is helped slightly by Lumet who pitches his character as pitiful and slightly unlikeable in the early stages, but then gets us back on his side due to his dogged determination and his rather creative detective work. Supporting cast are all fine with no real weak players, but this one really belongs to Newman who truly nails it.Had it been slightly better paced and a bit shorter than I may have rated this slightly higher, but the first half did feel a bit padded out and laborious (Galvin's various pinball games, visits to the bar etc) were overdone and didn't really seem to add much - apart from showing that he was an alcoholic which had already been established earlier in the film??Still pound for pound this is another excellent film from Lumet and is one that lovers of courtroom dramas or little man vs big corporation stories should find relatively enjoyable.",

So the basic character structure is quite inconsistent which is why I couldn't relate to it in the first place. Sidney Lumet is a master of screenplay with his superior '12 Angry Men' and 'Dog Day Afternoon', but never really gets going here with uneven pacing and misdirected direction occasionally.

Jack Warden, brilliant in whatever he touches, may be America's most under-rated actor, is his usual brilliant here. His timing, his humor, his natural, easy manner make his character riveting and always interesting; he dominates every scene he is in, even with Newman.

There are times when an actor is given the opportunity to do a role that is perfect for his age and experience, and this seems to be one. Frank Galvin has suffered, has loved and lost, and now, has stood for something and been beaten up for it, and is ready to be somehow, miraculously, redeemed. Newman, drawing on whatever life lessons he has experienced, and his innate acting skills, paints Galvin perfectly--you cannot help but love, pity, and root like hell for the poor guy. You can smell the alcohol on his breath. You can feel the discomfort of his clothes that he has not changed in weeks, and you experience the pain of his losses. But, when he wins, you win. More accurately, when he wins, the world wins.James Mason...enough said. Thank God for actors like this.Charlotte Rampling: didn't know she had this in her.

            "content": "Because it was, it was basically a look at the world of yesteryear, when even a drunk lawyer like Frank Galvin (Paul Newman) could suddenly get called onto a case and not be paranoid about terrorism. A time when people weren't going around calling each other terrorists. And above all, a time when it was possible to have trials, at least fair ones.Watching \"The Verdict\", one gets the feeling that it didn't please the New England legal establishment. But it sure pleased me. Galvin starts out the movie in a sleazy bar in Boston playing pinball. His life looks as though it's wasting away until he gets hired to represent a malpractice plaintiff. Jack Warden, looking his usual menacing but kindly self, plays Frank's cohort Mickey Morrissey, and makes a comment at one point about \"a doctor who wasn't Jewish\" (one gets the feeling that these guys might be a little anti-Semitic, or at least hold some Archie Bunker-esquire stereotypes).More than anything, the movie really gives the feeling of Boston: crisp air, Irish population, and dark indoors. We would usually expect Sidney Lumet to do a good job, and he doesn't disappoint here. Also starring are Charlotte Rampling, James Mason, and Lindsay Crouse, all in top-notch form. A perfect movie. I guess that I would have interpreted it differently had September 11 not happened, but there's probably no point in dwelling on that.",

Still, as a well made film of its type, it is arguably worth a look, with some shots that are set up very well by Lumet and great acting, especially from Jason Mason as a cunning, scheming lawyer who Newman's character comes up against. The film has some ideas concerning both morality and self-redemption, and the sets are rather good, often with washed-out colours to reflect how the protagonist feels. This is a well done courtroom drama, even if it is one that had the potential to be better. There are a few more things that could be picked on - the occasional lack of realism and the abrupt ending in particular. Even so, this is solid stuff, with quality acting and the skills that Lumet possesses as a director to carry it through.",

            "content": "I'm getting a little older and typing less, but I can still watch a film (in this case, 17 times) and know when I see brilliance. Now it's time to share a few thoughts. First, Newman is always good...but this is \"different\". This is no \"Slap Shot\" or \"The Sting\" Newman; he is perfect in his role as Galvin, and deserved the Oscar. I really can't think of a bad performance, or scene, in this film. If I had to pick one, I'd single out Lindsay Crouse...she always seems to come across as \"wooden\"...here she shows some \"emotion\", but her timing and delivery take away from it. So, Paul Newman is at his best here, as is James Mason (a devilish best). The movie is about redemption, reward, conscience, power, money, The Church, the \"system\"...and how a hopeless lawyer somehow has his \"lightbulb moment\"...and against all odds \"does the right thing\". That Lumet went with the original script/screenplay makes one wonder what the OTHERS were like, but everything in this film, the story, the characters, the lighting, the underlying plot(s) come together to make one of those \"perfect\" movies. After 17 viewings the only bad thing I can say is that I felt the titling (though perfect in its sense of movement and delivery) could have been better (the Old English Script seems over-the-top). But even the TITLES demand watching...Newman nursing a beer, playing pinball, dark lighting, all we see and hear is Newman and the sound of the pinball machine as the opening credits roll...then we fade into the film. You've got to see this movie at least once; go back again and catch some of the \"other\" things going on. This is what film-making is all about; an excellent cast, script, and situation. They don't make them like this anymore (although The Shawshank Redemption comes close). I give this one 10 stars; it should be required viewing for aspiring attorneys so that they never lose the \"human side\" of things. THAT cause may be lost, but The Verdict is very close to perfection; an excellent film. Peace.",

The supporting characters are mostly good as well, and director Sidney Lumet handles the material very smoothly. However, I felt that David Mamet's screenplay was only ordinary in its approach to the way Newman's character gets this chance at redemption in the form of an easy case. To me, nothing inventive really occurs or for that matter, nothing too dramatic that sucked me in and kept me riveting the entire time. I must admit, some of the twists Mamet injects into the story were good, but we've seen them before in other dramas just like this in a very tired, bloated genre. I don't want to take anything from Newman's fine performance, but The Verdict feels only like a two hour version of Law and Order; and I can watch that for free. This movie is simply average, nothing more and nothing less. And while it is far from a poor film, I just had so much more expectations from a director like Lumet and a writer like Mamet.",

The same goes for the under-achieving direction by Sidney Lumet (Oscar-nominated) who has a real struggle here surprisingly.

I am sure that this would be true of many courtroom dramas but it doesn't detract from the fact that dramas like \"The Verdict\" are a wonderful forum for the exploration of values and ideas related to justice. In the case of \"The Verdict\", it goes even further into the realms of friendship and faith and redemption. For me, it is the friendship between Mick and Frank as played by my favorite character actor, Jack Warden, and Paul Newman respectively that is at the heart of the film. Mick's gruff devotion to Frank despite all of Frank's flaws is touching and inspiring. My favorite line comes from Mick when he retorts to Frank's estimation of the opposing lawyer, Concannon,played by James Mason in his most charmingly malevolent manner: Frank: \"He's a good man.\" Mick: \"He's good man?! He's the prince of f.... darkness.\" Warden as Mick is unforgettable as he mouths silent thanks to the heavens as the jury asks if it can recommend an increase in the damages from the defendants.That Newman didn't win a best actor Oscar for his performance in \"The Verdict\" but did win one for \"The Color of Money\" is the final word on the value of the Academy Awards. Newman had to dig very deep for this performance and it remains my favourite Newman portrayal along with that of Eddie Felson in \"The Hustler\" - not \"The Color of Money\".",

Along comes a major malpractice claim against a local Catholic hospital that has left the victim in a coma. Newman, with the help of mentor Jack Warden (great as always) take the case on, and find they have run into a buzz saw from the church, their large and prestigious law firm (led by the despicable James Mason), and biased judge, among some of the many obstacles. The story plays out well, my complaints are: 1) it's sort of a unpleasant scenario to be watched by a practicing attorney, 2) some of the judge's rulings are just goofy even if he's favoring the hospital, 3) one of the big firm's shenanigans defies credibility, and 4) Paul's closing argument sucks.

He's all washed up and dejected, and is an alcoholic to boot, reduced to handing out his card at funeral services. His good friend Mickey Morrissey (Jack Warden) has thrown him a bone, however: a possible medical negligence case that an expert witness has told Frank should be a slam dunk. This motivates Frank to lift himself out of his personal abyss and fight for the kind of justice that he still cares about, while restoring his self respect in the process. He decides that instead of settling, he will take the case to trial, which will prove to be a challenge.It's been said that the late, great director Sidney Lumet was particularly strong when it came to working with actors, and he gets a wonderful performance out of Newman, one of the actor's all time best. The story (adapted for the screen by David Mamet, based on the novel by Barry Reed) may not always be credible, but it's utterly compelling and is extremely well told. If nothing else, the film does score on an emotional level, without ever going overboard into melodrama. Music (by Johnny Mandel), editing (by Peter C. Frank), and cinematography (by Andrzej Bartkowiak) are all first rate.In addition to the excellent Warden, the supporting cast is full of fine actors who bring their A game: Charlotte Rampling as Laura Fischer, the new acquaintance in Frank's life, James Mason as the smart and crafty attorney Ed Concannon, Milo O'Shea as the judge, Lindsay Crouse as former admitting nurse Kaitlin Costello Price, Edward Binns as the bishop, Julie Bovasso as nurse Maureen Rooney, Roxanne Hart and James Handy as the victims' sister and brother-in- law, and Wesley Addy and Joe Seneca as doctors. Mason is great fun to watch and Crouse has a powerful scene where she gives some revelatory testimony. Be sure to try and spot Bruce Willis and Tobin Bell as courtroom spectators.Newman, whose final speech to the jury is particularly well done, absolutely shines. Overall, this is a must for any fan of him or Lumet.Nine out of 10.",

We look for the poor, the marginalized, and the mistreated to have a win. Even if it's only one W in a ledger full of L's we are thrilled with that one.Francis \"Frank\" Galvin (Paul Newman) was a washed up ambulance chasing lawyer. He hadn't won a case in years nor did he want to try a case. His goal was to get a lay-up of a case that he could settle out of court for a handsome sum. He got such a case from the Doneghys. Sally Doneghy's sister had fallen into a coma after being admitted to Saint Katherine's Hospital to deliver a baby. By all accounts she was given the wrong anaesthesia. This Catholic run hospital was willing to settle out of court when Frank Galvin had an epiphany and decided to take the case to trial.Frank was hardly prepared for the powers he was up against: the Arch Diocese, their elite team of lawyers, and a judge that was a little too partial to the defense. Then, to make matters worse for him, the Cape Cod Casualty Company, Inc. (the hospital's lawyers) had a mole working for them to give them the inside scoop on Frank and his defense.All of it was enough to make the blood boil and tears of anger flow. You just sit, wondering, will truth somehow prevail over power?It did, it did, it did. Because of a slip up by an unscrupulous judge and the inability for human beings to forget, truth won and justice was served.The jury got to hear that the admittance nurse had written that the patient had eaten a full meal only one hour before being admitted. Per the anaesthetist's own testimony the patient should not have eaten for at least nine hours before surgery. Though the shady judge told the jury to disregard all of the nurse's testimony due to some technicality, the damage was done. They could not unhear what they heard nor would they not consider it.

He falls in love with a woman (Charlotte Rampling) who turns out to be not all that she appears, and receives counsel from his long-time friend and partner (Jack Warden). Meanwhile, the defense attorney (James Mason) prepares to decimate Newman in what seems to be an open-and-shut case.I called this film a courtroom thriller, but that's actually misleading. \"The Verdict\" is much more a character study of middle age male desperation than it is a legal suspense film. There are many scenes of Newman poring over details of the case and gathering evidence, but all of these do more to develop his character than keep us engaged in the trial itself. The actual trial is dealt with in a couple of dismissive scenes, and the outcome, when it arrives, feels anticlimactic. That is until the final scene of the movie, when we realize that the verdict of the film's title is referring to something completely different than what we thought it was for most of the film's running time.It's certainly a very accomplished movie, but it is slow, talky and a bit too gloomy for its own good. It received 5 Academy Award nominations in 1982: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor (Newman), Best Supporting Actor (Mason) and Best Adapted Screenplay (David Mamet).

As anyone who is familiar with the pattern of an underdog's courtroom victory, THE VERDICT is strictly following the procedure, Newman plays Frank Galvin, a washed-out ambulance chaser who receives a wake-up call in his fifties, stands up for his client just for once, for justice. Needless to say it is a lopsided trial, Frank and his aid-cum-mentor Mickey (Warden), whose plaintiff is a woman in a vegetative state, versus two cocky defendants (both well-respected doctors) and their stellar defense team, led by a top-notch attorney Ed Concannon (Mason). Apart from his omni-competent opponent, Frank has to endured\b\b a worst-case scenario during his rushed preparation for the trial, the disappearance of a key witness, an uncooperative insider, a maledictory judge (O'Shea), a questionable deponent (Seneca), a hostile client (the plaintiff's brother in law) who takes umbrage at Frank's arbitrary turn-down of a handsome settlement from the defendant for their medical negligence. And it is a miracle he could still squeeze some time to have a fling with a mysterious divorc\u00e9e Laura (Rampling). Things will nonetheless turns to a rosy side for Frank, as his trials and tribulations will eventually pay off, which doesn't prevent one from sensing frustration to witness all the paddings before a bleak light of hope comes to the rescue, a dogged Frank fortuitously grabs a clue lead to a game-changer in the accident, but meanwhile an unexpected betrayal is the last blow to complicate the case. And the ending with an prolonged and irritating ringing of the telephone, does certify a stark love-or-hate stance for its audiences. However, Newman is impeccable here, he is a pampered child living in an adult's body, strives for his last chance to revive his life, a salvation of his ill-fated past, during the taxing process, he also begins to examine himself, to overcome his weakness (a terrific rendition of a panic attack) and reflect his goodness from the pestilent barriers around him and around us too, one long- take of him making a phone call with his adversary manifests Newman's top-tier stretch in bringing authentic force of emerging into his character. Preciously, the film is not an outward feel-good film, Rampling's stern-cum-icy presence and Laura's underdeveloped storyline mars the narrative but at the same time mirrors Frank's own rite-of-passage, so we might not feel much relieved when at the end of the day he won the case, it intrigues us more after the victory, what is next for Frank? James Mason is Oscar-nominated along with Newman and the film in toto seized five nominations (including BEST PICTURE and DIRECTOR), his malevolent silver-tongue and smug sanctimony is spot-on, a paradigm of the miasma of our legal system. But Warden in my opinion is also Oscar-worthy, restrained yet faithfully being a helping hand and a firm buttress for both Frank and the spectators!",

            "content": "As time progresses, and as standards for film making escalate, the Verdict falls behind and does not stand the test of time from multiple perspectives.The tempo of this film is a snail's pace. Given that this film was from 1982, this seems to be far behind the times of the early 1980's. The pacing may have passed as normal prior to the 1970's. The Verdict is painfully slow, which is further amplified by the lack of soundtrack or orchestral support. If watched late at night, there's a chance that this film may put the viewer to sleep. This may steer away all but the most patient and well rested viewers.For whomever owns the rights to this film, there's a very good opportunity to edit out the extended pauses and give this movie new life. This film has moments, but those moments are drowning in a sea of slow moving characters/plot, coupled with monotone dialog (mostly). With the right editing team, this film could potentially be shaved down by a significant fraction and the viewing experience would be more compelling.Regarding the characters, it is challenging to identify with or become attached to any of the characters. Supporting characters are forgettable, shallow, and rarely developed, again amplified by the slow pacing. The main character is beyond help. He stumbles through most situations and stands up for what may be perceived as the hard path, on rare occasions. Dumb luck is the only hero of this film.Shouting is not acting. This seems to be more common with older films, so it may have been more acceptable in 1982, but moping followed by yelling like a junkyard dog makes characters less believable and separates the viewer from the character. This makes it difficult to identify with the main character. Logical one moment and belligerent the next, without provocation. The viewer may opt to root for the opposing legal team, as they seem to be above average intelligence and they have their affairs in order.Cinematography is substandard. Beyond the bleak characters, this film lacks color variance. Scene after scene is drab, or dimly lit. There's a lack of scenes that pop with color or beauty. There are no unique camera perspectives to make things interesting. An average college level film student could have shot this film easily, as most scenes are wide angle, steady, or slow panning in one direction.Sound quality and volume normalization is bottom of the barrel. Character dialog volume seems to swing wildly even within the same scene, indicating that there was likely one microphone in a fixed position. As a character approaches the microphone the volume spikes. If a character walks away the volume quickly fades. This makes it challenging to watch since the viewer needs to adjust the volume up and down to compensate. This is a failure on the production side and the supporting team also failed to fix this in post before release.This is very far from a perfect movie.",

Superb job by the supporting cast particularly Jack Warden, one of my favorite character actors. He does a great crusty old fart. Great storyline and great directing within what that offers.

When she breaks down and cries, saying, ''all I wanted was to be a nurse,\" it crushes me every time.\nCharlotte Rampling provides a good deal of sympathetic staring and, frankly, I could stare into those soulful eyes for eternity.\nThe only way this movie could have been better is if they had followed the original novel and not provided a verdict. I guess audiences in the 80s wouldn't have been able to handle an indeterminate ending (and maybe still can't. see: whining about Sopranos final scene).",

            "content": "Frank Galvin (Paul Newman)is a hapless,ambulance-chaser lawyer.With the reference of his friend Mickey Morrissey(Jack Warden)gets a malpractice case against two respected doctors and a prominent hospital. What he wants in the beginning is just that he should go the dependent, settle for a certain amount of money and take his share but when he visits his client in the hospital in her vegetative state he can't just take the money because if he takes the money he will be a lost, rich,ambulance chaser so he goes to court which is not easy at all because he has not a decent witness and the only good witness he has, a doctor whose opinion counts is 'got to' by the defendant's side. All his hope lies in his determination and a nurse who does not testify for the doctors.The acting of Paul Newman is just impressive. When one sees his acting in the movie, one can't help saying such players should just live longer. Charlotte Rampling as the cold Laura Fischer seems pretty sensual for a femme fatale.There are those who compares the movie with 'Twelve Angry Men' which is another great Sidney Lumet movie.The comparison is not fair to me because 12 Angry Man never enters a court room at all. It takes the system of justice through a jury's deliberations but The Verdict is not about discussing a concept like 'presumption of innocence'.It is about the struggle of a man who takes aside a book,the lawyers or a a marble statue which are the trappings of the court but have faith in the justice.The Verdict has its minor flaws for me too. First, a doctor named Gruber who is supposed to give corroborating testimony, who can afford to say 'I have an interest in hospitals. I don't want those bozos in the same profession as me' is easily bought off by the defendant maybe that makes the movie more believable in this wicked world but it did not sound OK to me.Second, though the two lawyers are out of time and they have been doing the legwork for the last eighteen months(which is only mentioned in the movie)it sounds like they have enough time to pick up a surprise witness, for instance. Still that does not make the movie a bad one. This is a treat for those who love the trial movies.",

After almost being disbarred for being too honest Frank's career as an attorney had gone straight down the toilet with him handling four cases in the last three years losing all of them. Unable to get over his drinking problems Frank spends his time in Boston bars playing pin-pall machines and telling corny jokes to the patron's, just so someone would buy him a drink. Frank is now down to attending funerals where he hands out his business card to the outrage of grieving family members.Mickey Morrissey an old and good friend of Frank's hands him a case that he feel Frank can handle involving a malpractice case against a Boston Catholic hospital St. Catherine's. Debroah Ann Kaye, Susan Benenson, had been admitted to the hospital to give birth and after being treated with amnesia fell into a coma after her brain was kept, as a result of her treatment, for getting oxygen for as much as 10 minutes.The Catholic Archdiocese that the hospital is part of offers an out of court settlement for $210,000.00 to Frank's clients Sally, Roxanne Hart, Deborah's sister and her husband Kevin Doneghy, James Handy, who are caring for the comatose Deborah. Frank balks on the deal and decides, against Mickey's strong objection's, to take the case before a jury. Frank also very unprofessionally, to the point of again being disbarred, keeps the news of the settlement offer from his clients which can also get him fired as their lawyer. On top of all that Frank foolishly falls in love with a woman Laura Fisher, Charlotte Rampling, that he meets while he's getting smashed in one of the many bars he drinks at who's working for the enemy, the defense, who he confides his most personal feelings about the case and how he plans to handle it in court!Great courtroom drama in and out of court with Frank Galvin, who never seemed to give up drinking during the movie, using his sense of justice and bulldog determination more then his knowledge of the law to overcome a battery of lawyers from a multi-million dollar law firm. The firm is headed by defense attorney Ed Concannor, James Mason, and his very good friend, who seemed to be working for Concannor in every decision he made on he case, Judge Hoyle (Milo O'Shea).Frank goes as far as breaking the law, by breaking into a mailbox, to get a very important witness who can break the case wide open former St. Catherine's nurse Kaitlin Costello Price (Lindsey Crouse) to testify. Kaitlin's appearance and explosive cross-examination testimony about how the hospital mishandled Deborah's operation had the smug and so-sure of himself Concannor almost get a heart attack and run, with his tail between his legs, to his very good friend and secret tag-team partner in the case Judge Hoyle. Concannor wants the Judge to strike all of Kaitlin's damaging testimony against his client from he record which a very willing helpful Judge Hoyle did.Touching yet simple closing statement by Frank will have you like it did the jury and all those in the courtroom, and even I suspect Judge Hoyle, almost in tears that went right to the heart of the matter. Frank appealed to the jury's sense of of real justice not the justice that those in power always get with their money and influence and, in case that doesn't work, by intimidating, persons like nurse Kaitlin Costello Price and ambushing and defaming defense lawyers like attorney Frank Garvin. P.S That big sneak Laura who worked her way into Frank's heart and apartment and was sandbagging his case from day one got her share of justice as well; a solid right-cross straight POW in the kisser from Frank.",

This is a riveting courtroom drama which avoid the clich\u00e9s and looks at the serious business of legal and medical ethics, taking to task the attitude that doctors should be above question and answerable for their mistakes. It is also an interesting character piece, looking at how a washed up ambulance chaser decides some things are worth fighting for - even at the risk of financial gain and security. Charlotte Rampling, Jack Warden, Milo O'Seah and an unforgettable James Mason are in top form and Lindsay Crouse turns in a scene stealer as a pivotal witness.

Much like in theory, it takes a shady turn towards the end which kinda surprised me than ridicule. Paul Newman is raw as the unlucky advocate embroiled in a game of politics among big hospital bigwigs. A harsh reality is depicted, although in a shoddy manner as it goes from low to high in a span of 2 hours.

Jack Warden delivers a powerful performance as Newman's \"side man,\" a guy trying to encourage Newman to recall his earlier successful days before becoming the classic ambulance chaser. Newman's performance is very emotional, as he seems to be seeking redemption. James Mason is perfectly cast as his foil on the other side, representing two negligent doctors and a diocese-backed hospital of renown. Charlotte Rampling's contribution to the film left this film viewer somewhat dissatisfied, and the film's ending seemed a little abrupt. Otherwise, The Verdict is well worth the time.",

Mason plays Mason and Warden plays Warden as always. Laura Fischer doesn't have much of a role, and plays it correctly as not much. Milo O'Shea plays the judge ambiguously as cute but mean. Only Lindsay Crouse does a really good job as Kaitlin. If I were on the jury, I would believe her absolutely too.Now for the plot: *** Major spoilers *** In refusing the $210,000,Frank is clearly putting his own redemption (as a lawyer) above that of his client. Only way too late does he try to correct this.The love interest, Charlotte, secretly works for defense attorney Ed Concannon (James Mason), but stops being a spy before telling Ed about Kaitlin. You see her staring at a phone, but not calling him. Indeed, she secretly gives Frank the letter that allowed him to trace Kaitlin. Because of this, the jury was able to hear the other side - that the doctors had changed the one hour to nine hours. Yet at the very end, Frank refuses to answer Charlotte's phone calls and listen to her side - that she stopped spying in time. This verdict of Frank against even listening to Charlotte belies Franks closing argument about a prayer for justice. So I don't see that Frank is redeemed at all.",

            "content": "I'm sure this film was quite provocative in its day, but its subject matter is fairly tame to anyone who has watched any of the kajillion lawyer shows on TV over the last 20 years. But though some of the particulars may be a bit dated, there's nothing that can take away from Paul Newman's performance as one of the great characters in movie history.Frank Galvin (Paul Newman) is a middle aged attorney who would technically be called an \"ambulance chaser\", except Frank isn't even good enough to chase ambulances. He actually scams his way into funeral visitations and gives his card to grieving family members, passing himself off as an old friend of the deceased. Frank drinks a lot, but it's still not enough to completely drown his own self-loathing. He works out of a tiny office with no secretary and barely manages to get into court. Frank Galvin is pretty much the last person you'd want arguing your case.But Frank still has friends who remember him from better days and one of them, Mickey (Jack Warden), has thrown a case Frank's way. It's about a young woman who went into a Catholic hospital with nausea, was given the wrong anesthetic and wound up a vegetable. Her closest family wants some money to take care of her and maybe help get themselves started on a new life. At first Frank is thrilled with the case. He's got a great expert witness on his side and he can smell the retainer he'll collect from the Church's settlement offer. But then Frank goes to see the young woman lying comatose in her hospital bed. He wants to take pictures of her he can wave in front of the Bishop to try and get them to raise their offer. But something happens to Frank when he looks at that young woman. He actually sees her. He doesn't see a settlement check. He doesn't see his retainer. He sees a ruined human being and he just can't let this case go away for money.Frank rejects the settlement offer, without checking with the woman's family, and heads into court against the Church's army of lawyers, led by Ed Concannon (James Mason), a professorial yet utterly ruthless attorney. Frank wants this trial to redeem himself, but that's an easy thing to want when you think you're going to win. When Frank's expert witness disappears, his cross examinations fall apart and the judge openly sides with the defense\u0085Frank stops thinking he can win. But even with defeat weighing him down like a suit of armor, Frank manages to find one witness, one shred of evidence that might save the day. That is, if it doesn't get thrown out of court on a technicality.As I mentioned before, the desperate tactics, underhanded maneuvering and seemingly unfair and arbitrary nature of the legal system may have been quite a shock to folks with a Perry Mason view of the law. But whether you've watched L.A. Law, Law and Order or O.J. Simpson's murder trial, you've probably seen a lot worse and a lot more twisted stuff than you'll find in The Verdict.That doesn't detract much from the greatness of this movie because the heart of the story remains Newman's outstanding performance as Frank Galvin. This is a deeply flawed man. A broken man who in a crisis of conscience clutches to what he thinks may be his last chance to save himself. But what truly sets Frank Galvin apart as one of the great characters of American cinema is that he remains flawed, even on his road back to redemption. When the case turns against him, Frank frantically tries to weasel his way out and runs to his girlfriend for sympathy. Even his desire to take the case to trial is fundamentally a selfish one. He's willing to risk the welfare of a comatose young woman and the future of her family for his shot at redemption. But Newman totally succeeds in making us care about Frank's struggle for his soul, even while showing us that Frank will never be perfect.Aside from the reason why Frank's new girlfriend (Charlotte Rampling) takes up with him just before trial not making a lot of sense when you think about it, the plot of this film is very solid with very powerful, though perhaps not that memorable, dialog. There are two points where the judge (Milo O'Shea) acts in service of the Almighty Plot Hammer, but that's largely forgivable.Courtroom dramas, especially on TV, have long since outpaced what you'll see in The Verdict but there hasn't been much to compare to Frank Galvin, and one of the greatest movie stars in one of his best roles is more than enough reason to watch this film.",

They just do not act like real lawyers and Judges would act.Paul Newman plays a down-and-out lawyer who takes on a malpractice case against a big Catholic hospital. James Mason plays the defense lawyer who is willing to stoop to anything to oppose Newman's effort to obtain justice for his clients. SPOILERS The problem is that the filmmakers have these lawyers and the Judge in the case do things which real lawyers or Judges would never do. For example, when Newman receives a generous settlement offer from the hospital, he turns it down without even consulting his clients. This is such a blatant ethical violation that the film loses credibility already at this point. Any attorney practicing in this fashion would be severely sanctioned.The defense lawyer marshals all the people in his large firm to work on this one case. He asks them to drop everything else they are doing, including canceling planned vacations, to concentrate on this one case. This is ludicrous; no big firm could stay in business by ignoring all its other clients to concentrate on one case. Granted, it is an important case, but it is still only one case. More realistically, in an important case the lead attorney would typically have an attorney helping him as \"second chair\", and perhaps a para-legal to run errands as needed, but to pull every single attorney in the firm off their other work defies credulity.And then there is the business of planting a spy in the defense camp. Of course this is beyond the pale ethically. Mason is such a sleazy character here that he is unpleasant to watch on the screen. This would have been a much better movie if Mason had been portrayed realistically, doing whatever he could within the law and Newman then has to surmount these obstacles.Worst of all is the unholy alliance entered into between the Judge and the defense team. The Judge's ire is raised when Newman turns down the settlement offer. Now, it is certainly not unusual for Judges to encourage parties to settle. But when Newman wants a trial, the Judge should allow him to have it. Instead, he does whatever he can to thwart Newman's efforts to present his case. When Newman unexpectedly comes up with the witness who can help his case, the defense attorney vociferously objects. He is silenced by a stern glance from the Judge, and the viewer is led to believe that the Judge is now going to allow the truth to come out. How disappointing, then, when we discover that the Judge actually silences Mason so as not to draw undue attention to the witness, and he then goes on to rule the testimony inadmissible.The sad thing is that there are issues here which need to be aired. We have seen in the sexual abuse scandals that have recently come to light that the Catholic Church has indeed been guilty of covering up misconduct of its Priests. So it is not surprising that it would also cover up misconduct by its doctors. Further, I am told by a leading malpractice lawyer that these days the hospitals will, in more cases than not, attempt to falsify evidence. What they do is substitute another patient's records for the plaintiff's records, and submit it as the plaintiff's own records to show that nothing improper was done. The thinking seems to be that they are going to lose anyway if they present the actual records, so why not take a chance and hope they won't be caught?So the problem with the film is not that the hospital is crooked, but rather that it portrays the defense lawyer as being part and parcel of the chicanery. No lawyer would keep his license to practice law after something like this. In actuality, the client submits the doctored evidence as real and the lawyer is kept in the dark.If you want to see a good film about the legal system, there are many to choose from. A short list includes `Inherit the Wind', `To Kill a Mockingbird', `Anatomy of a Murder', `Witness for the Prosecution', `Judgment at Nuremberg', `Breaker Morant', `My Cousin Vinny', and `Amistad'. Go rent any of these fine films, but skip `The Verdict'.2/10",

I knew something was up, but could not put my finger on it. And, James Mason, well he WAS the Price of fu*king Darkness!With 30 years of acting under his belt, Paul Newman gave an outstanding performance as a drunk, washed-up lawyer that was handed a cakewalk that he proceeded to screw up. He managed to come out smelling like a rose through luck and skill as a lawyer. He should have gotten an Oscar for this film, and I am not saying that just because I like seeing someone stick it to the high and mighty.Sidney Lumet was also great as director as should have been rewarded for this and not just given an honorary Oscar.The real credit for this film has to go to David Mamet. How they avoided given him an Oscar for this screenplay is beyond comprehension.Bruce Willis has a walk-on role",

            "review_title": "Paul Newman leads a strong cast in a fine courtroom drama",
            "content": "Two things struck me about this movie: the uniformly excellent cast and the lighting. Paul Newman, in one of his best performances, plays Frank Galvin, a middle age alcoholic lawyer who is down, way down, on his luck. Opening scenes often set the tone for a movie, and that is the case here. Frank is seen glumly playing a pinball machine and drinking a beer. The camera slowly zooms in on Frank's profile where you can read dejection and weariness. That one scene tells us a lot of what we need to know about Frank.Frank's friend, and sometimes associate, Mickey refers a medical malpractice case to Frank that looks like it would be a slam dunk for a quick settlement. And that is what develops initially, but in a well scripted and filmed transformation Frank comes to see the case as an injustice that should be righted with more than a pro forma settlement. The case is also probably Frank's last chance to redeem his career as well his sense of self worth.The ever intriguing Charlotte Rampling is perfectly cast as a woman who takes up with Frank. My early reaction to Rampling, and the way she was filmed, was to agree with Frank when he said to her, \"My god, you are some beautiful woman.\" James Mason is superb as Ed Concannon, a cynical head of a top flight Boston law firm; Ed leavens his killer instinct with a sharp wit. Jack Warden shines as Mickey and Milo O'Shea is positively chilling as a powerful and politically connected judge you don't want to cross. Clearly a lot of work went into designing the sets. Frank's office looks out into an archway that always seems to be cloudy--it provides a perfect backdrop for the grayness of Frank's life. It's an achievement that such a small space as Frank's office is made to accommodate many camera angles. One intense scene is made powerful by having the camera appear to be mounted on the floor looking up to Frank on one side of his desk and Mickey on the other. The scenes filmed in the courtroom and courthouse accentuate the formality of such venues and make the people and their cares seem small.Director Lumet uses closeups to great effect, particularly by the way they are lighted. Light often strikes a face at an angle, creating a contrast of light and shadow that almost achieves the effectiveness of black and white portrait photography. Scenes in the courtroom that appear to be lighted by natural light are also effective. The final scene left me wondering about Frank's future. Too late now for a follow-up in the way that \"The Color of Money\" updated \"The Hustler.\"",

            "content": "Sidney Lumet had conquered the courtroom drama subgenre 25 years prior without even having to show the courtroom, with his classic 12 Angry Men. This more conventional courtroom drama is consistently solid throughout, but it lacks a punch that could've made it even better. It's essentially a classic redemption story, but it's dealt with such subtlety that it's incredibly hard to emotionally connect with, though easy to empathise. While it handles the material strongly, the case itself feels interchangeable with any other case as it lacks political or personal significance to society or the protagonist.Granted, Paul Newman gives a strong performance as always, even if it does lack identifiable moments. It has impressive production value with a lush colour palette especially in the wide angles but it doesn't use them often enough. Mamet's script spends too much time dodging sentiment, exposition and clich\u00e9s (if hitting conventions) and neglects to fill the gap with some unique charm to make it special. It's certainly not unsatisfying and it's definitely engaging, but it is underwhelming. Fortunately Lumet adds enough sophistication to give it a mature presence, thereby justifying its subtlety.7/10",

            "content": "It is hard to comment this picture because this is one of my greatest film-experiences, and although this film seems very simple - it is much more difficult than it seems. I think the most surprising in this picture is The Verdict is much more than a conventional courtroom drama: it's about a character's spiritual resurrection, or at least, the chance of the resurrection. From this view, Frank Galvin's final success is much more he could reach as a lawyer: it is the success of a man, who had to face with his past and, of course, his present which seemed hopeless. The Verdict's most powerful element is naturally Paul Newman's performance - maybe this role is the peak of his career and talent. His partners are excellent too, Charlotte Rampling, Jack Warden and James Mason. I like very much the works of Sidney Lumet, but sometimes irritates me, how much the characters speak in his films - namely this produces a little theatrical feeling what can be the disadvantage of films (for example, in an otherwise very good movie, Lumet's The Network). Well, in The Verdict the characters don't speak a lot, moreover there are a plenty of moments when they silence. This fact leads to beautiful pictorial compositions. I mentioned this film as an \"autumn portray\", however The Verdict plays in winter. I know, but the whole world of this drama is much more has an autumn character - with a lot of orange, red: Lumet and his talented photographer, Andrzej Bartkowiak consciously produced this feeling, they wanted to follow the style of Caravaggio's pictures. In the camera-work as well they had an artistic work: when Mickey (Jack Warden) tells Frank, what he knows about Laura's betrayal, we see this scene from long shot, without words, only the sounds of the street and the traffic - this is brilliant. But the final shot - when Frank is behind his table, and we don't know whether he will answer the phone or not - is simply unforgettable. To sum up, The Verdict is one of the most beautiful and artistic mainstream Hollywood movies: very highly recommended.",

            "review_title": "Phantasmagorical Setting",
            "content": "An excellent story with superb if eccentric production design. Either the version I saw recently was a 'director's cut' with new scenes inserted, or the movie is more watchable on TV than in the theater. When I saw it recently on the tube I caught backstory and sideplots I'd missed before. For example: Frank Galvin (Paul Newman) started out working for courthouse hack Mickey Morrisey (Jack Warden), landed a job with a white-shoe firm that exploited his naivete and ruined his career, and then finally Mickey Morrisey took him back. Frank Galvin still naively loves his ex-wife, daughter of the white-shoe firm's senior partner, even though she assisted in Frank's betrayal. The Charlotte Rampling temptress is hired partly because of a fleeting resemblance to Frank's ex-wife.The David Mamet script is a gem, relentlessly plotted, but its depiction of Boston is pure science-fiction and fantasy. Mamet offers the peculiar notion that everybody in Boston, with the exception of one Jewish doctor, is an Irish Catholic; moreover at least half of them are Irish-born and speak in rich brogues. So here we have the half-Jewish Newman and the half-Jewish Warden both playing Boston-Irish lawyers, though without any Boston intonation or accent, and the Irish-Irish veteran actor Milo O'Shea playing the capricious judge while looking like the late Tom Snyder in a pageboy haircut, and talking like a bookie from Cork City. Then we get English actor James Mason as Concannon, attorney for the defense ('Prince-of-F**ing-Darkness,' according to Jack Warden's Mickey Morrisey), and he talks just like...James Mason! And not James Mason in Odd Man Out, either. An upper-class Dubliner, perhaps. Are you licensed to practice here, Mr. Concannon?All-American actress and theater royalty Lindsay Crouse would be a perfectly believable Irish colleen, were it not for the broad stage-Irish that she speaks for no discernible reason.Nobody, but nobody, talks with any sort of Boston accent. Even straightforward American accents are thin on the ground. Charlotte Rampling makes a good try but comes across as an English girl who did part of her growing up in Connecticut.As if to emphasize the strange version of Irishry imposed on the production by Mamet--a brilliantly imaginative East-European Jew who is more at home writing scripts about grunting, potty-mouthed Hollywood agents than he is trying to conjure up a sense of old-line Americana--the movie set is a dank procession of dark-wood pubs, frosted-glass partitions, and elegant but dimly lit Beacon Hill townhouses: a set that could serve equally well for James Joyce's Dublin or A. Conan Doyle's London. I applaud this brilliant fantasy as an aesthetic experiment, but I found it extremely distracting when I first saw the film in its theatrical release. It is as though you go to see a film set in Manhattan, and a parade of cowboys and indians periodically streams down Fifth Avenue, and no one ever explains why.",

            "review_title": "Newman's Best Performance in Probably His Least Glamorous Role",
            "content": "For most of his career, Paul Newman played characters who always knew how to make their situations work for them, because of their self-assurance, and confidence. Even if there existed a darker side to his jovial laughter, Newman's characters always had a clear sense of who they were. From pool sharks to train robbers to grifters, Newman's characters were always likable, even if they were not always completely comprehensible. Interestingly, Newman was nominated seven times for acting without winning until he snatched the Oscar for \"The Color of Money\", reprising his Academy-nominated role from \"The Hustler\", Fast Eddie Felson. Some Hollywood insiders viewed the win more as recognition for Newman's career than a truly outstanding performance as the other nominees seemed to have offered far more powerful performances. However, some critics regard his performance in \"The Verdict\", for which he was nominated but lost to Ben Kingsley (Gandhi), as quite possibly his best.Newman plays Frank Galvin, a character who is not the typical Newman self-assured role. Galvin is a nearly washed-out civil-suit attorney who is in the twilight of his career. Having once, we learn, been part of a prestigious law firm until he's forced to play fall guy for the firm's scandalous behavior, and is fired, Galvin is a depressed barfly sporting hard drinks and frequent turns at the pinball machine. And he seems lost in a world where he doesn't know where he fits in. His law practice is dismal, and he's resorted to attending post-funeral wakes hoping the family of the deceased might retain him for services provided the death seems \"wrongful\". At one such wake, he's thrown out when he lies to the family, claiming he knew the deceased. He's not just \"an ambulance chaser\", but a \"hearse chaser\" in some sense.Mickey Morrissey (Jack Warden), a colleague and former teacher, brings him just the case he's been looking for: a young woman who fell into a coma during a failed childbirth at a Roman Catholic hospital in Boston. The family of the comatose victim desires to sue for malpractice. He meets a prestigious anesthesiologist who is willing to support the case, possibly testify at trial. At first Galvin is convinced the hospital and diocese will settle out of court, but then Galvin has a change of heart. He is technically not the attorney of the family members. His client is the comatose victim. He decides to take the case to trial despite a relatively large settlement offered by the Diocese. As a result, the surviving family, the victim's sister and her husband are incensed.A sub-story develops when Frank meets an attractive young woman at the bar he frequents, Laura Fischer, who we learn was once married to an attorney. The story moves on both fronts, in which Frank pursues the case and simultaneously engages in a relationship with Laura. Several stumbling blocks occur in the wake of declining the settlement, including the sudden unavailability of his star witness. Galvin then must pursue other witnesses, some of whom don't wish to testify, while also pursuing another medical expert willing to testify. And then his colleague Mickey stumbles upon something which could put the entire plaintiff's case in jeopardy. The final summation at the conclusion of the trial may be the best courtroom speech of its type since Atticus Finch's summation in \"To Kill a Mockingbird\", as realized by Gregory Peck. \"The Verdict\" is an outstanding character-driven story which has as its theme the idea of second chances. As the story unfolds, we learn several characters were compelled onto undesirable paths which were not of their own making, Galvin being the obvious example along with his comatose client. Others are also in similar situations, but more subtly. Larger forces were at work which drove these characters out of their desired situations and into mediocre existences. In this story, there is the possibility for another chance to achieve their desires and reclaim their paths. Some characters succeed while others are denied this second chance at fulfillment and/or redemption.",

He sees this potential in a case involving a woman who was allegedly put into a coma by the doctors at the hospital she was staying at. Galvin becomes obsessively determined to win this case at any cost, even with all the hurdles and obstacles that come his way while he gets closer and closer to court.

Lumet employs a grittier and darker style of filmmaking that sets The Verdict apart and puts it way ahead of its time. It has that subtle effect of not being a loud or obvious film. It's not one that you are blown away by or absolutely astounded by, but the level of appreciation one has to possess towards this film is insurmountable. It is that brand of high quality filmmaking that one just doesn't see every day.The Verdict has the kind of raw finesse that can only be picked up by those with an astute appreciation for this kind of subtle filmmaking. This quality lies in the direction of the film, but also in the script. The always incredible David Mamet is the screenwriter for this film, and it's very easy to tell. Mamet does with words what action films do with explosions. He creates a riveting and enthralling experience just through the fancy wordplay and the sophisticated dialect all of the characters flaunt. It is a script that never gets unbearably dull and the dialogue never fall short of genius. Whether you like the movie or not there's no denying that it is of a truly profound quality.The Verdict is a quintessential court room drama film that you would be foolish not to see.

He creates a realistic, multi-faceted character who gets the audience fully invested in the trial at the center of the story - this time not around a murder or a rape, but the less sexy but just as important world of medical malpractice.The Verdict is, to all intents and purposes, a nearly perfect movie. It's entirely a genre film though - it lacks a special something that could have made it a timeless classic by its own right like 12 Angry Men or Witenss For the Prosecution, there isn't a strong moral dilemma, a strong twist or an interesting enough conflict, and the ending is oddly anti-climactic.

No longer the youthful sex symbol, he is the aging character actor, who performs the role of Frank Galvin, the alcoholic lawyer. Galvin never amounted to much and is shunned by many of his profession. He is faced with a moral dilemma of taking quick money or pursuing his own conscience. The case centers on medical malpractice at a Boston hospital. A legal team, led by James Mason, is stacked against him. The movie is grim and often dark as the viewer goes from pool halls to cheap hotels in the dark, cold New England winter; however, there are a few stunning shots taken on the streets that just seem to light up the movie. Newman is helped by friend and colleague Jack Warden as he tries to get witnesses that will establish the truth for the jury. Newman makes a few misfires in the courtroom that embarrass him and it becomes apparent that his own reputation is a drag on him, with even the judge showing little respect. The courtroom eventually comes to grips with the truth. Frank's summation is restrained but heartfelt. I found the movie riveting and had great respect for what the justice system can achieve even when obstructed by those who would rather not shake that system when justice is crying to be heard. Sidney Lumet, the director, has to my mind left a tremendous body of work and this ranks as a worthy addition to that legacy.",

What is so good about The Verdict however, is the film is not really about the morality and the out come of the case per s\u00e9 but rather the evolution of Paul Newman's troubled character Frank Galvin against that backdrop. Newman in a very moving and convincing performance takes us on the journey of his triumphs, trials and tribulations. His summation speech is particularly memorable. Jack Warden as always plays an excellent mentor and the consistently great James Mason (The Boys From Brazil) is also very good as the trial lawyer opposing Galvin. Highly recommended for the performances of all three principal actors.",

Along with Jack Warden as his mentor and friend, James Mason as an courthouse opponent, Milo O'Shea as judge and Charlotte Rampling as Frank's lover, all of them are utterly convincing and believable and give this film top-notch cast..Some allegedly small script details play such a huge part in differentiating this movie from a tons of movies with a similar subject.

The movie tells the story about a defense attorney named Frank Galvin (played by Paul Newman)who sees the chance to salvage his career and self-respect by taking a malpractice case rather than settling in and not trying the case. The man who persuades him to take the case is a fellow associate named Mickey Morrisey (played by Jack Warden in a great supporting performance).This was to me one of Newman's top performances of his career in a captivating portrayal. Director Sidney Lumet has crafted a courtroom drama masterpiece that to me came out to be one of his greatest films, and his best courtroom drama film since his first movie that came out in 1957 12 Angry Men.This movie compares to courtroom movie classics like To Kill a Mockingbird, A Few Good Men, Amistad, A Time to Kill, and many more.

            "content": "\"The Verdict\" is a very good courtroom drama and a fine character study. Paul Newman, James Mason and Lindsay Crouse give extraordinary performances. Sidney Lumet, who made such masterpieces as \"12 Angry Men,\" \"Long Day's Journey Into Night,\" \"The Pawnbroker,\" \"Dog Day Afternoon,\" \"Prince of the City\" and \"Running on Empty\", creates a gripping atmosphere and very fine courtroom images.Some critics have called \"The Verdict\" one of Lumet's masterpieces. I'm not sure about it. The plot seems somewhat constructed sometimes, especially towards the end. There are also some errors in legal details, as others have indicated.It has also been said that the behaviour of Newman, Mason and O'Shea wasn't credible, since it wasn't always ethical and since they risked their licenses. I disagree with this kind of criticism, since it completely misses the point of the picture. In Lumet's pictures you seldom find characters without human flaws. Newman's character should certainly have consulted his clients and should have asked them whether they wanted to accept the hospital's offer or not. That he hasn't consulted them shows his complete obsession to win this one case to restore his self-esteem. It shows a human flaw in Newman's character. He makes a mistake. This is made pretty clear in the picture! But it's an understandable mistake. He also beats Rampling, which is also morally wrong. But that's what makes the movie so interesting. Its \"hero\" is a three-dimensional one, a character with both good and bad aspects. The behaviour of O'Shea's and especially Mason's characters isn't ethical of course. But people who criticize this as incredible don't see that there is corruption among lawyers and judges as there is corruption in most professions. Those who think that this is false or that the corruption is always revealed and punished are a bit naive. The movie has been misunderstood by some as a criticism of defense lawyers and judges in general. This is wrong. Lumet's works often deal with problems in the society and with corruption. But as his famous films about police corruption (\"Serpico,\" \"Prince of the City\") don't claim that ALL cops are corrupt, \"The Verdict\" doesn't make such generalizations about the legal profession. Mason and O'Shea are NOT supposed to represent the majority of people who work as lawyers and judges (as Rampling's character isn't supposed to represent all women). You wouldn't think that L. Olivier's character in \"Marathon Man\" represents all dentists, would you? :-)This is not the best courtroom drama ever made. I prefer Lumet's own \"12 Angry Men,\" Preminger's \"Anatomy of a Murder,\" or Wilder's \"Witness for the Prosecution\" for instance. But \"The Verdict\" is in one league with a flawed, but admirable film like, say, \"Inherit the Wind.\"9/10 (**** out of *****)",

In Kaitlin Costello's testimony she states that she was the admitting nurse in 1976.  The check that Laura Fischer receives from Edward J. Concannon is dated February, 1982 (same as the release year of the movie).  That would make the operation six years earlier.  However, several times in the film it is mentioned that the \"operation\" took place \"four years ago\".

Galvin is all set to take the settlement, but something inside of him is now thinking twice, and he realizes that he will not take the easy money. This is his one and last chance to remember what it is like to be a lawyer, and decides to move forward and go to trial against insurmountable odds. As the details of the case emerge during the trial, the once quick buy-out/make it go away case now becomes a matter of exposing criminal behavior, negligence, and injustice.

The whole idea here is redemption, and once we see his character, Frank Galvin, making a stab at it, well, he's got us. If the film wasn't so skillfully put together, so well acted and directed, one might consider the ending a cheat. But it doesn't feel that way. It feels like justice. At the beginning, the boozy Galvin is shown going from funeral to funeral passing out business cards, always hurrying to his local watering hole at the end of the day to swap stories and jokes with the regulars there. He actually does have a case, one he doesn't pay much attention to until it's almost too late. A young woman is in a coma after a difficult childbirth, and her sister has sued the hospital and its doctors for not preventing it. When Galvin finally gets around to checking into it, something stirs inside him. He sees a chance to do something right again. He's not even sure why he's doing it and he wavers often. His mentor, Mickey Morrissey (Jack Warden, in a great, gruff performance), is really Frank's strength, helping him, encouraging him, criticizing him. Galvin turns down a substantial offer from the hospital's sponsor, the local Catholic diocese, to settle out of court and proclaims his intention to try the case. Everyone, including Mickey, thinks he's crazy. James Mason plays Ed Concannon, the hospital's attorney, and he is smooth and cunning as we would expect. He has a battery of lawyers to assist him and all the money and resources one could wish for. Concannon is supremely confidant and it isn't until the final few moments that he has any reason not to be. He hires a woman, Laura Fischer (Charlotte Rampling), to befriend and seduce Galvin, so that he'll know exactly what the other side is doing at any given moment. David Mamet's screenplay is near-perfect, displaying that great writer's brilliance with dialogue, relationships, and situations once again. Sidney Lumet's direction is sombre without being stodgy, deliberately paced but always moving the story forward, letting us see it from all the characters' perspectives. Even with a wonderfully varied cast of supporting actors, this is another latter-day showcase for Paul Newman, reminding one in many ways of 'Absence of Malice.' His characters in these films are not dissimilar; down-on-their-luck through much of the film but always ultimately rising to the occasion. And the ending of 'The Verdict' is every bit as satisfying to us as it is to Frank Galvin, sitting in his office and refusing to answer Laura Fischer's phone call.",

I was enamored with \"Runaway Jury\" which can loosely be argued as among the same 'genre'.\"The Verdict\" ends so abruptly, giving you pause to wonder what the actual end might be.

Didn't particularly care for or find Charlotte Rampling that believable in her part as a plant from Mason's firm to get information from Galvin.",

I suspect that Newman's early image of a pretty boy probably hurt him in some respects, but, man can he inhabit a character. In The Verdict, his Frank Galvin character is, essentially, a rather ugly, unsympathetic character. Through Newman's talents, he converts him into someone that you hope can turn things around. At the end, you still aren't sure if he has achieved this, but you get the feeling that he at least has his feet under him, and chances are good. Lindsey Crouse nearly steals the movie with a remarkable courtroom performance, but it's Newman who truly shines in this somewhat dark, engrossing tale of utter desperation and redemption.",

However, Sidney Lumet skillfully directs Paul Newman to keep this movie alive. The movie doesn't compel as well as such other courtroom movies (12 Angry Men, To Kill A Mockingbird), and this is most likely because the film moves at a very slow pace. The court case doesn't actually begin until you're nearly an hour and a half into the movie. Nevertheless, Newman gives a master-class performance, convincingly portraying a man who's life is dependent on this court case. As he murmurs to the invaluable Jack Warden: \"There are no other cases. This is the case.\" Sidney Lumet's beautiful shot direction allow you to share the pain with Mickey (Newman), and Andrzej Bartkowiak lights these shots accordingly. In short, this movie is kept alive by Lumet's direction and Newman's performance. And those two factors are enough to keep you in your seat throughout the whole movie.",

            "content": "There are a number of actors that can give a performance everyone can agree on. Some of the best performances are the ones that aren't well-known to the Academy. In addition, an performance must convince the audience and insure us that the actor is willing to expand his or her character to desperate measures. Paul Newman is one of those actors who doesn't take any chances when it comes to acting out his roles. And in The Verdict, his performance is outstanding.Newman plays Frank Galvin, a once-promising Boston lawyer who just lost four cases in the last three years. His addiction to alcohol has increase over the years. He tries to make amends to clients that he doesn't know and his best friend, Mickey (Jack Warden), is just had enough of his losing streak. All of a sudden, Galvin is given a last chance at a big moneymaker case. The case is a malpractice one and the client want to take the case to trial. With the help of Mickey, Galvin manages to put together the trial. But, another lawyer, (James Mason), is willing to take part in the trial, too. With the two opposing sides working their way toward the trial, an woman, (Charlotte Rampling), falls in love with Galvin. To matters worse, Galvin's star witness disappeared before the trial and the doctor that Galvin appointed to doesn't have any prior knowledge of the case. As soon the problems start to mound on Frank's shoulders, it soon becomes clear that the odds are stack against him. The question will be: Can Galvin pull himself together to make things right for himself and for the people around him?Paul Newman has never given a better performance than this. In my opinion, I wish that the Academy would give him the Oscar for his performance in this movie. He really convince me to believe that his character is not going to win the case. But yet, the people want him to do the right thing. His character is on the cuff of self- destruction. Basically, he is surrounded by a world that's filled with manipulation. Not only to himself, but to his peers. When the movie creates several drawbacks on the case, I started to realize more often that the movie is going to pull a fast one on me. What's surprising is that the movie pulls a fast one on it's itself when it does the reaches the climax.The supporting cast is absolutely wonderful. Jack Warden should've been nominated for a Oscar for his portrayal of Mickey. He is the last person that Newman wants to deal with. James Mason is also excellent as Newman's opponent. His character along with the others are strong in appeal because we, as the audience get a sense that Mason is going to win this case because he has a bigger team than Newman and Warden. Just as I mention above, the movie pulls a fast one on itself once again.David Mamet, who is a playwright author have written a brilliant screenplay. The dialogue is sharp, crisp, and explicit with meaning. When the characters begin to talk in the court and outside the court, you can hear these people talk the way they are meant to talk. The language is striking with the characters judging each with knowledge. Mamet's script is read like a book. Each scene is like a page in a book, with new and rich dialogue. These characters are believable and plausible because they are city-people with city lives. There's a lot to be said about the themes in The Verdict. One of those significant themes is redemption and manipulation. Throughout the entire movie, Galvin is trying to rebuild his reputation as a good lawyer. Meanwhile, Mason's character is also trying to rebuild the case on his terms. The end product is something extraordinary. There's are several moments when Galvin trembles in fear because he dreads for the worst to come. His anxiety gets the worst because he fears for his identity as a lawyer. Toward the end of the movie, Newman give a beautiful written speech toward the court and jury about having justice in their hearts. That's the one thing I'll never forget that scene. Newman doesn't play out his character. He acts it out. That's why I think his performance is award-winning. He acts in desperation as the character. You see it in his face that's he's acting as Frank Galvin. \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 4 stars.",

            "review_title": "A Perfect Film of Its Type",
            "content": "Quite honestly, I can't understand the quibbling exhibited here by some of the other reviewers. To me, this is just about a perfect movie, achieving exactly what it sets out to do, with everything in it and about it insuring the perfection of that achievement. Some say it is too slow, but this is the kind of story that has to be told slowly, as its main subject is not so much the legal case involved, but the step-by-step reemergence of a conscience that may lead to the reclamation of a human life and career from a decade or more of sheer mediocrity-cum-failure. The screenplay and direction are all of a piece, and they never veer off into cheap emotion, theatrics, violence, hyped-up speed or whatever. Lumet's direction is perfect, but it always is, and David Mamet's screenplay is a marvel of slow and painstaking discovery, both of salient story facts and of the characters' own strengths, weaknesses, fears and even concealed self-loathing (one gets the last not only in Newman's performance, but even in the short speech James Mason's character makes when justifying his and his firm's slimy methods). Which brings us to the acting, and this is really the primary reason to see this film, maybe even over and over again (I've seen it about 7 or 8 times since it first came out in 1982, each time with even more enjoyment and appreciation). Although the characters are just disparate enough to not rise to the level of an ensemble, this is film ensemble acting at its best. There is not a performance in the film that is not a stand-out. Others have already called this Newman's greatest film performance, and it well may be, but given so many superb acting jobs over almost 50 years, it may be hard to segregate any one of them as his best. But it is quietly yet grandly superb throughout. Mason's upper class but still somewhat seedy opposing attorney is as fine a thing as he ever did on screen, yet again, he did so much that even a thing as fine as this is simply running against self-competition! Jack Warden, among the most underrated actors of his time, equals them in his own way, even if in the kind of typically gruff and rough-and-ready role that was his trademark. The enigmatic performance of Charlotte Rampling as Newman's new - and maybe first in many years - love interest, comes into its own when certain hidden plot elements emerge towards the end of the film. Milo O'Shea is hatefully magnificent as the Judge, an almost too realistic near-parody of the kind of Boston Irish semi-political hack who does mean and nasty things and probably hits the Confessional once a month to be absolved of having done them. Binns is on the fence as the head of the Archdiocese, a Cardinal who seems to want to act justly, yet is willing to accede to what he intuits are some pretty unsavory methods used by his defense team, this in order to protect the reputation of the Archdiocese. Arguably the two best performances in the film are in minor roles, with Julie Bavasso (God, what an underrated actress for decades) as an older nurse who seems frightened to death of what she has witnessed in her job, and is now unwilling to speak of it to anyone, most particularly to Newman's plaintiff's attorney, finally breaking her reserve only to call him and all other members of the legal profession \"whores\". (In this story, it's hard to disagree with her.) And finally there is a gorgeous near-cameo appearance by Lindsay Crouse (Mamet's wife) as the missing operating room witness, whose life and career have been substantially ruined by the combined medical establishment, hospital and Archdiocese. For all practical purposes, her five minutes or so on the witness stand practically steals the acting honors in this film, a feat that would seem manifestly impossible given what I have written to this point. I would also call your attention to Mamet's incredibly well-written circumlocutionary closing argument for the plaintiffs, even more incredibly delivered by Newman in a long one-shot camera take that starts to the right of the judge's bench and behind the jury with Newman sitting silently in the distance, takes in the entire slow and deliberate speech as he makes his way up to face the jury, stays on him throughout, and then follows him over the jury's heads as he returns to his seat, now in close-up as the scene fades out. It doesn't call attention to itself, but it is in the realm of what we might expect from Welles or Hitchcock in their very best innovative moments. A wonderful film in every conceivable way!",

            "content": "I first saw \"The Verdict\" in my early teens, which was when the film had just been released. Although I was too young to grasp the legal technicalities and complications that the plot involved, I was still deeply touched by the simple yet powerful story: Frank Galvin (Newman), a lawyer who is on the brink of alcoholism and professional bankruptcy, takes a case involving a medical malpractice in which a young woman who was about to give birth has fallen in a terminal coma. Although the defendants are prepared to offer a good amount of money to the victim's family as an out-of-court-settlement, Galvin refuses to accept it, going for a trial instead; this is done against the advice of everybody, including his partner, the presiding judge, and even the plaintiffs themselves. Galvin sees this case as both an opportunity to show his capabilities again after many years of idleness, as well as a rightful struggle to punish those responsible for committing a shameful act who are now trying to get away with it lightly. Against him stands the formidable defense lawer E.J. Concannon (Mason) and his well-organised team, and Galvin's chances to win get bleaker day after day... Amidst all this, Galvin bumps onto an attractive woman (Rampling) who complicates his already complex life further.Viewing the film again now with the mind and experience of someone in his early 30s, I can make a more balanced, thorough, and accurate review. However, it is astonishing that my conclusion is the same as it was more than 20 years ago: The film is superb, and Paul Newman definitely gives an amazing performance. Not that the remaining cast is not good: Everybody does a great job, with Mason being first among equals. Yet, Newman is simply unforgettable, as he does an excellent job in portraying this lawyer who manages to get back from the brink of disaster, and show his true form-no matter what.Some might say that the plot is simplistic. However, the purpose of the film is not so much in showing the story (which is interesting anyway), but in portraying the interactions and clashes of the personalities involved. And it does a great job at that! 9/10.",

            "content": "A first and foremost reason for remembering this film when it was released and seen in our jurisdiction, the memories of being sworn in that year (1982) in the Commonwealth are vividly remembered today.This movie is in the must see lists for many who have a sincere interest in the law and why our system in the United States of America is created with the power to rest in a jury and a similar concept in law exists in common law abroad. Although in real life scenarios, most of these cases are settled.The acting is superb, as far as drama courtroom thrillers go, and the crew and production creators knew the importance of such a film because of our health care system. So many theorists discuss the elements of a medical malpractice case while understanding the need to prove medical errors in an array of consequences that come after the fact that are not readily seen because of the human condition and shareholders who have a broad degree of power to restrict evidence in some cases.When you love the law and know why, the filmmakers who present such a fact scenario in Boston with the level of talent in these actors, one knows how important the last scene is when the jury asks that one breath taking question. Some say a dream for a plaintiff's attorney, and a nightmare for defense, when dealing with a jury trial which is rare considering all that are filed usually intend that a just settlement be arrived at which must be accepted by the Court.I saw this movie with another attorney who was sworn in to the Bench & Bar in 1982. We both smiled and wondered about the law and precedent for many questions set forth depicted in the film knowing so very well how much more goes on before reaching such a point in a real case. A local attorney is usually handling such a case or is part of a team of trusted colleagues.In any event, out of 25 law or courtroom movies set forth by the American Bar Association in 2018, this movie was, of course, included probably for many reasons and not the least of which was where it was tried with a predominant religion being involved that has political and religious consequences for mother and child that cannot be blindly avoided. Thus, the film has many varying point of view perspectives that must consider another equally compelling point of view, maybe ones you have not considered.We all, whether or not you are inclined toward the rule of law, seem to do better when we review films noting the virtues, the knowledge of the players, and their power to convey truth and integrity in the actual performance. The script, how it is directed, the music, the realities of the city and actual courtrooms, and any particular idea that provokes thought is presented here.With that said and not subjectively displaying actors and his or her rankings among varied movies or the cast & crew that truly created the film, I remain one that remembers the family members of these companies who produce the films, the many people needed to professionally present and distribute the product. For better or for worse, the belief of hoping to extend a sincere hope that something in a review might be helpful to one person, is enough for me because I know how much the film industry displays the best heritage of mankind to our youth. Also, when I feel something is important and that feeling is based in experience, I usually write about it because writing is helpful in displaying historically why movies and documentaries are so important, together with television programming.In this movie, they did a top drawer job.Thank you kindly.",

Watching him here in \"The Verdict\", therefore, is nothing short of a revelation. Where a lot of actors would need a couple of paragraphs of dialogue to give you an idea of what is going through their minds, Newman tells you with just a look. The broken nature of the court scenes (abruptly leaving during the middle of Newman's opening argument, never hearing Mason's closing one) may be a bit much for some to take, but as the rest of the movie makes clear, the case is only part of the story. The behind-the-scenes manuevers, the strategy sessions at the firm of Newman's opponents, Newman's scrambling for any solid straw in the wind--due credit goes to one of my favorite screenwriters, David Mamet, as well as Newman for making these just as, if not more, important than anything that we missed in the courtroom.The images, I think, that will stay the most in my mind are the opening scene at the pinball machine and the unanswered call at the office at film's end. It struck me how much the sounds of the pinball machine ringing and the phone ringing were so much alike. But maybe Mamet was going for symbolism; the pinball machine representing randomness, chaos, luck of the draw and the phone as direction, purpose, focus. Regardless of such speculation, it helps to make the same point that \"High Noon\" made three decades before: doing the right thing is never easy...and sometimes, the price is VERY high.",

My case was very simple. I went to a doctor for a medical problem and was prescribed a drug (Tofranil) that I knew nothing about at the time. For nine months going every other week, I kept telling the doctor that I was beginning to have some side effects. Mild at first, then into the 'call doctor immediately' category as shown on every drug website. Yet every time I brought this up, the doctor (Gary Safier of Morris Plains, NJ) told me...'Don't worry about it, your body will adjust.' I kept getting worse and he kept saying the same thing until I finally had enough and left him, got off the medication. What I didn't know at the time was that the side effects I was having for so long had permanently damaged the digestive tract and my prostate gland. That was in 1991 I stopped seeing him and ceased taking the drug. Then after several months an I was still having the same physical problems I began to have as side effects from this drug over nine months. It's now 2020 and I've had my life stolen from me in 1991 and have been suffering through all it has done to destroy any chance at the life was was having before meeting this doctor. My wife bailed because she had no spine or loyalty because I was no longer able to do what I used to and live how I was living, it affected my ability to work to make a living. I'm still breathing, but in every respect that matters, Dr. Gary Safier killed me by ignoring my side effect complaints. And no lawyer would help me. THIS is how the legal/medical system works. I believe as shown in this movie that the lawyers pay off the lawyers to NOT take 'easy' malpractice cases like mine, although I thought it very simple. Incompetent doctors of all fields get away with causing permanent harm and lifelong suffering to millions of Americans looking for help. And the insurance companies love it because it is much cheaper to pay off a lawyer NOT to take a case that if tried would cost them infinitely more when a verdict has been rendered and the damages the jury awards is handed down.",

            "content": "One of the most overlooked and under-appreciated auteurs in cinema direction returns to the judicial stomping ground of his matchless debut. Sidney Lumet acquired this project after it had been abandoned by both Arthur Hiller and Robert Redford, troubled at aspects of David Mamet's adapted screenplay. Whereas Redford was uncomfortable at the prospect of presenting a chronic alcoholic, Lumet was drawn to the desperate and gritty realism of Mamet's treatment. The source material was a 1980 novel written by American trial lawyer, Barry Reed, who specialised in medical malpractice and personal injury cases. This background allowed him to explore the inherent iniquities of this area of legal practice. Moreover, Reed himself shared his main protagonist's epiphanal views on justice superseding financial gain, with his one-time law partner revealing: 'For the small cases he just wouldn't take a fee.'The tile of the movie suggests a courtroom drama, when the truth is that it is what happens outside the courtroom which has more gravitas. Rather, the title could be considered as referring to Newman's character's own 'verdict' on his having lost sight of what truly counts in the pursuit of justice.Despite interest from many leading actors, including Sinatra who offered to play the part for free, Lumet was determined to offer the leading role to Newman. In the standout performance of his career, the latter thrives under Lumet's trademark low-key direction, finally able to answer criticism from his former mentor, Lee Strasberg, that he had the talent to be as great as Brando, but all too often relied on his looks to coast through a movie. In an understated performance as browbeaten advocate and barfly, Frank Galvin, Newman captures effortlessly the shame and wretchedness of this flawed protagonist, justifiably earning his Oscar nomination for best leading male. Indeed, this should have been the performance to garner him his sole Academy Award, rather than the lacklustre follow-up to 'The Hustler'.A tale of redemption, the audience accompany Galvin on his arduous journey back from years of alcoholic abuse, a lack of self-worth, and professional malaise to a re-birth of some degree of self-belief and professional integrity. Reduced to trawling obituaries to seek potential clients, the road to redemption is triggered when he is handed an open and shut case of medical malpractice. His prior soulless and intoxicated existence - having 'the shakes' so bad he has to stand and sip from his glass - is perfectly married by Johnny Mandel's stark soundtrack.Despite the preparedness of all parties, including his own clients, to settle out of court, Galvin becomes determined to pursue justice for a young mother left in a vegetative state after receiving an incorrect type of anaesthesia. In attempting to prove two eminent doctors in their field are guilty of gross negligence, he has to take on the combined forces of the Archdiocese of Boston in whose hospital they work, a highly priced and organised legal defense team, and a hostile presiding judge. Though no thriller, this film is a wonderful character study, and not of a fearless hero, as the audience experience Galvin's panic attacks on realising his chief medical witness has been intimidated, and his last-ditch attempt to settle out of court. By contrast, later we witness him at the point he appears to be losing the case, as a means of steeling himself, repeat over and over the mantra: 'There are no other cases. This is the case'.In his last ever appearance in a major Hollywood production, James Mason, as the wily and assured lead defence counsel, provides such a mesmeric performance that it is a travesty he was not garlanded with an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. In a fantastic scene, his character reveals that his relentless pursuit of victory by any means was founded on the instruction of the head of the law firm where he first practised telling him: 'You're not paid to do your best, you're paid to win'. Mason was slated to reprise the role for TV but the project was shelved due to ill health.Two of Lumet's original 'Twelve Angry Men' appear in a superlative supporting cast, but very much out of character compared to those they portrayed in their earlier outing with Lumet. Honest and principled Juror # 6, Edward Binns is here the bishop determined to avoid miring the archdiocese in scandal at all costs by hiding the tragedy from public interest, while superficial Juror #7, Jack Warden, plays Galvin's loyal and dependable former mentor and ally. Another notable performance comes from Milo O'Shea as the biased corrupt judge, in his most incisive contribution to the silver screen. After summoning Galvin to his chambers for a dressing down, immediately after he has so openly disqualified the relevance of the chief medical witness for the prosecution, he finally encounters our protagonist's full fire and determination he has so fuelled. For screen time, perhaps the most striking performance is given by Mamet's then wife, Lindsay Crouse, in a brief but compelling appearance as Galvin's surprise witness.Finally, Charlotte Rampling adds her trademark steeliness to her role, which one reviewer perfectly characterised as a fellow 'lost soul' desperately clinging onto any buoy in a storm. While her underlying motives serve to illustrate the degree of corruption which Galvin has to overcome, her own battle with her conscience to do the honourable thing mirrors that of Newman's character.The nominations for best picture, direction, and adapted screenplay evidence how fruitful a collaboration this was between Mamet and Lumet. No scene captures their combined artistry more than that which marks Galvin's epiphany. Securing his own photographic evidence to bolster his clients' claims and his own percentage of any financial settlement, Galvin's empathy for the incapacitated victim suddenly takes shape as do the images in the Polaroids. It is as if her induced coma shakes me him out of his own self-imposed one. As if he declares to the Archbishop in rejecting the quite sizeable out-of-court settlement fee: 'If I take the money, I am lost. I'll just be a rich ambulance-chaser'. The power of this scene is further achieved as the only sound to be heard is the working of the life-support machinery. Lumet has managed to instil a sombre atmosphere and greater gravity throughout by intentionally shooting most scenes with a drab palette and curtailing extraneous dialogue and sound.Lumet should also be credited with persuading Mamet of the need to provide, as the title of the production would suggest, a judgement on the case. This is a judgement on life as much as on the lawsuit in question, and worthy of being carved in stone, as the trailer for this feature would suggest. After his surprise witness' testimony of the doctors negligence, in not checking the time between the last meal and the administering of the anaesthetic, is stricken from the record by a legal technicality, Glavin makes a speech in which he remind the jury that for that day 'You are the law', and not the trappings of the legal system. Unfortunately in spite of Newman's Oscar-worthy performance, and contrary to his character's summation, the jury at the Academy could not be trusted to make the right decision.",

This is probably Sidney Lumet's last great film after such classics as \"12 Angry Men,\" \"Serpico,\" \"Fail Safe,\" \"Murder on the Orient Express,\" \"Dog Day Afternoon,\" et al. Paul Newman was robbed, this is one of his best performances, and that's saying a lot. I love the little nuances of his performance, like when he greets the \"witch doctor\" at the railroad station, he feels the material of his overcoat as Galvin is \"sizing up\" his expert witness. I've always thought Newman had a great comic sense, which can be seen in \"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,\" for example.This is my 2nd favorite film of all time with deep personal meaning. No I am not an alcoholic, but most of us have been underdogs at sometime in our lives. We've all had people doubting our capabilities, just as James Mason's team of lawyers discount Galvin's competence. This film is about personal redemption. Further, I admire Frank's strength in not going back to Laura after she betrayed him. We've all known a woman like that in our lives...The cast is outstanding: James Mason, Milo O'Shea, Charlotte Rampling, along with perennial Lumet actors Jack Warden and Edward Binns. The script is by the best American Playwrite, David Mamet, who doesn't require an introduction.As I stated, Newman should have won the Best Actor Oscar. It was a tough year, against the great Peter O'Toole and Ben Kingsley. I always thought his first and only Oscar for \"The Color of Money\" was out of sympathy for losing in 1982, but he gave a great performance in that film as well. Still and all, this film is timeless, important, and motivating to all of us who have faced a personal crisis.",

            "content": "First of all i should say that Paul Newman, as always(as far as I've seen), gives a spectacular performance, as the main lawyer in this movie. Although the movie follows regular movie \"rules\" and has a very little original content it does offer good insight on the politics of law. There seems to be a sort of cynical tone somewhere in the writer's head, trying to show how justice does not always have its way, especially when a competitive corporation is up against a small group. There is a monologue I particularly liked, one about the firm paying employees to win and not to do their best, otherwise their existence would just fade, there seems to be a dichotomy between survival and justice depicted which is done in a very effective manner. This is a movie enjoyable even by people who are not movie geeks, though maybe not for the fanatic action fans :P.",

            "content": "Courtroom dramas come at a dime a dozen. John Grisham has become the popular voice for pitting lawyers up against the most intricate cases and nearly always having their client come out winning in the end. \"The Verdict,\" unlike others of its genre, refuses to be mired down by the standard conventions, preferring to look beyond the courtroom into what makes an attorney tick, the stress they are under to succeed, and the myth that they are all out to make a fast buck. Paul Newman has one of his best and most interesting character portrayals here as Frank Galvin, an admitted ambulance chaser who has a sudden attack of conscience during a medical malpractice suit. A heavy drinker and deeply fearful of entering the courtroom again, Frank refuses to accept an offer from the church and the hospital to let the case go away easy.  Justice is what he is after, even if the odds are dreadfully against him. Especially when he is against James Mason as the prosecuting attorney does he have reason to be anxious. You get to see behind-the-scenes what an attorney is all about, combatting the stereotype that lawyers are \"whores\" without a sense of loyalty or esteem. This is one of many Newman characters who is not ashamed to show weakness and vulnerability, but still fights for what is right and just in society. It's not surprising to discover David Mamet wrote the screenplay; each line is soaked with meaning and truth. The final summation by Newman is beautifully delivered without excessive theatrics. It is a beautiful pairing of a fine actor with a juicy script. Sidney Lumet, the director, keeps the atmosphere dark as always, but preserves the necessary realism to make this law drama shine like few others have done before or since. Every case a lawyer faces must be treated as if it were their last, and Newman is put through the ringer like nobody else. The conclusion (which I won't reveal) makes you stand up and cheer for its vindication and glory, not only for Newman but for the belief that justice can triumph in the face of a sometimes corrupt legal system. In the end, only the jury's \"verdict\" makes the difference.",

It is treated like a quirk, with no negative consequences at all for the character, who doesn't even try to quit drinking and actually seems to be at his best when drunk.The direction is attentive and effective, it's easy to follow every step regardless of your familiarity with the legal system.

            "content": "I was 15 years old when the film was released. I didn't get to see it then, but remembered it as a film dramatically lost so many of its Oscar nominations to Richard Attenborough's Gandhi, especially the ones for Best Actor-Paul Newman and Best Director-Sidney Lumet. I still remember the face filled with painful disappointment of James Mason, the film's nominee for Best Supporting Actor, who died shortly after the film's great success. Thirty-three years passed, and I finally got to see this film, if you can believe it. Lumet, Newman, and Mason are all dead. The mysteriously beautiful Charlotte Rampling has become an old lady, still carrying with her some mystique. Bruce Willis and Tobin Bell, who were extras in the courtroom with no dialogue, have become a major and minor great stars respectively. This Lumet's film still holds. The power and the intent are still there with little to no blemish. Even the images of outdated phones, furniture, cars, and all the rest have failed to discredit the film. We know it is an old film, but we cannot care less. The story of the verdict of a man fallen out of the main road and trying to get back, professionally and morally, is timeless. It is not as cheesy as Rocky and not as flashy as The Wrestler. It is calm, serene, constantly moving, even without one single reason why the main character should have bothered continuing. It is a very exciting non-action film. This is a life you can find around you almost on daily basis, a totally failed drunken loser, yet watching it is freshly breathtaking, like discovering something new. \"The Verdict\" was purposely made in the stage style: rehearsal after rehearsal, long takes and dialogues one after another, plus the virtually motionless cinematography. Brown tone of color all through the screen. All this should have bored and tired the audience to the bone. Yet we find two hours and 9 minutes of this film seamless and rather short. This is what a classic does.",

            "content": "Probably the best way to describe The Verdict is as a character exploration which uses a courtroom drama/thriller as its vehicle. It's the story about the struggles of an alcoholic who is trying to redeem himself as a person, and sees this one case as an opportunity..maybe his last..to do it. The alcoholic in question is an ambulance chasing lawyer named Frank Galvin (played with understated brilliance by the great Paul Newman), and he's up against a lot more than just his own demons. He has to deal with a high profile defense lawyer who's not above playing dirty, a biased politician of a judge, and at times his own clients, who are angry when he turns down a large settlement offer. Galvin's clients are suing the Arch Diocese and Catholic hospital over a botched baby delivery where the child is killed and the mother is effectively turned into a vegetable.I understand that director Sidney Lumet was doing a character study first and a courtroom suspense a distant second here, but the pacing in some parts of the movie was slower than it needed to be. You see example after example of Galvin's drunkenness and how it affects his daily life, to the point where you're thinking, \"Enough already! I get it!\" It's not that those types of scenes aren't important. They're essential to tell the story. But some of them didn't need to be dragged out for so long, and it makes the whole movie feel like it's crawling at a snail's pace.The strength of this movie is its realistic approach to examining an all-too human problem that affects nearly all of us at one time or another in our lives, directly or indirectly, along with a great cast and fine performances, not only by Newman, but also by Jack Warden as his only real friend, Charlotte Rampling as the girl he gets involved with, James Mason as the shrewd and not always ethical defense lawyer, and Edward Binns as the Catholic Bishop. But ultimately, the one reason I have for seeing a movie as depressing and slow as this one is to watch Paul Newman, a true master of his craft, at work. Watching Newman act is like watching Randy Johnson pitch, Frank Lloyd Wright draft, or Da Vinci paint. Yeah, as an actor Newman really was that damned good.",

Particularly notable supporting performances by James Mason, Jack Warden, and Miles O'Shea. The rest of the cast deserve honorable mentions all around. In general, a very strong cast.The brilliance of this movie is how well Frank Galvin's despair and desperation are conveyed by Newman.Another reviewer commented that it was unrealistic for Galvin to grow a conscience in the short time he visits his client in the nursing home. This is pivotal point in the plot and worthy of some analysis. What that reviewer fails to account for is that we're told (by Jack Warden, in a monologue about Frank's life to Charlotte Rampling) that Frank was idealistic before he sank into a bottle and began malfunctioning as a lawyer and a human being. In the nursing home scene, he wasn't growing a conscience. He was unearthing the one he'd buried under years of boozing and self-loathing.I actually think it's one of the most powerful scenes in the movie, and Newman does a great job, with single line (\"I'm her attorney\") and body language to communicate the waning excitement of a fat payday, to one of profound sadness about her and his own failings as he was preparing to exploit her destroyed life for a profit.The movie has a period-look to it that is very \"late 70s.\" The winter landscape of the Boston neighborhoods is depressing. The smokey clubs, bars, dark paneled law chambers, Frank's threadbare office and apartment, all have a feeling of darkness that reflects the cynicism of the era. It's ugly scenery, beautifully captured and perfect for the movie's context.This is a dialog heavy, character-driven movie that many moviegoers will reject for slow pace and lack of action. The wealth here is in the craft of the script and the performances.",

(Note: on TV the many F words are edited out.)In addition to the major cast players, watch for great performances by Edward Binns (Bishop Brophy--late coming to realize he needs to do some ethical housecleaning...but still realizing this) and the middleaged, brutally honest nurse (a bit tough, beat up by life some)--Maureen Rooney (played well by Julie Bavasso). One hopes the Bishop starts listening regularly to the \"little\" people such as Nurse Maureen, who could have given the Bishop the real story ages ago... ...had she thought her opinion would have been wanted.(After all, most Christian hospitals were started to \"serve the weak\" as in the story told by a Jewish man 2000 years ago. Thus, the Bishop must house clean to get back to the \"Good Samaritan\".)(SPOILER below...I thot of \"The Verdict\" and the barely seen other 12 heroes... the JURY. Despite the legal webs woven by both hostile judge and corrupt superlawyer Concannon, the jury does not let themselves stay enmeshed in such legal minutae. They look at the whole picture and return the just verdict. I just wish the legal \"gods' known as the US Supreme Court (and the demigods of Florida) could have had the view of the jury in THE VERDICT and looked at the whole picture instead of drowning in their own legal minutae, for instance some judges... (like the judge in The VERDICT) felt that they needed to protect their judicial turf or needed to \"teach\" upstarts who challenged their position---and thus did not deal with the CRITICAL issue---a severely brain damaged, yet healthy young woman who was being forcibly starved to death...I thought of THE VERDICT many times as Terri Schiavo took the couple weeks to slowly---die.",

Don't know how realistic is this movie, but to me clear message about, that is easier to lose trust than to regain same, is sent and when that happens, you don't know what hits you.All in all, movie is great and this kind of drama I would recommend to everybody.Similar looking movie: A Civil Action (1998) and A Few Good Men (1992) >> Acting factor:4/5 Plot factor:4/5 Fun factor:3/5 Art factor:4/5",

As much as I admite Redford more than any other modern actor / director / producer, I think that he missed the point here. The fact that the lawyer was an alcoholic was essential to the character.This was one of the best courtroom dramas ever produced. Filled with emotion, and real life experiences, I found the movie to be unparalleled in its realism, emotion and feeling.I loved this film, and I cannot recommend it enough.

First, I want to say, although it appears to be a courtroom drama movie..it's not. It's a movie about a man's character with the use of a courtroom and a lawyer to show it. It's definitely quite different from Newman's typical movies. This movie is about the character development of Francis and his descent and ascent in his personal and professional life, how the former affects the latter. It's quite introspective, which I believe he quoted in the \"featurette\" on the DVD. We see a man struggling with his sense of self worth and hit rock bottom with the typical use of alcohol as a means to get there. Newman is fabulous in this movie, we see him raw and vulnerable, his acting is remarkable. His mentor, played by Jack Warden, is also worth noting. Although their relationship is one that is typical for any movie of this kind, Warden is extremely believable.. Of course, it's a dated movie (1982) but for its time, it's worth watching, or even purchasing if you can get it for a discount. My rating 7/10 stars...",

James Mason is perfect as the defense attorney for a powerful entity--cheating at every turn even though he has overwhelming advantages.  Charlotte Rampling plays Laura perfectly.  Edward Binns, whom I seldom see praised, is terrific as the bishop whom Mamet has mouth the words \"What is the truth?\" like a latter-day Pilate.Best of all, the ordinary folk in this movie get an opportunity to challenge the tendency of professionals to bury or to bankrupt their mistakes.Don't let the title fool you.

His performance is seminal here, however even the minor roles are performed superbly.

I guess the point is that people can't just forget that kind of evidence, which is something I quibble with in almost every courtroom drama where dramatic evidence gets thrown out. But if that's the point, why the slow meandering toward such a simple ending and outcome? I must just be basic and prefer John Grisham. At least on Law and Order, getting the law stuff wrong (or right but in a severely slanted way) is part of the schtick and they don't waste my time about it.",

Besides, even at this time most C-Sections were being done under Spinal or Epidural and aspiration would not be an issue.

A meager law office, an aging mentor (Jack Warden) and the pinball machine at the local bar are all he has when he decides to make a lifestyle change. With his client in a coma and little hope of ever recovering, Galvin decides to reject a sizable payout from the Catholic Hospital that put her there and takes them to court in a high profile malpractice case.The 57-year-old Newman looks a far cry from his typical on screen self. His ratty suit and near constant stubble fit the hard-drinking Galvin, who frequently stumbles to the bar before lunch for a quick hangover cure. While his actions spiral him deeper and deeper out of control, the actor's steely blue eyes pierce through the character's rough exterior giving the audience hope for his redemption.As Galvin turns from the bottle and throws himself into the case, he begins to see the client as a person instead of a payday. Even as every tactic he throws at the jury is shot down by the Hospital's high powered attorney (Mason), he never loses hope. While the Catholic Church is at times depicted as the villain or at least a corporate entity, faith becomes the overwhelming theme of the film.The Verdict garnered five Oscar nominations, including only the second in Newman's long career. Though he would again lose out on the award, he would reinvent himself by proving he could still step out of his comfort zone as an actor.There is no real hero in this courtroom drama that relies more on emotional draw than actual evidence.

            "content": "There's a moment in The Verdict, after the incriminating testimony of his surprise witness is ordered to be struck from the record on a technicality, when Frank Galvin (Paul Newman) makes this last-ditch plea to the jury: \"...there is no justice. The rich win; the poor are powerless. We become tired of hearing people lie. And after a time we become dead, a little dead. We think of ourselves as victims. And we become victims. We become weak. We doubt ourselves, we doubt our beliefs. We doubt our institutions. And we doubt the law. But today you are the law. You ARE the law.\" These words are as much a description of the lawyer's own tenuous, emotional state, as they are an entreaty to the jury to do the right thing. They are a sample of a spare but sparkling screenplay by David Mamet (American Buffalo, Glengarry Glen Ross) which resonates as much today as it did in 1982, as America prepares to vote during a pandemic with a brazenly authoritarian president in power.\nSidney Lumet's courtroom drama The Verdict is a quietly brilliant achievement. Paul Newman stars, at age 57, as washed up lawyer and alcoholic Frank Galvin. Unable to recover from the damaging events that ruined his standing as a reputable lawyer, he occupies his days in the same dreary haunts playing the same sad pinball machine, scouring funeral homes for legal leads, and sharing whiskey shots with a motley crew of pals at the pub. His loyal ex-partner Mickey (Jack Warden) passses him a malpractice case to help him out, and the story proceeds from there.\nWhile the suspense elements and steady build up of the story are both intriguing and engaging, THE ONE THING that stays with me the most after watching this is the pitch-perfect mood of the film. Cinematographer and longtime Lumet collaborator Andrzej Bartkowiak casts the film in faded hues of brown and grey, matching Galvin's washed out existence. Newman's performance is low key and vulnerable, unlike anything else I've yet seen him in. All elements combine to create the portrait of a man in a moment of existential crisis. Will Frank be able to climb out of his comfortable but destructive routine? Will he find allies to help him uphold justice, or will people disappoint as they pursue only their own self-interest.\nThe story is gripping because I can easily see myself in Frank. At any moment, a person's life can change. The moorings that provide meaning can slip out from under you, whether it be a job, a loved one, or a traumatic experience. The journey to recovery is an uphill battle, and to do it surrounded by doubters, as Frank is, can be terrifying. The film's ending is both triumphant and uncertain. On the one hand Frank has a victory, but on the other he is betrayed by someone he came to rely on. It is this open-ended ambiguity, rare in Hollywood films, that makes me like the movie even more. It keeps you thinking after the credits roll.",

The Verdict features Paul Newman and was written by David Mamet. This film has a medical context and a nursing role.A word about Sidney Lumet. Lumet directs quality movies about medico-legal, substance abuse and cultural issues. For instance, in Equus the plot is about a psychiatrist treating a boy who blinds a stable full of horses. Lumet also directed Long Day's Journey into the Night which is Eugene O'Neill's autobiographical account of his explosive home life, fueled by a substance abusing mother, an alcoholic father and a mentally ill brother. Dog Day Afternoon is about a gay man who robs a bank to pay for his lover's sex change operation. The simple robbery turns in to a hostage situation and a media circus. Critical Care, a medical \"comedy\", is about a young hospital resident embroiled in a legal battle with siblings over the care of their rich, comatose father. The resident has a supervisor who insists that he only care for patients with full insurance. Finally, 12 Angry Men, another courtroom drama is about a young Hispanic male who is accused of murdering his father but the story really is about jurors' prejudices about the trial, their biases about the accused and each other.The Verdict depicts a once successful, now down-and-out lawyer who sees his career turning around when he accepts a medical malpractice case and refuses to settle rather than going to trial.Kaitlin Costello Price, Mamet's wife in real life by Lindsay Crouse, is a nurse who was involved in the pre-surgical care of the comatose patient. The long and short of her story is that she had to leave nursing because the surgeons told her to change a patient's record who had eaten an hour before the operation so they could use general anesthesia. If she did not falsify the record, she would never work as a nurse again. She doesn't.Her words echo in my mind to this day \"Who were these men? Who were these men? I wanted to be a nurse\"!Some racial profiling and sexual bias goes on here. A black doctor is brought in to testify and Newman treats him shabbily.Jack Warden called him a \"witch doctor\". Additionally, there was a seen where Newman punched his girlfriend for lying to him and she thinks she deserves it.",

First, as always, I must note an excellent movie bar, which after doing some research, availed itself to be a bar I've been to and love (the 7B Horseshoe Bar aka Vazacs, or simply, The Horsehoe) \u2014 this surprised me, for as much of the film takes place in Boston, a lot was shot in NYC. The watering hole is where Frank, our legal knight, frequents to tell dirty jokes with the usuals, play pinball, and occasionally drop a raw egg into a glass of beer. The conflict arises when Frank is given a medical malpractice case as a favor from an old friend and biz partner (Jack Warden), which is set to settle for a pretty sum, if only Frank doesn't have a change of heart, hides the offer from his clients (a big no-no), and loses his star witness to\u2026 vacation? You can imagine where the plot goes from here. Despite the system being against him (the \"system\" here being a judge with a ridiculous haircut and an army of corporate lawyers), Frank conducts some shoe-leather investigations to beat the insurmountable odds. Frank's iron will is commendable, but he commits at least two counts of malpractice, the first I already noted, the second coming when he didn't motion for a mistrial after the red-handed evidence of opposing counsel's (James Mason) ethical violations. Even though the jury finds in favor of our hero (and against all the weight of admissible evidence..) it still is unsatisfying because we never hear the awarded amount. I simply don't understand this. When there has been so much emphasis on the amount from the settlement negotiations, what Frank could've accepted for his clients and the cut for himself, when that amount seemed hopelessly lost, it was a shock that the script didn't include the amount in the namesake verdict. Like so many movies before really the past 10 years or so, we end with whether the romantic interest be tied up, in which, like usual, I don't care. Moreover, if Frank even contemplated continuing a relationship with Laura, I'd want to smash him over the head with his own beer glass. It's a solid legal drama, but with a few changes, could've been something special.",

Tossing Paul Newman in the lead role completed the trifecta as he grows into his character as this film progresses, ultimately delivering a memorable performance by deftly portraying the range of changing motivations and emotions his character underwent throughout this film.\n\nThere were times this felt like the type of Grisham courtroom thriller I grew up reading and I have always been a fan of this genre from a young age. There were also moments I felt this veering into unnecessary melodrama but thankfully these scenes never slowed the film down or took me too far out of the story. I also wasn't sure how keen I was on the last scene but should probably sit on that for a little while before declaring \"it didn't work for me\".\n\nJack Warden provided good support and is always a welcome sight in a cast for me. James Mason was also memorable as opposing council and Milo O'Shea deserves a mention as I found him extremely unlikable, a definite compliment, in his role as Judge Hoyle. 7.5/10",

However, his redemption is nuanced, not forced, and he has a lot of natural character development that's satisfying to watch. Unfortunately, I found it very hard to connect with him near the end of the film as we are forced to literally watch him assault a woman under the guise of justice; it's distasteful and could have been handled so much better.\n\nThe trial itself, which takes up a good portion of the movie, is really engaging and rightly brings frustration to the bureaucracy and bias of the American justice system. It also felt very accurate to real-world courtrooms, although I'm no expert. The ending felt kind of off, though: I don't want to spoil anything, but there is a verdict at the end of the movie that doesn't feel in line with the legal evidence presented. It feels more like the verdict was chosen for an emotional response more so than as a result of the proceeding events. This was frustrating because the rest of the movie was incredibly detailed and technical.\n\nTo summarize, it's an imperfect movie but absolutely worth watching.",

The rich win; the poor are powerless. We become tired of hearing people lie. And after a time we become dead, a little dead. We think of ourselves as victims. And we become victims. We become weak. We doubt ourselves, we doubt our beliefs. We doubt our institutions. And we doubt the law. But today you are the law. You ARE the law.\" These words are as much a description of the lawyer's own tenuous, emotional state, as they are an entreaty to the jury to do the right thing. They are a sample of a spare but sparkling screenplay by David Mamet (American Buffalo, Glengarry Glen Ross) which resonates as much today as it did in 1982, as America prepares to vote during a pandemic with a brazenly authoritarian president in power.\n     Sidney Lumet's courtroom drama The Verdict is a quietly brilliant achievement. Paul Newman stars, at age 57, as washed up lawyer and alcoholic Frank Galvin. Unable to recover from the damaging events that ruined his standing as a reputable lawyer, he occupies his days in the same dreary haunts playing the same sad pinball machine, scouring funeral homes for legal leads, and sharing whiskey shots with a motley crew of pals at the pub. His loyal ex-partner Mickey (Jack Warden) passses him a malpractice case to help him out, and the story proceeds from there.\n     While the suspense elements and steady build up of the story are both intriguing and engaging, THE ONE THING that stays with me the most after watching this is the pitch-perfect mood of the film. Cinematographer and longtime Lumet collaborator Andrzej Bartkowiak casts the film in faded hues of brown and grey, matching Galvin's washed out existence. Newman's performance is low key and vulnerable, unlike anything else I've yet seen him in. All elements combine to create the portrait of a man in a moment of existential crisis. Will Frank be able to climb out of his comfortable but destructive routine? Will he find allies to help him uphold justice, or will people disappoint as they pursue only their own self-interest.\n\u200b     The story is gripping because I can easily see myself in Frank. At any moment, a person's life can change. The moorings that provide meaning can slip out from under you, whether it be a job, a loved one, or a traumatic experience. The journey to recovery is an uphill battle, and to do it surrounded by doubters, as Frank is, can be terrifying. The film's ending is both triumphant and uncertain. On the one hand Frank has a victory, but on the other he is betrayed by someone he came to rely on. It is this open-ended ambiguity, rare in Hollywood films, that makes me like the movie even more. It keeps you thinking after the credits roll.",

The story is a slow burn, slow build and sisyphean in it's determination, anchored by Newman's gravitas. The only real weakness is the female love interest, their relationship never taking hold in a way that feels substantial enough to earn the dividends Lumet and Mamet pay it in the final 3rd. With a worthwhile turn (spoiler -> she is working for the other side) but when she fails to authentically win back Newman's affections, we are left feeling vacant not because of their failure, but because as an audience we never understand enough about either of them to invest in their potential bond. A stoic performance from a young Charlotte Rampling, but behind the stone facade of her and Newman, we need more than just behavior and suggestion. For the early 80s it was enough of a B story and emotional foundation to build upon, but not quite enough for today. Nonetheless, the film holds up, the twists and turns keep us engaged and the final surge is a thrill. With strong support from James Mason (ole' Humbert Humbert) and a general trust put into performance though many masters and long takes, The Verdict will still win you over.",

            "content": "Sidney Lumet explored the importance of justice in American courtrooms with 12 Angry Men (1957) and twenty five years later he chose to produce another classic courtroom drama with The Verdict (1982). Fortunately the two films are very different as while 12 Angry Men largely confines it's action to one room and provides limited backstory for it's characters this is a film that employs the extensive landscape of Boston, Massachusetts and serves as an in-depth character study of a failed, alcoholic lawyer. I was particularly impressed by Paul Newman's performance as while I have found him to be a charming presence in other films he never struck me as a great dramatic actor but he proves himself to be absolutely riveting and capable of really carrying a film here.\n\nAlcoholic lawyer Frank Galvin, Paul Newman, had his once promising career ruined when he was framed for jury tampering early in his career, divorced his wife, was fired from his law firm and became addicted to alcohol. He gets one last chance at redemption when his friend Mickey Morrissey, Jack Warden, has him assigned to a case in which he will defend the sister and brother in law of a woman who choked on her own vomit and was deprived of oxygen during childbirth after being given anesthetic by negligent doctors which has resulted in her being left in a vegetative state. Against the advice of everyone around him Galvin chooses to try the case and attempts to put together a decent defense before going up against the formidable Ed Concannon, James Mason, who employs dirty tactics to argue his cases. Galvin also begins a relationship with fellow alcoholic Laura, Charlotte Rampling, who may not be what she appears and faces corruption in the form of a biased judge and the difficulty of his primary witness disappearing. With perseverance and commitment to the case Galvin is able to track down a crucial witness and bring compelling evidence forward.\n\nThe film doesn't follow all of the typical beats of a film of this sort as while we get the essential last minute introduction of crucial evidence and an impassioned speech from the protagonist there are moments of true inspiration here. No, I'm not just talking about the scene in which Newman unexpectedly punches Rampling but I will admit that I was surprised at seeing our hero hit his supposed love interest. The final, passionate speech was what really sold me on the film as it is comparatively restrained and thoughtful compared to the outbursts seen in \u2026And Justice for All (1979) and A Few Good Men (1992) which while entertaining are less emotionally moving than they should be. This quiet monologue fit Newman's character as he is a man who has been relentlessly beaten down by life and he doesn't have the energy to yell and scream. He gets his point across just as well speaking in a muted but clearly emotional tone which felt more realistic in addition to having a greater impact on the audience.\n\nLumet's direction cannot be undervalued as a story that could have felt like another episode of any number of television shows is elevated to the status of sophisticated drama as he builds tone and atmosphere without giving the audience any easy answers. The David Mamet screenplay also makes the film that much better than other films of this ilk as it provides characters with a simple, concise way of speaking that is able to reveal depths about their characters without making them seem too eloquent to believe. The film even looks beautiful, rare for a courtroom drama, as we are led through the various seasons and how they affect the climate in Boston while witnessing the havoc that alcoholism can wreak on one man's life. Finally, the performances are all top notch as Newman gives one of the finest performances of his career as a haunted man who still has that glint in his eye suggesting that he has the ability to be a great lawyer and possibly a redeemable human being. Mason is equally fine as our British villain who is menacing not because of a facial scar or his physical strength but his eloquence and unmatched abilities in the courtroom. Both men should have won Academy Awards for their work as they are quite brilliant and display that even late in their respective careers they still had more to offer.",

I suppose it was a great summation and he talked about the justice system being about the jurors, who represent the people.  But, I found it kind of unintentionally humorous that at the very end of his eloquent speech, he just drops his head, walks back to his seat, and you feel like his body language and the abrupt ending of the speech was saying \"why even bother.\"  Overall, I'd say don't even bother watching this movie.

Lumet returns to form in the courtroom after his classic 12 Angry Men (1957) with The Verdict. Lumet's smooth direction gives The Verdict a grounded quality. The problems are all gritty and down to Earth. The Verdict is as real down to the mundane aspects of the courts.\n\nDavid Mamet's script for The Verdict takes on corruption of judicial figures, corruption within The Catholic Church, miscarriage of justice, doctoral malpractice, and criminal negligence with a scathing critical lens from Lumet. All the issues within the judicial and medical industries are put on full display due to Lumet's careful camera placement and dedication to depicting good lawyer work.\n\nJohnny Mandel's score is a subtle composition of classical music that brings out the seedy darkness of the law world. He keeps it quiet until the score suddenly rouses into a moody accompaniment of sorrow around Paul Newman's failures as a lawyer.\n\nPaul Newman sheds his cool exterior to play Frank Galvin, who is the broken and defeated alcoholic lawyer on his last case. Newman is remarkably understated that makes The Verdict age well into a thoughtful piece on doing the right thing as a lawyer. Newman's closing statement speech is a neat choice of heartfelt honesty as he opts not to go for the impassioned speech declaring his client in the right. Newman instead keeps it classy and genuine that plays to pathos and emotions to do the right thing in the face of adversity. He made a logical and fair case and gave it his all in a performance you must see. Newman's stumbling around drunk is very fun as it is troubling, while Newman simultaneously establishes his character as the lawyer to root for in the end.\n\nOn the other hand, James Mason is phenomenal as the cheating lawyer with ghastly underhanded policies in his nuanced and calm performance as Ed Concannon. His villainy is present despite his charming persona. His careful politicking around reveals his cruel and unethical abuses of his office as a lawyer. Mason is brilliant as ever regardless of his older age. James Mason is the perfect foil for Paul Newman in The Verdict.\n\nJack Warden's supporting role as Mickey is as realistic and endearing as a portrayal of a friend and good lawyer as film gets. Milo O'Shea's irreverent and crooked Judge Hoyle is despicable and disturbing to watch his brazen abuses of his office.\n\nLastly, I must mention the young and lovely Charlotte Rampling in an incredibly complex role as Laura Fischer. Her moody personality and blunt speech makes Laura the ultimate femme fatale. Her character's twists are unpredictable as I did not see them coming. I especially appreciate the realistic ending Lumet chose for Newman and Rampling. Charlotte Rampling has always been an actress to watch and appreciate excellence in realistically nuanced acting. She is simply divinely blessed in her craft.\n\nI loved The Verdict for its lack of hand holding in how mature and respectful Lumet treats his audience. You follow the case exactly as Newman experienced every sudden hope and disillusioned crash. The courtroom has never felt so tense and uncertain as it exists within The Verdict!",

He uncovers a legitimate injustice and struggles to accept a settlement, which effectively results in a cover-up of a major medical error. The case symbolizes his individual struggle to take badly needed easy money or to regain his professional integrity and peace within himself by bringing the case to trial. The story works well, and the internal conflict within the main character is clear and emotional. It picks up as the powerful opposition, his high-paid defense attorneys attempt to sway trial outcome with bribes and underhanded tactics. Watching him research and build his case is exciting. He knows he has a case, but his formidable opponent makes it difficult for him. It all builds to a climactic court scene. A drunk lawyer on the skids is a different type of role for the usually likable Paul Newman, but he pulls it off very well. His character has a conscious, but he is uncertain of himself. He knows he must defeat his internal conflicts in order to be the lawyer his clients need him to be. It is a very good movie, with the emotional backbone needed to leave a lasting impact.

He befriends Laura (Charlotte Rampling) who is budding a budding legal counselor and finds some hard truths. \n\nPaul Newman portrays a man in depression who sees no way up from the position he is in but wants to stick by some ideology he never followed through his career. So the basic character structure is quite inconsistent which is why I couldn't relate to it in the first place. Sidney Lumet is a master of screenplay with his superior '12 Angry Men' and 'Dog Day Afternoon', but never really gets going here with uneven pacing and misdirected direction occasionally. Performances are top-notch throughout. \n\nUneven pacing and unrelatable protagonist didn't work for me, but features an excellent performance by Paul Newman.",

Everything that happens before the trial begins is incredibly tasteless and uninteresting, and everything is showed in such an expository way, which makes it a chore to watch. None of the characters are likable, nevertheless all portrayed beautifully. The pacing is really off, it starts incredibly slow with some good moments, then it suddenly picks up in pace, drops in pace for like 15 minutes then picks up again, that makes it difficult to watch too. Also in the courtroom scenes, usually filled with great new characters that are put on the stand, surprising twists, intense argumentation, and exciting new info being uncovered. ---- The Verdict has none of those, it does have a beautiful monologue, that however felt completely out of place and meaningless because of it. On top of that when in the end the trial is obviously won (It's still a movie, that's obviously what will happen in any type of courtroom movie) you, as the audience, feel no compassion for the leading man, you dont feel happy for him, you dont feel happy/uplifted yourself, nor do you feel proud or empowered, like you usually do after a fantastic courtroom drama, take Sidney Lumet's other work, 12 angry men, for instance.\n\nAll in all The Verdict is a masterfully crafted piece of cinema (hence the 3.5 stars) but does lack emotional depth to keep the movie afloat.",

            "content": "Simply put, The Verdict features the finest work in the long, impressive career of Paul Newman. What he accomplishes in Sidney Lumet's 1982 courtroom drama is stunning. He plays a lawyer who carries a massive chip on his shoulder, and the results of the case he undertakes will determine whether or not he can pull himself out of the alcohol-filled abyss he finds himself in. He's not the most charismatic man-not by a long shot. But we really want him to succeed, to salvage himself, and to give his clients the justice they deserve.\n\nThe case Frank Galvin (Newman) accepts is a tricky one, though it doesn't have to be. A Boston woman turns into a vegetable after an oversight in the operating room. Her family thinks the Catholic hospital and the doctors on duty should be held responsible, and the hospital itself recognizes its error, offering a big check to keep the case out of court. But Frank can't accept. Not only does he think the plaintiffs deserve more, but he needs to renew his faith in the legal system and himself. After rejecting the offer, however, Frank begins to think he's made a big mistake. The woman's family is furious with him, the opposing attorney (James Mason) is a shark, and his colleague (Jack Warden) doubts Frank's instincts and doesn't think he can stay sober long enough to get through the trial.\n\nWhile there's no denying that Newman is the main attraction here, the film has a lot of other things going for it. Sidney Lumet's direction is as assured as ever. The pacing is deliberately slow, which takes it out the thriller category so many legal films fall into. Another thing I noticed is that there's virtually no non-diegetic sound, which I thought really helped me stay involved in the plot and the characters. It's a risky choice because music does a lot of the heavy emotional lifting for many films, but The Verdict loses nothing without it. In fact, leaving it out probably makes the film better.\n\nI've spoken to Newman's brilliance already, but seriously, the guy conveys more emotion and meaning with a simple glance than most actors can in an entire movie. Really take in the scene in which he visits his comatose client in the hospital and decides to take the case to trial. Not a word is spoken-all you hear is the rhythmic sound of a breathing machine-yet it's at that moment that our lead character makes a life-altering choice, and we totally believe it.\n\nI definitely wouldn't say Newman's work is matched by that of his supporting cast, but there are many good performances to be found in the film. Charlotte Rampling plays Laura Fischer, Frank's new girlfriend who helps him through his pre-trial lows. Her subplot felt a little underdeveloped for a while, but late in the film, she breaks out. The film's other attorneys, played by Mason and Warden, are also quite good. Mason has a juicier role as a truly conniving lawyer. Warden is strong as another of Frank's rocks, helping him stay strong when his past history would dictate another relapse.\n\nAnother aspect of The Verdict I enjoyed was the way it made you think about the legal system. It's neither pro-lawyer nor anti-lawyer, though it points out a number of positives and negatives. Several characters derogatorily refer to Frank and his colleagues as \"you people,\" saying that all lawyers are the same and that they have no problem gambling with people's livelihoods in order to make more money. It's a fair point, but we understand where Frank is coming from, also. He wants to do the right thing, and part of the reason he's so depressed and dependent on his alcohol is that he's lost a little faith in his profession.\n\nThere's virtually nothing wrong with this film. If I had any complaints it's that it doesn't really do anything out of the ordinary, but it's so well-directed and well-written that it's easy to forgive its familiarity. And Newman's performance is just incredible. If you ever need a reminder of why he's a legend, look no further than The Verdict.\n\nhttp://www.johnlikesmovies.com/verdict-review/",

Paul Newman is amazing as a washed up lawyer who has been completely disenchanted by the law. They do a nice job of slowly developing his character throughout the film, and showing us why he is so frustrated with life. This setup also makes it even more affecting when we see shades of his past experiences threatening to make this new case just as miserable, particularly because he starts to care about his client more than he had cared about any case in years. I was getting annoyed by the seemingly tacked on and unnecessary romantic relationship, but they cleverly tie that in to the story so my complaint went away. Towards the end I found the proceedings in court became a little far-fetched, but if you're willing to buy the legal logic of the movies and can put your critical brain on hold it still works (although I imagine real lawyers are somewhat perturbed by what they see in this movie.) I think where the movie was the weakest was in the final resolution. They never have that celebratory moment you expect in a courtroom drama when the case is won and people rejoice because justice has been served. Instead they decide to scale things back and make the conclusion more character-focused instead of giving us that cathartic moment of joy. It's a small complaint, but I think I just prefer court films that keep the law as their centerpiece more than the lawyers. But the performances were good enough in The Verdict that I enjoyed it anyways.",

Both movies have a message about the importance of the jury and how it can make or break the legal system. The only character I didn't like was his girlfriend, and not just because of the plot twist. Her acting was very cold and flat, and the one emotional scene she has just doesn't work. The inclusion of music in that scene makes the drama seem forced. I mean, during the emotional scene she says to the guy, who's a nervous wreck at this point, \"I can't invest in failure, Frank, anymore.\" Who talks like that? Anyway, she didn't spoil the movie at all. \n\nThe story here is really great. The opening scene sets the tone for the rest of the film. It alternates suddenly from the noisy pinball machine to Newman sipping on a beer and having a cigarette in silence and very casual. The rest of the movie is like that. The story and Paul Newman's character shifts suddenly from anxious to calm to anxious again. One second he's in a panic, next second he's sitting in the dark with his head between his legs. The mood is consistent, though. And the ending is great. Everything comes full-circle. Newman got himself in this mess by making a decision on a whim; when he turned down the money and decided to go to trial, and his optimism is replaced with regret and dread in the very next scene. At the end of the movie things go from dark to sunny just as quick, and then it's over and it leaves you speechless. It's amazing how those in the legal system have so much power and they can enact it so readily. That further drives home the point that justice belongs in the hands of the jury. \n\nThe very last scene with the telephone is the cherry on top. It really shows how much stronger and more confident he is after all he's been through. A drastic change from the Newman we were introduced to at the start of the film.",

Along the way, he has to deal with what can best be described as \"Murphy's Law: the movie.\"\n\nThis isn't the best performance by Paul Newman. His voice is a little too raspy for too many stretches of the film, but there are moments where he does deliver, mainly in the trial scenes, which don't start until the movie is halfway over.\n\nNewman's opponent, described as \"the Prince of Darkness\", is played by James Mason, who gives the film's best performance. Despite his grandfatherly appearance, Mason does indeed live up to the nickname the film bestows upon him.\n\nNow we get to the film's problems. First, Lumet's directing is a tad off. There are a few awkward edits and scene transitions that are a tad too jarring. Most of the film is shot in a rather dull, lifeless way. The camera doesn't move a whole lot.\n\nHowever, the film's biggest problem comes from the title of the film itself: the Verdict. The verdict is supposed to play off as a surprise, but the problem is that nothing in the film leads to a plausible way for the surprise to work. There is not one point during the trial where one can go \"Newman's got a chance to win this.\" If we're supposed to believe Newman's big, Oscary speech was enough to sway the jury, then that just isn't good enough. There needed to be a little more going in Newman's favor.",

It still stands up today as a powerful drama. Set in Boston, lawyer Frank Galvin (Paul Newman) was once a top graduate of Boston College Law School and worked for a top legal firm in Boston. Now, he's down on his luck, an alcoholic and is what you'd call an ambulance chaser. His former colleague and old friend Mickey (Jack Warden) gives him a medical malpractice case out of sympathy. It seems like an open and shut case, with a quick settlement expected and a source of income for Galvin. But the more Galvin looks into it, he unearths a web of lies and skulduggery with a woman in a coma. He's put up against the hospital's top lawyer  Ed Concannon (James Mason) as well. It's very well made with good dialogue and some familiar faces in the cast including Charlotte Rampling and Milo O'Shea, but Newman gives an assured and world weary performance as the has-been lawyer. It was tipped as a top Oscar contender, but it was put up against Gandhi (1982). Oh, well...",

            "content": "If there ever was such a thing as the prime movie star, his name would be Paul Newman.  It's extraordinarily rare to have an actor as handsome, talented, and timely as Newman, and The Verdict is set in stone as proof as to why his name alone has been immortalized in the same way as Elizabeth Taylor or Orson Welles.  But unlike the latter two, Newman didn't have a certain set of \"years\" where he was at his prime - for certain, Taylor was a fixture of the '50s and '60s, only retaining interest later on through her personal life rather than her acting abilities, with Welles keeping his name intact only through a handful of films, sporadically placed, however extraordinary.\n          What Newman did that was so different from every star of his day was that there was never a time where he wasn't appealing, where he wasn't able to capture audiences of differing decades.  47 in The Verdict, Newman serves as a compelling basis for what eventually proves to be a character study, a role that he was born to play.  As Frank Galvin, we are forced to examine what lies beyond his magnetic blue eyes and delve deeper into his inner psyche, a task that proves to be much harder than we originally think.  \n          Galvin was once a successful lawyer, but when he got a divorce, he turned to booze to drown his sorrows - graying and embittered, Galvin has no clients or prospects to push his life forward; until a middle-classed woman walks in with a perfectly good case: her sister was given the wrong anesthetic during birth, and as a result, has lost the baby and is dependent on life support.  The few people in his life remind him that he has a huge chance towards winning, but the case isn't necessarily the problem.  Galvin's problem is that he has not represented anyone for years, and his alcoholism has made any task more difficult to do when sober.\n          The title of the film may be The Verdict, but it's not infatuated with the courtroom, as it might suggest.  It would rather spend time with Galvin alone, in his office, with his best friend (the always dependable Jack Warden), or with his love interest (Charlotte Rampling, who carries an enigma that pulls us towards her).  As Galvin attempts to piece his life back together while having an explosive case on his mind is highly riveting, with a naturalness that could only be carried by a director like Sidney Lumet, who makes sure each moment is compiled together properly instead of speeding things up to get to the climax in time.\n          But The Verdict is a showcase for Newman, plain and simply - it's an understated performance, and his restraint is what makes Galvin such an excellent character.  He goes from living as a man who could care less, one that could be insulted and be much too tired to even blink an eyelash, to one who begins to realize that what he does for a living makes him more vital than he could ever imagine.  \n          The ambiguous ending, however, causes us to question whether or not he has turned over a new leaf and become the comeback kid, leaving his troubles in his wake, or if he once again has been let down just enough to send him spiraling down again.  In the closing scene alone, Newman is astonishingly able to combine every angel and demon Galvin retains without saying a word. \n          The Verdict is a film that is even better when it has no words to speak with - it's one that is perfectly comfortable with studying a person instead of only allowing us to judge them through their actions.  And frankly, you cannot ask for a better assortment of characters to breathe through.",

Needless to say it is a lopsided trial, Frank and his aid-cum-mentor Mickey (Warden), whose plaintiff is a woman in a vegetative state, versus two cocky defendants (both well-respected doctors) and their stellar defense team, led by a top-notch attorney Ed Concannon (Mason). \n\nApart from his omni-competent opponent, Frank has to endured\b\b a worst-case scenario during his rushed preparation for the trial, the disappearance of a key witness, an uncooperative insider, a maledictory judge (O'Shea), a questionable deponent (Seneca), a hostile client (the plaintiff's brother in law) who takes umbrage at Frank's arbitrary turndown of a handsome settlement from the defendant for their medical negligence. And it is a miracle he could still squeeze some time to have a fling with a mysterious divorc\u00e9e Laura (Rampling). \n\nThings will nonetheless turns to a rosy side for Frank, as his trials and tribulations will eventually pay off, which doesn't prevent one from sensing frustration to witness all the paddings before a bleak light of hope comes to the rescue, a dogged Frank fortuitously grabs a clue lead to a game-changer in the accident, but meanwhile an unexpected betrayal is the last blow to complicate the case. And the ending with an prolonged and irritating ringing of the telephone, does certify a stark love-or-hate stance for its audiences.  \n\nHowever, Newman is impeccable here, he is a pampered child living in an adult's body, strives for his last chance to revive his life, a salvation of his ill-fated past, during the taxing process, he also begins to examine himself, to overcome his weakness (a terrific rendition of a panic attack) and reflect his goodness from the pestilent barriers around him and around us too, one long-take of him making a phone call with his adversary manifests Newman's top-tier stretch in bringing authentic force of emerging into his character. \n\nPreciously, the film is not an outward feel-good film, Rampling's stern-cum-icy presence and Laura's underdeveloped storyline mars the narrative but at the same time mirrors Frank's own rite-of-passage, so we might not feel much relieved when at the end of the day he won the case, it intrigues us more after the victory, what is next for Frank? \n\nJames Mason is Oscar-nominated along with Newman and the film in toto seized five nominations (including BEST PICTURE and DIRECTOR), his malevolent silver-tongue and smug sanctimony is spot-on, a paradigm of the miasma of our legal system. But Warden in my opinion is also Oscar-worthy, restrained yet faithfully being a helping hand and a firm buttress for both Frank and the spectators!",

Newman is magnificent in this film and undergoes an amazing transformation of spirit as his confidence and vigour return to his character.

As a foil to this downtrodden atmosphere, we get the ever-wonderful James Mason as the high powered defence attorney. Slick, powerful and confident his character is as far removed from Newman as it is possible to be. The clash between the two is more akin to a game of chess than a battle and it feels all the more powerful for that. Thrown into the mix we have the icy, mysterious Charlotte Rampling, playing one of her characteristically dark roles, the dependable, raincoat inhabiting Jack Warden and the slime covered Milo O'Shea.

It's billed as a legal thriller, but it's really more of a character drama about the lawyer himself, and the actual case is incidental to the lawyer's quest to redeem himself from his descent into alcoholic, ambulance-chasing desuetude. Paul Newman's performance is excellent, though it quite deliberately lacks the sort of scruffy charm of many of his earlier performances. Charlotte Rampling is severe as the woman the lawyer unwisely falls in love with, and James Mason's particular brand of genteel disdain makes for an opposing counsel you don't mind rooting against, even though he's not a total mustache-twirling villain. The movie was written by David Mamet, but very early on in his career, before he had perfected his signature style. It was directed by the underrated Sidney Lumet, and while it's not one of his best movies on the level of Network or 12 Angry Men, it's still a solid testament to Lumet's skill with serious and potentially dry subject matter. If it isn't the most rousing of courtroom movies, the downbeat ending does feel very realistic and appropriately unsentimental.",

            "content": "Frank Galvin (Paul Newman), a once-promising trial lawyer for an elite Boston law firm, is near the end of his career.  And he's on a losing streak that would make Lionel Hutz blush.  He's lost four cases in a row over the last three years and he's afraid that he would end his legal career on such a down note.  Frank Galvin was once a partner at a prestigious law firm, but was forced to resign from the firm after allegations of jury tampering surfaced.  Somehow he was never disciplined by the bar association let alone indicted for that serious crime (It turns out he was, \"Accused.  Not indicted.\"), but Galvin's career quickly took a downturn...\n\nFrank Galvin has been working as a solo practitioner for the past several years, desperate to take any cases that come his way.  He's described as an ambulance chaser, somebody who cares not about the people except for their wallets.  To really demonstrate how low Galvin has sunk, we see him attending funerals, pretending to be a \"friend\" of the decedent.  He then passes out cards to the mourners at the funeral.  He's obviously only interested in drumming up business for himself and is unaware of his insensitive actions.  Yeah, sounds like desperation to me.  Lawyers sometimes have a reputation for a lack of scruples and Frank Galvin doesn't do much to shatter that stereotype.  With his career in the doldrums, Galvin spends much of his time hanging out at the bar, playing a pinball machine, and drinking booze in order for the time to pass by quickly...\n\nGalvin operates from a dingy office and he's barely making ends meet.  He's struggling to afford paying his office rent for crying out loud!  Frank's only real friend is his former partner and mentor, Mickey (Jack Warden) who sees how much Frank has hit rock bottom after seeing him passed out drunk on his office's couch. \n\nMickey tells Galvin that he has worked hard to secure him a great case, a potential moneymaker.  However, it's been about eighteen months since Galvin was supposed to be working on this case and Galvin hasn't done so much as even meet with his client.  And Galvin has court in just ten days.   \n\nGalvin meets with Sally Doneghy (Roxanne Hart), the sister of his client, Deborah Ann Kaye.  It turns out that Deborah is suffering from brain damage and is currently in a coma.  What happened was that Deborah went to the St. Catherine Laboure Hospital in Boston to deliver her third child.  However, she was allegedly given the wrong anesthetic by the doctors and now is fighting for her life.  She is barely kept alive as she is breathing through tubes connected to a medical ventilator...\n  \nGalvin hasn't exactly been putting forth a lot of effort on this case.  He just wants a quick settlement and boom, it's over.  Get it done and over with and earn a nice windfall in the process.  But when he actually sees the comatose woman and the vegetative state she is in, Galvin experiences a powerful epiphany.   \n\nFor Galvin, this is a big time medical malpractice case with significant ramifications.  It turns out the St. Catherine Laboure Hospital is owned and operated by the Archdiocese of Boston.  And the Bishop of the Archdiocese has set up a meeting with Frank Galvin in an attempt to resolve this case expeditiously and amicably, which could be beneficial for both sides.  \n\nAt the meeting, the Bishop offers Galvin a handsome settlement in the amount of $200,000 if he agrees not to pursue the case any further.  But going against the wishes of his client's family, Galvin, being the maverick that he is, rejects the settlement offer.   Galvin has always been scared to go to court and try cases.  But he decides to put everything on the line and take this case to trial.  This case has become personal for Galvin.  Because Galvin learns that it's not about money, it's about principle and doing the right thing.  Maybe he will emerge victorious.  Maybe he will find what he's capable of doing.    \n\nThe Archdiocese however has some considerable legal firepower of its own.  The defense attorney representing the Archdiocese in this matter is Ed Concannon (James Mason), who is described by Mickey as the \"Prince of Fuckin' Darkness.\"  He has all the financial resources and manpower of a major law firm behind him.  Concannon is also not above using below-the-belt legal tactics like bribing witnesses.    And the judge presiding over this trial is Judge Hoyle (Milo O'Shea), who during a pretrial conference in chambers, not very subtly encourages Galvin to take the settlement offer and run.  For whatever reason, Judge Hoyle isn't particularly enamored with Galvin and will do what he can to make the trial an unpleasant experience for Galvin  And a lot of things which could go wrong for Galvin before trial, do.  \n  \nGalvin's only semblance of a love life is Laura (Charlotte Rampling), whom he sees regularly at the local bar.  The two meet and strike a conversation, and soon enough, the two develop a close relationship.  Like Galvin, Laura is herself divorced, only her ex-husband is a lawyer.  She is also one of the few who believes in what Galvin is doing and his righteous cause.    \n\nGalvin must go up against the might and power of the Archdiocese.  Maybe then, can Galvin earn the self-respect that has for so long eluded him.  Could Frank Galvin finally live up to his full potential as a trial attorney?   \n\nThe Verdict is one of the finest courtroom dramas I have ever seen.  On one hand, it's a classic David vs. Goliath story about one man going up against a powerful institution.  And that man can really earn a name for himself if he slays Goliath.  On the other hand, it's about this lawyer standing up for justice as a way of redeeming himself after years of floundering and hard drinking.  It's really a powerful tale about a broken-spirited trial lawyer on a personal path to redemption.  \n\nThe Verdict is one of my favorite movies.  It's real.  It's honest.  It doesn't glamorize the legal profession or put lawyers on a pedestal.  It shows the day-to-day struggles of a lawyer trying to stay afloat, barely making a living.  It shows some of the desperation tactics lawyers do to try to make business or at least keep their names out there.  If anything, this movie may scare people off from wanting to go to law school and become lawyers.  For those who had fantasies about lawyers making big bucks and driving the latest brand name cars, this movie will demolish those illusions.  \n  \nIn addition to being a superb legal drama, The Verdict also examines many interesting concepts of jurisprudence.  Often times, there are competing interests between lawyers and the courts.  The courts are interested in moving the case along smoothly and quickly while lawyers have a responsibility to zealously represent and advocate for their clients.  There are also the popular themes of integrity and morality and how they intermingle in the judicial system.  Integrity to the courts means that cases move through litigation without any hiccups.  Some worry that the integrity of the judicial system can often be compromised by human emotions.  These emotions can cause people to go against the established rule of law.  \n\nSo what happens when an attorney feels that opposing counsel or even the judge himself is not playing fair?  Here, Galvin is driven by a sense of morality, to stand up against the bullies of not just the Archdiocese, but even the court system.  But both the Archdiocese and even the judiciary have tried to make a mockery of Galvin.  That Galvin is a fool for wasting the court's time taking this to trial.  Taking frivolous cases like this to trial compromises the integrity of the judicial system.  The pressure to \"cave in\" whether it is having a criminal defendant cop a guilty plea or pushing a plaintiff to settle a civil action case in order to maintain the integrity of this judicial system is one of the challenges that lawyers face, particularly if the lawyer is perceived as an \"outsider\" or has a seemingly unwinnable case.  But our emotions and our morals make these lawyers feel that some cases no matter how tough they seem are worth taking the opposing counsel (and the court) to task.   Here, Galvin's sense of right and wrong prevents him from toeing the line.  Ultimately, his personal feelings about this case have allowed him to make the right judgment call.  \n      \nOne of the more difficult challenges of being a trial attorney is not letting those same personal feelings get in the way of your professionalism.  All of the above means nothing if an attorney cannot at least act as a professional.  Sometimes, you feel very strongly about a case, but your personal life shouldn't mingle with your client's.  An attorney can be passionate about a case, stand firm in their position, and try to deliver justice, but an attorney is also bound by the rules of courtroom decorum.  An attorney has to look credible in court for the sake of public perception.  Of course all this can be cumbersome when it seems like your adversary is not playing by the rules, which is what Frank Galvin experiences the hard way.  You see Galvin biting his lip for too long and then lashing out at what he perceives as unfair treatment towards him and his client.  In short: you can be outraged at the system, but look professional showing your indignation.  While The Verdict explores what integrity means in the court system, there is also the issue of personal integrity.  An attorney must have that personal integrity in order to maintain their trust with their clients.  Frank Galvin makes the mistake of letting it slip and almost losing it completely which nearly costs him.    \n   \nAs lawyers, we are not just representing individuals; sometimes we are representing causes as advocates of justice.  We take on controversial cases because we want to make a difference, maybe even enact social change.  That's one of the more fascinating facets of Frank Galvin and plays an integral part of his character arc.  In the beginning, Galvin was simply worried about keeping his head above water.  But as he becomes more involved with the case against the Archdiocese, Galvin finds his personality changing into a more hard-charging lawyer that he was born to be.  All it takes is one look at the comatose woman and the condition she is in to galvanize him into action.  \n\nAnybody who has been a practicing trial attorney can appreciate this movie and can relate to Frank Galvin's experiences.  Galvin goes through the stress of potentially losing a big case.  It's not just money that's at stake; it's his name and reputation.   Because the latter two are often times the only things you have as an attorney.  I like how Frank Galvin is sometimes shown as being unprepared and overwhelmed, at times stumbling through his performance.  He makes mistakes, embarrasses himself in front of the judge, and even has the judge berate him in open court.   Of course, Judge Hoyle himself doesn't make it easy for Galvin.  There's this one great scene where the judge is constantly interfering with Galvin during his direct examination of his expert witness.   The judge decides to butt in and question the witness himself, flustering Galvin.  It really shows the uneasy tension between the plaintiff's lawyer and the judge.  The judge's job is to be a referee and not a participant and one can see how he has crossed that line, much to Galvin's frustration.     \n\nThe Verdict does a good job of capturing the adversarial nature of the courtroom and how some of the acrimony goes beyond what is said on the record.  Galvin navigates the labyrinth of the court system facing many obstacles.  His dogged persistence is what keeps him going.  Standing in his way is Concannon, who is always well prepared for battle and is highly intelligent.  Not to mention he probably has most of the judiciary on his side thanks to his hobnobbing.  Concannon knows how to shred witnesses on the stand and destroy their credibility right in front of a jury.  He can find the weaknesses of any case and penetrate them.      \n\nFor a hero to truly triumph, he must defeat a powerful villain.  Superman has his Lex Luthor, Batman has his Joker, and Galvin has his Concannon.  Concannon makes for a terrific bad guy, whether he is attacking the credibility of witnesses on the stand or making snarky remarks about Galvin's legal abilities or the validity of his case.  The two make for a fun match up.        \n\nOne of the most crucial aspects of being a trial lawyer is preparing your witnesses.  But if you can find your witnesses and get them to cooperate with you, you've won half the battle.  Here, Frank Galvin has a hell of a time just locating witnesses.  Even when the witnesses do show, getting them to cooperate is a whole another story.  And one very critical witness just disappears on Frank like that. \n\nOne improper thing Frank Galvin did from an ethical standpoint was failing to consult with the client's family before turning down the settlement offer.  The family finds out about this and is furious at Galvin for having rejected the settlement offer without consulting them at first.  In real life, it is actually not the lawyer's decision whether to accept or reject an offer.  It is the client's decision as to where he wants to go with the case; the attorney merely dictates the strategy.   The attorney has to respect their client's decision and if the client wants to resolve or settle, the attorney must listen to them.  \n\nMost lawyers you see in the movies dress impeccably and drive luxury cars.  Frank Galvin dresses in a way that I don't even want to know where he purchased his clothes from.  Maybe he obtained them as a donation from the local Salvation Army.  \n\nI won't spoil the details here, but Frank Galvin's summation is one of the best I have seen in any legal drama.  You can see Galvin pouring his heart and soul into this case, and Galvin tells the jury how much this case means to him, not just on an individual level, but on a much greater, public policy scale.  Because it is not just one person's life at stake, it's the entire justice system.  How a jury renders its verdict will impact justice on a macro level.  It will impact which laws are seen as valid, and which laws are antiquated.  It will impact what laws politicians will advance and which laws they will fight against.  The politicians, from the local representatives to people working in the state and nation's capital, help write the bills and pass the law.  The authorities regulate and enforce the law.  But it's the people who have the final say as to which laws are fair and just.  \n\nPaul Newman nails it as Frank Galvin.  His performance is perfection.  It is because of Newman's craftsmanship that Frank Galvin is a cogent and well-developed character.  The Academy Awards screwed up here.  Paul Newman really deserved the Oscar win for his superlative performance in this movie.  Although Paul Newman is ably supported by an excellent cast, Newman really shines in the spotlight.\n\nThere is hardly any action in this movie.  It is all dialogue.  And if anything, The Verdict feels like a stage play.  But the script by David Mamet is so well-written that the time passes by rather quickly.  And the performances are top notch.  Yes, Paul Newman carries the bulk of the weight, but the supporting cast is fantastic and Newman interacts very well with the actors.  Jack Warden does a great job as Galvin's mentor who is looking out for his well-being.  Warden's character is very sympathetic to Galvin, but sometimes he has to put his foot down, or rather, put his foot up Galvin's arse.  I enjoyed James Mason as the cocky, sleazy defense lawyer battling wits with Newman's underdog hero.  Mason really makes his character out to be a snake and he seems to takes pleasure in doing that.  Milo O'Shea gives a solid performance as a judge on a power trip.  Charlotte Rampling adds a layer of stern compassion in her role as Frank's love interest, Laura, who serves as Frank's social contact with the outside world.     \n  \nFrom a technical standpoint, the film looks great.  Director Sidney Lumet makes sure that the actors know what they are doing, but otherwise doesn't interfere.  He allows the actors to be themselves and deliver great performances.  But it's not just the dialogue; it's also the quiet moments that count.  Like the scene in the beginning where Galvin is staring at the local newspaper, checking the obituaries while having an alcoholic beverage.  Or when Galvin is about to take a third Polaroid picture of the comatose patient but then stops himself.  He observes the woman for several seconds, not saying a word, but his eyes speak for themselves.  We then get a view of the two other Polaroid photos with the images of the comatose patient gradually coming into focus.  There is no music, no dialogue, just the constant sound of the breathing through the tubes and the ventilator machine pumping oxygen to keep her alive.  You can see how much this has affected Galvin.  As the photo images become more visible and the colors more distinct, it really drives home to Galvin the importance of what he is doing.  It's one of the most poignant scenes in this movie and is really pivotal to how Galvin sees this case.  He no longer sees dollar signs; he sees how much somebody's misfeasance has really destroyed another's life.  Overall, Lumet's direction helps to effectively convey the struggles Galvin is going through, whether self-inflicted or external circumstances.  \n\nThe one-two potent punch of Sidney Lumet's taut direction and David Mamet's sharp screenplay make The Verdict an exceptional film.  What I really like about this film is the realism and believability of the characters and the situations they are in.  The film strips away all the pretenses and shows what being a lawyer all is about.  It's a hell of a lot of work and the compensation isn't always great.    \n\nWhen one of Hollywood's most talented actors teams up with one of Hollywood's most renowned directors as well a highly respected writer, this is the masterpiece that results from their creative hard work.  The Verdict is required viewing for anybody who enjoys courtroom dramas, character studies, or inspirational stories which will have you rooting for the underdog.   Or for anybody who wants to see a screen legend at the top of his game, period.  It's a film worthy of the recognition it deserves.  The Verdict will keep your riveted throughout from the beginning until the jury's final verdict is rendered and afterward.",

The first half is essentially a character study and focuses on Galvin's desperate attempts to maintain his sanity and rehabilitate his already-crumbled reputation bolstered by Newman's trademark ability to make us warm to the character even though we are supposed to largely unsympathize with him for all his carelessness. As the film progresses into the trial, Galvin continues to warm to us and thoguh the case progressively looks unwinnable, in spite of Galvin's lucklessness, it is a trial that is not over until the verdict is revealed. This is not just a great film because of Lumet's direction or the Oscar-nominated performances of Newman and James Mason as the opposing lawyer, but also because of the various twists that occur throughout to the point that it is virtually impossible to guess what the outcome of the trial, so by the end of the film, what could have started as just an ordinary courtroom drama clearly becomes something special. Gandhi took home the Best Picture Oscar of 1982, but in my opinion, this should have been the clear winner.",

The man himself doesn't do too much wrong giving one of his better performances as a lawyer on his way spiraling down clinging on to the one case that drains his moral conscience. \r\n\r\nFrank Galvin (Paul Newman) a lawyer on the verge of financial and career crisis latches on to a case of medical malpractice against a prestigious hospital and rejects an offer for settlement though he doesn't have enough firepower to go for a trial against the will of the kin to the victim. He befriends Laura (Charlotte Rampling) who is budding a budding legal counselor and finds some hard truths. \r\n\r\nPaul Newman portrays a man in depression who sees no way up from the position he is in but wants to stick by some ideology he never followed through his career. So the basic character structure is quite inconsistent which is why I couldn't relate to it in the first place. Sidney Lumet is a master of screenplay with his superior '12 Angry Men' and 'Dog Day Afternoon', but never really gets going here with uneven pacing and misdirected direction occasionally. Performances are top-notch throughout.\r\n\r\nUneven pacing and unrelatable protagonist didn't work for me, but features an excellent performance by Paul Newman.",

Screenwriter David Mamet gives us a smart script filled with terrific characters are moments of brilliance that greatly elevate what could have been a very pedestrian story. Mamet uses the twists and turns that are his trademark but still manages to keep the movie grounded in reality. \r\n\r\nCourtroom dramas are a Hollywood favorite, but this one avoids all of the typical Hollywood trappings. Masterful director Sydney Lumet keeps the movie personal, and that's what keeps you watching. It's not so much about the huge court case as it is the personal struggle within its lead character, beautifully played by the incomparable Paul Newman. The film earned the veteran actor his sixth Academy Award nomination for his fearless, gutsy performance. He forgoes the good looks that helped make him a star to play a real person with real problems that you can see etched all over his face. Newman says more with his eyes and his body language than he does with his words in this picture.\r\n\r\nYou know the character's story without him ever having to open his mouth, and despite all of his faults you get behind the guy. You want to see him come out on top. Lumet could teach a lot of young directors something about the simple thrill of good storytelling. \"The Verdict\" is a powerful and moving film full of human drama as well as great performances and sharp writing. This is easily one of the best films of the year 1982.",

Galvin is all set to take the settlement, but something inside of him is now thinking twice, and he realizes that he will not take the easy money. This is his one and last chance to remember what it is like to be a lawyer, and decides to move forward and go to trial against insurmountable odds. As the details of the case emerge during the trial, the once quick buy-out/make it go away case now becomes a matter of exposing criminal behavior, negligence, and injustice. Newman's performance is spectacular as a man struggling, and then pulling himself together after hitting rock bottom, and finding his way again.

It stars Paul Newman as a down on his luck lawyer who lands a medical malpractice case against a catholic hospital. Where he would ordinarily settle the case, take the money and run he has a moment of clarity and rejects the offer, opting to take the case to trial. He has little in his favour and works against the odds to fight for justice. It's pretty contrived stuff really and the film's saving grace is the performances. All players are really solid. It's a shame that it's a boring case with scarcely any excitement. While I prefer courtroom films to be believable, I still need a certain element of thrill to keep me invested in the story. I just didn't care for this case at all. In fact each time I have watched The Verdict I find myself distracted by the trivial crap going on around it... like, how many times people butt their cigarettes out on the floor without picking them up and trying to spot Bruce Willis and Tobin Bell at the back of the courtroom.

It benefits from note perfect supporting perfomances from film icon James Mason, the teddy bear like,  truthful presence of the great Jack Warden, sleazy Irish Judge Milo O'Shea, and the mysterious love interest Charlotte Rampling.\n\nThe story is Newman, by fluke, getting a medical malpractice suit against a powerful law firm acting for the Catholic diocese who run the hospital where a healthy young woman is turned into a vegetable by negligent high profile doctors.  James Mason exudes power and smugness as the senior partner with his usual subtlety.  Newman is given the case by his colleage Jack Warden who has had enough of his friend's alcoholic negligence and wants to be done with him.  Charlotte Rampling is a stunning, almost ghost like presence who offer's Frank one last chance at love in his late years.  \n\nThe dreary color palette and gothic (Boston and New York pretending to be Boston) locations add to the melacholic atmosphere of broken down, end of his rope ambulance chasing lawyer Frank Galvin (Newman).   Music is minimal and close ups are used very sparingly.  \n\nGalvin's need for redemption is so palpable that any human heart watching this gut wrenching performance is made to care deeply that he succeeds.  Somehow, this 'need for redemption' trope, normally  a hackneyed cliche, which fails in so many similar movies of the recent era is as perfectly executed here, due to Mamet's economical, unsentimental use of words (look for Galvin's haunting jury summation) and Newman's self-effacing, brave emotional nakedness.  \n\nThis film grips for all of its two plus hours, and though it may look a little old fashioned to modern eyes, it is very rewarding viewing.  An almost pefect film.",

            "content": "The Verdict works well enough as an entertaining courtroom drama, but sometimes you want a film to go beyond the conventions of cinema as simple escapism. Sometimes you want it to bury its heals down unto the mud as the story moves along, feeling as though you are being given something more than frosting with no cake. To hell with it. Skip the cake, I want something hardier than that, I want meat and this is only frosting.\n\nI'm supposing that much of the blame, or acclaim (however it is you view the picture), belongs to the director, Sidney Lumet, who, earlier in his career gave us such interesting stories as 12 Angry Men and Dog Day Afternoon. Both films accentuating the character more than the mundane plot devices which were meant by the writers to propel the celluloid at full speed. Both had a sense of justice --  one more orthodox than the other, but justice nonetheless. Here we have another story of justice seen through the eyes of a struggling alcoholic lawyer played for our sympathies by screen legend Paul Newman.\n\nI'm not going to trash on Newman, he's a fine actor, but not in this role. How can I say that when so many laud his performance as a masterful work of artistic brilliance in the face of cinema history. Easy, I just did. Instead of making the character interesting by keeping the guys losing qualities throughout the film, we are immediately handed plot point number one where our lawyer grows a fleshy heart after witnessing the state of his client (a comatose bed-bound vegetable who exists only by the grace of a life support machine). If I wanted to feel all warm hearted inside, I'll watch Sleepless in Seattle. It's as though the director and actors lost balls in the process of making this film and felt as though we had to perform a miracle and turn this guy into a saint if we were ever to get behind him and root him on to victory. When you look at it that way, it's simply a generic sports film in another arena.\n\nThe best character in the film was James Mason's rival lawyer, who appears to my eyes to be less of made up character and more of what you'd naturally expect from a working professional. I don't know about you, but if I'm going to trial for whatever reason, the guy who represents me, I want him to be the biggest, meanest, ugliest guy around and not someone who constantly has his nose buried in an ethics book (I know it's a horrible thing to say, but hey, do you want to win or don't you?).\n\nAs far as writer Mamet is concerned, this may be one of his lesser works, having little in the way of twists which we have come to expect from him, and more of a mainstream effort on his behalf. That being said, I cannot be completely sure as where to blame the author in this story. Mamet's direction is so sharp and quick witted, something sorely missed from Lumet's helming of this ship. I feel as though this might have not been the route which the writer would have taken the film, directotialy. I would like to have seen what he would have done with his own words in the stead of someone else.\n\nSo, when it comes down to it, is The Verdict a bad film? No. It was quite entertaining. But sometimes entertaining just doesn't cut it. Sometimes I want to chew on what I've been served and not simply swallow it down and have it pass through my system. There's a time and a place for desert. But please, not until after dinner.",

When his pal Mickey approaches him with a malpractice case, wherein a woman was suffers brain damage due to being given the wrong anesthetic, he takes it, confident he can win this \"easy\" case. The high-priced lawyers for the defendant, the archdiocese that runs the hospital, attempts to settle out of court with a reasonable sum, but Newman refuses. It then becomes a David vs. Goliath style battle. James Mason is wonderful as the corrupt, high priced, laywer who will do anything to win. Jack Warden as Paul Newman's buddy is wonderfully vulgar and lovable. Charlotte Rampling is stellar as Newman's love interest. But the real star is Paul Newman. He has wonderful performance. It is hard to imagine Paul Newman, with those dashing blue eyes, as unhappy, but watch Newman's expression when he is dealing with an unfair judge, and you will see the face of rage that rivals Al Pacino in the Godfather Part II when he finds out Kay had an abortion. I could also go on about David Mamet's wonderfully executed script and Sidney Lumet's masterful direction, but it speaks for itself. I highly recommend this movie.

I, myself. would take it and run like a thief.\u00a0\nFrank Galvin: I'm sure you would.\u00a0\n\nThe Verdict is one of the best courtroom dramas you'll ever see. It's success is not on one level, but on many. Sidney Lumet was always a great director primarily because his movies never strayed from the path of the lead character. He has extreme focus on Frank Galvin in this film. Frank is an alcoholic lawyer who has only one client. She happens to be a total vegetable. Frank takes the doctors to trial even though he could have received $200,000 plus, not to. Paul Newman is as extraordinary as ever in this role. He gives a powerful and emotional performance and elevates a good movie to greatness.\n\nThe movie is all about the conflicts Frank is facing. He has a case that is going to be tough to win. On top of that, the judge is against him and his star witness is gone. Then there's another conflict that I didn't see coming and I don't feel one should know before watching the film. It seems throughout the whole movie that whenever Frank starts to make some headway something happens that pushes him back. It's his job to pull through and win this case. Not only for himself, but for the family of his client.\n\nUnlike many courtroom films, this always was understandable and more than that, it was always engrossing. Lumet never gets too wrapped up in the ins and outs of the trial process. He always sticks to the conflicts that plague Frank. The movie has tense scenes and but also many somber scenes that succeed because of just how good Newman is. This really is a must watch.",

We are involved with a drunkard-attorney who has nearly hit rock bottom with his practice in shambles, wife divorced, and his reputation as \"an ambulance chaser\" at its apex. The opening pinball sequence (while sipping on a beer) acts as a foundation to a film about playing games and the consequences of losing your discipline. From the red-lettering to the transitioning transitions (soft dissolve to sharp cutting) to the unrelentingly immaculate crane shots and painstaking framing, The Verdict is a technical masterpiece. The denouement delivers audience satisfaction in regard to morals and even our newly reengineered protagonist who has nonchalantly switched from booze to coffee. And the endlessly ringing phone symbolizes the omnipresent force of former vice, which Newman abnegates without breaking a sweat. As the credits roll, a viewer comes to terms that despair is a bitch, esp. when it's self-induced, but it usually takes arduous resilience to reach heights again. But it is so so sweet once you arrive there.",

My biggest criticism of courtroom dramas is that the research process moves slowly and things don't pick up until they are in court.  This film is guilty of that pattern but those slow parts give Newman a chance to really act.  To compliment the successful career of Newman, 2-time Oscar winner Jack Warden is cast as his partner, creating another memorable role.  Finally, Charlotte Rampling was the highlight of the film for me as makes this film about more than what happens in the court room.  The film has a very unexpected twist which adds to the heartless portrayal of the justice system and the trail unfolds with unexpected discord.  I can't rate it as high as \"A Few Good Men\" but \"The Verdict\"s gritty questioning of the fairness of the justice system gives Paul Newman another chance to portray the down-and-out drunk character with excellence once again.",

Most of the time they are reacting to the powerhouse performance by Newman, who really does a great job of showing his character's transition and only bolsters the point that he is one of the greatest actors in the past 50 (or some odd) years. (if not one of the best in all of history) Sidney Lumet finds a way to make every shot interesting and deep and is an actor's director. He is able to make an actor react and display genuine feeling in every shot and is willing to hand over the reigns to an acting great like Newman. Lumet has the ability to give great atmosphere in his shots and does a fantastic job of creating the image of Frank Galvin before and after. Lumet also makes a shot that should be a simple two shot into a masterpiece. So Yeah I'd give it a 5 star.",

In 2011, we all know how the system is broken, and there have been countless movies putting their spin on that. \r\n\r\nIt's pretty gimmicky. A judge that stands up and confronts a witness? Dramatic but highly unlikely. Two great attorneys who move to and fro around the courtroom (which is full by the way for some inexlicable reason), and get in the face of witnesses. Again, very dramatic, but as far as I can tell, not allowed. At least the final witness is disallowed as I fully expected, but how does an attorney like Newman even think it will fly? \r\n\r\nNot knowing all of these movies, maybe this was groundbreaking. Maybe it was the first of its kind. Especially with Grisham churning out several of these, these stories have become mainstream. In that context, The Verdict is pretty ordinary.",
