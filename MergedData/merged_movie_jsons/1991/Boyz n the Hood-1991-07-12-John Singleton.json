            "content": "John Singleton's Boyz n the Hood remains one of the best fictionalized and most poignant summaries of some of America's toughest internal problems - racism, violence, poverty, and drug abuse. This is not a hip-hop film, nor a detached and dehumanized story about \"gang violence\" (the great over-simplified scapegoat of the issues treated in this film), its a story about growing up fatherless or motherless in a war zone with a faceless enemy, where people do not value each other's lives at all and value their own lives only slightly more.Laurence Fishburn leads one of the best casts of the early 1990s, in his memorable portrayal of Furious Styles, a father trying to raise his son (Cuba Gooding Jr) well in an environment where murder and substance abuse are day-to-day realities - South Central L.A. The film follows his son, Tre, and his friends, from the hardships of childhood in an irrelevant educational system and a neighborhood which doesn't allow kids to be kids, through to the realities of making decisions about the value of life and the development of responsibility and hope as young adults.The cast disappears into their characters and brings each one to life in a unique and powerful way. losing the identities of big personalities like Fishburne and Ice Cube is no mean feat. Many of the performances recorded here are award-worthy - Fishburne, Bassett, Chesnutt, Gooding, and Ice Cube are especially memorable. For me personally, this is the film that convinced me that Ice Cube was destined to become a major personality in American cinema. While I had enjoyed some of his music prior to this film, it was here that I was first exposed to his versatility and intelligence as an actor. While some may see some of the film's messages as heavy-handed, and others might have issues with the fact that the film deals with so many of the problems of inner-city life in a very 'in-your-face' almost archetypal manner, I find these criticisms impossible to justify.This is a great film about real issues, sensitively portrayed and thoughtfully examined. Every American who cares about the vast untapped potential of our people ought to take a long, hard look at this one. These are not 'black problems', they are everybody's problems, and their solutions will require everybody's understanding. I could think of far worse places to begin developing that understanding than Boyz n the Hood.",

The power of the film has yet to be matched as most modern interpretations of street life prove to be violent stylizations. While Singleton has taken a couple missteps along the way, this film still stands up rather well by today's standards. The motives and actions appear realistic, especially Doughboy's thirst for revenge. A good film, which not only helped improve Laurence Fishburne's career, but introduced us to Gooding.",

            "review_title": "Incredibly Powerful & Realistic",
            "content": "Set in the Crenshaw neighbourhood of South Central L.A., this hard-hitting drama charts the journey that three black youths make from boyhood to adulthood The challenges they encounter are far greater than those faced by most people because their environment predisposes them to the kinds of dysfunctional relationships, drug dependencies or early violent deaths that are such a normal feature of everyday life as they know it. First-time writer and director John Singleton, whose story is based on his own childhood experiences, posits that the most effective way out of this self-perpetuating cycle of violence, poverty and hopelessness is through better parenting.As a 10-year-old boy, Tre Styles (Desi Arnez Hines 11) is bright, short-tempered and constantly in trouble at school. As his divorced mother feels unable to do anything to change his behaviour, she sends him to live with his father so that he can learn how to become a man and enjoy a better and more successful future. Furious Styles (Laurence Fishburne) is smart, stern and strict and immediately starts mentoring his son in an effort to teach him the importance of education and how to survive in the dangerous neighbourhood in which he also grew up. Seven years later, Tre (now played by Cuba Gooding Jr.) and his friends Doughboy (Ice Cube) and Ricky (Morris Chestnut) are on the brink of adulthood and apparently heading in different directions.Tre is responsible, has a job in a clothes shop and plans to go to college with his steady girlfriend, Brandi (Nia Long). His best friend Ricky has already become a father and lives with his girlfriend and his infant son in his mother's house. His ambition is to become a professional football player and he hopes that the scholarship he's preparing for will be his road to success and provide him with a way out of the 'hood. Doughboy, who's Ricky's half-brother, has regularly been in trouble with the police since his first arrest on a shoplifting charge at the age of ten and now, as an ex-con, has no career prospects, is dealing drugs and is also a member of a local gang.The boys all get on well together but a tragic event soon creates a hunger for revenge and the way in which Tre responds is guaranteed to have enormous implications for his future as well as providing an acid test for how successful his father's mentoring has actually been.None of the boys grew up in a conventional family environment as their fathers were all absent for most of their lives and this put them in grave danger of ending up in gangs. This point is made strongly but their relationships with their mothers were also dysfunctional in different ways with Doughboy losing out the most and as a result, growing up with an inherent disrespect for women.\"Boyz n The Hood\" depicts Crenshaw as a neighbourhood where life is cheap and guns, gangs and drugs are always in evidence, as are the seemingly ever-present police helicopters that contribute so strongly to the place feeling and looking like a war zone. The ways in which this is done on-screen are incredibly powerful and realistic. Equally powerful, however, is the way in which all the characters are so understandably products of their environment and so well represented by a wonderful cast of actors (especially Ice Cube, Cuba Gooding Jr. and Laurence Fishburne) who make them so relatable.The fact that this movie is the work of a 23-year-old first-time director/writer is absolutely extraordinary and a great achievement by anyone's standards.",

            "content": "A movie that takes place in South Central Los Angeles in 1991. I don't know about now but, at that time, that area was crime ridden with drug deals and murders happening almost daily. Father Jason Styles (Larry Fishburne) tries to bring up his son Tre (Cuba Gooding Jr.) correctly despite all the violence around them. It also deals with two friends of Tre--Darin (Ice Cube) an angry young black man and his brother Ricky (Morris Chestnut) who wants to go to college. It all leads up to a truly harrowing ending.Director John Singleton's first movie is incredibly powerful and still his best movie (so far). From what I've heard he captured exactly what it was like to grow up in that area. It's a little dated though--the guy sucking on the pacifier confuses some people but that was a big fad back in 1991. It's just unbelievable that kids grew up in an area like that and survived. The story itself is a little too simplistic (the good and bad brothers) and it's basically just the story of a teenager coming of age--but it still works. Singleton wisely doesn't accuse anyone of how the situation is and offers no solutions. He just presents it in a matter of fact way which makes this all the more powerful.The acting is just great. Fishburne and Gooding play a father and son perfectly. Fishburne is just incredible--Gooding falters a few times (and it's obvious that he's no teenager) but he's still very good. Ice Cube is a little one note in his character (always angry and sullen) but it fits. Chestnut is just great.People should be warned--there's tons of profanity (but that is how kids talk) and the ending gets very bloody and disturbing. I still remember people crying out loud in the audience back in 1991. A powerful film and well worth seeing.",

We probably all have to agree that \"Boyz n the Hood\" was basically the first \"growing up in the ghetto\" movie, showing how these African-American youths are surrounded by violence during their childhoods - some perpetrated by the cops, some is their own doing - but they all have to find a way to keep going. If the movie has any problem, it's that it opened the flood gates to a series of similar inferior movies (but also the hilarious satire \"Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood\").Anyway, this is the one that I recommend. Cuba Gooding Jr. made a very good debut. Also starring Laurence Fishburne, Ice Cube, Morris Chestnut, Nia Long and Angela Bassett.",

When Tre is suspended for three days at school, Reva decides to send him to live in Crenshaw with his father, the businessman Furious Styles (Larry Fishburne), \"to become a man\". Tre befriends his neighbors, the half-brothers Doughboy and Ricky Baker, and soon they become best friends. Seven years later, Tre (Cuba Gooding Jr.) is an educated teenager preparing to join the university; Ricky (Morris Chestnut) is an athlete, expecting to join the university with scholarship since he is a great football player; and Doughboy (Ice Cube) is a small time criminal that has been arrested several times. But they live in a dangerous neighborhood where dreams are shattered by bullets. \"Boyz n the Hood\" is a powerful drama by John Singleton that has not aged after twenty-five years. The social problem in American ghettos is shown in South Central Los Angeles. Youths are forced to live with violence and shootings since their parents cannot afford to move to a better neighborhood and even those that try to prepare for a better future, may be involved with the environment.

            "content": "1991\"One out of every twenty-one Black American males will be murdered in their lifetime\"\"Most will die at the hands of another Black male\"\"Increase The Peace\" is the closing message of John Singleton's powerful, intelligent and affecting call for calm in South Central Los Angeles. Often mistakenly presumed by those who haven't seen it to be a film that glamorises violence, Singleton's debut film takes us into South Central and holds us there by just shooting the story. No trickery or overtly moralistic posturing from the director (and writer), just an unpretentious look at life in a modern ghetto.The story follows three black teenagers as they ponder on what life holds for them as adulthood lurches from around the corner. Brothers Doughboy (Ice Cube) and Ricky Baker (Morris Chestnut) and best friend Tre Styles (Cuba Gooding Jr), each have the usual worries that come with leaving the teenage years behind. Parents, girls, careers, not returning to the pen! But this is no ordinary coming of age drama, we have been party to this neighbourhood that these boys live in. This is a place where a trip to the store can get you killed in a drive by shooting. A place where those keen to learn and do their homework have their muse shattered by the frequent sound of gunshots and sirens filling the South Central night.Though Singleton can be accused of painting some of his characters as too saintly, he should be forgiven since this is after all, a message movie. Besides which his portrait of this particular neighbourhood is done from honest memory since he himself be a former youth of South Central LA. There in lies one of Boyz's trump cards, Singleton, through his own observations, asks of those in \"The Hood\" to take responsibility for what they do. Something that is potently given narrative credence courtesy of Tre's father's (a fabulous understated Laurence Fishburne) deep musings. Once the built up tension explodes with the inevitable tragedy that all should be ready for, the impact is like a sledgehammer hitting bone. Not in a blood letting for impact sake, but with the aftermath as a family soaks up the situation. It gives 90s cinema one of its most affecting and damning scenes, one that once viewed is hard to fully shake out of the memory bank. Here Singleton could possibly have bowed out of the story, but he goes further, expanding the aftermath and taking us, along with the characters, to the final \"Increase The Peace\" d\u00e9nouement.It's been called everything from an After School Special to the most important Black American movie made thus far. I agree with the last assessment. 9/10",

            "review_title": "Brilliant use of sound, engaging script and wonderful character development makes this film better than you think.",
            "content": "Boyz 'N the hood is a thoroughly fascinating and deeper than you think look at life in Los Angeles around the early 1980s to early 1990s; what the film actually does is look at a life in one of these Los Angeles 'ghettos' and uses it as the backdrop for a wonderful series of filmic events revolving around growing up, relations with family and friends, racism and the constant threat of violence. The film has a certain aged charm about it; and with actors you'd easily recognise today looking very different in 1991, this adds to the feeling. These actors/celebrities are: Laurence Fishburne, Cuba Gooding Jr, and Ice Cube. I was surprised at how everything in this film just managed to pool together and just work. The film doesn't really adopt a neo-realistic approach but what it does do is tie together an unpredictable and often heart-warming script, great character development and some genuinely entertaining situations that don't let your eyes off the screen. Some examples of this can be when the main group of characters are out for revenge and stalk a rival group whilst they innocently have their meals on the pavement or when the father of then ten year old Tr\u00e9 (Gooding Jr.) is desperately trying to bring his child up well and teach him the right things he needs to learn whilst we are desperately longing him to listen. The way in which the four main characters in the group also progress; bouncing off one another in life and scraps as they try to find their way is not only compelling viewing but the attention to detail by including unnecessary dialogue and real life conversations in real life situations is remarkable. The life in which these people lead is also put across in a very disturbing and realistic way that makes you glad you're not part of what is going on. This is done thanks to visuals and background noise and sound effects. Often a police car siren will begin to wail; signalling there's probably been another shooting or crime that has happened; there will also be, what I presume, a police helicopter fly overhead every once in a while \u0096 forced into keeping an eye on things and events even though everything's probably fine. This feeling of being trapped and constantly in danger whilst being watched most of the time plays on the character's minds and is relayed onto us in an often effective manner.In terms of visuals, there are constant threats and reminders that danger, literally, lurks around every corner. Tr\u00e9 attempts to take some food from one house and walk it about a hundred yards back to his own for his father but along the way is greeted by a car containing a few 'gang bangers' possessing a sawn off shotgun that is consequently aimed at him. He also manages to save a child that had escaped from its mother from getting run down in the road \u0096 it turns out the mother has just too many to deal with and very solemnly shuts the door on Tr\u00e9 without much of a 'thank you'. Not only this but the approaching sound of rap and R&B music as cars get closer when there are multiple unknown characters in a scene is heard; it can feel very threatening \u0096 especially if our heroes are out on foot and you do feel like they are in danger.Boyz 'N the Hood is a fantastic debut film for John Singleton as many have already said. It combines multiple conventions and mixes them in well with one another as we see the lives progress of these four people we would never normally give five seconds of our time to.",

            "content": "\"Boyz n the Hood\" seems to pride itself as a morality play, but it's the characters that had me glued to the screen. Laurence Fishburne is magnetic, and I couldn't get enough of his sermonizing as a single father defiantly raising his kid in a hopeless world. And even though it's Cuba Gooding Jr.'s soul at stake throughout all of this, it's Ice Cube I really felt sympathy for in the end. At that point, for a rapper-cum-fledgling actor, he really brought out the sadness in his thug character.Subtlety isn't the movie's strong suit, and that feeling of dread knots itself in your stomach right on cue. But Singleton does a great job saying that this isn't just a depressed (and violent) neighborhood - there are real people living here. And it says a lot that every time you see a low angle shot of palms, rundown street, plane flying overhead, you conjure this particular movie; even after all the imitators. A standard was set, certainly.7/10.",

While some elements of this life are already very well known to the point that they may become a cliche in a movie, in this case the director manages to portray it all very realistic and easy to connect to the people in the movie. There is great acting and a special mention should be of Ice Cube for whom this was his acting debut. He portrays Dough in a brilliant way. He may be the guy who went the wrong road but we can see him being a good person and not having made these choices just on his own but being part of the system that pushed him into it. No wonder Ice Cube continued his acting career and is pretty successful.Definitely a nice classic from the 90's that I recommend to people who want to watch a realistic and dramatic movie that makes one both think and feel",

Tre finds that the hood is full of traps for the young men therein and must decide how he wants to live his life with guidance and hindrance from his father and his friends.It's hard to remember now, but this film was the one that created a series of copies and spoofs, some of which were better or more hard hitting, but they all suffered because they held to cliches that this film created. I.e. the babyfather trap, the college kid having his dreams crushed etc.  The plot now suffers because we know it is all a clich\u00e9 - but with fresh eyes it is powerful and realistic for many.  Singleton may be a flash in the pan but this was his flash and he directs well - only occasionally going OTT dramatically with slowmo etc.The young cast are all very good.  Gooding Jr delivers a good, if na\u00efve performance and Ice Cube proves that not all rappers have to be rubbish actors in poor `comedies'.  Fishburne is as powerful as ever in a small role but Angela Bassett has little to do with her small role.  Long is one of my favourite actresses and she's really good here.  Many of the cast do fall into caricatures but it's best to ignore that as much as you can.Overall a great film that suffers now because it has been copied so much that it looks like a clich\u00e9 itself.

However \"Poetic Justice\" DID and when I finally came around to watching \"Boyz n the Hood\" I had extremely low expectations.I honestly thought it was going to be as absolutely pointless as \"Poetic Justice\" was.And, yeah, I did kind of like \"Higher Learning,\" which I also saw before this, but I still kind of feel that he was pointing the finger at white people and telling the viewers that we are all evil and the cause of all the problems in the world.So I went in here thinking it was going to be a talented racist mess.However, it wasn't. The fact is the film was absolutely amazing. And, honestly, it was the first film I saw about gangs, from a non-police POV, that didn't glorify them. And it remains one of the few gangland movies I've seen that doesn't glorify the lifestyle.And I understand that they are two completely different beasts, but the film felt like it was taking the issue of gangs and giving it a \"The Godfather\" treatment...and it worked.It worked brilliantly. You can both relate to the characters--although I'm probably not supposed to say that--and see that the gang culture is a horrible thing. Unlike \"Poetic Justice\" it has a point.

Out of an era of gangster rap came a nationwide exposure of the issues within the Black and Latino communities, and directors like John Singleton and the Hughes Brothers follow in the footsteps of the great Spike Lee. The film Boyz n the Hood is an intricate examination of the archetypes and stereotypes of the hood, as well as an introduction to the survivors, both trapped in the violence and escaping the cycle. The film concentrates on a Black community without the interactions between communities shown in Do the Right Thing, another epic race commentary. The direction of the film is fluid and natural, the acting heartfelt and strong, the affect extraordinary. The message of the movie is deeper than White or Italian based gangland movies, because the human aspect and the characters are more solid and approachable, and rooted in highly intellectual and applicable theories on race and violence. This film is a showcase of the radical and moderate themes expressed by Black activists, with Laurence Fishburne's character as the leader and role model of the film. A careful examination of the film reveals a strong message and a strong film. Don't underestimate the power of this film.",

Lawrence Fishburne and Morris Chestnut add further depth to a strong cast.All in all a very real, gritty depiction of the challenges faced at every turn by African American men and women in modern America. The building anger bristling beneath the surface in so many scenes is particularly resonant given the outburst of violence in the Rodney King Riots that took place in the very same city of the story just one year later.The film spawned several 'urban gang flick' imitations in subsequent years, but most glorified violence and placed an emphasis on a loud soundtrack and sexual explicitness at the expense of strong plot-line, good character development and a serious social message.All three are to be found in Boyz N the Hood.",

The dichotomy of street life is represented by Tre Styles (Cuba Gooding Jr.) and Ricky Baker (Morris Chestnut), who make an effort to improve their situation in life, against the gang-banger mentality of young blacks like Doughboy Darren (Ice Cube) and Dooky (Dedrick D. Gobert), who engage in an eye for an eye existence in relation to the street gangs that roam South Central Los Angeles. Particular emphasis is placed on the idea of young black kids needing a father, or at least a father figure in their lives to teach them right from wrong in matters of education, job skills and even the responsibility that goes along with pre-marital sex. The dialog between Furious and his son is particularly frank and well intentioned, making this picture appear to be worthy viewing for all inner city high school students. I found the movie to be sensitive and thought provoking, with only some mild disappointment with the closing screen narrative that described the fate of Doughboy two weeks after the tragic death of Ricky. As a fictional story, I didn't find it necessary to sensationalize the drama of yet another young man's death in service to the movie, as there was enough to contemplate regarding the tragedy that had just recently occurred.",

Most people embrace for the portrayal of hood life but only a few people understand why Boyz N The Hood is one of the most important contributions to Black cinema. Boyz N The Hood had a social conscious that is missing from a lot of hood flicks that come out nowadays. John Singleton got a lot of acclaim for this movie and to tell you the truth he deserved it.The story if you didn't know is about Tre'(Cuba Gooding Jr) being sent to live with his father after he gets in trouble in school. The rest of the film details his experience in South Central Los Angeles.Laurence Fishburne is at his best here. I always thought that he was a great actor and his role here proves it. Furious Styles is a loving father but stern and wise enough to be observant about his surroundings. Cuba Gooding Jr is great as Tre': a somewhat confused but intelligent kid. Ice Cube's best performance next to Fudge in Higher Learning will always be \"Doughboy\". Angela Bassett shines as Tre's caring mother.I like all the gems in this movie like Furious telling Tre' why Black men shouldn't join the army or Furious explaining to the neighborhood in Compton what Gentrification is(hell, most people don't even know what that is now). The stereotypes in this movie are all too real: The mother that loves one son over the other, the biased black cop, the confused black men and women and crack cocaine. All these things still exist in every ghetto in America that is why Boyz In The Hood is still relevant after all these years! I recommend this movie to the crowd that is smart enough to embrace it for the gems that are held within. All you hoity-toity suburbanites that spent your whole life in The Hamptons need not waste your time. Two thumbs up all the way.",

            "content": "I enjoyed Boyz N the Hood on many levels. For instance, it's fun just as a film capturing a certain time and place. The culture of young black men in South Central Los Angeles. We also see the young women and older and wiser parents in their lives but the focus is on the boys that grew up to be men between 1984 to 1991. Or perhaps, as the title suggests, they still have a lot to learn before they are men. One character uses a dummy (or pacifier), one is in a wheel-chair and another seems to have a drinking problem. They don't appear to be employed or to have any serious plans about their futures.People talk about \"keeping yourself out of trouble\". I guess they mean you need an active lifestyle as part of the community, doing good normal things. If you don't, you're at risk to get mixed up with the wrong people or to be drawn into a gangster lifestyle. But even if you're straight-laced, the streets are dangerous. Guns and alcohol are readily available and in fact Furious (Larry Fishburne) suggests that this is a deliberate ploy to encourage black youth to kill themselves. After all, you don't find so many gun and liquor stores in other neighbourhoods. But then, the guns are being bought and business is business so it's hard to be so sure. Either way, it's pretty disturbing. As you might guess, shootings are common and police helicopters are often flying overhead.I really enjoyed the hip hop soundtrack. It was mostly songs I didn't recognise but I really liked them and it created a unique vibe. Not a collection of fad songs that now make the movie dated. It's what the characters probably would've liked, what they heard and grew up with.The performances are so natural, it feels like the actors simply are those people. I guess the director (John Singleton) was able to trust that they know their character and give them the confidence to do whatever feels right to them. The cast is entirely black and there is no compromise in their language, nothing is translated into typical Hollywood dialogue, they just say what they're feeling. Some of the bluntness I found hilarious. But it's always clear what they mean and what they feel and that's what matters. This movie isn't about race but it is set within a black culture and it feels legitimate rather than forced or contrived.Another strength of the film is that it only cares about its characters and its story. There are no convenient dramatic pay-offs, no major plot twists, practically no exposition. The movie never tells us what to think or feel (as at least 90% of movies try to). But there are shocking moments and surprises. There are emotional climaxes and tension when we're not sure what risks a character might take and whether they'll survive.It has one of the most realistic and heart-breaking death scenes I've ever seen. There are so many different emotions on display. Hearing that raw pain, the sobs, the yells, the repeated phrases, the shock that a loved one has died and you can't or don't want to accept it. It shows that death isn't always poetic with a few final stuttered words followed by a profound screaming of \"no\", sometimes it's brutal and harsh and cuts through your soul. There are also details afterwards that add a venomous after-sting of grief to the death.There is some inevitability to the violence that occurs and it's hardly a surprise that the movie veers in that direction. It's only a matter of time before someone you know is affected. But it's more knowing simply that some violence will occur, the specifics of who and where and how are quite random and the movie captures this. Tensions rise, misunderstandings turn into intimidation and assertions of later vengeance. In those heightened moments when people are running, hearts racing, guns firing, a split second can make all the difference. It's chaos and that makes it all the worse and harder to bear. But I guess it's always going to be like that with guns.Cuba Gooding Jr. (Tre) stands out as the main character. He carries an inner-conflict within him. He is kind and caring but he's passionate and wants the violence to end. It tears him apart that he feels so powerless. What can he do? How can he fight the violence without turning to violence himself? How can he have a normal life when his friends take risks, he regularly encounters aggression and guns are everywhere? When I saw police arrive in one scene, I felt sure they would be racist white cops and I thought \"here we go, another stereotype in another movie\". One of them did seem racist, but he was also black. Pretty unexpected. He turns up late to answer a call, casually eating as he arrives. He seems convinced that these young men are as good as dead, he believes it's unavoidable and therefore deems them worthless.In a way, it's Tre's love for his friends and family that is the biggest risk for him. He would do anything to save, protect or avenge them. If he was smart, maybe he'd abandon them and focus on his hopeful future. Gooding Jr. embodies this struggle very well. He never seems to fully smile or laugh freely. There's always some fear or apprehension lying behind it. And the supporting cast is incredible, every part. Ice Cube is understated, you feel a lot it going on in his mind. He seems consumed by anger for whatever reason.Anyway, Boyz N the Hood is a great movie that really affected me. It's funny to reflect on the problems I have in my life and to see how mild they are compared to the ones in this film. Makes me realise how lucky I am.",

They didn't have sh-t on my brother, man.\" The mother of Tre Styles (Cuba Gooding Jr.) decides to send her son to live with his father, Furious Styles (Laurence Fishburne), after he gets into a fight at school. Furious, who lives in the heart of South Central LA, is a man that knows the values of how to respect and how to earn it. He's strict, but he's fair. Furious works as a mortgage broker.We watch Tre mature from a young boy to his senior year in high school taking the SAT's. His two best friends are brothers. Ricky (Morris Chestnut) is a great athlete and is getting into college to support his girlfriend and infant son. The other brother, Doughboy (Ice Cube), is headed down a totally opposite path of guns, drugs, gangs, and violence. He's in and out of prison each year.Furious knows that his son could get killed easily, as he was once involved with the gang scene himself. He wants Tre to graduate college and be good in whatever his profession may be.As the story goes more in depth, we see that even if you aren't involved in a gang, you could still be a target. Whether it's your brother, cousin, sister, or other family member that is thee one involved with the violence, the main target could be the person in the family who stays away from the dangers of the street.Tre and his friends are in a world where being violent is sometimes the way to live. Helicopters are heard searching for murderers every night. The police are so busy, that sometimes a 9-1-1 call could mean waiting for the police to arrive. There is even one Black-cop, who uses his power to try and intimidate young Blacks who he thinks might be involved in the gangs and violence.This is the ultimate ghetto film, which will never be topped. All of the direction and screenplay is brilliant. Singleton doesn't use cheap scenes that get the viewer off-topic and the audience, as a whole, is always into the movie. Come into a world that most of us haven't been in. Follow the life of one boy who turns into a man as he has to not only goes through personal struggles, but has to worry about whether he'll be killed at any moment. -Pat10/10",

The acting from the young black cast, including Cuba Gooding Jr., Morris Chestnut, and Ice Cube, is fresh and invigorating, as these guys actually manage to capture the fire and conflict within the souls of their characters. Nothing much that happens in BOYZ N THE HOOD will shock or surprise, as sadly the daily news is much, much worse, but this is a remarkably tough social drama that manages to be heartfelt at the same time.

            "content": "\"Never accept images that have been created for you by someone else.\" - Malcolm X The opening scenes of John Singleton's \"Boyz n the Hood\" feature a Reagan/Bush reelection sign, framed like a Wild West \"Wanted\" poster and riddled with bullet holes. Much of early hip-hop and rap music was itself openly aggressive toward Reagan. Public Enemy cite Reagan as being responsible for their very birth and early songs by Jay Z, Pusha T, Ab-Soul, Mos Def, Riley, 2 Pac, Scarface, Geto Boys, Biggie, Ice Cube, NWA etc were oft peppered with obscenities directed toward the President (\"Reagan made us monsters\", \"Fk Reagan\", \"Reagan don't want us to rise\", \"Reagan is bull****\", \"Mother**** Reagan\", \"Ronald brings the coke\" etc).Reagan, meanwhile, was overseeing the \"managed decline\" of America's poverty stricken communities. He waged war on minorities, those on welfare, scuttled public services, gave the rich tax breaks (upper marginal rates which had been no lower than 70 percent, and often in the 80-90 percent range since the 1940s, dropped to lower than 28 percent) and justified draconian cuts in social programs by creating in the minds of affluent, (mostly) white Americans the spectre of the \"welfare queen\". Life, for Reagan, was apparently too easy on inner-city families. Time to change that. Years later it would be revealed (by an investigative journalist mysteriously shot dead) that in tandem with the CIA he facilitated the sale of massive amounts of cocaine in US inner-cities, causing crack epidemics and flooding urban areas with cheap hard drugs. Due to the Reagan administration, the kilo price of coke fell dramatically from $60,000 to a mere $9,000. While the media and White House bashed African Americans for a rise in drug related crimes, rappers hit back with lyrics like \"Reagan cooked up an answer\", \"Reagan got Manhattan blow\" or \"I never sold base, mother**** Reagan\".Still, the drugs kept flowing, passing from Colombia to Panama and Honduras to Miami and then trickling throughout the United States. But while the FBI certainly did once stage a covert war on Black America (its COINTELPRO wing fought against the Black Panthers and branches of the CIA conducted the illegal germ-infections of African Americans) the influx of drugs during this period was primarily a means of gathering funds for other covert operations, namely illegal wars in Nicaragua and the funding of illegal forces (the Contras) put together by the Pentagon to destroy revolutionary movements in Central America. If minorities in the hood paid a price for US foreign policy, so be it.That's the context of \"Boyz n the Hood\", one of the better films in a late 1980s, early 90s wave of films \"about\" African Americans and/or by African American directors. A coming of age tale, the film watches as ten year old Tre Styles is sent to South Central LA to live with his father, Furious Styles, played by Laurence Fishburne. Furious schools his boy on love, life and responsibility, and does his best to keep his kid righteous. Competing with Furious is the \"Hood\", a cocktail teeming with its own character shaping forces.Opening scenes show Tre feuding with teachers. It's immediately clear he's subject to a Eurocentric school curriculum that has little cultural relevancy to Black students (the one lesson we see involves a teacher whitewashing Colonialism and boosting Thanksgiving mythology). As punishment for not conforming and quietly embracing hegemony, Tre is sent directly to an unsettling and violent neighbourhood in South Central Los Angeles; be white, baby, or go die in the hood.Much of the rest of the film exposes the increasing dissolution of the Black family. Tre's parents live miles apart and another character, Brenda Baker, is forced to favour one son (Ricky Barker) over the other (Doughboy) because of economic pressures. Ricky \u2013 portrayed as a \"financial investment\" - may be a star athlete and thereby help lift his family up the economic ladder. Doughboy, meanwhile, is \"just waste\". He's recently returned from jail, having tried and failed to make a buck through illegal channels.Fathers, of course, are almost entirely absent. The one exception is Furious, Tre's father, who works hard, 9 to 5, scraping to make a living. Late scenes show Tre's surprise when confronted with Furious' cramped working conditions. But Furious \u2013 always well dressed, upright, a cross between Malcolm X and a handsome Super Fly - takes pride in everything he does. Other subplots touch upon the military's preying on the impoverished and the media's refusal to broadcast the sobs of the ghetto.While \"Hood\" does well to draw attention to what is essentially a slow genocide, it doesn't examine the larger psychosocioeconomic forces buffeting its cast. Singleton's stuck on the level of \"blacks needing to behave\". He sees things as a black responsibility; blacks need to grow up and stop killing one another. Blacks, in other words, just need to be good whites. One scene, in which Furious explains the word \"gentrification\", attempts to delve into the confluence of economics and violence, and does approaches some kind of critique of capitalism, systems, land ownership and/or appropriation (prophetic post Katrina and post housing collapse) and the (inevitable) creation of gangster and crime filled suburbs, but is too vague to mean anything coherent (minority communities \"collapse\" because they do not have enough money to warrant being siphoned OF money. Locals are then killed off and/or moved somewhere worse while their land is re-appropriated for profit).The film is very heavy-handed at times (its stop sign opening is terrible), and far too literal, but Singleton was a kid when he directed this, so we allow it. The film is more soulful than others in its genre, invented all the clich\u00e9s of the \"hood movie\", was made prior to Scorsese's \"Goodfellas\" so suffers none of the gratuitous/exploitative uses of violence/swearing that ruins Scorsese's imitators and contains some lovable characters, particularly Furious and Doughboy, played by rapper Ice Cube.8.5/10 \u2013 Underrated.",

            "content": "Despite two different contexts, \"Boyz N the Hood\" paid a small tribute to \"Stand By Me\" with a scene showing four kids walking along a rail track to find a dead body. But I think I found a deeper (though maybe unintentional) connection: in Rob Reiner's film, Gordie's father appears in his son's dream, while he's burying his oldest son, he tells Gordie \"it should've been you.\"In \"Boyz N the Hood\", Tyra Ferrell plays the mother of two sons from different fathers: Ricky (Chestnut Morris) is athletic, loving and carries all the premise of a brilliant university career and Darren (Ice Cube) went through juvenile centers and jail. When I saw her crying over Ricky's dead body, I was wondering whether she, like Gordie's father, wished Darren was dead instead. If he hadn't deserved it, at least he would have had it coming.But Darren already sealed his own fate by avenging his brother; the day after, he has a talk with Tre (Cuba Gooding Jr.) and he's quite resigned about it, we learn that he's murdered two weeks after, and that I almost took it as 'natural cause' was chilling. But that's exactly the impending doom that followed me as I followed the lives of these young boys from their childhood to their young adult years, I knew this was an escalation to something I didn't want to see. \"Do the Right Thing\" prepared me for it.But John Singleton's movie is different than Spike Lee's, both in style and substance. Lee cared for the theme, and Singleton for the characters, his use of violence is more pointless and random but no less tragic and its emotional impact even greater because the characters were fully developed and played almost in intimacy with us, starting with the central piece of intelligence in this film: the relationship between Tre and his father \"Furious\" played by Lawrence Fishburne in an Oscar worthy performance.Tre's mother (Angela Bassett) left him to his Dad after one incident too many at school, so he could make a man out of him. But like Furious say, any guy can make a baby, it takes a man to raise him. And Furious elevates fatherhood up to eleven, he's not just a father figure but as the actor said, the mentor for all single fathers in the world, and never a moment is wasted to teach proper values such as respect, self-respect and responsibility. And Tre grows up a brilliant and articulate young man with problems of his age such as thinking of the future... and the \"first time\" with his Catholic girlfriend Brandi (Nia Long), the streets of South L.A. are the least of his concerns.That's the power of Singleton's style, it is based on his personal memories but he offers us a view that differs from the usual. Sure we hear the police sirens, the helicopters and their flashy headlights but we also follow people trying to pass grades, find a job, a meaning to their lives, a purpose, have fun, dress well and just live. In the end, \"Boyz N the Hood\" is about characters in ordinary situations... and that includes the final tragedy which makes it even more tragic.They don't even talk about it about on the news, the self-hating cop will probably be glad that a \"hoodlum\" is dead, a mother will end without sons, yet the ending is bittersweet because Tre doesn't surrender to the call of the streets, and the way the scene is played wonderfully tie the plot together. Just when I thought the film's culmination was violence, I realized the true climax was the confrontation between Tre and Furious.Furious realizes all his education and advice have been leading up to that make-it-or-break-it point, and that's where you realize how precious a parent can be, regardless of gender or race. It's also important that Tre disobeys first but makes it his own decision, getting himself off the endless cycle of violence and not wasting his future, he's ready to confront adulthood.This is not just a poignant coming-of-age story but a cautionary tale. Like Ricky, one can live 'clean' and be shot anyway, and that speaks a thousand words. Speaking for myself, the film left me speechless... and impressed by a director who could at such a young age (he is still the youngest Oscar-nominated director and first African-American) and with such a cast of relatively unknown actors, beat the odds and make a drama that can play as the little brother of \"Do the Right Thing\" but not as a follower, as a decade-defining movie, one of its best and most difficult to watch.Indeed, I was prepared for something rough from \"Boyz N the Hood\", I knew there was one death and I waited till the name I accidentally read would be wiped out from my memory to watch the film. But for all the violence I saw coming, I didn't expect it to be such a deep, emotional and meaningful experience. All the main emotions that John Singleton's story projected in my heart and in my mind were less in the realm of anger or fear or shock but more of understanding, appreciation and realization. I was surprised by how powerful the film was and my surprise didn't surprise me.When you think of movies set in inner cities, or in the hood, you expect gunshots, gang wars, bloodshed, police brutality, profanity... and all that rap. And you get all that stuff in Singleton's film, except that they all work as peripheral material, they're not part of the life but work as ominous danger signs, reminding every day that one of these black kids might get shot for no other reason than a stare, a gesture, an accident or just destiny that comes punching the wrong clock.If we can't change things after the film made us aware, at least being aware is a positive change.",

All those elements make Boyz N The Hood not only one of the best films of the 1990s and a classic of not only Black cinema but cinema in general and is John Singleton's best film.Set in South Central Los Angeles,California,Boyz N The Hood tells the story of Tre Styles(Cuba Gooding Jr.),a teenager who as a kid is sent by his Mother Reva(Angela Bassett)to live with his Father Furious Styles(Laurence Fishburne)who has been teaching Tre to grow up since Tre was a kid. Along with living with his Father,he is best friends with brothers Doughboy(Ice Cube),a criminal and Ricky Williams(Morris Chestnut),a star High School Football athlete and young Father. While living in their neighborhood,Tre,Doughboy and Ricky have to deal with violence,tragedy and coming of age in South Central.Boyz N The Hood is a brilliant and groundbreaking film in many ways because it's the movie that gave birth to the 'Hood genre in the 1990s and is The Godfather of this genre paving the way for other Hood movies such as Menace II Society(1993)and Juice(1992). It was also the first film where director John Singleton was the first African-American to be nominated for a Best Director Oscar which was well-deserved. And while Singleton has made good films since Boyz N The Hood,none of his other films has matched the power of Singleton's film debut. Boyz N The Hood is an instant classic from the moment you watch it because it's a Hood movie,a morality tale and a coming of age film giving viewers a gritty film that never loses it's impact after many viewings. Boyz was also the film that gave movie goers a look into the world of South Central Los Angeles,showing the violence,tragedy and urban decay that was going on in 1991 and where there is danger and bullets in the air the kind of things that was being talked about on record by great Hip-Hop artists such as N.W.A,Ice-T and Ice Cube during the late 1980s and early 90s. The w There is many themes that are repeated in BNTH themes such as family,violence and growing up and the themes are presented in a harsh and realistic way that is in your face and unflinching and never sugarcoated with messages that will make an impact on viewers. The Coming Of Age genre has always been one of my favorite film genres and BNTH is one of the greatest and most realistic Coming Of Age films with the examination of the film's three main characters and best friends Tre,Doughboy and Ricky. Tre,Doughboy and Ricky are great characters in the Coming Of Age film genre because we as viewers see them as flawed individuals that we can relate to and we see all three of them have to deal with various issues and subjects:Tre and his relationships with his Father and girlfriend,Doughboy being out of jail and trying to survive on the streets and Ricky trying to get into College while being a teenage Father. The three of them are the best of friends but act like they are real brothers who are faced with living in a dark and harsh environment while still trying to be strong and survive on the mean streets of L.A. while growing up fast and quick. What is also interesting about Tre,Doughboy and Ricky is the differences in the three characters home lives because while Tre has his Father and a positive role model in his life,Doughboy and Ricky live with their Mother but with no Father or positive role model in their lives to give them guidance(Doughboy and Ricky are Half-Brothers)and lead them on the right path. With Tre having a Father around him you feel that there is hope for Tre but with no Father for Doughboy or Ricky you will feel sadness for the two of them. Tre,Doughboy and Ricky are characters that will stay with you because you will wonder will they survive the on the streets of South Central or will the streets get to them. The screenplay by John Singleton(which was nominated for an Oscar for best screenplay)is impressive and powerful,with Singleton giving the characters dialog that is thoughtful and sends a message that makes you think. The ending of Boyz N The Hood is amazing,unforgettable and gives viewers a mixture of hope,tragedy and sadness that is bittersweet but matches the tone of the rest of the film. An incredible ending to a classic film.The cast is wonderful. Cuba Gooding Jr. is excellent and memorable as Tre Styles,with Gooding Jr. bringing emotion and depth to the performance. Ice Cube(in his film debut)is brilliant and unforgettable as Doughboy,Tre's streetwise best friend,with Cube being iconic and charismatic. Laurence Fishburne is fantastic as Furious Styles,Tre's well-meaning Father. Morris Chestnut is great as Ricky,Tre's other best friend and Doughboy's brother. Nia Long is wonderful as Brandi,Tre's girlfriend. Angela Bassett is terrific as Reva,Tre's Mother. Tyra Ferrell does a fine job as Brenda Baker,Doughboy and Ricky's Mother. Regina King(Shalika),Raymond Turner(Ferris)and Jesse Ferguson(Officer Coffey)give good performances as well.The direction by John Singleton is amazing,with Singleton bringing a simple but effective and realistic gritty style to the film. Great direction,Singleton.The score by Stanley Clarke is outstanding,powerful and intense and truly adds to the movie's tone. A terrific score by Clarke. There is also a great song called How To Survive In South Central by Ice Cube that plays at the end of the film. A wonderful song.In final word,if you love John Singleton,Hood Movies,urban films or cinema in general,I highly suggest you see Boyz N The Hood,an excellent,powerful and unforgettable classic that will stay with you after you watch it. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",

The storyline follows a young man as he transitions from living with his mother to living with his father who resides in the hood just outside Los Angeles. His father tries to teach him how to be a man and survive in a harsh cruel world. We follow the young man and his friend's upbringing in these challenging circumstances.

The storyline for this picture is outstanding and contains a brilliant blend of character development, social and societal issues, family dynamics and the intensity of their lifestyle circumstances. The dialogue is very good and the cast delivers awesome performances. The chemistry between characters was perfect and the film is so entertaining to watch unfold. The ending is always gut wrenching no matter how many times you see it. This is an all time American classic and should be recognized as so. Really a must see and an easy 10/10.",

            "content": "John Singleton's first and most successful film to date (and, I'm positive, his best work too) is an honest account of three black friends (played, in their teens, by Cuba Gooding Jr., Ice Cube and Morris Chestnut) growing up in a South Central LA ghetto.Ice Cube's song \"AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted\" partially inspired the story, which is also partially autobiographic. Like the protagonist Tre (Gooding Jr.), Singleton lived with his mother (played by Angela Bassett in the film) for his first years, and was sent to his father's (Laurence Fishburne) when she felt the place she was living in wasn't suitable for the 10 year-old, and it was about time his dad taught him \"how to be a man\". The other protagonists, Ricky (Chestnut) and Doughboy (Cube) are half brothers who couldn't be more different: Ricky is their mother's favorite, the athlete pursuing a football scholarship to USC and their mom's pride and joy, while Doughboy is the overweight, overlooked 17 year-old ex-con.\"Boyz N the Hood\" starts with sad statistics: \"One out of every 21 black males will die of murder, most of them at each other's hands\". Singleton, who was only 23 when the film was made (he became not only the youngest ever Oscar nominee for Best Director, but also the first African American to be nominated in that category; only this year another African American would be nominated, Lee Daniels of \"Precious\", exactly 18 years later), told a story of how the reality of one's environment and upbringing are definitely huge factors in how one's personality and life choices are shaped and/or limited; yet, it still remains one's own struggle in the end. The rebellion here is the struggle to get out of a rotten environment you alone aren't strong enough to change, without being killed by it before then. It's a struggle only those who have been there know entirely, and for those of us who are fortunate enough to have been raised in better or at least not as violent environments, we can imagine and analyze through statistics, but not with an inner understanding of what living in such reality is like - lucky us. In that sense, Singleton's film reminds me of Fernando Meirelles's masterpiece \"City of God\" (2002), which presents an even tougher, scarier reality in Brazilian \"favelas\", which, as a Brazilian myself, I can tell you it's all true (sadly). The musical score is corny and easily the weakest link in the film, and some moments seem clich\u00e9d and contrived; but you can't deny the impact and overall honesty of this brutal effort from this young director. Not as multi-layered or even ambitious as Spike Lee's \"Do the Right Thing\", but still a film that remains relevant in 2010. 8.5/10.",

As the opening line of the film says, one out of twenty-one black men are murdered and usually at the hands of another black man. So you might be able to guess where the film goes. Starring Laurence Fishbourne, Ice Cube and a very young Cuba Gooding.The film is something like an extended version of a Snoop Doggy Dogg video. Which I mean in a complimentary way, because if I had known when Snoop first came out what \"Crenshaw\" was and other such things I would have appreciated the message in his music more. (Critics may say the message was about \"blunts\" and \"40s\" and \"bitches\", but if life in South Central is anything like what they show in this film, those things are pretty typical in that neighborhood.) The clothing was very strange. I've seen the Cosby Show, but did people ever really dress like that? A dark shirt with a big yellow circle? A pacifier? Not a good fashion statement, in my opinion. \"Don't Be a Menace\" rightly mocked this.But anyway, the acting is great and the emotions are real. Fishbourne is incredible, and was probably an actor who didn't get enough credit in 1991. He was still Cowboy Curtis, you know... but now he's Morpheus, so I guess it paid off in the long run. Good job, Fishbourne! And Cuba? He made a few good films (especially \"As Good As It Gets\"). Ice Cube made \"Anaconda\"... you can't win them all.Unless the films of black people make you irrationally irate (and I can't help you with that), you need to see this film because it will help you understand the real-life struggles of poor men in the ghetto and what they must go through to join mainstream society. You will learn the meaning of gentrification and why black men were not equal, even in the Army.",

The tough inner-city of Los Angeles is examined through the eyes of a young African-American man (Cuba Gooding, Jr. in his star-making performance) who has been forced to leave a middle-class existence living with his mother (Angela Bassett) to become part of the mean jungle that is the hood to live with father Laurence Fishburne. We see the character's evolution from a young boy of 10 to a senior in high school and see that the more things change, the more they stay the same. The neighborhood includes former juvenile delinquent Ice Cube and his high school football star brother Morris Chestnut. Also along for the ride is Gooding's love interest Nia Long. The movie is superbly written and directed by a very young John Singleton (only 23 at the time). The film is one of those that is both a joy and a trial to sit through. Singleton pulls no punches and all the performances are first-rate. Laurence Fishburne gives perhaps his greatest performance and Cuba Gooding, Jr. shows unlimited potential here and of course he would only improve with age. 4.5 out of 5 stars.",

And Boys n the Hood still stands up today.Set from 1984 to 1991 in South Central LA Boyz n the Hood follows three friends, Tre Styles (Desi Arnez Hines/Cuba Gooding Jr.), a smart kid who wants to lead a normal life, Ricky Baker (Donovan McCrary/Morris Chestnut), an aspiring American Football player and Ricky's gangbanger half-brother \"Doughboy\" (Baha Jackson/Ice Cube).The main characters three different aspects of black life - Tre is the academic, Ricky is athletic and Doughboy falls in with a bad crowd and serves as an example of what could happen to Tre and Ricky. Although Tre and Ricky have ambition and potential they can't escape the gang warfare infecting the area.Singleton gets the atmosphere of the area - the constant police presence and shootings, the young men that roam in cars and gangs and the drug addiction of some the residents of the area. A powerful image early in the film is showing children's drawings of the gang and police violence.Some of the dialogue is a bit too blunt and heavy handed but I willing to put it down to Singleton's youth at the time as he was trying to get his point across. The same goes for the more melodramatic scenes but this was because of extreme personal circumstances that the characters have to go through.Boyz n the Hood is a highly influential film in the 'hood subgenre' and it is clear it set up some of tropes that many of it ilk followed.",

This was written by John Singleton and as such is based on his experiences growing up in South Central LA with his father. To portray a strong and smart father figure is played by Laurence Fishburne as Furious Styles. The story is told from Tre(Cuba Gooding Jr) point of view and is a very multi dimensional film that presents itself in a very honest fashion that up until this point has not been brought to light before in a major film. Most of the social issues brought to attention by the film are still relevant today. Movies like Boyz n the Hood are rare that are both groundbreaking, unpretentious and genuine.

            "content": "\"Boyz n the Hood\" is an American film from 1991, so this one has its 25th anniversary already this year. The film focuses on the life of Tre Styles, early on as a young kid, but later on as an adult. At the same time, we also witness how the people around him get older and that includes friends, family members and of course his girlfriend. All of these take very different paths and that includes Tre as well. The best performance of the film comes probably from Laurence Fishburne, who plays the main character's father. His interactions with his son, but also with his son's mother (Angela Bassett), are core aspects in here. And there are more known names. I am speaking of Ice Cube and Morris Chestnut here especially, two young actors and they play the people in Tre's life that are around his age and that he looks up to and respects as his peers. But are they really worth it? Watch for yourself.This film runs for slightly over 110 minutes and was written and directed by John Singleton, who was only in his early 20s when he made this film. With his director nomination at the Academy Awards, he made quite an impact, not only because of his age, but also for being the first African American to get in that category. In addition, he also managed a screenplay nod. If you look closely, you will also see Singleton play a mailman during one scene near the end. As a whole, this film works very well. The story seems realistic, the characters are intelligently presented and elaborated on. Yes the ending is a bit extreme with these two shootings, but sadly these things really do happen and the sad thing today is that almost nothing has gotten better in the last 25 years. But let's not talk about race crimes or politics here. This description also fits the level of films with predominantly black actors. There are quite a few every year and there are awards bodies like the Black Reel Awards honoring these, but the quality in these films has gone south considerably. A quality black film like this one here is only released once every 3 or 4 years perhaps, probably not even that often. So go see it! This was a convincing watch and I applaud Singleton for what he did here despite his young age. The Academy Award nominations (especially for director) may have been a bit over the top, but it was definitely a good watch and I recommend checking it out.",

This was his first movie, and he coaxed good performances from the entire cast, making me a little bit surprised that he hasn't really directed much of note since then. The movie opens with captions offering a sobering look at life in \"the hood\", and then proceeds offer us a look at that life in this black neighbourhood of Los Angeles, where violence, drug addiction and a general feeling of hopelessness is an everyday reality. That look is offered mostly through the character of Tre (Gooding) - a young man who seems to keep out of trouble for the most part but watches as his friends and neighbours often get sucked in to what's going on around them.Tre was perhaps too good for my liking. As the movie begins, Tre (as a young boy) is sent to live with his father (Fishburne) so that his mother can finish her education and his father can teach him how to be a man. Frankly, Tre seemed to me too easy to teach. He really didn't seem to be much of a challenge for his dad. Perhaps a bit more emphasis on the relationship between Tre and his dad would have given the movie a bit more intensity. That's what seemed to be basically lacking for me. Until quite near the end of the movie, I wasn't finding this especially intense. I found it sad - especially the brief glimpse of the drug addicted mother who let her baby wander into the streets and didn't really seem to care all that much - but not really intense. That does change near the end of the movie, especially with the story of Ricky (Morris Chestnut) - a talented young football player who has a chance to get out with a football scholarship to USC. But up to that last half hour or so, I wasn't really finding this movie especially powerful.Perhaps the intensity was lacking because the movie is more than 20 years old and is a bit dated, or, more likely, perhaps as a white person I simply can't relate to the environment that was being depicted. Whatever the reason though that lack of intensity and personal connection with the movie and characters (in spite of the good performances) pulls this down a notch or two for me. (5/10)",

Singleton saw that film and immediately started on the script for his own tale of inner-city youth encased in problems of racial oppression, sexual politics and other forms of discrimination and, of course, the gang violence. Though certain parts have not aged especially well, the core of the film, about the relationship between a son and father, as well as how to operate in a neighborhood where violence is around every corner, does hold up and resonates well.It starts and has its first half hour spent (wisely) in 1984, when young Tre gets in a fight at school and his mother (Angela Basset, only in three scenes but essential to the story) takes him to live with his father (Fishburne, maybe his best/subtlest performance), who can \"teach him how to be a man\" as she puts it more than once. And lo and behold, he can as he is a responsible parent with his own business; indeed one can imagine if they were living in the suburbs or elsewhere in a less hazardous area, they'd be a reasonably normal unit. But right away we see the trouble the night Tre moves in: a home invader comes in, Furious fires some shots to scare him off, and the cops show and do nothing (we also get the first moment of the racist *black* cop, who shows up in one of the most memorable scenes in the picture).Then cut ahead to seven years later - Tre's friend Doughboy gets sent to juvenile detention for a crime that's only hinted at, but we can guess the severity - and now it's high school years. In some ways, the majority of this picture still takes from a typical 'youth' picture: the concerns are boys chasing girls, some girls going after boys, and, as pertinent to some youth movies, gang violence. For example, could one see the altercation that sets up much of the trouble in the last act be seen in a 50's B-movie? Probably. Certainly some of the melodrama could be akin to something far removed from this on the surface like Rebel Without a Cause. And certainly again it's also about what effect, or lack thereof, parents have on their children in such an environment.Although at one point Singleton nearly stops the movie for a speech on gentrification - more distracting not so much for the speech but how immediately people gather around to listen and respond, which feels the most \"screenwriter-y\" of the movie - most of what he is showing really works: urban alienation and the sense that things won't get better (i.e. Doughboy's brother); the dangers of urban youth having children at a young age (lack of sex education is hinted at); and, of course, the lack of any real authority or leadership from those who \"Serve and Protect.\" When it comes to the 'hood' of the film, it's often the opposite.The scene with the racist black cop is striking for how Singleton takes what could be just a very one-dimensional character - we don't really know his name - and fills him with real conflict. The self-hating black man is a figure that probably wasn't seen in many films, certainly set in urban decay, and it's this that actually pushes Tre to the limit (at first, anyway, to a scene later parodied especially in the Wayans' Don't Be a Menace where he punches at air). What to make of someone who is not only not helping but on the opposite end is actively going out of his way to oppress his own people? Is this constructive? Will this get people to change? More like a self-fulfilling prophecy, actually.Some of the music choices, not the songs so much as the score, hasn't aged well at all - it's like Badalamenti's music for Twin Peaks but much less engrossing. And a few moments in the last act stand out as being very melodramatic; I have to say just a few though as the moment where a mother discovers her son is dead is still a tremendous gut punch (notice how little Singleton cuts away in this scene, and how Cube is trying to remain the strong one in the scene - only near the end do we see him get emotional). Furious has lived through this world, gone through his own troubles, and still has to remain strong for his on. But how far can he go for someone who he sees now as a 'grown man'? Is he still just a boy lost in this world? Gooding plays Tre as a man who is strong and confident, but because he is a good person it's trouble in another way: how can you act as a good man in a world that doesn't allow you to be so? Where having a gun is preferable to not having one? For all of the little things and scenes that don't quite work today in the film, there's nevertheless so much resonance and logic to the storytelling that it's hard to not get wrapped up in it. I might look to 'Menace' as being a little better far as filmmaking goes, but this was the gold standard for many years for a reason or two: Singleton takes another step from what Spike Lee started and transposes it into trying to speak about the bigger picture as far as how men treat women in this world, how men treat one another, and what options are there be you decent or a thug (sometimes, in the case of Doughboy, that awful grey area, where you don't know how the f*** to feel).",

            "content": "The men in Boyz N The Hood are reaching that awkward point where you're not a boy, but not quite a man. Dealing with this is hard, but I can't begin to imagine how hard it is when you live in the hood with constant fear of violence, racism, and gang trouble becoming deadly. I live in a small suburban town, almost nothing happens where I live and I'm thankful. It is almost strictly a white town. Racial segregation is common in most neighborhoods, and actor Laurence Fishburne speaks about that in the middle of the film.The movie begins by showing us ten year old Tr\u00e9 Styles who gets in trouble at school, resulting in a suspension. Tr\u00e9 and his other Reva (Bassett) made an agreement that if he got in any more trouble he would be sent to live with his stern father Jason, nicknamed Furious (Fishburne).After half an hour of seeing the young life of the boy, the film fast forwards seven years later. Tr\u00e9 (Gooding Jr.), now seventeen, is trying to pressure his girlfriend into marriage, at the same time juggling school and keeping up with his hoodlum pal Darren, nicknamed Doughboy (Cube) and his football playing brother Ricky (Chestnut). All three boys struggle to live their own lives in a town filled with hatred and gang violence.The main thing the film wants to show is that a strong father figure is very important in a young black man's life. Woman can raise them, but a everybody needs a man for a sense of direction and guidance in difficult times. The character that has the best family is Tr\u00e9, and it shows that it really has an affect on him. At the end of the film, Furious guides him away from possible danger that very well could've saved his life. The audience always asks \"What would've happen if Doughboy had Tr\u00e9's father? Would the outcome change?\" The answer is most definitely.Director John Singleton has made a film that not only depicts realism of gangs without glorifying it in any way, but has a way of treating his characters like true human beings with hopes and dreams. The color of their skin doesn't matter. Just like in Baby Boy, his film that concluded his hood trilogy ten years after this one, he has made a film showcasing blacks outside of their racial stereotype.Besides excellent camera-work and writing, we see the roles that lead Cuba Gooding Jr. and Ice Cube to have many more movie roles. Cuba is at his best in this, and Ice Cube does very well with the drama based script. Seeing him in Barbershop and Friday, I was skeptical if he would play a drama role with goofiness or true sincerity. The outcome was more than I had ever expected, and leads me to question why Cube doesn't spend more time in the drama field of film.Boyz N The Hood is truly a masterpiece in the world of film. Scene after scene is breathtaking and emotional. It is so well acted and so well filmed it almost comes off as a documentary. And above all, everything in the film, every character, moment, line, and event is all crafted so well it's like reality. The scary part is, it's someone's.Starring: Cuba Gooding Jr., Ice Cube, Morris Chestnut, and Laurence Fishburne. Directed by: John Singleton.",

But I have seen Hustle and Flow and Menace 2 Society which were both really good movies surprisingly and one movie that everyone recommends to me was Boyz N the Hood and just praising it, so I finally sat down and watched it the other day and this movie just got to me. This is one of the better acted movies with stories of the ghetto and the thing that I loved about this film was that it had a good strong positive message to never let go of your dreams and don't let stupid people get you down. I was really impressed mainly with the performances in this movie, who didn't have a great performance in this movie? But I think it was Lawerence Fishbourne and Cuba Gooding, Jr. that really steal the show and tell the story so well.Tre is having a hard time in the city where he and his mother live, he gets in trouble at school and she sends him to live with his dad, Furious Styles for the summer to teach him how to be a man. Tre grows up, comes back for a summer, and lives with his dad, seeing old friends and reconnecting with an old flame, one problem, this is all happening in South Central where the shootings are frequent, drugs are being done 24/7, and you have a 98% chance of being a looser that will probably die. He and his two best friends learn how to deal with the possibility of being killed or doing something they can never take back.Boyz N the Hood is a powerful movie that is very impressive, especially for a film that was made under a seven million dollar budget. I would recommend this movie, it is a bit violent and the swearing is persistent, but this is a film about the ghetto. But I felt like this film had a positive message that really made me smile and just kept rooting for these poor boys who had no say in their lives and just had to do the best the could to make it out of these deadly situations where they could die before even making it into an adult life. I really liked Boyz N the Hood, it's a good strong movie that will remind you to hold onto your dreams and don't let anyone get you down.8/10",

It illustrates the fact that the vast majority of black murderers kill black victims. It is in fact the same thing as for white murderers and white victims. Who is the copy cat? Or is it a rule that you murder one of your own? In other words crime is not racist, not even racial, in its vast majority. It is nothing but the result of a social, cultural, ideological, economic and political situation that nurtures it. But the film provides absolutely no answer about that social situation. Cynical black cops who can only repress, even the innocent, when they do something at all, especially when that innocent is black, though most of the time these cops do nothing as for protecting the black community against the crime it feeds and raises in its own heart like a pet in a home. There is no hope except escape, go away as far as possible to free ourselves from the white plot that locks blacks together to produce a self-destructive boiling pot of a community, not even seeing it may be a time bomb that could harm the whole society when it explodes. It only wants to impress the audience with a fate, a fatality and create in its audience a feeling, emotion of total rejection based on disgust, maybe even hatred. But there is no hope anywhere in that film. No hope whatsoever.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Cr\u00e9teil, CEGID",

In fact, I'd be lying if I didn't say that I was a bit choked up when Laurence Fishburne goes on his rant. I wish there was more of that in the film. Sadly, it felt like the rest of the movie was a fairly by-the-numbers story about young people growing up in a dangerous community with a lot of bad influences. Coming-of-age is already a genre that I don't typically enjoy, and adding in the depressing nature of this particular film, I had a tough time with it. Admittedly, I was emotionally invested in the journey of the characters, and I shed a few tears at one point when tragedy struck. Yet I saw it coming. Every beat of this movie felt like something I've seen before in other films, so it was extremely predictable. Many of those movies might have been drawing inspiration from this one, but I just happen to be in a place now where this all seemed rote. I guess at this point I'm looking for a more unique or nuanced approach to these topics, or even films that shine a light on how we can move forward rather than the pessimistic note we are left with here. I can't deny that Boyz 'N the Hood is a well-made movie, and I imagine if I saw it back in the early 90s when I was a teen it would have struck a chord with me and shifted my worldview in some way. Seeing it now, I'm simply left wanting something more, and that may be a problem with me and not the movie itself.",

It has been blamed for ushering in thug movies that stereotype and marginalize the black youth. But I would take a different view and say this film works as a classical neo-realist docudrama and reports to the world what is really going on in several parts of the black community. These were events that were not reported by news stations. John Singleton's characters not only show us what goes on but they give several sides of the issue to ponder. The director shows us three paths but in the end, John's message is to take the path of higher learning which happens to be the subject and title of his next film.Three Paths Doughboy Tre, and Ricky. Doughboy, Ricky and Tre make up the three paths or options for a young black man in South Central Los Angeles. Furious says that they're like brothers. Doughboy took the pathway of gang life. This path came with violence, prison and a deep bitterness towards life. Ricky became a football star. On this path he encountered a lot of parties and party girls.Ricky got a woman pregnant out of wedlock and now he's looking for football scholarship to get into college and take care of his family. Tre took the option of education and a minimum wage job in retail/ customer service. This comes with a steady Christian girlfriend that wants to wait until they get married before having sex.The Blessing Doughboy was cursed by his mother. He did not have a father figure; so, his absence spoke another curse over his life. The only love or blessing he got was from gang members and gang life. Ricky was favored by his mother. She blessed him and believed in his foot ball career. Girls in high school worshiped the ground he walked on. Everyone not only believed he could make it but they were counting on him to make it. When Tre was sent to live with his father his father protected him one night from a house burglar. With that blessing came several nuggets of wisdom. Tre's father Furious Styles taught him that violence is not the answer; he taught Tre to love his brothers; he taught him what it means to be a man and he taught Tre education is the way out.Education as a pathway outAt the end we're left with the idea that education is very very important. Doughboy believes that maybe if the right people were educated as to what was going on in their neighborhood, they would intervene and help. Tre goes off to college and Doughboy goes back into the concrete jungle. We see on the screen that Ricky's SATs were good enough for him to get into college, implying that education was a possible way out for him too.http://parablestoday.blogspot.com/2010/01/boyz-in-hood.html",

When hip-hop was about something apart from the bling-bling and social anger was fermenting just beneath the surface one important hallmark came in the emergence of true classic movies straight from black intellectuals - with Spike Lee and of course John Singleton the guiding light for future generations. \"Boyz in the Hood\" is a mix of \"Godfather\" and \"City of God\", equally pivotal as the mentioned classics, albeit maybe less artistically accomplished, as can be expected by a d\u00e9butant.Set in the South Central district of Los Angeles \"Boys in the Hood\" is a cross examination of life within black ghetto neighbourhoods, bona fide war-zones, although mostly ignored at the times as irrelevant by police and white-led society. Focusing mainly on Tre Styles (Cuba Gooding Jr.), raised by his single dad Furious (Lawrence Fishburne), a true father figure and role model focused on his son's upbringing. His two best friends are brothers: Ricky (Morris Chestnut), an aspiring college football player and Doughboy (Ice Cube), the bad seed of the family, disowned and mistreated by his mother, who lays her hope in the more ambitious son. Growing up in neighbourhood, where - as opening credits inform - one in 21 people are murdered each of them tries to find solace in the situation or a way out.Each of the three main characters carries himself as a stereotype, but are also far from bland cardboard cutouts, instead seamlessly fitting into the prescribed roles envisaged to create a sense of hopeless hope permeating the society. Several scenes do unfortunately scream of amateurish overzealousness, like a tacky sex scene, which does little to deepen the story, fulfilling merely a melodramatic role. Nonetheless these are minor flaw in regards to the strong triumphant direction complimented with a forceful coming out by Cuba Gooding Jr. The drama is hard-hitting, whilst violence is so peculiarly banal in its presence, making the rough edges seem to compliment the overall tone. It is also worth mentioning the strong use of sound enforces the dread of the hood with ever-sounding tyres screeching, helicopters, police sirens and gunshots replacing typical background noise.John Singleton has in future outings proved to be a relative hit-and-miss, still waiting for another such prolific attack on American passiveness. Nonetheless even if he never makes anything of this generation-changing impact he is sure to become part of cinematographic history.",

The first fifteen minutes or so are a clear homage to \"Stand By Me\", even though it might be rougher around the edges. The entire movie works because those early scenes are so well-written, it's painful when all their hopes are crushed later on. The movie is pretty fragmentary and doesn't really follow a coherent story, but thankfully they're just really good fragments. Singleton's bare-bones style combined with realistic performances from the entire cast makes this is an absolute jewel among American independents and one of the 90s' most influential movies.",

Its cultural significance was recognized in 2002 with its induction into the National Film Registry.The story's central character is Tre Styles (Cuba Gooding Jr.), a young man living with his father (Lawrence Fishburne) in the Crenshaw neighbourhood of South Central. At seventeen years of age, he and his closest friends are at a crossroads in their lives that could either lead out of the ghetto or into an early grave.The cast may have been composed of mostly unknowns at the time but it's an impressive ensemble in retrospect. Apart from the aforementioned involvement of Gooding & Fishburne, Ice Cube contributed a creditable performance in his first film role. Strong support was also supplied by Angela Bassett, Morris Chestnut, Nia Long & Regina King, among others.John Singleton's first time direction isn't particularly flashy but it got the job done and resulted in an Oscar nomination. Singleton also garnered a well-deserved Oscar nomination for his thoughtful script. Musically, the score & soundtrack haven't aged uniformly well but that's a minor point in the scheme of things.Ultimately, \"Boyz N the Hood\" represents one of the finest moments in African American cinema and still holds up well more than 20 years after its release. The authenticity of the writing, combined with a simple but powerful message, makes it a memorable and involving story for moviegoers of all backgrounds.",

            "content": "BOYZ N THE HOOD is an incredibly good movie and deserved the best picture Oscar. It starts with audio of gangster type talk and a little boy crying they shot my brother or something and police talk and words come up that say something about the murder rate of black people by other black people then starts following the life of a boy named Tre living in 1984 in south central Los Angeles which is a very rough part of America with a lot of gangs and crime. His mother decides because of trouble he gets into that he should move with his father because she thinks he could raise him better. He does and after some scenes the movie skips to 1991 and follows the teenage life of Tre with his friends and family including troubles he has involved with living where he does. The main thrust of the movie comes when Tre's friend Ricky is outrageously killed by gang members he had gotten into a scuffle with earlier in the movie. Friends of Tre go out and find them and kill them. The next day, Doughboy, the brother of Ricky, and Tre's friend, talks to him sadly about bad things that happen in the hood including his brother's death and the lack of media coverage. As he's walking off Tre tells him he's still got one brother left and Doughboy thanks and hugs him. The movie then says what happened to Doughboy, Tre, and Tre's girlfriend. The screen then blackens and BOYZ N THE HOOD appears then ''Increase the Peace'' appears under that staying for a couple seconds maybe after the movie's title disappears. This is because this represents the main message of the movie. The movie is a statement against violence that goes on in those kind of places, police misconduct, and parental mistreatment and neglect of their children. It works magnificently. The music is great too. This is a very moving emotionally gripping movie. The silence of the lambs sure didn't deserve the best picture Oscar over this. It's amazing to me that a horror movie, and not even a very good horror movie, won best picture over this. Other movies released in 1991 were WAY more deserving of best picture than the silence of the lambs. Especially this one.",

            "content": "I think that how good you find a film like Boyz N The Hood will ultimately depend on what you expect from it. The write up for this film suggests that it's going to be a deep and gritty film that explores the seedy underbelly of South Central. It also suggests that the characters involved will discuss various fundamental issues affecting their daily lives. I'm sorry, but if this is true then I clearly must have watched another film....This film does not explore its characters and doesn't even really explore the violence within South Central. It basically goes from scene to scene with all the 'kids' cussing each other and being disrespectful to their 'ho's'. Then thrown into the mix we have a million f-bombs and lots of shouting. The major problem with Boyz N The Hood is that for the most part it has an aimless, meandering feel to it where for most of its running time you never feel as though it's going anywhere. The dialogue exchanged between the characters is at best poor and at worst irritating. The relationships between the characters are poorly established (particularly between Tre and Furious) and this is unforgivable as this should have had much more focus than it actually did. Many of the characters are dull clich\u00e9s (with the exception of Ricky and Furious). I've got to be totally honest and admit that I was bored for most of this film and considered switching it off at one point.There is one scene that was truly effective in this film and that was the scene where Ricky gets gunned down in a drive-by shooting. I actually found that scene very moving because Ricky was a likable individual - a family man who was on the verge of a scholarship. It was even more sad when you realise that he was always the one that kept out of trouble and was merely 'guilty by association'. I was genuinely moved by that scene and sadly that was the only good scene in the film.Of course this sets up the revenge aspect that we see in the final act and I only wish that Singleton would have focused more on the rivalry we saw towards the end rather than tedious melodrama that I had to endure for most of the running time.Boyz N The Hood is a good film that's trapped inside a terrible screenplay. Although its message is obvious from the start this still could have been a very good film if Singleton would have made the main story more compelling. As it is the tedious melodrama and dull and meandering nature of the narrative really killed this for me. Aside from the one effective scene, I found Boyz N The Hood a very hard film to care about.",

            "content": "The children in the world of Boyz n the Hood have never known a life without a police helicopter shuttling overhead. It has simply become part of the everyday scenery, much like the long faded letters of the police tape. The whirring of the blades serenade the characters throughout their journey; a young couple's first time, the lull after two brothers' final embrace, and so on. We see it early, in a crude crayon drawing that sticks sorely out of place. Police sirens are a similar recurring motif. For Tre and his friends it is not safety that is associated with these sounds, but another sin committed. It makes a bittersweet duet with The Five Stairsteps' O-o-h Child, the song crooning and pleading at the same time for sweet respite for these children. Only some though, have the father figures to do so.This is the most frustrating aspect of the film, in the way that it must cast off black women as problematic and dispensable in order to empower black men. Tre's mother Reva flits in and out of the film, with a vague dissatisfaction on the upbringing of his son despite it being her idea initially. She is a self-affirming ideal, by admitting that it takes a man to raise a man in the hood, something that she apparently cannot provide. She has betrayed her roots by rising above the hood and severing her connection to her son, and so becomes that stuffy stereotype of a divorced parent has no clue how to interact with their child other than showering them with gifts. While she is strong, Brenda is perceived as weak, abandoned by the fathers of both Doughboy and Ricky and desperately fending for herself. She is earmarked as the origin of Doughboy's rough pathway by Furious himself, a passive figure enabling the downfall of her children. Brenda pampers and babies Ricky up, treating him as a financial investment that might lift their family from the hood with his athletic talents. No doubt behind the scenes she is fussing over his shirt and tie before the big interview. And look for how frantically she tries to maintain the illusion of class in her home, brushing off the vermin (Doughboy and his lady) from the couch for the talk. But then Singleton does the nigh impossible, and manages to present a full-faceted character from within this sinking sandpit. He draws great conflict from making this a sympathetic act, something that we can hardly blame her for. It is motherly pride, and the least she can do is make sure Ricky gets his shot. The film makes note of the learned behaviour of the hood, and how it becomes a self-reinforcing cycle between generations. Even the venerable Furious is not spared from this fate; see him answer the phone crudely, and how Tre has picked up the same trait. In her own way, Brenda is also imposing the same vicious cycle, by immediately assuming the blame of Ricky's death lies with Doughboy. She is ultimately right, but that is beside the point - we feel for Doughboy, because this is just the last of a long line of influences that have reaffirmed the criminal path he has taken, and in doing so he knows no other reaction to his brother's death but more death. Early on, Ricky's apparent goodwill with his treasured football is received with hostility, and this becomes ingrained into the children's minds. They learn in the hood that to get what you want, you must take it for yourself. It comes down to Tre then, at the fork-road of his life, to make the right choice. He has the tricky challenge of rising above his friends and being a responsible young man without losing touch with them, which has always been a dilemma for the teenager. He would rather give his father a sexed-up, fantastic music video story about his first time than admit he has not 'gotten any pussy' yet. This later makes the scene of him losing his virginity all the more heart-wrenching; it comes after the primal release of pent-up emotions that goes against all that he has been taught. And yet later Furious must also fall to his level of logic, if only to dissuade him from making this biggest mistake of his life. Singleton is asking those in the hood to accept the responsibility of their actions, to speak up and step out of the car, and in the end Tre triumphs. And Doughboy acquiesces in his own way; he allows Tre to choose his own path, and sees so clearly and sadly how his is almost at its end.",

            "content": "I'm not sure I saw the same movie that others here saw. Not that I don't think it's a very strong effort by Singleton, it is. In fact, his later movies are quite disappointing in comparison. Where I may disagree with some is what this movie is about, and what it has to say. I won't pretend to know what the maker intended, but I know what it communicates to me about life in South Central Los Angeles. I'll start out by saying that I haven't the faintest idea whether this is a real life portrayal of \"ghetto\" America, since I've never spent two minutes in it. But taken as a discrete world, with characters created for it, I found this a very depressing place indeed. Larry Fishburne, in another wonderfully understated performance, plays \"the conscience\" but in fact seems to teach his son to blame someone else for the difficulties around him, an interesting inconsistency with his other lessons in self reliance and responsibility. It seems that many in this neighborhood are more interested in seeing that no one else escapes rather than escaping themselves, or bettering it. The structure of the community they live in isn't awful, in fact most live in smallish houses, but not hovels by any stretch. There seems to be money enough to buy the necessities if not the luxuries--no one is starving. And in fact the most hopeful sign is when the neighborhood comes together at a neighborhood picnic--a real sense of community comes through. Unfortunately it's only a glimmer. The various characters seem to be facing one form of hopelessness or another--even Ricky, attempting to accomplish something through sports is not a viable role model for most in that neighborhood, only the truly gifted manage to make it to scholarship athletics, and there are relatively few of those. Ice Cube, a rapper from the group NWA and not an actor by training, puts in an accomplished performance that a veteran actor would be proud of. When he says: \"They don't know, don't show or don't care\" about the \"hood\", it's as if he's waiting for someone to come and save him. That may be the voice of John Singleton, hard to say, but it runs counter to the idea that people make their own choices and should take responsibility for them. There's a streak of blame game in the movie--about how there some conspiracy somewhere that's causing all the misery. That's a dead end approach. That doesn't detract too much, since as I understand it, that's a real attitude that exists in some quarters. And the performances are uniformly well done--a good marriage of good acting and good writing, there's a lot for these folks to work with.",

            "content": "**Possible Spoilers**\t\tThe problems of inter-city culture, and what it's like to be a black youth growing up in South Central Los Angeles, is addressed by writer-director John Singleton in the   hard-hitting `Boyz N the Hood,' starring Laurence Fishburne and Cuba Gooding Jr.  The story centers on young Tre Styles (Gooding), whose parents are divorced, and as a troubled youth at age ten, is sent by his mother, Reva (Angela Bassett) to live with his father, Furious (Fishburne), in South Central.  The story then jumps ahead seven years, and we find Tre still living with his father. Furious is a man of principle, a decent man with high ideals, and he's done a good job of teaching Tre how to be a man, and how to survive without slipping through the cracks to become just another statistic from the \u0091hood, without hope of ever amounting to anything.  Furious is the calm in the eye of the storm, navigating a culture steeped in a seemingly never-ending cycle of violence.  Then when Tre is about to graduate from High School, and with his father's guidance is looking toward college, his best friend is shot and killed.  Tre wants to fight back; and suddenly, he must make the decision that will determine the path the rest of his life will take. \tSingleton successfully captures the alienation of an entire community from the rest of the city, and the atmosphere of violence that permeates the lives of all who live there; the incessant presence of the police helicopters a constant reminder, lest they forget for even a moment, where they are.  The anguish of the mothers who fear for the lives of their children, along with the frustration of the apparent futility of trying to make a change.  In Tre, Furious, and those close to them, Singleton paints a profound picture of what life is like for everyone who lives within that few square miles that is South Central Los Angeles.  A grim portrait, to be sure, yet in the end he manages to tone it with a positive sign; a glimmer of hope that there may yet be a light at the end of the tunnel for those born and raised in the inner-city. \tFishburne gives a dynamic performance as Furious Styles, the voice of reason and truth amid the turmoil.  He knows who this man is, and his purpose; and it shows in the subtle command he takes whenever he is on the screen.  Gooding, too, gives a remarkable performance, aptly conveying the complexities of young Tre, the pride mixed with confusion.  The terrific supporting cast includes Morris Chestnut (Ricky), Ice Cube (Doughboy), Darneicea Corley (Keisha), Tyra Ferrell (Mrs. Baker), Redge Green (Chris) and Dedrick D. Gobert (Dooky).  Singleton is to be commended for having the courage to make a truly thought-provoking film.  For this is not a movie about gang-bangers; this is a film that has the guts to ask important and significant questions objectively, without copping an attitude.  About the cultural bias of the S.A.T.'s; why there's a liquor store or a gun shop on every corner in the \u0091hood, and not in Beverly Hills; and the lack of even the attempt at creating the symbiotic relationship that would benefit all who live in and around the city of Los Angeles.  This is an important film that goes far beyond the scope of mere cinema, and one for which Singleton will be remembered; it is definitely a movie that should be seen by all.  I rate this one 9/10.",

            "content": "\"Either they don't know, don't show, or don't care about what's going on in the hood.\" These are the words of Ice Cube's character in the powerfully emotional race film, Boyz n the Hood, a story about a group of black kids who grow up in an impoverished and violent inner city neighborhood. It chronicles their lives as they grow up and turn into adults, some setting themselves up for greatness past the hood, while others are perpetually fastened in to the hood's violent gang straps. The film tells a moving story all fueled by racial tension within the black community and just how this affects the lives of those involved. It boasts numerous prominent black actors, many of whom were no names back when the film was released. It portrays a world and a lifestyle that some of us are all too familiar with and others, like myself, are very far from and never experience anything close to the impoverished absurdity that goes on within these \"hoods.\" Boyz n the Hood is a fascinating watch and it is one of those films that can stick with you long after you watch it.Like I said, the lifestyle depicted in this movie is something so far fetched in my mind and it is something I can't relate to or hardly even comprehend as reality. I guess I have to blame my gaited little community of Texas suburbs and what is called \"the bubble.\" But from what I understand, Boyz n the Hood is a very powerful depiction of the reality of these ghettos. And that is really the beauty and joy of a film like this. This kind of world is real and this society exists in our world and a movie like this allows us to witness the brutality of something like this. I don't experience this level of gang violence first hand but I certainly see it on the news enough and am exposed to it second hand via the media. But that's the media. They report facts rather than tell a dramatic story. Thus the dramatization of these kinds of real life situations through a movie like Boyz n the Hood makes that much more important. This movie is an eye-opener in the truest sense of the word.And apart from being socially significant Boyz n the Hood is really a well made film. The hood rat dialouge is very poignant and its vulgarian cadence is very consistent, albeit shocking at times. The mood of the hood setting is captured very well through John Singleton's visual eye and all of the sets seem very true to poverty stricken suburbs that look like they were built in the 60's. Plus all of the performances are excellent. This is basically the movie that began Cuba Gooding Jr's career and began his long run of great performances in the 90's. Laurence Fishburne's powerful performance is a given, but he does an excellent job Gooding Jr's father. Up until this point Ice Cube was only a rapper and Boyz n the Hood was his very first film appearance. And what an appearance it was. He delivers some of the most important lines in the film and does an incredible job when he has to. His is arguably the strongest performance in the entire film, believe it or not.As far as these \"ghetto gangster\" movies go, Boyz n the Hood fits in very well as one of the better ones. The most similar film to this that I can think of would be the Hughes Brother's Menace II Society from 1993 which is slightly better than this film for its own reasons. But it doesn't mean that Boyz n the Hood is an excellent film. It is very moving, very powerful, and very memorable. It is a worthwhile watch that will expose you to some very challenging, yet very real, things.",

The genre of 'hood films' is one that is not popular outside of its targeted rap community, but this specific film is one that doesn't settle for simplistic broad character strokes that most would. John Singleton made inarguably his most personal film in his 1991 debut, and for a number of reasons.Firstly, it has an unflinching and striking depiction of the violence that flourished on the heated streets of this country. It helps to cement the realism and also captures the terror of the film's nicely done atmosphere. Secondly, the characters are not cardboard archetypes, many of them with distinct qualities. Tre's father, played by Laurence Fishburne , as well as his mother (Angela Bassett) both represent how the story offers much more than taking the easy way out with the character development; say for example just slapping a drunken loud-mouth stereotype in the setting.Then one can focus on the spectacular character study, and one can see how this crushing environment affects each character differently. I'd like to point out the golden performance of Cuba Gooding Jr. and. Both are intelligent young men with promising futures and both are committed to getting out of their bleak neighborhood. However, all around them are forces designed for them to fail, as Fishburne's character points out. This also brings me to the tragic character of Doughboy, played by Ice Cube. It's INARGUABLY his greatest role ever. The character is very intelligent yet nihilistic in a sense; he's succumbed to the 'streets' as it were. He seems self-aware of it all, a puppet who can see the strings, but he can never quite find the nerve to make a change. The use of mise en scene is of course to display a decrepit but very real look to the whole film, and it's masterful.I hate to spoil things, but there's a scene where a character is shot in the back, and our director makes it so devastatingly surreal. Everything stops: the yelling, the sound of running, and all you hear is the laughter of children. Then comes the gunshot, and the composer's fantastic score. My favorite scene though, among so many excellent ones, has got to be the conversation between Cuba and Cube at the climax. The word's shared, the hurt in Cube's voice, it all is just so painful when one lingers on what the film means.If you ever take psychology, or have a quick second to browse the vast internet, look up the term 'learned helplessness'.",

Only 23 when this film came out, Singleton's growing up in L.A. with a single real estate dad is the story of Tre (Cuba Gooding, Jr) in this film. Dad raises him to be responsible, and it pays off in the final battle scene when Tre asks to be let out of the car before his friends found and snuffed the guys who had killed Ricky earlier that day. As the captions at the end tell us, Tre went off to college in Georgia, and his girlfriend Brandi (Nia Long) was in college right across the street.The whole film depicts a gunfire-riddled neighborhood of mainly slackers. Every scene in the 'hood has at least one of the boys with a quart of beer that he is working on. All mothers are single. Kids find a dead body and don't think too much of it, except \"it stinks.\" We learn all the conversational phrases of 1991 L.A. - What up? Who dat? Who dis? W'sup? We learn that one in 21 black men will be murdered, and most likely by one of their own.Aside from being mainly autobiographical, why was this film made? Simply as a statement? To show that it is possible to rise above the ghetto if you want to?  I don't know, but it sure puts in perspective a large issue within our society.

Now that I am older and have an appreciation for culture and history, I can see how this film gave voice to a previously voiceless discontent by an entire segment of the population in the city of Los Angeles. The year after this film gained world-wide attention, Los Angeles was on fire for a week and the national guard patrolled the streets with tanks. Just to be clear - Rodney King was not the reason for the 'L.A. Riots'; the relationship between the L.A.P.D. and the communities in South-Central Los Angeles caused the 'L.A. Riots'. Without this film, I do not believe those riots would have taken place at that time. Most likely, something worse would have happened later - but not in 1992. For better or worse, 'Boyz N The Hood' (1991) created a conversation that permanently changed United States race relations and law enforcement practices.RealReview Posting Scoring Criteria:\nActing: 0.5/1;\nCasting: 1/1;\nDirecting: 1/1;\nStory: 1/1;\nWriting/Screenplay: 1/1;Total Base Score = 4.5Modifiers (+ or -):\nOriginality: +1;Authentic Location Shooting: +1;Cultural Significance: +1;Total RealReview Rating: 7.5 (rounded up to 8 for IMDB)",

            "review_title": "Strong message, weak story",
            "content": "Movies like this raise the question of whether movies are most important as arts of work on their own terms or as social statements made to have an impact on the world. Just by habit, I tend to lean towards the first view, and I would guess that most filmmakers do as well, since directors generally seem wary of discussing their work in terms of messages. But obviously not John Singleton; in the very first shot of Boyz n the Hood, the camera pushes towards a stop sign until it looms over the audience. This image sets the mood for the rest of the film, which has a strong impact that, as contradictory as this might seem, is somewhat blunted by the lack of subtlety. It belongs to that group of movies that probably stem most directly from Martin Scorsese's Mean Streets, a film that showed how talented young directors could make a splash with a debut set on their own home turf, particularly home turf far removed from the mainstream of American society. Not that Boyz n the Hood is anywhere as good as Mean Streets, but then I don't think that Singleton's main goal is to top Scorsese: he has a point to make. It's about the poverty and violence infesting South-Central L.A., with three main characters representing the basic options available to a young black man from that background. Cuba Gooding Jr. plays Tre, whose father, Furious Styles (Laurence Fishburne) is determined to raise him with the self-respect and discipline to avoid a life of crime and violence. His friend Ricky Baker (Morris Chestnut) isn't as smart but hopes to get into college on an athletic scholarship. Doughboy, meanwhile, is already immersed in gang life. The main performances are strong, particularly from Ice Cube, whose character is in man ways the most interesting, possessing the self-awareness his life is headed nowhere but not the will to do anything about it. At his strongest, Singleton creates a powerful, bleak portrait of a community under siege from guns, drugs, poverty, and general hopelessness, and he immerses you in this world as well, so that you share with the characters the same sense that all of the exits have been closed off. Whether or not you agree with all of the specific points that Singleton is trying to make, Boyz is unquestionably strong as a statement and a piece of reporting. It's far from a great piece of film-making; the music is intrusive and poorly done, and the story is overly melodramatic- it's not enough that one character has to be murdered to show the tragedy of gang violence, his friends then have to dump his bloody corpse in his living room so that we can see his mother's and his girlfriend's hysterical grief. But melodrama isn't really the main problem; it's more that Singleton's determination to get his message across frequently overwhelms his determination to tell a good story with believably individual characters. Too often the characters seem to be speaking to the audience instead of each other, sometimes to the extent that I expected them to turn towards the camera and issue a final warning. But for all of my criticisms of the movie, in the end I'm not sure how much they mean, because Singleton's focus, as I've already said, really doesn't seem to be on creating great art. If the success of a film is to be measured by whether it accomplishes what it sets out to do, rather than by one's enjoyment of it, than I think Boyz n the Hood would have to rate as a solid achievement.",

Gooding has since made good on his promise (see Jerry Maguire), and Ice Cube has similarly demonstrated an astonishing natural and versatile talent for acting (see Fridays, Three Kings).Final vote: 8 of 10",

Laurence Fishburne hangs along the entire movie with his preaches, and I still wonder if he shows justice to Tre, or if he's being too hard. I can't make up my mind. Then eventually things start to go wrong, and at the end you are touched, as usual in the ghetto-genre. This was a bit of a start for Cuba Gooding Jr, a very good actor that I have respect for, e.g fantastic performances in JERRY MAGUIRE and AS GOOD AS IT GETS. He is very good, and his Tre in BOYZ N THE HOOD is defenitly no excuse. Ice Cube also proves that he can do more than rap, and that is something that most rappers don't really do (take a look at Ice-T).\nJohn Singleton, well, as a director he's good I guess, I haven't seen others of his work, and honestly for a director, compared to other movies, I doubt that this was a difficult movie to make.

Am I saying that Stand by Me, a movie about four white kids in Castle Rock, Oregon, is anything like Boyz n the Hood, a movie about young blacks in Compton, California? Absolutely not. But, there was the opening scene of Stand by Me which rang a bell. \"Do you want to see a dead body?\" is what Vern asked his three other buddies. There were absolutely no other parallels after that. In fact, the bodies were abandoned victims for two different reasons. The first, a kid that was hit by a train and missing in the woods. The second, a victim of murder.Boyz n the Hood was one of, if not the grittiest and realest movie I've ever seen about life in the 'hood. Until 1991 Colors was the only movie I knew of addressing impoverished black neighborhoods with gang problems. I think it was because of this movie that movies like Menace to Society, South Central, Juice and others were made. I don't know that John Singleton has directed a better movie to this date.I would say that Boyz n the Hood was exactly what some needed to see and too much for others. The lifestyle and conditions portrayed were not glorified so as to make it seem cool to be involved in gangs and drive-bys, yet it wasn't overly despondent whereby you get the feeling that everyone in the hood is doomed.

From looking at his later films and seeing it now from the way I look at films now \"Boyz n the Hood\" does look a little amateurish but it is still a magnificent piece of work! The casting is almost perfect! They couldn't have found better actors to play the parts in this film even if they tried. To say Ice Cube never played in a film before this one says a lot about his talents. Even the smallest unnoticeable things Ice Cube did in this film were convincing. Another good thing about this film is the messages that are spread though out it. Everything from demeaning women, racism, police brutality, gangbanging, and gentrification is talked about in this film which also makes this a film for everybody to learn from and enjoy. Overall, this film is a master piece that probably won't be matched by any other of its kind.

BoyZ N the Hood not only explores socio-economic problems, but explores issues of race that are not as simple as black against white.

This was the kind of experience I had watching this movie.  John Singleton wrote and directed a deeply inspired coming-of-age drama that gives his audience a picturesque look at what it's like to grow up in the hood.  Yet Singleton never gets overly sentimental.  He tempers much of the drama with humor.  The performances are right on target.  Sometimes I see now-famous actors in their earlier works and I'm not as impressed.  That wasn't the case with Cuba Gooding, Jr. who absolutely shines in this early performance.  Needless to say, Laurence Fishburne and Angela Bassett also give powerful performances, both of whom possess intense screen presences.  Ice Cube probably gives the best performance of his career.  He has proved in other movies that he's a decent actor, but in this one he actually proves to be good.  I tend to be a sucker for these types of coming-of-age stories, like \"A Bronx Tale\" and \"This Boy's Life,\" but every once in a while a bad one comes along.  This is definitely not one of them!  I laughed, I was moved, I was riveted.  Plus, I must mention that the film breaks away from certain stereotypes among African=Americans.  For example, Tre's parents aren't on welfare and food stamps, but people with decent jobs that pay decent salaries, as well as being well-educated.  Of course, South Central does have its share of deadbeat, crackhead mothers and others of that sort, and they are portrayed as well in this film.  But they don't compose the whole S.C. population.  \"Boyz N the Hood\" IS really as great as it was hyped up to be.

            "content": "Ice Cube failed in Anaconda but I gave him another shot in Boyz 'N he Hood. The gang life is not easy and making a movie about it can be even harder, probably not but I wouldn't know. With the title and summary of the movie I knew this could be one of two movies, one, a violent bloodbath of gang violence with obvious characters and little story, or the exact opposite. Boyz 'N the Hood has really good characters, a deep and meaningful story, and a well developed look in the gang life of California. I don't know how accurate this movie is to the gang life in the 1990s but I felt sympathy for all the characters living in that life and it is hard to believe people actually live like that in real life.The story follows the life of Tre, a really intelligent, black, man struggling with the life he lives in. Lawrence Fishburne plays Tre's father and he is an incredible character. I will start this review praising his awesomeness and knowledge of the real world. He is a man who understands the life he lives in and he does not want that for his son. From a very young age he teaches his son how to be a man and how to avoid the life. He is a great role model for his son and brings a lot of depth to the movie. There is a scene when he prevents gang violence and goes on a rant about why the hood is the hood. He says something along the lines on the government wants blacks to kill each other. On every corner of the ghetto there is a liquor store and a gun store. That is the true meaning of the movie, or the deeper meaning. Gang violence destroys people's lives and it is pointless. The movie exaggerates how the gangs know it is pointless but they do it because they have to. Ice Cube's character hits on this point too, being the gangster of the movie and the head of his own crew. Its characters like Tre and Ricky which give people hope. Fishburne and Ice Cube did fantastic in the roles they were given. They went above and beyond and put more than 100% in their performance but Cuba Gooding Jr. plays Tre as an adult and he was underwhelming. I'm not the biggest fan of Cuba Gooding Jr. I don't think he is a great actor but I think he was a good choice for the role. Tre seemed almost unimportant and I don't think it was because of how the story was written, I believe it was because of how he was acted. Tre is different. He doesn't want to live the thug life. He wants to be a success and movie out of the hood. Gooding Jr. didn't act that out so well. His character was boring at times and it took all the way to the end to get any emotion out of him. I liked his character as a kid way better than an adult. That's a huge complement on the child actor, or a slap in the face to Cube Gooding Jr. you decide. Towards the middle of the movie Ricky has a chance to go to college. Ricky is a great character as well. He isn't so smart but he is good at football. He was another example of people wanting to get out of the hood and his only chance was football. This is the case for a lot of young people trapped in the gang life. Unfortunately, his story was more than predictable and half way through the movie I knew exactly how it was going to end. I wasn't surprised by the ending at all but it didn't take away from the movie as much as I thought it would. The very last scene with Tre and Ice Cube was so emotional and deep it saved the movie for me. It made me able to look past the predictability and enjoy the movie. Throughout this review I mention the thug life or the gangster life and I did not expect so much detail of the life in the movie. At one point there is a little girl in a diaper and Tre picks her up before a car hits her. Tre returns her to her mother and all the mother cares about is getting a fix. She didn't care about her child and wanted cocaine instead. \"You selling rocks.\" She says. I know it's a movie but I believed that happens in real life and it made me sick. I like how Tre had a great relationship with his father. I expected him and his father to clash heads and argue, but they didn't. In more ways than one this movie surprised I liked it way more than I thought I would. Overall, Boyz 'N the Hood was very emotional, very impactful, very practicable, but very good and I can see myself watching it again and again. I can look past the obvious endgame and enjoy the cinematic experience. Ice Cube gave me a surprising performance while Cuba Gooding Jr. disappointed me. Lawrence Fishburne gave the best performance I have ever seen him in and I expected nothing less. With a title like Boyz 'N the Hood I expected the violent bloodbath. I did not expect the emotional roller-coaster and lovable and relatable characters. This movie surprised me a lot and I'm proud to give it the WillyT Honorable Mention.",

Even though there have been parodies against this movie, it still has a strong & powerful message.  It explored the plight of South Central L.A. without sugar coating it with dance routines, and lame comedy.  John Singleton aimed for the jugular when he directed this masterpiece of growing up in South Central, and he succeeded in delivering the message that there is a war going on in our citie's neighbourhoods that cannot be ignored any longer. This was also the first John Singleton movie that I ever saw of his.  Since this one he has maintained a steady stream of great movies like \"Poetic Justice\" and \"Baby Boy\", just to name a couple.  \"Boyz In The Hood\" was a must get for my video library, because even though it was made 12 years ago, the message of this movie remains pertinent today: \"Increase The Peace\".",

            "content": "I remember seeing this debut film from Oscar nominated director John Singleton (Shaft, 2 Fast 2 Furious) in college, I could only picture the certain moments, so I really wanted to see it again. Basically it focuses on three young African American boys growing up in South Central inner city Los Angeles in the hood, i.e. surrounded by violence, alcohol, crime and drugs. Ten year old Tr\u00e9 (Desi Arnez Hines II) is left by mother Reva Devereaux (Angela Bassett) to live with father Jason 'Furious' Styles (Laurence Fishburne), and he hangs with his ten year old trouble making friends, half-brothers Doughboy (Baha Jackson) and Ricky (Donovan McCrary), and also Little Chris (Kenneth A. Brown). Seven years later, the three friends have stuck with each other through their approaching adulthood, and all are going different directions in the tough neighbourhood. Tr\u00e9 (Cuba Gooding Jr.) still living with his father is still learning how to be real man, while making a relationship and losing his virginity with Brandi (Big Momma's House's Nia Long). Ricky (Morris Chestnut) is trying to become a professional all-American athlete by getting a scholarship in sports, specifically football, but finding it hard to do. Doughboy (Ice Cube) is still big and lazy, and occasionally getting involved with the violence, alcohol, and crime around, but not losing sense of pride or honour. The most challenging scene is where Ricky has offended a gang of thugs, and Tr\u00e9 witnesses them gun him down in cold blood, on the day he would have received his test results. While Mrs. Baker (Tyra Ferrell) and others are screaming with shock and despair, Tr\u00e9 planned to go with Doughboy to find the gang and shoot them dead, but after some words from father Furious, he changes his mind at the right time. In the end, Tr\u00e9 and Doughboy part ways but on good terms, and the final texts reveal what they did next, half good half bad. Also starring Redge 'Regi' Green as Chris and Meta King as Brandi's Mom. It is amazing to think director/writer Singleton was only twenty-three at the time, and with a brilliant cast of black actors, great scripting, and quite a powerful premise of growing up in rough areas, it is definitely a must see drama. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen for Singleton. It was number 19 on Film 4's 50 Films To See Before You Die. Very good!",

            "content": "Spike Lee's \"Do The Right Thing\" in 1989 was the start of the \"hood\" film genre. Two years later, young director John Singleton did his first film that has since been regarded as the mother of all hood movies. I do think that \"Do The Ring Thing\" is better, but Boyz N the Hood has more humanity and has more morals, which is why it is still raved as being the best of the genre.Boyz N the Hood is a coming-of-age film about a group a young people living in Compton. Cuba Gooding Jr. stars in the centre of the film as Tre Styles, a smart kid who is bound for bigger and better things. As a child, he was given full custody to his father, Furious Styles (Laurence FIshburne) so that he doesn't grow up like other people is LA's ghetto. Furious is an investment broker and Vietnam War veteran, who is determined to raise his son with the proper obedience. Morris Chestnut and Ice Cube co-star as siblings who are Tre's best friends. Them and a few of their friends do their best to stay out of trouble. But robberies and gang violence are part of the everyday. The whole time, we wonder how the pacifism that Furious taught will actually remain a part of their lives.We get a perfect glimpse into South Central Los Angeles. The police abuse their power on its residents. Its not much of a race-related thing since one of the most brutal cops is black. It is about class. Los Angeles is divided, and the ghetto is too. There's a very famous scene where the a gang cons Ricky into taking his football. But aside from that, there's always rival gangs in ghettos. Not only are we taken into this neighbourhood, but the characters that inhabit this area are real. Ricky loves football, Doughboy is the fat brother who got the short end of the stick, and Tre wants out. Simple gang violence leads to deaths. Tre may have to go against his father's orders in order to ensure survival.This is a very precious film about survival and loyalty. Tre and his friends are lucky to grow up around somebody like Furious. It is not a a movie with black guys swearing and killing like so many other hood movies are. There are actual messages and life lessons, with real characters that draw us into a real place.Do The Right Thing started the genre, but Boyz N the Hood remains in its top spot.4/4",

John Singleton captures the true essence of the problems in Compton by filming this in South Central LA and by pulling no punches. This is a story which needed to be told and needed to be conveyed in as brutally honest a manner as possible. There are no cliches here, just honesty in the storytelling.Technically speaking, the acting and direction were brilliant. Lawrence Fishburne is a fantastic actor and did not disappoint. Neither did Gooding or Ice Cube, both of whom gave extremely moving performances. Take note of the scene in which Gooding goes to his girlfriend's house after being harassed by cops.One of my favorite scenes in this film involves Styles (Fishburne) describing to Trey and Ricky the ways that society is turning them and their neighbors against one another and about the need to unite in order to save their neighborhoods, rather than continuing to fight one another. It is a central theme throughout the film and it is one which we should all consider.A brutally honest film with a critical message:Increase The Peace",

            "content": "Some films hang around at the back of your mind for days, like the aftermath of a bad dream, influencing your mood and giving you a feeling that all is not well, for no apparent reason. John Singleton's\" Boyz n the Hood\" (1991) did that to me. If I could sum it up in one image, it would be that of a kid lowering the car window and pointing his gun at anything that caught his attention. It conjures up a darkness, a barbaric senselessness, an uncivilised malevolence that infects the spirit.I was surprised at the difference between the two halves of the film when watching it again recently. The first seems to be infused with light. OK. Laurence Fishburne unleashes his gun on an intruder in his house the night he takes in his son. He has accepted the responsibility of caring for him at the request of his ex-wife, who wants to concentrate on finishing her masters degree in teaching and establishing her own career. Fishburne's physical resemblance to Samuel L. Jackson always leads me to expect a \"And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy My brothers\u0085\" kind of tirade every time his bulky frame fills the screen. Instead we get the warm and cuddly velvet glove over the just as powerful, iron fist threatening presence. We saw that persona in Michael Apted's 1991 film, \"Class Action\", in which Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio produced a female version of the Samuel L. Jackson style of acting.So, after violently defending the home he will share with his son, we see him him singing along with his favourite soft soul music song on the car radio and spending time fishing and passing on his philosophy of life. That's the first half of the filmThe second is so much darker. Now the father is preaching to his son, his friend and interested bystanders on the need for African Americans to retain the identity they have given to their neighbourhoods and to resist the seductive offers by real estate agents bent on acquiring their houses with a view to gentrifying those areas.The son (Tre ,played by Cuba Gooding Jr.) and his football champion childhood friend and neighbour (Ricky Baker, played by Morris Chestnut) are both determined to improve their prospects in life by means of getting a tertiary education. But then the dark forces of meaningless violence masquerading as a means to earn 'respect' impinge upon their quest to leave their troubled environment.Paradoxically, it is the innocent, mild mannered Tre who sets the tragic events in motion, when he objects to being shouldered out of the way by an outsider at the local hangout. That action unleashes the forces of evil, revenge and vendetta. It is powerful stuff. Tre opts out of the savagery. Ricky and his delinquent brother are murdered.At the conclusion of the film, Singleton places the words, \"increase the peace\" on the screen.In the context of the film, that gesture is quite dramatic. But in the cold light of day - it is just words. How can anyone \"increase the peace\" in such an environment. And it is not just the 'drive by shooting' infested areas of inner city Los Angeles. Australians were sobered on 21 August 2013 by an event described by CNN as \"A random act of violence has left a promising 23-year- old college baseball player dead, a family devastated and two countries half a world apart rattled. Christopher Lane, who was from Australia, was gunned down in Duncan, Oklahoma, while he was out jogging last week. The motive? Three teens who had nothing better to do, according to police.\"That got me thinking about how Americans, with their fiercely protected rights to bear arms could \"increase the peace'. It brought to mind the concept of \"hot spot policing\". (New York mayor Rudolph Giuliani corrupted the initial concept and turned it into \"zero tolerance policing\"). Hot spot policing worked on the basis that some areas had effectively been turned into war zones. Violence reigned. So the authorities instituted a TEMPORARY version of \"zero tolerance policing\". Once order had been restored, and the forces of darkness had been moved on, the heavy policing of that locale ceases. So what about the argument it is just shifting the problem elsewhere. It is not a problem. When the problem moves to a new location, a new \"hot spot policing\" area can be declared for the area to which they have moved, and the same processes can be instituted. Areas should only be declared to be hot spots for a defined time. The status should be temporary - not permanent. So why not ban all weapons from such \"hot spot policing\" in public areas? All such weapons would be seized by the police and destroyed in a weekly public ceremony within seven days of seizure.Such a policy should not need to an affront to members of the NRA. People, like Tre's father, who keep their guns at home for use against intruders would not be affected. It would only be those involved in drive by shootings, or those who carry guns with them as a means to demand \"respect\" in places that could be temporarily declared to be \"hot spots\"Australia (which does not have any right to bear arms laws) instituted a \"gun buy back\" for automatic weapons after a gruesome mass shooting in 1996. The gun buy-back scheme started on 1 October 1996 and concluded on 30 September 1997.The buyback purchased and destroyed more than 631,000 firearms, mostly semi-auto .22 rimfires, semi-automatic shotguns and pump-action shotguns.

            "content": "After his Cannes triumph and a remarkable box office return on the dollar when it hit theatres in the summer of 1991,John Singleton's writing/directing debut feature \"Boyz In The Hood\" got him dual Oscar nominations at the ripe young age of 24. Juggling half a dozen characters with ease it was a cautionary tale about three friends through young adulthood in a impoverished neighborhood where life and death was a constant struggle to survive against impossible odds. This was a movie that dealt upfront with the trials and tribulations of a young man's growing up in the mean streets of South-Central Los Angeles,California. This was a movie that hit a nerve with its audience and it shows in detail of a young man's odds to survive at all costs in a hellhole of a ghetto where poverty and violence were everyday occurrences. This was a movie that gave the audience a profound look at life on the streets and gets a realistic approach to the everyday happenings that are out there and the dangers that are out there,especially the gangs. Even after 15 years later,it still packs a punch and stands up very well with the standards of today.This was the ultimate \"ghetto\" film which will never be topped. The movie \"Boyz In The Hood\",came out during a slew of films of that period including \"New Jack City\"(1991),the Hughes Brothers' \"Menace II Society\"(1993),and \"Jason's Lyric\"(1994). Even fifteen years ago,the film,\"Boyz In The Hood\" brought some of the new fresh faces in black cinema at the time and they after this movie went on to bigger and better things. Newcomers Cuba Gooding,Jr.(who played Tre Styles) and Morris Chestnut(his best friend Ricky),along with Nia Long,Regina King and even Angela Bassett(who plays Tre's mom)present excellent performances,but the real performances from this movie come from Laurance Fishburne,who was memorable as the complex authority figure-the single dad who raises his son in a hostile environment where he worries that his son could be killed at any moment. The \"real\" performance comes from the debut of rapper/actor Ice Cube as \"Doughboy\" is enough to make the film stand out. Even for a actor who is better known for his explicit lyrics on records,Ice Cube gives the most realistic performance that I have ever seen and it shows in his breathtaking and memorable range as an actor.

            "content": "Cinema that for once speaks the language of the streets - a language that maybe even crosses racial divides. As a film it's got an unfair reputation in my neighbourhood that comes from all the wannabe gangsta's hoping to emulate some of the lifestyles that they've seen on screen. One can't help lamenting that in aspiring to this they've missed the point entirely. \"Menace II Society\" is another one THAT crowd all adore; but unfortunately I haven't had an opportunity to watch the latter just yet. I'm unsure how you make a film that's honest in its verisimilitude without at least PARTIALLY glamourizing - I guess that would be why I'm not a director, then... !The 'elevator' type music occasionally in the background sometimes lends this the air of a daytime soap; especially coupled with the movie adopting somewhat of a 'sermonizing' tone every now and then, complete with symbolism that some might well consider 'overdone' (extreme closeup of the 'Stop' sign at the beginning, for example!) This brand of heavyhandedness belongs somewhere else; threatening to undermine as it does the gritty urban subject matter.One of the many things the film DOES have in its favour though is a wealth of talented black performers - Fishbourne in particular doing yet more superb work that makes it all the easier to spot when he's 'coasting' in other projects (a la \"The Matrix\"!) Everybody brings a 'weight' and a strong sense of 'social conscience' to the enterprise that's belied in a way by the silly 'street slang' of the title. No trivial, cursory examination of the issues, this. Singleton establishes the tone quickly by exerting a strong directorial control that I'm willing to admit pleasantly trumped any preconceptions I may've held before watching. Constantly there is a violent undercurrent and a persistent feeling that anything is capable of happening within the narrative world that has been so disturbingly recreated. We must never forget that for many people this life is of course a reality, and not merely a diverting fiction, as I might be tempted to think of it in the reasonably affluent white lifestyle that I lead. Not of course that one should feel guilty about the relative safety that one was borne into; but it's films as accomplished as this one that are capable of jarring people out of their comfort zones and forcing them to look at life on the other side of the fence. It's an experience that can only make you a better person should you give yourself into it. \"Boyz N the Hood\" represents a crucial landmark in cinematic history. 10/10.",

            "content": "Most people may consider this movie to be in the category as a \"ghetto film\", but as to me and maybe even others, its a relating film. I say this because each event that has happened in this movie is similar to events that i have seen during my life. Considering my point of view, this movie was basically based on a couple of young men growing up in the hood struggling trying to protect themselves from the all the dangers of the South Central streets. This movie relates to a lot of what really goes on in these types of communities.In the movie, there was one part that caught my attention which was when Doughboy(Ice Cube) was on the porch talking to Tre(Cuba Gooding Jr.)and said exactly \"Either they don't know, it don't show, or they just don't care about whats going on in the hood.\" As of speaking for my past, I did believe that specific quote. Back then, when you would turn on the news, they would almost never tell about incidents that happened in the hood. Because of that, i can really relate to how Doughboy was feeling in the movie. Even though Doughboy rarely showed any emotion to how he felt, i could still feel the pain that he would go through daily. The impression that the actors gave me in the movie felt so realistic. You could tell that they held anger in their hearts because of the things that would happen in their community. In my opinion, the turning point of the movie was when Doughboy brother,Ricky(Morris Chesnut), got shot and killed. The bad thing about it was that he was one of the few in their hood that was actually trying to get to college and make something of his life. When he got killed, i felt that everybody came to a \"breaking point\". Ricky's brother, along with his friends, found the need to seek revenge. They felt that the guy who shot Ricky, owed them his life. I can just imagine how Doughboy felt when he had to carry his own dead brother into their home and try to explain to his mother what happened. The thing that bothered me was that when Mrs.Baker(Tyra Ferrell) broke down and started accusing Doughboy of killing her son Ricky.Even though Doughboy and Ricky did get into a fight earlier before Ricky got shot, Mrs.Baker should have known better that her own son would never kill his own brother. This, I could tell enraged Doughboy. On the other hand, Tre,being the loyal friend he was, felt that he also needed to catch revenge on the people that killed Ricky. To me, Tre was actually one of the lucky ones that actually had a father to look up to at the time. His father Furious(Laurence Fishburne)was like Tre's guardian angel. It was his father that had to talk him out of catching revenge on the guys that killed Ricky. Even though Ricky was one of Tre's best friends, Tre's father did not want him to go out there and mess up his life and end up in jail like the many others. Even though Tre did leave with Doughboy to go catch revenge, he did not go through with it. Tre actually took the advise giving by his father and just left the situation in the hands of Doughboy and the others. Overall I can say that this is one of my top favorite movies. I really enjoyed the actors because they fit so well with their character. The showed great amounts of emotion from their anger, their tears, and their sincerity in their words. To me, this has been marked one of the greatest works of John Singleton and shall be remembered for many years to come.",

He gives us fascinating and tragic story of living in \"the hood,\" the poorer, almost all Black and Hispanic sections of Los Angeles. It shows us the story of Tre (Cuba Gooding Jr.), as he tries to make good decisions in the face of a world where good decisions are rarely rewarded. It shows the conflicting values of loyalty, honor, pride, and vanity, and how to deal with them in a place where going to the store can get you killed.  This danger brings a sense of dread to even the most innocuous scenes.  The danger serves the dual purpose of making us even more invested in these characters, and more importantly, to give insight to the constant fear that pervades \"the hood.\"  Yet, Singleton makes an intensely moral film that argues that restraint, effort, and self reliance are the ways to make it out of \"the hood.\"   Lawrence Fishburne plays Tre's father as the moral center in this film that is strong, fair, tough, and in its own way, perfect.",

The Hughes Brothers (Menace II Society, Dead Presidents) helped the Hood movie make the transition from \"Anti-Establishment\" to becoming \"The Establishment\"!

            "review_title": "The importance of a father figure - probably the main point of the film",
            "content": "Being from Australia, my understanding and familiarity with issues of gang violence and south central los angles is fairly limited. While I don't take everything in this film as gospel, it certainly was a thought-provoking and powerful movie.However, I feel that some people misread what the messages of the film were, probably because they had a preconceived idea of the underlying themes that would be self-evident in a film concerning 'the hood.' I felt that it did not particularly deal with, or perhaps, harp on about racism. Instead, it chose to focus on daily life against a backdrop of crime, violence, drug dealing and substance abuse. However, while there is a presumption that such surroundings automatically breads crime and disaster, Singleton didn't shy away from the view that choice survives. Tre is presented at the start of the film as a boy who seems to be encountering behavioural problems at school - perhaps the early indications that he is about to wonder the path leading nowhere.Tre's mother sends him to live with his father - almost as if it's a punishment of sorts. Singleton appears to emphasise that Tre's mother is not going to display a forgiving attitude towards her son's misbehaviour, while reinforcing that her concern for his welfare stems from her love and hopes for a good life. In short - she made a tough choice in the best interests of and out of genuine love and concern for her child. Singleton rightly endorses her as a terrific mother. Tre's father is subsequently introduced early and while he appears to be a comparatively strict parent, you begin to understand what Singleton is really trying to point out: the importance of a male authority figure and role model. Consider it closely and reflect on the various times in the film that an aspect of parenthood is canvassed. Tre's father says to Tre \"I'm trying to teach you responsibility\" and that his friends don't have anyone to show them importance of taking responsibility for yourself. Namely, they don't have fathers.In the early stages of the film, Doughboy (as a child) is arrested for stealing. At this time, we notice that Doughboy has been raised by a single mother who is portrayed as young and irresponsible, not to mention the fact that she fails to adequately discipline Doughboy or instill a responsible attitude. When the film jumps to stage where they are nearing the end of high school, Doughboy's mother is portrayed as a wiser and sharper women and a more capable parent. If only she'd waited till she was older and wiser before having children. It was interesting to note that Singleton used the character to Ricky to show that not all children of irresponsible parents become criminals. But then again, Singleton wasn't afraid to insert the fact that Ricky - the naturally good son with a more positive attitude and a bright future - also has a child before finishing high school. In fact, Singleton seems to point out his disapproval of young parents several times throughout the film. When we learn that Tre is a virgin because he was afraid of being a father, his reasoning may seem odd to some, but his responsible attitude and \"smart choice\" ethic starts to become more apparent. This culminates to the end of the film where Tre is forced to make, what may well be, the most serious choice in his life. This is really where Singleton reenforces the need for young men to have a father-figure; a male role model who can teach them to make the right choices. The consciousness and smart-choice attitude is why Tre asked Doughboy to pull over the car and let him out towards the end of the film.Singleton even expresses his view on this subject early in the film. Remember the scene in the first 30 minutes or so where Tre's father and Tre are fishing and he asks Tre \"what do you know about sex?\" Here, he teaches his child from an early age that \"any fool with a dick can make a child, but only a real man can raise his children.\" It would appear that this was one of the main messages of the film.As well as this, also stand back and consider how Singleton assembles the film. The first section is an insight into the children, their current circumstances and their surroundings. Then, cut to eight years later and here is where they are, now that they are about to enter adulthood. Singleton seems eager to point out this connection between responsible home life/irresponsible home life and how the children of such homes turn out years later. Ironically, Doughboy was being arrested for the first time at the end of the \"childhood\" section of the film and had just come out of jail (for what was probably his third, fourth, fifth offence?) at the start the \"eight years later\" section of the film.Downside: I thought this film rose above the \"this is all the white man's fault\" line, but there was a scene or two where it featured unnecessarily. That wasn't the focal point of the film",

I just hope that there can be a resolution to these situations one day and it is a shame that 30 years on it is still happening. I live in a small town in Devon, England where these situations, if they happen are very few and not so extreme and have only been occurring very recently, so I can say without doubt that I am not down with the kids in the hood.With that in mind, my rating for this film is very low (1), because it's just not my thing.",

He puts on a real tough act and leads everything. Ricky is cool as the jock and Tre is good as the student who's actually going somewhere. I know people say this is a powerful and emotional film to watch, especially when you've had friends fall to some of these situations; the movie is mainly good for them. I also think it is good if you live in a neighborhood where absolutely nothing happens. Cars just sit outsde and nobody leaves their houses. Then this movie is good to watch. There is actually activity. I'm not saying it's good to be in danger for your live when you go to the store, but it's cool to see that people hang out together. And then I'm sure there's more here to some people, people who know these situations. But for me, it's cool to watch the different types of people react to the same neighborhood. and lead it and try to get through it. I also like the music. There is one song in particular, when the boys are going to meet the people who confront who have it against Ricky, if you know I mean, and Doughboy goes to make sure they stay the way he wants them, that music in particular I like.

Most importantly, the film seems unwaveringly true to the reality of growing up black in South Central L. A.

            "content": "Boyz in the Hood, a break out film for writer and director John Singleton, chronicles the difficult task of black youth trying to climb out of a crime-ridden neighborhood in Los Angeles and their choices. The film vividly and with detail depicts the life of these young black men from different family structures in an inner city community.Three characters illustrate the different life paths taken. Tre' (played by Cuba Gooding Jr.) started out living with his mother Rita (played by Angela Bassett). When he began to get in trouble at school as a teenager, he is to live with his father Furious Styles (played by Lawrence Fishburne). Furious lives in a neighborhood crime and gangs are common. Tre' immediately find two friends who are brothers: Ricky (played by Morris Chestnut) and Doughboy (played by Ice Cube) who are from a single parent home where a father is not present.Although Tre', Ricky, and Doughboy are friends, they each choose a different direction. An example is a scene where after spending time together as friends they each choose to do something different with the rest of their after noon. Tre' goes fishing with his father Furious, Ricky plays with his football, and Doughboy goes to the store. While at the store, Doughboy decides to steal and is taken to juvenile jail. This was the beginning of Doughboy's life of crime and gang activity. In another scene, Ricky has a recruiter from USC visit his home and discuss a possible scholarship if he can obtain the appropriate score on the SAT. Tre' spends a lot of time with Furious and is taught how he will use his intellect to succeed in life.John Singleton uses music, sound, and dialog to bring to life the mood and feel of a crime-ridden neighborhood. The music chosen is reflective of the tenseness and violence of the area. The use of hard-core rap especially in scenes with Doughboy was appropriate setting the tone of the action. A nice contrast was the R&B music during the scenes with Furious and Tre'. Along with the rap music, the dialog adds to the authenticity of the film. While there is cursing throughout the film, it is used in context of what is happening in the scene. Other dialog between Rita and Furious portray the struggle between divorced parents in determining what is best for Tre' and his future. Finally, the use of background sound like gunshots, helicopters, and crying babies add to the overall feel of the film.The shooting of Ricky at the end of the film is similar to the shooting violence in the beginning of another John Singleton film Poetic Justice. Each exposed the agony of young lives cut short by inner city violence. Justice (played by Janet Jackson in Poetic Justice) and Tre' must learn to move forward in their lives and not let the tragedy claim their future.Overall, John Singleton portrayed the difficult choices young black men make everyday to try to escape or survive violence in crime-filled neighborhoods. All through the film, he exposes how the choices made by each young man affect them and their loved ones.",

Lawrence Fishburne is superb as the 'wise' dad trying to raise his son in the rough streets of LA. Cuba Gooding Jr. also provides a solid performance as a young man in the path of discovering what he is and what he wants to do. Often uncomfortable to watch, but a very good film highlighting the horrid conditions of inner city ghettoes like those in South Central Los Angeles, in America \"the land of the beautiful\". Released at a time when the African American Civil Rights movement was in a great decline, this film is an important example that highlights the ongoing social oppression of African Americans in the \"greatest nation on Earth\" -8.5/10-",

            "content": "I believed that this was always a more emotionally challenging film rather than it being more powerful.   I saw this when I was 13 I think and it was my sister who showed it to me and said after watching it I would be grateful not to be in these people's position and for once in my sibling's life she was telling the truth.   I never knew who Ice Cube was and the same goes for Cuba Gooding but he wasn't that well known anyway unless you were a huge Coming To America fan and noticed him sitting in the barber's chair.  \nWhen seeing it for the first time I was amazed by it but looking back at it now it isn't so much as strong but for a 13 year old to watch it and come out of it thinking about being in that kind of life is quite an achievement in it's own right as many that age don't.  As far as story goes it is far better than Menace To Society but I find Menace to be a lot more powerful as a film and that's what I look for when watching these kind of films.   The characterisation of Boyz n The Hood is brilliant and every character has it's own story and thoughts throughout.   Laurence Fishburne sticks out in my mind most as the devoted and preaching father Furious.   If all children had a father like Furious then the world wouldn't have problems with it's teenagers as he tries to keep Tre on the straight and narrow.  I do think though he is portrayed to hard on Tre as Tre does nothing out of order till the very end and is always on at him and I was thinking to myself `Yeah help your son at all times and guide him to the right direction but don't shout at him so much for him not being exactly like him'.  just thought I would share that with you.   John Singleton has only made one film that is just as good as Boyz and that was Higher Learning but for a 23 year old to direct a film that hadn't been tried before was a big gamble but a valuable one.   I was quite surprised Laurence Fishburne, Ice Cube and Morris Chestnut were not provided with Nominations at the Oscars.  Actually I have funny feeling Fishburne did but I still think Cube should have had a nod.  Cuba Gooding was also good but I thought Morris Chestnut had a much more demanding Ricky as he was very convincing as the troubled and trapped Ricky.",

            "content": "This is the one, that started it all off, the new, fresh stream of black gangland movies, marking a new generation of film, and young talented filmmakers, and what a hell of a way to start it off, with still argubly the best, rawest, real life depiction in the life in the deadly burbs of east LA. Director, John Singleton, is a young director who impressed me so much. Where there on, he made more of these fine potent dramas. You couldn't ask for a better set of actors in this, notably Ice Cube, who brings a fresh character talent to the role, of the loser brother, to his younger wannabe athlete one, who sadly makes for one pof the most dramatic moments. Boyz is so bloody entertaining though, from start to finish. The whole film just has you, and really brings an admirable realism, much thanks to these great actors here. Fishburne and Bassett, who, of course teamed up again later, are fabulous. You really feel what it's like to live here, where at times, it chokes you with it's intensity. Following a frightening statistic at the start, we follow in the liife, of little Tre, and watch him grow up. When first taking rsidence with his Pop ((Fishburne) he's made to rake up all the leaves, a job I absolutely hated when I was young, even if done for pocket money. A repellent character I really couldn't stand, was the big black cop, if living the fantasy of a white cop, over abusive, over threartening, and overacted, who thought he was different to others of his race. Boyz is still regarded as the best of these films, and like East LA, that is something which isn't gonna change. It must be seen.",

Usually when you are excited for a movie, your really almost setting yourself up for failure. Not with Boyz N The Hood, it was an absolutely phenomenal movie from many stand points. Not only was it a great story about the \"hood\", it dealt with so many issues. Poverty, Teen pregnancy, drugs, School difficulties, Career choice, Stds, crime, and death just to name a few. Now i know not everyone is a particular fan of the type of characters that are portrayed in this film but you can not tell me that you have not had to deal with one of these things in your life. To me it was so well written almost like a educational film, the scene when there playing cards at the barbecue and they start talking about aids is a very good example of that. But don't get me wrong its not a typical sex ed video or anything like that, it just simply appealed to many and in turn educated many. The climax of this movie is as good as most any movie ever made. I don't even shutter an eye to say this is one of the best movies put out in the early 90's.",

Unlike other similar pictures, for example, \"Menace II Society,\" Boyz In the Hood possesses heart and intelligence. To explain, the story briefly centers on Tre Styles as a child before shifting its focus on his teenage years. As a child, Tre lived with his mom. He was a bright kid, but he was a joker with a mild temper and lacked direction in life. As a result of his behavior, he is forced to live with his father, Furious, who will play a pivotal role in his transcendence into young adulthood in a hostile environment. Although Boyz In the Hood deals with living in a violent world which some of us will never understand, the story is more of a coming of age film rich in character development. Overall, It will make you question the war on drugs. It will make you wonder how people residing in 'ghettos' live on a daily basis. But above all, it will make you think about the significance of having a positive role model.",

The acting in this movie was great. Lawrence Fishburne always does a great job.From the strong father      figure for Tre, to the wise and caring teacher for Malick in Higher Learning.

It's one of the most authentic and realistic hood films I have seen, John Singleton tells the story brilliantly and his direction is on the same level as his storytelling skills. The camera work improves as the film goes on but I'm not judging him for that, it's his directional debut after all and I feel like the storytelling and the direction he gave to the actors is more meaningful than camera work. The cinematography is brilliant and beautiful, the imagery is memorable and many scenes are iconic. Maybe it's me loving the film that I recognize the scenes and sets, or it's just brilliant cinematography. Mostly the latter, I think.The case is filled with big names like Cuba Gooding Jr., Ice Cube, Morris Chestnut, Laurence Fishburne, Nia Long, Regina King, and Angela Bassett. The story follows Tre Styles who is sent to live with his father Furious Styles in South Central Los Angeles which is surrounded by the neighborhood's booming gang culture. The film kickstarted the acting careers of Cuba Gooding Jr., Morris Chestnut and Nia Long. For good reasons, talented actors, all of them.John Singleton sadly passed away back in 2019 and since then I have wanted to re-watch this but didn't for some unknown reason, at least I was following Snowfall which I still am and recommend to everyone who are a fan of this film. What is so special about the writing is that Singleton wrote the film based on his own life and that of people he knew and the idea came to him in film school. The United States Library of Congress selected it for preservation in the National Film Registry, I can only say that it has every right to be there. It's an unforgettable experience and an incredible film.",

While the film at times pretends that cliched messaging and preaching is somehow high-minded revelations, it doesn't taint the tone or consume much time. The film is not afraid to point out some harsh realities that people don't like to talk about-like the problem of absent fathers and single motherhood in the black community-as well as recognizing the importance of a present, strong, masculine father figure in a young man's upbringing. It shows how easy people can get sucked into a bad life and how hard it is to resist the pull of crime, poverty, and prison. While the film focuses primarily on the film's protagonist Tre, it devotes sufficient time to character development so that the viewer is able to get invested in each character and their motivations and struggles. Overall, very well done.",

            "content": "This movie has been slammed for doing a good job, the view it paints is a realistic one and people hate having to face a truth as harsh as this. \nSingleton's directorial debut is laced with racism, deep brooding racism, that inhabits almost all his characters and this stems probably from personal experience but it's quite real onscreen.  Furious Styles is an unusual \" on hands Black father\" who imbues his only son with the strength and dignity of his kind.  Weaning his kid away from the streets is difficult and is one seeming losing battle. But Tre comes in time to appreciate the values being passed on to him by his dad. As Furious tells Tre \"I didn't raise you to lose you to the streets\".  \nIn contrast, we have Doughboy who lives on the streets by his own rules, not relating to his mother who obviously means him well, his brother Ricky who happens to be the \"golden boy\" and apple of Mama's eye, this is an entirely different tangent and he tries to draw Ricky into the seedier aspects of street life, Ricky keeps resisting but eventually becomes caught in the resultant violence of his brother's reputation.  Cuba Gooding Jnr as Tre fights again and again to escape the soft boy image cast on him by his doting dad and this almost destroys him. \nSingleton's imagery is sharp, unflattering and healthy.  His direction is swift, paced and unrelenting.One of the most poignant scenes is toward the end when Doughboy hears Tre is going to college after Ricky's shooting,  there is a kind of desolation in his face as if he knows he's lost the battle.  The camera pans onto his face for a split second and holds briefly but it seems like forever and forever actually flashes through his face but then it's gone and he's back to being Doughboy who doesn't last much longer.

I didn't understand why I was crying at the opening scene where small children view the outline of a murdered body on their way to school. But I didn't cry at the tragic end -- it was inevitable and I was numb. The great american tragedy is not about powerful corporate giants.

Today, this movie goes straight to BET.The sequences are just as surface level as many made for TV movies, and while there are some bona fide stars in this movie, the supporting cast is full of bit players and people that will never be seen again.Though there are many flaws, two moments in particular come to mind. First, Tre comes back from a night of hanging out and shows up at his girlfriend's house, has a nervous breakdown, and she instantly, without discussion, gives him what she had so vehemently denied him earlier in the movie. Do we have any idea why? That was just an excuse to add the one element of appeal that makes up for what the movie is lacking. It's the oldest trick in the book. Then, when the shooting occurs, the victim is dragged into the house and on sight of him, his girlfriend screams, but we're reminded of the attempts at acting that are characteristic of a low budget horror film. It was pretty weak.Anyway, the morals, the premise, and some of the performances are pretty good, but overall, this movie is corny and satirical.",

Not possible: U.S. direct action officially ended in early 1973 ( and had been in decline since its height in 1969 ). So if he had joined the army when was 17 -- it would have been 1974, and he would not have gone to Vietnam. Even, and it didn't happen, if some recruit joined at that time, and was sent there, it would be to do paper work. Combat arms was gone. 1972 was the end for the U.S. ( its just a historical error in the screenplay's details ). Also Cocaine was huge since the early 70s. If there is a demand for a product, criminals will give people what they want. The difference between someone snorting uncut cocaine at a Beverly Hills party and someone smoking rock in a hood is merely economics: its what form of the substance you can afford and how you get it. Coke is in as much demand for rich white people as it is for poor blacks ( or poor whites ). So why would their be a conspiracy to destroy the black hoods when dope dealers ( and I mean the big shots ) would be getting rid of a significant part of their market.Trying to present it as a government conspiracy is simply absurd. But LW's character is 'racist' and in many ways ignorant and logically absurd. And I hate it when the 'White' college educated people say that Rick's murder was a thing of 'honor' -- carried through by his assassins. Where is there honor in killing an unarmed person for nothing more than bs pride. Its the same bs that is still going on now. It's not people of honor, it's people who don't care about right or wrong and people who can go eat a burger and french fries after they just blew away an innocent person.Still a good film.",

The film's 3 central main character, the \"Boyz,\" are all clearly different people instead of one common stereo-type being performed by 3 actors.This film is completely against gang violence and \"Black on Black\" crime, yet it was strange how at the time how numerous reports of fighting and gang violence were seen during the course of its run.

I suppose that my lukewarm reaction to this well-received film has much to do with the existence of The Wire, which treats many of the same topics in a far more cinematographically sophisticated production.That said, it is nonetheless amazing that John Singleton wrote and directed Boyz n the Hood as his d\u00e9but and while still in his early twenties.

The central character is Tre Styles, who is sent to South Central at ten by his mom and gets raised by his father \"Furious.\" Tre, along with his friend Ricky, grew up to be pretty innocent young adults, staying out of trouble and not getting shot. They were experiencing the average teenage things: hanging out with friends, getting girls, and worrying about their futures. Ricky was in line for a football scholarship at USC and Tre was on his way out of the \"hood.\" However, like so many black men before him, Ricky had his dreams shattered due to gang violence and he was brutally murdered. The movie is most importantly a social commentary on the status of African-Americans in our country. They have all lived out of fear of each other and not just of other races. Ever since the Civil Rights Movement, African-Americans have lived in fear of the establishment, thinking that something might happen again. The anger of the black masses seen from afar is the anger of being persecuted for so many years previously and now they were venting their anger with their newfound freedom. This is what the movie portrays so well.This is one of the most emotionally powerful movies of the 90's and it is relatable to all kinds of people. African-Americans saw this movie as their experience while white people were able to see what was going on in the inner cities. This is probably one of the best debuts ever by any filmmaker and John Singleton, who had just graduated from USC film school, became the youngest director at 24 years of age to be nominated for an Academy Award. It can be seen throughout the movie that Singleton was very passionate about the material and it rubbed off on all of the actors, who played their parts perfectly. Most notable among the cast were Cuba Gooding Jr. and Laurence Fishburne as Tre and Furious Styles. Both delivered highly believable and gut-wrenching performances that stick with the audience long after the credits roll. This is one of the most real and powerful movies of the last quarter-century and it almost single-handedly increased African-American jobs in the film industry exponentially.",

I didn't cry but I was on the verge because it was so RAW. It happens so much, Ricky was a rising football star, recruited by USC. The whole part is so raw with emotion from everyone, you can actually feel what they felt.

This is a great point that Singleton took time to illustrate since the majority of men in the black community are often raised by their single mothers. The principles that Furious (Played by Larry Fishborne) install in Trey (Played By Cuba Gooding Jr.)are something not portrayed in mainstream movies. Singleton carefully weaves this into every day life experienced in the lower income black community, drugs, gang activity, violence, & the general feeling of hopelessness.

Fifteen years on, this film still has hugely important things to say, and unfortunately, not just for America. The emergence of black on black gun violence in Britain is a worrying trend of recent years. While it should not be exaggerated, there's no doubt that issues raised in this film apply equally to the British case (for example, the two innocent Birmingham girls caught in the crossfire on New Years Eve two years ago). The culture of 'respect' as the cause of needless young deaths is a key part of 'Boyz n the Hood's message. Furthermore, John Singleton's presses home his central point, that the black community needs strong male role models, with force and clarity. Furious Styles (played brilliantly by Laurence Fishburne) is clearly the type of figure Singleton wishes there were more of. He is ultimately powerless in the face of other strong influences determining Tre's actions. However, at a crucial moment in the film's climax, it is proved that his job as a father has already been done.",

            "content": "I watched this movie the other night because I had not watched it in a long time. It was on TBS a few weeks ago, but I never like to watch films like this that are edited. So, I rented it and watched it.Here's the deal. I remember watching this movie as a 18 year old. Seeing it from an 18 year old's perspective, this was one of the most intense movies I had ever seen. After watching it the other night, I would say that it is not the most intense film I have seen, but it is one of the most important films to have ever been made.First, it was the first film of its' kind to reveal to the world what was going on in South Central and other places like it. For someone like me, a kid who grew up in a loving home with both parents in a suburban town, this movie was and still is an eye-opener. The \"shock factor\" the film had when it was released in 1991 is not their anymore, simply because the world now knows what is going on in places like SC. But at the time, the film broke the wall down to a world that needed to see what was going on. For that, you have to give John Singleton props. What I like most about the film is the fact that Singleton does not hold back. The reality that is \"the hood\" is presented without any attempt to sugarcoat it. And that is the way it needed to be. Some of Singleton's views expressed in the film are debatable, and I found myself not always agreeing with some of these views. Nevertheless, I would not have had Singleton change a thing about the movie. I'm sure their are people who are like Furious, Doughboy, and Tre and share the views each character had.\nWhen you watch the film now, try and remember that things were different in 1991. Appreciate the film for what it meant to audiences back then. Still, the message Singleton wanted to express still stands true today. At the end, you see the words \"Increase The Peace\". To me, Singleton wanted the world to know what was going on in places like South Central, and he wanted people to come together and stop the unneccassary violence. If only it were that simple.",

            "content": "During the early 90s, there's was a huge exposure of issues in the black community through cinema and music, Boyz N Da Hood, along with Colors (released in the late 80s.) and Menace II society, provided white America a glimpse into the social problems of the race they had long tortured and harassed. It was also during this time that the LA riots happened, further escalating awareness in the social and economic problems in areas like South Central LA. But to me, the biggest wake up call of them all, next to the riots, was Boyz N Da Hood.From its disturbing opening, to its tragic end, Boyz N Da Hood serves as a look into the dark side of Los Angeles. Filled with tremendous acting from actors destined for stardom, such as Ice Cube, in his brilliant acting debut, as Doughboy, Cubba Gooding Jr. as Tre and Lawrence Fishburne as Tre's father 'Furious'. It explores a part in the world where the Innocent are killed for no reason, Crooked racist cops roam the streets and helicopters and gun shots are heard night after night. It explores themes like racism, gang violence, gentrification, bad law enforcement and having a strong father figure for young black males in urban city communities. This is the kind of movie that comes around once in a generation.My views on towards American life and Los Angeles were never the same. The one thing that saddens me the most is that when your modern day teenager watches this movie, they think its cool to walk around with a pistol, pull drive bys on innocent people, call women 'bitches' and 'hos' and kill people for messing with you.As the end credits say, we have to \"Increase the peace.\"",

Tre's Dad, Furious (played by Larry Fishburne) is an Ex Military Man who is goal oriented & expects the same out of Tre but is still young enough for Tre to talk to about sex, fashion, & teenage problems. Furious loves Tre & vice versa but Furious gives Tre his space to make his own mistakes & be a Man w/o going to far. Brandi (Nia Long) is Tre's Goodie 2 Shoes Girlfriend who argues with Tre constantly about his sexual advances but supports him otherwise unconditionally.The Baker Boys, Ricky & Doughboy are like Night & Day. Ricky is an All City Tailback being recruited by USC provided he passes the SAT Test. He is also a Teenage father with his girlfriend & baby living with him at his Mom (Tyra Ferell) House while Darren aka Doughboy is constantly in & out of jail for weapons & intent to sell charges. There is also underlying feelings by Darren that Mom cares for him much less than Ricky which leads to Dough & Ricky being at one another necks with Tre or Lil' Chris as Ref.A Beef between Ricky & a Local Gang Member over a bumping of shoulder on Crenshaw Blvd leads to Dough & his Crew protecting Ricky & punking out the gang member & him his partners itching for payback on Ricky when Dough isn't around.The Movie is a portrait of life in South Central or any U.S City ghetto where your choices are in order to survive & make good money like $80,000 are sell drugs, be an athlete or be a musician. Even though the climax is predictible, Singleton lets you know what ultimately happen to the remaining Main characters.a",

Cast: Great acting in both, but I felt the Boombox man more than the man in the wheelchair.Both are some of my top favorite movies, and I could never put one over the other.

It contains powerful writing that creates a coming of age story and what would it be like growing up when reaching adulthood. The heart comes to the right place telling us how Tre would be worth a main character since the start of the film. The direction makes the movie dramatic including how the cinematography shots well to the movie's dark tone. The actors have given their great performance that fits to the character development. And it has an engaging social commentary against violence and murder. This is worth watching for the people that are at their young mature phase and you need a good example how you can get through adulthood. However since this is a drama movie, I recommend to prepare yourselves. Because this is a movie about the hood and it will contain its dark image of the dangers. It may be the movie you may not want to see, but something you should if you're ready. As the ending of the film says it best, it knows how to remind to increase the peace.",

In particular, the scene in which Tre's friend is brought home shot to the shock and horror of his family is surreal and moving.While not deserving of its high level of critical acclaim, Boyz n the Hood is a must-see.  It was ground-breaking in its frank depiction of the much-ignored (at the time) suburban ghettos and their disadvantaged inhabitants.

            "content": "John Singleton has outdone himself with this gangsta-themed classic. The acting is superb from all of the actors.The plot: When Tre (Cuba Gooding Jr.) is expelled from his school, his mum makes him move to his dad, in Crenshaw. As soon as Tre get's to his Dad's house, he is forced to sweep the leaves, and that's when you know this is not gonna be a walk in the park for Tre. From that point on, Tre's friends, Doughboy (Ice Cube) & Ricky (Morris Chestnut), helps Tre out when he needs it, and Tre helps them back in return. But when bad things begin to happen, Tre doesn't know what to do; he can either join his gang of friends and help get revenge or stay home and do nothing.What I think: This film is very sad. Lots of tragedies, lots of emotional moments, lots of violence & lots of bad/foul language. Nevertheless this is a classic film, by far, this is John Singleton's best film. Ice Cube does an amazing job at his first shot at acting, this is also one of Larry Fishburne's best roles, and this is the best Cuba Gooding Jr. film I've ever seen.Overall: 5/5 A classic hood-film, which will always be one of my favourite films.

            "content": "Boyz n the Hood is a story about a boy named Tre Styles (Cuba Gooding Jr.) who grows up in the ghetto of L.A. Tre is sent to live with his father, Furious Styles (Laurence Fishburne), and ends up becoming best friends with two brothers, Ricky and Doughboy. Furious quickly learns the struggles of raising his son in a neighborhood surrounded with drugs, alcohol, and murder. Boyz n the Hood shows that having a father figure is essential to how a young boy matures and turns into a man. It shows the importance of having a male role model and how that can affect a boy's life decisions as he grows into the man he will become.The importance of having a father figure is shown throughout the film by the choices that Tre makes. Tre and Ricky try to do the right things and be respectful young men. However, just being in the same crowd as Doughboy and his friends brings unexpected trials. Ricky and Doughboy do not have a father figure in their lives. Doughboy is seen as a lazy, ignorant criminal to his mother while Ricky is the perfect child. Because of this favoritism, Doughboy ends up in jail and lives a reckless lifestyle while Ricky pursues a college football career.Even though Tre was surrounded by a neighborhood with unfortunate circumstances, he continued to uphold the morals his father had taught him. He develops a loving friendship with and a deep respect for his father. Because of his father's constant encouragement and direction, Tre is able to avoid many of the problems that his closest friends are facing. The frustrations of living in a neighborhood surrounded by violence, poverty, and drug and alcohol abuse overwhelm Tre at times, which is shown through his emotional responses.The setting of this film is a very important contributor to the main theme. The neighborhood in which the movie was filmed shows the hardships of living in the ghetto. In order to show how important his relationship was with his father, the setting needed to be in a rough area. Also, the dialogue contributes greatly to the theme. The dialogue between the characters consists mainly of profanity to show how people in the hood talk to one another. Another film that has a similar theme to Boyz n the Hood is Dead Homiez. Also filmed in L.A., Dead Homiez shows how African American families and their friends are affected by violence in their community.There is a strong moral message concerning father figures and life choices that is conveyed through the theme of Boyz n the Hood and it should not be ignored.",

            "content": "Boyz N the Hood is the story of a young man's journey of growing up in the \"hood\". Director John Singleton portrayed Tre Styles (Cuba Gooding Jr.), journey, along with two childhood friends, Doughboy (Ice Cube) and Ricky Baker (Martin Chesnut) as an exciting but to also show the social issues of young African-American males. Tre is highly intelligent but with a bad temper. His father Jason \"furious\" Styles, taught him how to take responsibility for his actions, to be a leader, and to determine what's right and wrong in any given situation. Doughboy is the exact opposite. Doughboy chose the life of drugs, alcohol, and violence, but still has pride and honor in himself, friends, and family, even though his mother was obvious that she did not appreciate or favor him. Ricky Baker, who is Doughboy's half brother, the All-American athlete. He is hoping to win a football scholarship to attend college, and his mother could see great things in him. Although he had a child at a young age, he strives to do anything to better himself for his son.The story revolves around Tre, and his journey from childhood to manhood. He grew in the inner city of Los Angeles, and the story starts out as Tre as a kid, displaying his intelligence and also his short temper. His mother sends him off to live with his father, to show him how to be a man. His father is hard on him, with many chores and restrictions, but it's only to show him what responsibility is. Throughout his journey, he meets a woman, Brandi (Nia Long) and falls in love with her. He always goes to her when he's seen danger, especially when an African-American police officer puts a gun to his neck for no reason at all.The dialog of this film plays a key role in presenting the theme of a young man's trials of growing up in the \"hood\". The slang language, the threats of violence, young love, and pain is presented by the dialog throughout this film. Listening to the dialog in this movie, the viewer can sense the journey Tre went on to becoming a man. The events that he has witnessed and his thoughts and feelings are portrayed throughout the film. The lighting of the film also creates the mood for different scenes throughout this film. The low lighting or almost dark scenes created the dramatic and intense scenes that were in the film. Such as when the African-American police officer held a gun to Tre's throat had dark lighting, and created a powerful scene. This film has many strong scenes with low or even dark lighting to enhance the feelings of the viewers. The director wanted the viewers to feel as if they were a part of the movie, and also that this was the reality of young men living in the inner cities. Using different lighting techniques portrayed this thought exceptionally.Sharing the same general theme of a young man's journey through life and the trials and tribulations that African-American males go through, is the film Ballast. This movie follows the lives of a single mother and her son living in one of the poorest parts of America. After extremes trials, the fragile family grows together. This movie is very similar to Boyz N the Hood in the general theme of the movie. Tre's journey through his childhood represents every young African-American male growing up in the inner cities of America. Throughout his journey, Tre's has seen death, fell in love, and witnessed pain and suffering and is determined not to become like others in the hood.",

He shows you the life of three boys who live in \"the hood\" who become friends throughout the movie. Ricky who is played by (Morris Chestnut) is going to become a football star once he gets the scholarship that he has longed for. Doughboy, who is Ricky's half brother, is played by (Ice Cube) who is just not doing the right things with his life as far as selling drugs and is involved in violence. Tre who is played by (Cuba Gooding Jr) has moved there due to problems with his mother (Angela Bassett). So his father, Furious Styles is played by (Lawrence Fishbourne) who is there to teach him about growing up a man in life. Tre is the only one of his friends that has a father figure that he can go back to.After years of growing up, Ricky has his pick of schools for his football scholarship and Tre is going to go off to college but Doughboy is still doing what he does best and that is in and out of juvenile. Then a day comes when Ricky and Tre are gunned down in an alley by a gang. Ricky is shot several times and killed. Tre is left with the decision on whether not to take revenge on the gang with Doughboy. He knows what his life would be like if he did participate in this. The film gives you all of the ideas of what it is like living in South Central, Los Angles. Being that they are black males growing up in \"the Hood\" they are faced with a lot of trials in their life, such as racism. John Singleton also did Baby Boy in 2001 which was a follow up to Boyz in the Hood. So he is familiar with the effects of lighting and the angle of the shots. The lighting and the angle is what makes the movie. It allows you to see everything and make seem as if you were there or went through the events as they were portrayed in the movie.",

            "content": "I will be reviewing Boyz n the Hood directed and written by John Singleton. The movie has a few recognizable names, first there is Ice Cube, Angela Bassett, Nia Long, and Laurence Fishburne. The selection really helped bring the movie to life, and I think all did a awesome job of portraying the films theme of gangs, drugs, and violence in inner city kids. The film is primarily focused around three boys who are growing up in Los Angeles, where they all have different paths, yet were all friends. Ricky is an athlete trying to get a college scholarship to play football, Trey also is a young man trying to get out of the \"ghetto\" and attend college, and dough boy, who is the one wrapped up in the wrong crowd of violence, gangs, and drugs. Another huge part of the film is Trey's father, who is trying to teach him the right path to follow.During the movie there are some major points of lows and highs for the boys. They face huge decisions on whether or not to continue on the right path, or to succumb to the violence that is inevitably their fate. When Trey makes a decision not to be involved on the attack against gang members who have wronged him, it starts to turn the movie around that, no matter your surroundings, you can still make choices to better yourself and remover yourself from the situations. The movie is very powerful and involves lots of violence, but the story seems to portray a good idea of what inner city kids have to deal with growing up, and the different paths they must choose, or in some instances we saw in the movie, they do not even have to be choosing the wrong path, for it to sneak up on them and cause harm. I think all kids should see this movie at an appropriate age, to show how making right decisions can better your life, and that you are not stuck living the life you are born into, you can choose a path to be whatever you want to be. That is a very exciting feeling, knowing that you may start off in a very bad place, but with consistency, and hard work, you can really be anything you want to be.",

            "content": "In essence, a work of art. Circulating around real life issues and exploring deeper the misunderstood nature of black lives and their so-called 'brotherhood'. The film itself is slow-paced, gradually progressing and developing into transition. Captivating the vulnerability and fear that many black lives experience even today - which is why the film is so very significant and educational. The watch begins in 1984, a young Tre Styles is excluded from school due to bad behaviour and his mother makes him live with his father, nicknamed 'furious' and portrayed by Laurence Fishbourne. 'Furious' is a wise, working man who teaches his son respect and basic life manners. Tre goes out in the street with his three friends Ricky, Chris and Doughboy (also black) and find a dead human body, the four are confronted by an intimidating older group of boys who steal Ricky's ball, Doughboy demands for it back but is beaten and kicked. Furious and Tre go fishing the next day, Tre's father encourages his son not to join the army after explaining to him about the Vietnam war. Upon returning home, Tre and Furious see Chris and Doughboy arrested for shoplifting. In 1991, a barbecue takes place in celebration to Doughboy's recent release. The schoolboys now young adults sees Chris in a wheelchair paralysed due to multiple gun shot wounds and two new friends join the initial four, Dooky and Monster. Ricky is a top-student at his high school, aiming for a successful career manifested by his academic achievements, he, who lives with his single mother Brenda, girlfriend Shanice and infant son, explains that he needs at least 700 in his SAT's in order to get into his desired college. Tre is an intelligent teenager who works at a clothing shop and has a devout catholic girlfriend, Brandi, who is set to have sex after marriage, much to Tre's frustration. On the night that Ricky and Tre finish their SAT's exams, they join in on a street racing gathering, Ricky is rudely bumped into by a group of 'thugs' who engage in an argument, Doughboy brandishes out a handgun causing the group of rival attendees all dressed in red to vanish. Moments later the rival attendee fires a sub machine gun into the air, causing chaos and commotion in the street. During their exit from Los Angeles, the group are pulled over by the police, the lead officer is recognised by Tre as the same who came calling 7 years ago after a burglary took place at Furious' home - he intimidates the group and threatens Tre with a gun, assuming that they provoked the shooting. Tre shows up at Brandi's home and breaks down in front of her, the pair go inside and have sex for the first time. The next day, Doughboy and Ricky get into a fight that Brenda and Tre break up. Tre takes Ricky on a walk through the neighbourhood to cool down and the pair spot the rivalling gang from last night in a car. The two protagonists sprint away attempting to avoid any conflict; Dooky, Doughboy and Monster sense danger when seeing their two friends sprinting, Ricky fails to keep up with Tre and is greeted by the driving gang, the leader winds down his window and shoots Ricky twice before driving away. Hysterical, Tre holds Ricky as he slowly dies and Doughboy turns up with the others to visualise the tragedy. They take Ricky's corpse to his home where Shanice and Brenda emotionally blame Doughboy who unsuccessfully tries to convince them that it wasn't his fault. That night, a distraught Brenda sadly opens Ricky's exam results to find out he got 710, more than enough to have got him into college. Outraged, Tre takes his fathers handgun and intends to exact revenge, Furious encourages Tre to abandon the thought of revenge but his son ignores him and leaves out the back window to join Doughboy, Dooky and Monster. Tre soon realises that revenge isn't going to solve any of his issues and only add to the problem, he evacuates the plan and returns home, he and Furious both don't say a word and walk to their respective rooms. Doughboy and his two friends identify the rival group at a fast food outside eating area, the group realise their targeting and attempt to escape but Doughboy kills two of them and wounds their leader, Ferris with an AK-47, Doughboy exits the car and confronts Ferris who states he didn't kill Ricky and insults him, Doughboy shoots him twice, killing him. The next day, Doughboy visits Tre and understands his reasons for leaving. Doughboy knows that he will sooner or later face retaliation for the murder he committed the previous evening and accepts the consequences of his crime-ridden lifestyle. He plaintively questions why America does not care about the life in the ghetto, and sorrowfully notes he has no family after Ricky's death and Brenda's disowning of him. Tre embraces him and tells Doughboy he has a brother in him. The epilogue reveals that Doughboy saw Ricky buried the next day and was himself murdered two weeks later. Tre and Brandi attend Morehouse and Spelman colleges in Atlanta, respectively. A film so topical and relevant to the present day, an often misunderstood subject regarding the livelihoods of black lives and the stereotypes that accompany their existence. The title itself is significant, including language common to black people in the 90s, the hood being a neighbourhood dedicated to black people and boys spelt purposely with a 'z' emphasises a typical rebellious nature. The focus that the film centres around is the idea of unity and togetherness amongst black people, and that they should help and protect one another in order to 'prove' their place in society. Fishburne's character is the mouthpiece manifesting this ideology; notably when demanding Tre not to take revenge, Furious believes killing another black man as revenge only adds to America's problem and gives the ignorant racists a reason to question black lives' presence. A sad, emotionally moving watch that portrays the harsh reality of racial injustice.",

Ditto Cuba Gooding, and Fishburn.I cant really find any weak parts of this movie. I saw it over a decade ago. Recently rewatched it, understood it better and enjoyed it far more.I seriously think this may be one of the greatest movies of all time, sort of the 'Rebel Without A Cause' of the 1990's.",

Furious played by Laurence Fishburne is trying to raise his son Tre' and show him that there is a better way of life and there is a world outside of the Ghetto. Tre' coming of age experiences life in the ghetto and its harsh reality of drugs, prison, poverty and death. Ricky played by Morris Chestnut is on his way to college by way of a sports scholarship for playing football. Ricky is interviewed by college scouts and his future looks bright until Ricky has a confrontation with some gang members that didn't like his brother. Ricky was gunned down in an alley on his way home from the local convenience store. Tre distraught goes home and locates his father's gun and attempts to flee the house with it when Furious takes the gun from Tre's hand and tries to talk some sense into him. Tre then goes to his room and flees through a window where he meets up with Ricky's brother Dough Boy played by Ice Cube. Dough Boy is a young man involved in gang life that gets released from prison but doesn't become a very productive member of society. Dough boy and his crew along with Tre set out to get revenge on the people who killed Ricky. Driving through the city trying to find the men who murdered Ricky Tre asks Dough Boy to stop the car and let him out. Dough boy and his crew continue searching the city till they locate the blood gang member known as Ferris and kill him in retaliation for killing Ricky. This is a film that many people living in the ghetto and poverty can relate to. Furious was the only father figure in the movie, and when Furious found out Tre was getting in trouble in school he told Tre's mother to let Tre live with him. Furious knew that Tre needed a father figure in his life if he was going to have any chances of Tre staying out of trouble and being a positive member of society. This movie is a great example of things that some people from different walks of life would never experience or see for themselves.",

            "content": "Based on the title, one would assume that \"Boyz in the Hood\" is yet another film glorifying violence on the streets. Quite the contrary, Boyz in the Hood takes a unique look at the lives of three young black men living in the violent streets of Los Angeles, CA. Director John Singleton delivers a riveting, raw, and emotional view about growing up chronicling the lives of three young friends as they navigate through poverty, gang violence, and drugs. The tried but true \"Coming of Age\" theme is given a fresh perspective as childhood friends Tre Styles (Cuba Gooding Jr.), Doughboy (Ice cube), and Ricky Baker (Morris Chestnut) transcend adolescence and become young men.This film shows the importance of choices and how they can impact the rest of your life and the lives around you. It also reinforces how important positive role models can help an individual in making these choices. A common theme that revolves around other films such as \"Menace to Society\" (Directors: Albert Hughes, Allen Hughes). This is shown by how different the lives of each of the friends turn out after they grow up approaching the end of high school. Tre, who raised by his father, Furious Styles (Lawrence Fishburne) grows up in a disciplined household. Furious makes sure Tre is accountable for his actions and fully understands the consequences of making the wrong choices. Doughboy, who has recently come home from incarceration, hangs out with his friends and deals drugs. Ricky, who sees playing football as his salvation takes to the sport and aspires to attend college making football his career. All three live in the same rough environment but lead different lives which are influenced by their role models (or lack there of) and through the choices they make.Rather than relying fancy effects or studio sets, Mr. Singleton maintains the feeling of this urban environment by filming in the very locations that he refers to in the film. Filmed on location in Crenshaw Boulevard, Inglewood, and downtown Los Angeles, CA, Mr. Singleton further adds to the depth of his film by bringing viewer into this austere environment. An effect that would not be able to be reproduced in a studio set with props.This is a powerful film is not your typical \"Coming of Age\" movie and tackles additional problems that may not be faced by all youth growing up. Social awareness is the key to such issues as poverty, drugs, and violence which Mr. Singleton successfully ties together with the lives of three young men as they struggle through life with a common theme that everyone can relate to.",

            "content": "This film takes place is Los Angeles in the early 1990's during a time of civil unrest and frequent Police brutality. The main character's first appear as adolescent kids when they are exposed to the everyday struggle of crime in any forgotten urban community. Dead bodies, whose arms are prodded with needles, lay about. The crime rate is evident by the cars on the block that sit with broken windows. Many are damaged by fire, yet they have not been removed and are now used as jungle gyms along with discarded old bed mattresses.These kids are forced to occupy their time with whatever entertainment they can think of, so of course they turn \"narcoleptic\"... soon stealing in the streets leads to time in jail at early ages for characters like Ice Cube's Doughboy who eventually serves several years in juvenile detention for general gang-banging. Other characters of the movie like Chris, actor Reggie Green are victims of gang violence and as a result are portrayed as adult quadriplegics. These depictions ring true in many communities as what you put into life is ultimately what you get out of it.This movie also depicts what it's like to be from the same area as a gang-banger, and not fall into to the traps facing urban at-risk youth. Cuba Gooding's character Tre Styles is forced to make several life changing decisions, from not having unprotected sex, with Brandi played by actress Nia Long, to hanging out late into the evening. Tre is also aware of ongoing gang wars amongst him and his childhood homeys. Unlike his peers, Tre has a male role model or \"father\" that is guiding him through the mean streets of LA, played by actor Laurence Fishburne.Ricky Carter (Morris Chestnutt), brother of Ice Cube's character Doughboy is facing peer pressing decisions that every sexually active high school teenager faces during an unplanned pregnancy. Ricky Carter can either sign scholarship papers, and play football or stay home and raise his child that is soon to be. While dealing with the issues of his life, Ricky is caught up in random gang violence, falls victim to gun fire leaving the future of his family uncertain.Boyz n the Hood did an excellent job at telling the story of every urban community in America that is stuck in gang warfare. Decisions have to be made every day of which way to survive and how not to fall prey to those who have grown hopeless to different issues including waking waking up that morning.",

            "content": "Boyz N the hood was one of the first movies that told the story of how gang violence was in south central Los Angeles California. Majority of the black males in the community never make it to the age of 21. The main problem was most of these young men were killed by gun violence at the hands of other black males. This movie first debuted in 1991 and had two Academy Award nominations for Best Original Screen Play and Best Director, John Singleton. Mr. Singleton was the first and youngest black director to have an Academy Award nomination.The theme of the movie is how that black males are being exterminated through astronomical rates in the inner city. There are no special camera angles or lightening throughout the film. Tre Styles played by Cuba Gooding Jr. was one of the main characters; his mother decides that since he is an influential teenager that it would be better if he was raised by his father. He has two best friends, Ricky played by Morris Chestnut and Doughboy played by Ice Cube. The film follows Tre and his best friends on their adventure through the mean streets of Crenshaw, in south central LA. Tre is taught from his father played by Lawrence Fishburne \"How to be a man\". These life lessons are essentially necessary so he won't end up dead or in jail. There is a transition in the film when it moves forward seven years to when Doughboy is recently released from being incarcerated. There is a party that is being thrown for him and in one particular scene it shows how Tre is continuing to live his life as a good student and he even has a job, it is also shown that Ricky has a young child and is struggling to get a certain score on the SAT's in order for him to go to USC and play football. While Doughboy was in jail, Ricky got into an altercation with a gang member from another turf because of Doughboy, it later shows Ricky walking down the street and he sees the gang member's car, he tries to run away but is shot in the back in an alley; his death is witnessed by Tre. Tre he is upset and wants revenge, he rides out with Doughboy to find the killer but get scared and he is let out of the car. Doughboy gets revenge by killing the gang member that killed his brother. During the end it states that \"Doughboy is later murdered himself\". Tre finally achieves his goal of getting out of the hood and going to college. This movie shows how hard it is for young black men to grow up in the hood, and that even if you are trying to live your life right you can still be hurt from someone else's' action, regardless if you were the cause of the problem or not. It also shows that there are some black men that are able to get out of the hood.",

Singleton manages to portray a microcosm of the harsh realities of the inner city as opposed to the rest of the city.The movie begins with Tre Styles as a boy. His parents are divorced. Tre starts to become troublesome so at the age of ten, his mother sends him to live with his father, Furious in South Central. The story then skips ahead seven years. Furious has successfully taught Tre how to survive, be a man, have pride, and respect. He doesn't want him to be just another statistic. Ricky is an athlete that wants to get out of the hood through athletics. He wants to overcome the violence and pettiness of the gangster way of life. On the other hand, doughboy willfully succumbs to a mentality that respects the hood way of life. He doesn't really try to overcome he just wants to survive. He accepts the idea of drugs, gangs, and violence.Tre is lucky in that his dad, Furious, is his guide in navigating through the on-going cycle of violence. Tre has more reassurance in a better way of life. Then when Tre is about to graduate from High School, his friend is shot and killed. Tre wants to get revenge so he has to decide what decision to make to get even but to avoid ruining the rest of his life. The theme of the movie is based on the notion that if you choose to make the right decisions by elevating your mind you can better your life even though the odds are against you.In the 90s there were similar movies with this same theme, Above The Rim, Juice, and Menace II Society, just to name a few.Some of the motifs used throughout the movie are the constant sounds of police, negative news of violence, police helicopters, and gangsters. The camera angles are in your face and help viewers feel that they are right there with the actors in their life experiencing all of their emotions. You can clearly see the fear, anger, or sadness in the faces of the actors. Despite the harsh reality and gritty storyline, the movie ends with a hopeful message that there are ways to make it out of the hood and all its trappings.",

It's kind of a weird thing to call this new release an anniversary edition, but maybe they'll start a trend of having a 12 year anniversary edition for other movies. Whatever happened to a 10 year edition?  Oh well, enough of that.Boyz n The Hood is John Singleton's 1st movie, and easily his best. Sometimes I see a John Singleton movie, and wonder how this is the same man that created Boyz N The Hood.  Baby Boy didn't impress me all that much, it just seemed too cliched.  The score, the acting, and the character development in Boyz is amazing.  Considering that Ice Cube was in his 1st role, Cuba's performance put him on the map, Morris Chestnut also in his 1st role, and Fishburne was perfect as a father figure. Such great performances from new (at the time) faces.  Who knows if we would have had movies like Friday and Barbershop if Ice Cube were never in this movie.  Who knows if Cuba would have won an Oscar for Jerry McGuire, had he not delivered such a quality performance in Boyz.Boyz to me is unrivalled in terms of it genre, not only because it was one of, if not THE, first movie of its kind, but nothing I have seen in the past 12 years is as good.  Menace II Society was close, but other than that, I can't think of any others.  The movie evokes so many emotions.  Sadness, satisfaction, happiness.  Strong sense of sadness is evoked when Ricky is killed.  Because his character was so well developed despite not having that many lines.  And nothing is more satisfying than when Ice Cube and his crew gun down the men that killed Ricky.  The way it was done, was the way that the audience craved to be done.  I know if I had the chance to come face to face with my family members killer, I might do the same thing.  Possibility of going to jail not withstanding.  Singleton just put together the perfect movie to depict his old neighborhood, it's just a shame that none of his recent work is as good as Boyz N The Hood.  If you are a fan of gangster films, or just good movies in general, you will like Boyz N The Hood.",

            "content": "Boyz in Da Hood is a coming of age drama that is based on the early 90's drug and gang warfare scene that took place in South Central Los Angeles. Having said all of that; this is not a film about drugs, gangs, or violence. It is a tale of families, the journey to manhood, and the decisions in life people face that define their path. The film begins with Furious Styles (Lawrence Fishburn) attempting to educate his young nine year old son Trey, (Cuba Gooding Junior). Trey and his father live alone in a neighborhood in Los Angeles with a high drug and crime rate. Furious wants nothing more than to see his son get an education and graduate college. He does not want to see him go down the path of drugs and gangs. Trey has a group of friends that he runs with from a young age; two of these characters are Doughboy (Ice Cube) and Doughboy's brother Ricky. Even from a young age we can tell that these two brothers are very different characters. Doughboy gives off a hardnosed vibe, while Ricky seems to be more athletically gifted and happy to toss around a football. The film later digresses about ten years into the future and the group of boys are now young men. The choices that they made as children are now starting to come to fruition. Doughboy is recently released from jail, Ricky is finishing high school and getting ready to attend college on a football scholarship, and Trey is interested in becoming a man, in more ways than one. One of the themes in this film that we come to realize is that you don't need to be a part of a gang to be a victim of gang violence. Boyz in Da Hood contains a brilliant script, with relevant dialogue that can still be appreciated today over twenty years later. The film was released only a couple of years before the Rodney King riots and could be seen as a prologue to the madness that ensued. I feel that anyone involved in this film wanted the rest of society to see what takes place in a ghetto; from the lowly drug feine to the dirty cop. Four out of a possible four stars.",

After Trey gets into an altercation at school resulting in his suspension his mother takes him to live with his father Furious who is a real-estate broker mostly for black owned business. When Trey arrives at his fathers home Furious begins to help his son grow into a man while teaching him many life lessons such as Responsibility and Being a Leader. After Trey returns with Furious after a fishing trip he sees his friends Dough Boy & Chris being arrested for shoplifting from the local corner store, during the night Trey's house is broken into but Furious manages to scare him away after shooting at the intruder. After a long wait for the police to arrive Furious is berated by a police officer who is black for not killing the intruder as he says \"would've been one less nigga on the street.\" After this scene the movie skips 7 years into the future and we are shown a party welcoming Dough boy home from jail after being in and out, Dough Boy's brother Ricky (also one of Trey's close friends) now has a son and lives at home with his mom and girlfriend. Just these few scenes convey John Singleton's message. Dough Boy's character said it the best with one of the famous lines in the movie \"I started thinking, man, either they don't know, don't show, or don't care about what's going on in the hood.\" Many believed that nobody cared about what was going on in the hood that is why John Singleton's movie is so important. So my rating for the movie would be 10/10 Stars this is truly John Singleton's masterpiece.bryan benjamin templeton 2016",

I did like the ending though, so I'd say it was a good movie. Nothing more. Nothing less. I'd probably recommend it to fans of gangster movies, but I have to point out again that other than the ending, there wasn't much of anything interesting going on for me.

Too spoil it for you guys ,Rickie the main character gets shot because he was in the wrong place at the wrong time.my favorite scene was at the beginning of the movie when Doughboy said \"sorry b***\" that part was funny.

I have to watch this movie without permission because my family is just as closed-minded as many other people are. John Singleton wrote this extremely good movie that shows how messed-up some things are that most of us don't (or don't want to) see. Lawrence Fishbourne does a great performance as a man who does his best to raise his son, Cuba Gooding Jr., to be a responsible, noble, true man. Ice Cube is as good as in his later films, portraying a young man trying to figure out what he should do, and gets \"kicked in the mouth\" wherever he turns.I recommend this movie to anyone who even considers watching it.

It was the second film to really portray the \"hood\" and L.A. gangs to mainstream America, (the first being \"colors\")but the first to portray it from the point of view of black people living amongst the danger, hope and despair and it spawned dozens of imitators, but none lived up to the original.It has aged well, and with the exception of the 4 or 5 rather silly, preachy \"public service message\" type things added in, it still packs quite a punch on many levels.Ice Cube to me was excellent and Morris Chesnut was good as well. Gooding was very believable and this and his \"show me the money\" character were the high points in what has become a disappointing career to say the least.Fishburne was great as was Angela Basset.*************SPOILERS************** *********************************** ************************************ *********************************** ***********************************personally, I found so many great scenes in this film, but I found the most powerful to be when young Trey and Furious return from their fishing trip to see Doughboy and Lil Chris being taken away in the patrol car with \"ooh child\" playing in the background.that particular scene has really stayed with me all these years and was quite representative of the unfortunate net young black kids growing up in the inner city find themselves caught in from a young age, both from not having a responsible father figure around, to being immediately put \"on the books\" of the legal system and \"branded\" for life.there are too many great lines to recite.that said, I found the scene with the USC recruiter while touching, to be not very authentic. Obviously, the joy and the promise of the situation for Ricky and his mom are genuine, but they made it seem like the recruiter felt very out of place in the hood and was surprised by the family situation with regards to him having a son and the dangers of South Central (police chopper overhead etc.) I mean not genuine in the fact that USC is pretty much located right in South Central so everyone is familiar with the environs of \"the hood\" and not to mention, the football recruiters are usually the football coaching staff who are familiar with the kids being recruited in the L.A. area and the hardships they face on a daily basis.USC has always recruited football players from the inner city areas of L.A. ... Watts, Long Beach, Compton, Carson, Lakewood etc etc. and this was the only scene I found a bit less than genuine...but I am being nit-picky.all told, a great and important film that i enjoyed and will always watch a part of when it is on the TV",

His son even gets to see a young Doughboy getting arrested at a young age, getting out of prison later we learn at a cookout, and Furious is so smart? Right. Not to mention that Furious is a racist and has a rant during the movie while everyone is standing there like they are learning something special. Sure, living in the hood is bad, but don't promote it in a movie like this that makes it seems like no one has any choices. They do, during this film they seem to portray it as a \"how to live your life in the hood without getting killed mentality\". It is an interesting movie, but not for everyone.",

This film shows us the consequences along with the 'coolness' of being a gangster.The All-star cast deliver breathtaking, masterclass performances, especially Laurence Fishburne as the concerned, passionate father.Boyz n the Hood is a must watch film, not only for the messages it portrays, but for how it can deeply affect us and the ones who are close to us...",

Ice Cube, a rapper at the time, made his film debut as Doughboy, the drug dealer who does the most crime on the streets on South Central. Cuba Gooding, Jr. also made his debut as Tre, a man whose father (Laurence Fishburne) teaches him how to be responsible and making the right choices.

This movie is a very powerful drama, and deserves attention from everyone. It might shock you, but you will be far to captivated to turn it off. I am glad that this film was made since, to me, a well done drama based on real human beings truly outweighs in importance for example, a movie about a killer rabbit.Boyz N the Hood has depth, realism, and is even entertaining (although not in a cheap and sleazy way).

As we follow Tre Styles from childhood toward becoming a young adult (as played  effectively by Cuba Gooding, Jr.), and attempting to dodge, with the cautious guidance of his parents, the many dangers and risks associated with growing up in inner-city America, the sense of ever-present danger and, often, hopelessness associated with attempting to avoid falling into the cracks of society is abundantly clear. In the role of Tre's troubled friend Dough Boy, Ice Cube is something of a revelation, and his balanced performance, alongside Singleton's excellent script, prevent him from becoming merely another gangster caricature. Lawrence Fishburne and Morris Chestnut add further depth to a strong cast. All in all a very real, gritty depiction of the challenges faced at every turn by African American men and women in modern America. The building anger bristling beneath the surface in so many scenes is particularly resonant given the outburst of violence in the Rodney King Riots that took place in the very same city of the story just one year later. The film spawned several 'urban gang flick' imitations in subsequent years, but most glorified violence and placed an emphasis on a loud soundtrack and sexual explicitness at the expense of strong plot-line, good character development and a serious social message. All three are to be found in Boyz N the Hood.",

I'm not saying its not like that anymore, but I think it was a bit different. It was more about respect than it is about money today. It also is a good film because of the actors of course, because this movie is in the beginning of all of their careers. I also like that it begins when the main characters are only boys, maybe the reason for the title. I have seen one other great movie that came two years after Boys n tha hood that does the same thing and that is Bound by Honor.

The film follows the life of Tre, a bright young man growing up in the 80's and 90's who is torn between his parents who are trying to keep him on the straight and narrow, and some of his friends in the community who throughout the film become more entrenched in the thread of hurt and violence that twists through the community.Although the characters and storyline are fictional, the story echoes all too closely the real stories of individuals and families in the real-life community and others like it. It unflinchingly lays bare not just the actions that occur, but all the complex emotions behind it and the ripple effects that violence ends up sending through everyone. It is groundbreaking in taking a deep look into intergenerational trauma and lateral violence years before these terms were talked about. It's a hard watch at many points as it should be. 30 years after its release, it remains a vitally important film and a must-watch for everyone.",

It's a fascinating window into South Central LA in the mid-80 and early 90s, when the infamous riots would take place, as well as a searing indictment of gang culture. There's not many big events in the film, with most of the time being spent watching characters chat about things, posture and make wise cracks, but that's actually why the film is so enjoyable. It builds a bond between the characters and the audience, draws you into their lives, and as such you feel something when tragedy occurs. The standout performers are, of course, Cuba Gooding Jnr and Ice Cube, who play very different individuals, with separate goals and aspirations, but has them reuniting when the situation calls for it. Most of the dialogue is profanity filled tirades or insult laden banter, but it also contains a lot of insight into the woes of its characters, ones which many people still face to this day. It's not a black and white story of one side versus the other, but about how a life of gang violence will always lead to disastrous consequences. It's one hell of a debut, and its such a shame that Singleton would never reach such lofty heights in his career again. But if he's remembered for nothing other than this film, that's still a legacy to be proud of.",

And the film touches on gentrification and culturally biased standardized testing and several other important issues of systemic racism. In delivering this message, I think the film does a great job. But just as a piece of art or entertainment, I don't think it does anything special. And maybe that's because it was very original when it was made, and since then many other movies have expanded on it and done some of these themes better. I think the message is still very relevant in 2021. But the film isn't amazing in any area. Every American should still see it at least once though.",

Sadly, it felt like the rest of the movie was a fairly by-the-numbers story about young people growing up in a dangerous community with a lot of bad influences. Coming-of-age is already a genre that I don\u2019t typically enjoy, and adding in the depressing nature of this particular film, I had a tough time with it. Admittedly, I was emotionally invested in the journey of the characters, and I shed a few tears at one point when tragedy struck. Yet I saw it coming. Every beat of this movie felt like something I\u2019ve seen before in other films, so it was extremely predictable. Many of those movies might have been drawing inspiration from this one, but I just happen to be in a place now where this all seemed rote. I guess at this point I\u2019m looking for a more unique or nuanced approach to these topics, or even films that shine a light on how we can move forward rather than the pessimistic note we are left with here. I can\u2019t deny that Boyz \u2018N the Hood is a well-made movie, and I imagine if I saw it back in the early 90s when I was a teen it would have struck a chord with me and shifted my worldview in some way.

Boyz N the Hood definitely fits into the latter category, and while most of us are aware that these unfortunate cases of cyclical violence exist, I always think portraying the circumstances and motivations through stories creates way more empathy than a two minute news clip featuring faceless victims. Singleton does an admirable job here, even with aspects such as sound design, where the constant whir of helicopters and outbursts of gunfire creates a level of tension for me, despite the characters seeming totally unaware, as these sounds have become a standard and unalterable feature of their environment.",

Cuba Gooding Jr. is doing some of his best work in here but the real game changer is Lawrence Fishburne as a soothing and resolved father in this convoluted world.

If you are the type of person to be on your phone while watching a movie, you wont watching this because the movie instantly grabs your attention. A few major characters in the movies is, Ice Cube, Morris Chestnut. The movie came out in 1991. It's a very popular movie, just about everybody I ever met watched it multiple times. Its one of those movies you could watch over and over and never get tired of it. The movie was shot in Los Angeles The setting instantly tells you what type of movie it is. Any movie that's informing can be on the urge of being good & 'Boyz N The Hood' is very informing how things were for a certain type of individuals.\n\n\tCuba Gooding Jr. who play's Tre  moved out his mom's house to live with his father due to the violence going on the neighborhood. He also got into a fight in school which really made his mom come to the conclusion that he had to leave as soon as possible. He moves with his dad and the violence still continues. He ending linking up with old friends he knew from when he use to visit his dad. One thing tre had that they didn't have is a father that was around. Violence goes on throughout the movie. \n\n\tWhen I first seen Boyz N the hood i was very fascinated. It really opened my eyes and made me realize how crazy life can be. My brother and I watched it when we were ten and eleven. My first impression was, \"I have to see this again.\" The movie is very realistic which is my strongest impression, and it's also very relatable because i grew up in a very dangerous community, I moved neighborhood to neighborhood due to violence and it never stopped until I moved to a different city.\n\nThe characters played their roles perfectly and I feel as the ones they picked to play each role were a perfect fit. The movie starts off with violence; usually when a movie starts with violence it ends with violence. Tre's mom didn't think that his father's neighborhood was as bad as the one he lived in before. She wouldn't of moved him there if she knew. He moves in with his Dad and experiences a lot of drama. The simple fact that they show you the main characters when they are young and when they are grown, allows you to develop feelings for them. I wanted the best for each character.\nThe acting was on the point; you would've thought it was based on a true story because of how good the acting was,  i was very convinced. Ice Cube known came from a rough environment so I feel as for him to play Doe Boy which was the ghetto role was very easy.\n\n\tIf you want to be informed on how lives were for some African Americans, I suggest you watch this movie. It's not based on a true story, but the things that happens in the movie are very realistic. There are shooting scenes, fighting scenes. Lots of drama goes on in movie it's very impressive and informative. Its one of those movies that will snatch your attention immediately",

All people from the suburbs know of South Central LA is what NWA and Snoop Dogg have told you about it in their albums.  Sounds kind of grimy and rugged, but in a cool and tough guy sort of way, right?  John Singleton takes that thought that is bobbing in your head and puts a bullet right through it.  This is a devastating look at what most young men in the Los Angeles ghetto have to deal with on a daily basis.  Just walking from a picnic down the street to your house, not even a block away you have to worry about someone driving by and opening up fire on you.  Not just a couple random shots from a handgun, but from an automatic military rifle, because of course you did something for them to cause this behavior, right? Wrong again, they are shooting at you and trying to end your life because you may be wearing the wrong colors or maybe they just don't like your neighborhood for some unknown reason.  What Singleton does with this movie is great, because up until Boyz in the Hood gang violence was glorified in music.  There is no glorification in this movie at all.  If you come away from watching this movie thinking it is cool to be \"hood\" or live in the \"ghetto\" you have to immediately have your head examined, because you have lost your mind.  A harrowing look at not only how violence and gangs have an effect on the people involved in this criminal activity, but also how it effects the people around them, their family and friends.  We get a unique look from all perspectives in this movie.  From the mother and father to the gangbanger and the do good star football player athlete and they are all stuck in the hell they are forced to call home.  There is a very poignant scene at the end of this movie where Dough Boy played by Ice Cube just kind of shakes his head and realizes people get killed every single day in their area and no one will ever hear about it or even know about it.  He is not mad at this realization, he has accepted this fact and has come to terms with it.  Which is sad in its own right.",

They must learn the whys of where they live before they can focus on the hows of improving their own lives, but as every day goes by a little bit of them is killed off as opportunities and hopes and dreams pass them by.

It's a rewarding but also a punishing experience all at once, a film that transcends its place and time and people as a serious and unflinching look at a slice of life few ever know.",

I'll admit that it is sometimes hard for me to immerse myself into the film's particular setting, but I find that this film is very realistic. I trait I tend to notice about this film is that it's very careful about glamorizing gang violence, and this approach allows for an unadulterated portrait of the film's characters, which are all well-played, and coupled with a solid script, this makes for a highly meritorious work of drama. The film also carries a certain atmosphere, bolstered by its well-polished production values, which give it a kind of timeless quality, which is especially important considering that the issues dealt with in the film are still around today. This is certainly a very thought-provoking film, and a highly immersive one, and for that reason, it is still quite relevant today. Relevant or no, it was a great film, and one of the best the 1990's has to offer.",

You really feel for all of them at one point or another, and though the script does feature some misses (such as a crazy black cop whose more of a caricature of a corrupt police officer than a real person) most of it is dead on and you get the sense that director John Singleton was writing about something he lived personally, not just heard about.

You could even argue that Singleton's work has gotten worse over the years with almost each movie going down in quality with each one.\n\nThis movie works on a lot of levels. The acting is really good. This was Ice Cube's first movie and although he is basically playing a version of himself there is no denying that he has talent as an actor. Cuba Gooding Jr, Laurence Fishburne, and Morris Chestnut also do a great job.\n\nI like this movie although there are some weird things in the plot that don't exactly work for me. In all it is a good movie but in some ways it doesn't seem complete for some reason. I really like the characters and the movie's plot is solid although with these characters I think the whole concept would actually work better as a TV show especially with the high standard of where TV is at now. Overall the movie is slightly above average but not quite on the same level as other similar movies such as Colors (1988).",

Whitey can feel bad for themselves, people that don't live around this kind of thing can get an interesting glimpse into a world they typically prefer to believe doesn't exist, and the people who do live in this world can get some positive messages from a man named Furious that might help them get out of that world.  Stopping that kind of violence is a worthy cause, even if the white man must be blamed for most of it.\nFull Review at: http://robertreviewsstuff.wordpress.com/2013/12/09/boyz-n-the-hood-1991/",

They must learn the whys of where they live before they can focus on the hows of improving their own lives, but as every day goes by a little bit of them is killed off as opportunities and hopes and dreams pass them by.

            "content": "Ice Cube failed in Anaconda but I gave him another shot in Boyz 'N he Hood. The gang life is not easy and making a movie about it can be even harder, probably not but I wouldn't know. With the title and summary of the movie I knew this could be one of two movies, one, a violent bloodbath of gang violence with obvious characters and little story, or the exact opposite. Boyz 'N the Hood has really good characters, a deep and meaningful story, and a well developed look in the gang life of California. I don't know how accurate this movie is to the gang life in the 1990s but I felt sympathy for all the characters living in that life and it is hard to believe people actually live like that in real life.\n\tThe story follows the life of Tre, a really intelligent, black, man struggling with the life he lives in. Lawrence Fishburne plays Tre's father and he is an incredible character. I will start this review praising his awesomeness and knowledge of the real world. He is a man who understands the life he lives in and he does not want that for his son. From a very young age he teaches his son how to be a man and how to avoid the life. He is a great role model for his son and brings a lot of depth to the movie. \nThere is a scene when he prevents gang violence and goes on a rant about why the hood is the hood. He says something along the lines on the government wants blacks to kill each other. On every corner of the ghetto there is a liquor store and a gun store. That is the true meaning of the movie, or the deeper meaning. Gang violence destroys people's lives and it is pointless. The movie exaggerates how the gangs know it is pointless but they do it because they have to. Ice Cube's character hits on this point too, being the gangster of the movie and the head of his own crew. Its characters like Tre and Ricky which give people hope.\nFishburne and Ice Cube did fantastic in the roles they were given. They went above and beyond and put more than 100% in their performance but Cuba Gooding Jr. plays Tre as an adult and he was underwhelming. I'm not the biggest fan of Cuba Gooding Jr. I don't think he is a great actor but I think he was a good choice for the role. Tre seemed almost unimportant and I don't think it was because of how the story was written, I believe it was because of how he was acted. Tre is different. He doesn't want to live the thug life. He wants to be a success and movie out of the hood. Gooding Jr. didn't act that out so well. His character was boring at times and it took all the way to the end to get any emotion out of him. I liked his character as a kid way better than an adult. That's a huge complement on the child actor, or a slap in the face to Cube Gooding Jr. you decide.\nTowards the middle of the movie Ricky has a chance to go to college. Ricky is a great character as well. He isn't so smart but he is good at football. He was another example of people wanting to get out of the hood and his only chance was football. This is the case for a lot of young people trapped in the gang life. Unfortunately, his story was more than predictable and half way through the movie I knew exactly how it was going to end. I wasn't surprised by the ending at all but it didn't take away from the movie as much as I thought it would. The very last scene with Tre and Ice Cube was so emotional and deep it saved the movie for me. It made me able to look past the predictability and enjoy the movie. \nThroughout this review I mention the thug life or the gangster life and I did not expect so much detail of the life in the movie. At one point there is a little girl in a diaper and Tre picks her up before a car hits her. Tre returns her to her mother and all the mother cares about is getting a fix. She didn't care about her child and wanted cocaine instead. \"You selling rocks.\" She says. I know it's a movie but I believed that happens in real life and it made me sick. I like how Tre had a great relationship with his father. I expected him and his father to clash heads and argue, but they didn't. In more ways than one this movie surprised I liked it way more than I thought I would. \nOverall, Boyz 'N the Hood was very emotional, very impactful, very practicable, but very good and I can see myself watching it again and again. I can look past the obvious endgame and enjoy the cinematic experience. Ice Cube gave me a surprising performance while Cuba Gooding Jr. disappointed me. Lawrence Fishburne gave the best performance I have ever seen him in and I expected nothing less. With a title like Boyz 'N the Hood I expected the violent bloodbath. I did not expect the emotional rollercoaster and lovable and relatable characters. This movie surprised me a lot and I'm proud to give it the WillyT Honorable Mention.",

            "content": "I could very easily make a song reference here, but I won't, because rap isn't technically music, and plus, if I couldn't already go the rest of my life without hearing another rap song, I'm pretty much spent after this film. Granted, this film's soundtrack isn't too played up, and when it is, it features '90s rap, which is not quite as bad as modern rap, but is still pretty weak, and that is where they get you, because if I am to ever to watch this film again, then that would mean that I would have to sit through its soundtrack again, and I would not mind watching this film... up to a point, of course. Yup, I tell you what, nothing says quality, Oscar-nominated Cannes Film Festival entry quite like \"Boyz n the Hood\", featuring Ice Cube and Cuba Gooding, Jr., and directed by John Singletone before \"2 Fast 2 Furious\" and 2011's \"Abduction\", but make no mistake, if you can get by its title and soundtrack, this film good one. Hey, I joke, but this film's title features a \"the\", rather than a \"da\", so clearly we're looking at a truly brilliant filmmaking team, as reflected by its member's going on to make perfectly good decisions in the entertainment business. Hey, Laurence Fishburne's character in this film is named Furious, so maybe John Singleton did \"2 Fast 2 Furious\" because he thought he was being asked to do a sequel to this film, or at least that's my attempt at finding an excuse for Singleton's \"2 Fast 2 Furious\", because, you know, it makes Singleton's decision making sound much more sensible. Eh, whatever, I'm just going to go ahead and accept that it was only a matter of time, as Singleton has never been the most subtle of storytellers, as this film will actually tell you. Don't get me wrong, this film is good and all, because as much as I hate to admit it, the hip-hop points in its soundtrack is hardly the biggest of its problems.\r\n\r\nI won't go so far as to deem this film's story concept minimalist, because this is a pretty juicy coming-of-age drama that needs time to develop, and takes that time, yet I'm not entirely sure a runtime that stops just short of two hours is entirely necessary, as reflected by the moments in which the film slips into excess material, if not filler, that does little more than run out the clock and slow down momentum, often into repetition. The film is by no means too repetitious, but it does have a tendency to fall into aimless spells that sometimes stick around so long that you kind of get used to them, thus making the eventual shifts in actual plotting focus slightly jarring, and therefore detrimental to resonance that is hurt enough by a bit of undeniable cheesiness. Sure, the film's dramatic hiccups are hardly the cheesiest moments in the film, because even when you disregard the lame '90s neo-soul/R&B and hip hop soundtrack, musical aspects are considerably hurt by a weakly corny score by Stanley Clarke that still carried the stink of pop film score sensibilities of the '80s, and yet, when cheesiness does catch up with the dramatic aspects, they're sometimes in the form of, of all things histrionics. I say, \"of all things\", because this film is generally quite genuine and realist in its handling of its worthy subject matter, yet there are still those occasions in which the film's dramatic kick feels kind of questionable, or at least comes off as questionable, because if nothing else is mishandled in this film, it is, of course, it's subtlety. There is enough inspiration behind the overdone dramatic touches to compensate for the resonance lost in the fierce wake of subtlety lapses, but there is no fully ignoring the blatant overemphasis on the intense themes and drama that drive this film, which would be more effective if it wasn't so desperate to be effective, telegraphing its depths in a passionately overambitious way that takes you out of the resonance a bit, no matter how striking it may be on the whole. The aforementioned flaws outside of subtlety issues range from barely considerable to fairly light, but subtlety issues can be enough to hold a drama back, and sure enough, no matter how much this film presses on as rewarding, its full potential is ironically all but lost because of John Singleton's being unable to be as controlled as he probably should be in the handling of a worthy tale. In spite of this, as overambitious as this film is, when it fulfills its ambition, at least to a certain degree, it compels, and let me tell you, this film fulfills hits such compelling moments more often than not, as well it should, considering the importance of its subject matter.\r\n\r\nThe conditions of darkly stereotypical black communities, or rather, \"hoods\", have been swiftly exacerbating for decades, with the early '90s timeframe in which this film takes place, alone, being all but beyond saving, and that's frustrating, especially when you look within the community and find what lucky few, relatively cleaner blacks there are being challenged, if not threatened, and even influenced by an inhumanly harsh environment that blemishes society as we know it, so the subject matter explored in this film is certainly relevant and important, with worthy that join drama potential within the story concept itself to craft a premise that deserves an inspired execution. As I said, the film is every bit as overambitious as it is inspired, and that cheeses up the interpretation of this worthy story concept, but make no mistake, for every aspect that is too ambitious for its own good, there is an aspect backed by genuinely effective inspiration, even in the writing department, as John Singleton puts together a script that isn't especially outstanding, but is rich enough to do this premise some justice, juggling so many themes - which include life in an unsafe environment, questionable influences, coming of age and bonds between loved ones - that it sometimes gets uneven in its thematic focus, but never to where the thematic depth and dramatic weight of this story aren't fleshed out enough to intrigue and compel. If Singleton accomplishes nothing else as screenwriter, he delivers on characterization that, in spite of subtlety issues and even the occasional histrionic beat, breathes enough life into the essence of this film's characters for them to feel relatable on a human level, and it helps that the portrayals of such well-rounded characters are also graced with human inspiration. As intense as plenty of this film's characters are in a lot of ways, there's only so much for this talented cast to work with, yet there's a certain charisma to everyone, and when more than just charisma is requested, the performers really deliver on dramatic heart whose gradual escalation helps in reinforcing a sense of escalation in the final product's intensity. The impassioned, if often rather underwritten performances throughout the final product help in driving the human weight to this layered and thematically rich study on important social themes, but at the end of the day, it's a certain offscreen performance that really brings Singleton's script to life, and that is, of course, Singleton himself. As director, Singleton doesn't so much unveil shortcomings to be fixed later, as much as he gives you tastes of shortcomings that he's always had, particularly when it comes to subtlety, because if Singleton were more restrained in his meditations upon this subject matter, we would perhaps be looking at a pretty powerful drama, yet as things stand, the commitment to Singleton's storytelling tends to compensate for many of the shortcomings in subtlety through striking imagery and soul that make the heavier moments tense and the more resonant moments all but, if not decidedly piercing. At the very least, Singleton entertains you enough to keep his flaws as a storyteller from throwing you off too much, and when such entertainment value is broken up by dramatic effectiveness, compellingness finds itself firmly secured enough for the final product to take all of its blows and still come out as effective.\r\n\r\nOverall, filler often drives storytelling into aimless spells, while the occasional histrionic dramatic beat marks a particularly height in subtlety issues that taint the final product throughout its course and could have crafted an overambitiously underwhelming effort, yet goes fought back enough by the thematically heavy writing, inspired acting and generally entertaining, when not dramatically effective directorial storytelling to do a worthy story concept enough justice for \"Boyz n the Hood\" to stand as flawed, but ultimately compelling dramatic study on the deplorable then-modern and still-worsening conditions of inner city black communities.\r\n\r\n3/5 - Good",

Almost everyone performs good to great here though.\n\n\nOne sequence in particular that is truly hard hitting, is the death of Ricky.  The composition of this sequence is nothing short of impressive, with how the sound fades out, aside from the children playing in the background, reflecting the audiences realization of the sudden truth: Ricky has met his demise.  There's also the performances in this part, they're strong throughout the film, but here in particular it's as if they weren't acting; their conviction of shock, grief and sadness at Ricky's death comes across as nothing short of genuine and natural.  Oh yeah, the somber soundtrack adds another layer to this scene.  Not to mention the last thing Doughboy did with Ricky before this scene was beat him up.  All these combined should develop at least a lump in your throat.\n\nIt's easy to see why Boyz N the Hood is as influential as it is, and why it spawned a plethora of blaxploitation hood dramas in the 90's onward post its release.  John Singleton, like Quentin Tarantino with Reservoir Dogs, did an impressive job and showed much promising cinematic skill with this debut.",

The movie is about three young men, Tre, Doughboy and Ricky who are trying to cope with the dangerous society that they live in and find a way to overcome it.One thing I loved about this film was how honest it was. It wasn't afraid to display the reality of situations which were indeed happening in real life. I think a reason it was so realistic was the fact that much of it was based off the director's own life. Speaking of the director, this was his debut film and to say this was his first he did a great job. He was also the youngest person ever to be nominated for an Academy Award at the time too.All of the cast gave great peformances, the one who surprised me the most was Ice Cube. If you knew that Ice Cube was in the movie and your reaction was \"That isn't going to work any day\", then I take it you've only seen the Ride Along movies. I was surprised by how sincere his character and acting was and I think the conflicts he had to face with the N.W.A and the police in the past added to his character as his character is someone who has had many run-ins with the police in the past. Another peformance I was surprised by was Laurence Fisburne as the main character Tre's (Cuba Gooding Jr.) father. He displayed the qualities of a good father and someone who managed to connect with the character of Tre in multiple situations. It's probably my personal favourite peformance of his that I've seen.Like I mentioned earlier, this movie wasn't afraid to display the truth and it did it well, with many emotionally intense scenes and also many surprisingly relatable ones too. It displayed perfectly the difficulty of life for everyone living there and you felt for their characters.\u00a0It also provides a good message of the right\u00a0way to fight back against all of these bad things.I believe that the themes of this movie will likely stay relevant for quite a while and they can be applicable to just about anyone too and this is the reason why I think that this movie will remain important for many years to come. No wonder it's apart of the Sony Classics Collection.Overall, this was a much deeper film than I expected to see that wasn't afraid to show the realism of situations that were also going on in the real world and carried across a good and moving message. I would highly recommend this film.8.2/10",

John Singleton's amazing writing and brilliant execution skills brings out more from character's perspective that goes deep into it whilst still playing on surface. Cuba Gooding Jr. is doing some of his best work in here but the real game changer is Lawrence Fishburne as a soothing and resolved father in this convoluted world. Boyz N The Hood takes it lightly in its first half and builds up this character driven feature in its second one before the intensity increases and stakes grows bigger than usual (which is projected smartly) in its stunning final act.",

I was especially interested in the film because of the cast of Ice Cube. I was bored most of the time, but it got more interesting towards the end. Not that it's any bad, I'm just saying I wasn't really interested. I did like the ending though, so I'd say it was a good movie. Nothing more. Nothing less. I'd probably recommend it to fans of gangster movies, but I have to point out again that other than the ending, there wasn't much of anything interesting going on for me.",
