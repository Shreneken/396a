            "content": "I recently purchased \"Barton Fink\" along with \"Miller's Crossinhg\", another Coen Brothers gem.Barton Fink quite simply is a writer who cannot see the forest for the trees. He is so taken with the fact that he is a writer that he can't write. He is so idealistic that he misses fantastic opportunities to become a writer for the ages because he wastes precious time proselytizing. John Goodman perfectly sums up everyone's frustration with Barton Fink when after a series of unfortunate occurrences, Barton asks him \"Why me?\" to which John's character answers \"Because you don't LISTEN!\" Set in 1930s Hollywood we follow the exploits of a one-hit wonder, Barton Fink, who has written a successful Broadway play and is summoned by the powers that be to Hollywood. After much cajoling to take the job from his agent, Barton arrives in Los Angeles determined to become the writer for the common man where he insists true stories live. The trouble with Barton, however, is he does not have time for the common man because he has so romanticized their lot as well as his particular quest in speaking for them.Excellent performances from John Turturo, John Goodman, Judy Davis, John Polito (often overlooked, but his scenes ALWAYS become his!!) and the inimitable Tony Shaloub.I have decided after a slew of Coen Brothers films I currently have in my collection, that any project these guys are involved with deserve more than passing scrutiny.",

Deep insight into the nature of the creative spirit, a plethora of fine performances bringing at first stereotypical characters to full life (despite the unreal, fable-like atmosphere created by the slimy, glistening colours reminiscent of the films of Jeunet&Caro...), and many moments of hilarity make this a perfect movie, one I would not hesitate in recommending to anyone despite the fairly high probability they will hate it. A lack of any underlying morality, an absence of absolutes of right and wrong, good and bad, give this film a unique feeling that it could go anywhere. The last twenty minutes are about the most powerful I have ever seen in anything, at the end of almost every scene I thought it could end there and be an amazing film, yet each further scene only added further depth and poignancy. The first time I saw it, it left me drained, mind spinning, hands shaking, barely able to reach for the remote to rewind it to watch it again...",

There are just too many funny things in this movie to mention them all, so I won't mention any.  But this is a movie that is going to stand up to the test of time; it may be the Coen brothers' best movie, because it is both dead funny and dead serious.Turturro gives the performance of a lifetime as Barton, and Goodman proved with this movie that he was a first class acting talent (what made the Coens think of him in this role, anyway?  surely a mark of genius).  Davis also shows herself off extremely well, in one of this underrated actresses finest roles.There is, simply put, no better satire of Hollywood, and none that I can think of that so successfully manages to also spoof the pretentions of those who despise it.",

            "content": "The Coen brothers have come a long way from their start with an 8mm camera. They have written and produced some great homages to the film noir era of Hollywood, and this film is no exception.First, is the great dialog written by the brothers. Great dialog is a feature of their films, and this one has some of the most memorable I have heard. You can almost turn off the visual and just listen and be enchanted and know you are listening to a Coen brothers film.But turning off the visual would deprive you of the great cinematography of Roger Deakins. His can frame a scene to the point that you could pause the film and just soak in the texture and color and realism. It is almost as if every frame is a painting.The Coen brothers also seem to get the best performances out of an actor that I have seen. John Goodman is brilliant in this film and he seems to do his best work for the Coens. John Turturro is captivating as the hack writer who talks about his love for the common man, but just really doesn't know the common man and really doesn't care about them. Michael Lerner was brilliant as the requisite man behind the desk that is the feature of 40's noir.One doesn't always know what is in the Coen brothers minds. Is this a foretelling of the rise of Nazism, of intellectuals who really didn't understand the appeal of fascism to the common man, or a surreal portrait of someone who sells out. No matter what their intention, they make you think and return to see their films again and again.",

            "content": "This is my first time to comment on a film on this site. I have enjoyed reading y'all's comments. After 4 viewings, I found peace with the mysteries I saw in the film. Barton, though he talks a good show about wanting to write about \"the common man\", doesn't see anything around him as worthy of being a subject. He fears learning about the common man, or anything else outside his experience. His experience  teems with material for a watchful writer, but Barton sees nothing. When the wallpaper peels, he doesn't look for what's underneath or an explanation, he feverishly tries to cover up what's \"exposed\" as fast as he can (uno metaphoro). I agree with all comments about Goodman presenting Barton with a \"common man\" right in his own room. He has a research subject to learn from and to use as a springboard to break through his \"writer's block\", but he can't see anything that \"god\" presents for him to use. And the Woman on the Beach. Interesting that he never sees her face. He can never really SEE her but seems drawn to her and fascinated by her. He is drawn to the fact that she is \"unseeable\". In the end he \"sees\" her and doesn't explore that possibility either. The Box? He never opens it. We assume what we want to assume, but Barton, who is in control (!) simply attaches to the box without ever \"discovering\" it. He is all show and no substance. I agree, his one hit (the play) may be all he has in him. He's a one-trick pony posing as a seeking writer, intent on revealing the inner \"common man\" but is petrified by fear, ignorance or what-you-will. Look at the film again with an eye to his inability to \"see\" what is clearly revealed to him. you may \"see\" what I mean! Cheers!",

            "content": "I knew I was entering the world of the insane when I picked this up. I wasn't disappointed. This is a dark comedy where people don't talk to each other, they just talk. Barton Fink is a big phony one hit wonder. He has these high ideals which he really doesn't understand. He's unable to see the forest for the trees. When he meets John Goodman's character, Charlie, he has an opportunity to find his muse, but he doesn't even listen. When he does, it's too late. The events of this film are wonderful, from Barton's speeches and his block. To Mayhew, the ersatz Faulkner, who drinks constantly and screeches. Barton Fink is so unlikeable that we don't even care what happens to him in other than a casual way. Goodman steals every scene he is in and ends up so much more that originally thought. This is a movie about taking everything to a higher pitch. It's about the artist and the dilettante. It's about the movies being a purely commercial enterprise. Wallace Beery is the king of the screen. It's a wrestling movie. For God's sake, they're asking for so little. Barton Fink is a whiny loser and he pays the price. The Coens are, without a doubt, the most refreshing thing of the last two decades.",

This movie is clearly the product of a writer who has struggled with their muse, and equally one who has a healthy mistrust of Hollywood - the sausage grinder. Although Hollywood has been critiqued in film before in similar ways, memorable scenes, clever dialogue, quality acting, and a surreal plot and setting, add together to make this an unusual and different film. Maybe another viewing might add a different dimension. This is by no means 'light entertainment' and it leaves plenty of questions unanswered. But on the whole, an intelligent movie, if something of an enigma. My vote 7/10",

If you have not seen the movie please do not read the following comments.Others have commented about Fink's apparent \"descent into Hell\", led by the neighbor/devil.  I found a different interpretation, revealed by the very last shot of the film.  To me, it is fairly clear that he is \"in Hell\" so to speak, but it is very much a Hellish existence on Earth, and the fire is merely allegorical of the intense pressure for him to deliver, compounded by the stifling Summer heat in his hotel room. I believe that at the end, Barton is still hopelessly blocked, having not written anything beyond his opening paragraph.  He didn't get laid, there were no murders, no police, no package, and his neighbor has no dark secret. Those were all part of Fink's fantasy/insanity, created out of the desperation to come up with ideas, as he continues to stare at the picture over his desk.  I even have doubts about the visit to the studio executive's home.In short, at the end of the film, I think he is in exactly the same situation as at the midpoint of the film, the last time we see him staring into the picture, waiting for inspiration.",

            "content": "This is probably one of the most hermetic, personal and autobiographical films that the Coen Brothers have ever presented. Many people find it boring. I understand and I can even agree but I also believe that I understand, at least in part, what the directors wanted to tell us.There is a lot of common between the Coen's and Barton Fink, an idealistic intellectual Jew who idolizes ordinary people and, therefore, cannot see how stupid they are (the Coen's can). Suddenly, Fink is hired to write the script for a mediocre B movie about pugilism. The kind of movie ordinary people pay to see even today. Of course the script, by an intellectual full of ideals, would never be useful in these kind of film because Fink didn't know how to adapt himself to the task. He is far above ordinary men to realize what they want to see and that is why he would never please them. This is not just with Fink: today, the majority of people don't like theatre or art because it has become too elitist and intellectual to appeal the masses (taking theatre and the arts as an example, we can still think of classical music or even cinema).From this point of view, this film is deeply intelligent: it starts out as a very intellectual and hermetic film which will make the most idiotic audience flee from the theater and, then, it gradually becomes more \"normal\" through action and violence. Even so, it always contains some intellectuality, through elements and moments that the film never bother to explain (the importance and content of the box that Fink receives near the end, for example, a thing that left me confused and curious). Its as if the film, even making an effort to adapt itself, never ceased to be what it really is. In the midst of it all, I enjoyed the work of Turturro, which gave life to the protagonist. He knew how to make his character naive and dreamy. Fink sometimes seems so oblivious to the world around him that he seems to be stoned. What counts for him is the world he has inside his head. Very interesting, but difficult to swallow for commercial audiences.",

            "content": "Some individual scenes in 'Barton Fink (1991)' are great, emphasising the Coen's philosophy that the scene takes precedent over the story, and there's a chunk just after the halfway point where things really pick up steam and a proper 'plot' seems to be getting underway - until the film just ends without any real satisfying resolution, that is. For most of the run-time, though, this off-kilter 'comedy'-drama lacks drive and instead meanders around through ponderously aloof satirical sequences in which the protagonist pretentiously proposes that his writing must come from a source of pain and how that's more important than critical acclaim or audience acceptance. It's frustrating that there seems to be some hints of a sub-layer to the narrative, indications that perhaps something supernatural is going on beneath the surface or that we're going to get a big 'reveal' in the third act that makes sense of some of the stranger moments (or at least cements the necessity of their inclusion), but though there is a 'twist' of sorts that slips a slice of sinister into the otherwise lukewarm narrative, these hints and this plot point peel away to surmount to nothing and, as such, seem like hollow inclusions only added to infuse a false sense of depth to a hopelessly shallow narrative. This seemingly indicates that the Coens themselves fell victim to the writer's block that consistently aisles their bespectacled creation. 6/10",

            "content": "Barton Fink is a playwright, the new darling of Broadway, who gets a tempting offer to write for a Hollywood studio. Reluctantly, he agrees, but when he is assigned a wrestling picture, he finds he is completely blocked up. With a deadline looming, can he come up with a good story ?This movie, which won the Palme D'Or at the 1991 Cannes Film Festival, seems to be saying that fruity movies designed for critics, are worthless. Isn't that a delicious irony ? An arty movie reflecting on the self-indulgent, egotistical, uninvolving qualities of arty movies. Barton is so self-obsessed with the importance of his work he completely misses the point of everything that's happening around him. Only at the very end, when Lipnick finally chews him out, does he begin to understand the point of writing (and cinema), and it's not to win acclaim for yourself. What makes this especially weird is that for the Coen Brothers, this critical darling of a movie was sandwiched between two even better films, Miller's Crossing and The Hudsucker Proxy, two fantastic entertainment extravaganzas, both of which were mauled and bombed. It's a beautiful film though, filled to the brim with subtext which invites interpretation - the Hotel Earle is really Hell and Charlie is the Devil, is it Audrey's head in the box, wrestling as a metaphor for Barton's block, beauty as a distraction from work/reality, Mayhew as King Nebuchadnezzar unable to interpret his own dreams, Barton's surreal experiences of Hollywood. There as so many engaging little nods to these ideas, like the hotel stationery logo (\"A day or a lifetime !\") or the odd whooshing noises whenever a door is opened (Skip Lievsay's sound design is terrific). Of course some characters can be interpreted as disguised parodies, with Barton as Clifford Odets, Mayhew as William Faulkner and Lerner as Louis B. Mayer, but this is hardly a biopic or expos\u00e9 story. The cast are all terrific, with Turturro giving a career-best turn, Goodman doing an incredible job with a character who seems to transform constantly throughout the film, Davis as a southern belle straight out of Tennessee Williams, Lerner and Shaloub injecting wry doses of humour, and Mahoney in a showstopping drunk role. The ace photography (the Coens first with cameraman Roger Deakins) is simply stunning throughout; long elegant takes, amazing ultra-closeups as we literally crawl into Barton's Underwood typewriter, a bravura down-the-plughole tracking shot. Combine this with Carter Burwell's typically spare, haunting score, and terrific production design by Dennis Gassner - the Earle is a much a character as any of the actual people - and the result is an unforgettable piece of fantasy drama and one of the Coen's best movies.",

            "content": "*SPOILER ALERT* *SPOILER ALERT*\"Barton Fink\" is about Barton Fink. Catchy title eh? Fink is a writer. He's a writer for the common man. He wants to create a new, living, breathing theater \"of and about the common man\". He has one hit play and then shuffles off to Hollywood to continue his fight for artistic purity. The second he gets there, Hollywood has different plans. They want him to get cracking on a wrestling picture. \"People are going to say to you, Wallace Beery, wrestling, it's a B-picture.\" Fink slowly realizes he's in over his head in a low genre. Thankfully his neighbor, (John Goodman), shows up to help Fink connect to the mind of the common man. Fink can't hear him because he's too busy listening to himself talk about nothing.There are a couple of different movies going on in \"Barton Fink\". My favorite one, and the most funny, is the story of pretentious Fink and the harsh reality check he gets from the Hollywood players. Jack Lipnick, (Michael Lerner), is hilarious. He's the studio head who talks a mile a minute. He confounds Barton with his West Coast ways. He has showmanship and Barton has none. Fink also runs into another fast talking studio exec, Ben Geisler, (Tony Shalhoub). All the scenes with Lerner and Shalhoub are classic. I've watched this movie many times just to see those scenes. The fast forward button took me to the scenes I needed.The rest of \"Barton Fink\" is an odd tale. There is murder, Goodman, cops, writers block and visions of Hell.  Fink came out to L.A. to show us something beautiful but got knocked to his knees as Hollywood showed him the way things really are: Their way or no way.  A surreal cautionary tale about Hollywood although it makes me want to meet some slick guys like Lipnick and Geisler. I would laugh my head off as they tell me how idiotic I am. \"We don't put Wally Beery in a fruity movie about suffering! I thought we were together on that!!\"",

            "content": "Spoiler Alert 98% of the above user comments have totally missed the idea of this movie, and yet some have gotten it exactly correct without even realizing it. Here is THE WHOLE POINT OF THIS MASTERPIECE MOVIE...Those that stated that the first 2/3 of the movie is boring and then it starts to pick up when the action begins, have unwittingly seen the plot, and masterfully fulfilled its premise. See, Barton Fink is a boring, artsy, impassioned Jewish writer, that gets one lucky break, and is instantly summoned to write a movie that the execs are sure \"will be a winner\" (no pressure there, right Hollywood?). But since he is so much an \"artist\", he cannot lower himself to the level of writing a simple wrestling film, desiring instead to write witty stories about \"the common man\", films that \"really mean something\". Then he refuses to listen to common man stories, stuck instead on his own ideas of what that should be. Well, OK, what is obvious here? Well the Coens for one, are Jewish WRITERS/ FILMMAKERS, who got one lucky break, \"Blood Simple\", and then were given the open door to make Hollywood films, are always branded as mere \"artists\", too idealistic for the majority of the masses (their movies are rarely fully appreciated or understood, and make only a small profit, but their genius high critic ratings keeps them afloat). So THEY ARE Barton Fink, quite literally and intentionally. It is THEIR personal tale, ensconced in a symbolic cloak. Summary: Barton wants to write for the common man, and yet what the common man wants to see is this dumb \"B\"-rated wrestling flick, not some heartfelt idealistic piece about some friendly yokel. They want predictable mystery, unadulterated violence and blood, guns blazing, detectives crunching, and loud sex. As Barton stares at the image of his idealism (the beach picture), he longs for his ill conceived idealism to take form and materialize onto the paper. But of course it is a failure, because he sees himself as an \"artist\", not as a business man with epic visions. Which is why finally, the mysterious Audrey (the real writer he is supposed to consult), who always helps Mayhew's stories out of a jam, becomes the catalyst for this story as well, by initiating the sex/horror/detective story as soon as she is asked to. Normal writers apparently are like either Fink or Mayhew, but she sees through to what makes for real-world successful writing (not some dorky contrived \"common man\" story), and she initiates the final action-filled finale immediately. This is PURE GENIUS! \"Adaptation\" as one user here mentioned is like this film, because of the similarity in how the plot loops back in on itself. But this one is much more subtle, to the point where the \"common man\" would not even understand this movie, and thereby fulfill its message, that all people want are the action films that Hollywood dishes to us, just like the mogul states over and over, and we see delivered on the last third of the celluloid. In the end, Fink realizes his idealism, that what he really wanted is to get his artistic view rejected, so that he can maintain his idealistic (unrealistic) outlook, which is his true passion, the \"fight\" for self fulfillment. This is personified by the appearance of the girl on the beach, with Fink still not realizing what would be in the box, because he doesn't comprehend Hollywood thinking or action movies (or \"mainstream\" movies or plots). But he has achieved his goal, as has the movie for Joel and Ethan, as both being an incredibly well-thought and executed film, both an art flick, and an action piece with more perfectly executed symbolism than anyone since Wells.Now you know why it won all the Cannes awards that year, and why these two brothers from St. Louis Park Minnesota are gods of the art film, while the contrasting Warchowski brothers were once gods of the \"common man\" film (the first Matrix at least). The Warchowski's even named the subtitle of the Matrix Reloaded as \"The Burly Man\", which if you look closely (zoom in), is the name of Barton Fink's mystery screenplay, thereby once again fulfilling the intention of this film to the fullest (that what common people want is delivered like clockwork in the Matrix), just like pure Bible prophecies. Amen, brothers.",

I should identify that although we usually expect unusual things from the Coen brothers, this is beyond bizarre. Of course, it is very likely that they're just showing how hellish Hollywood is (how many movies have shown that?). But that bug, plus Charlie Meadows (John Goodman), plus the picture on the wall - and of course the end scene - all add up to something really far out. What does it all add up to?

Playwright from N.Y.C. comes to Hollywood and suffers a block while working on his first screenplay. John Turturro is uneven as Barton Fink, but it's not his fault, it's in the writing (Fink isn't a consistent creation); John Goodman is amazing as an insurance salesman and Michael Lerner shines as movie mogul. But the writing is disappointing, the culmination of events sour, with details that don't come to fruition. Yes, that may be the whole point, but even puzzle movies should have some sort of pay-off, either visceral or emotional or tangible. \"Fink\" left me in a funk. ** from ****",

You see, Fink (John Turturro) was in Hollywood to capitalize on his hit stage play success, only to fall victim to the 'common man', read that 'lowest common denominator' syndrome. Could there be anything lower than coming up with a wrestling film for Wallace Beery? He actually did one you know, 1932's \"Flesh\", but that's another story.I don't know what it was about Turturro's appearance in the film, it reminded me of a cross between Roy Orbison and Elvis Costello. But he has the conflicted writer business down solid, with a writer's block that just won't quit. It would have been easy if only he took Mayhew's (John Mahoney) advice - \"Well me, I just enjoy making things up.\" Intead, holding to his ideals of artistic integrity, Barton is doomed to police investigations, an affair that turns deadly, and a dreaded head in a box. Come on now, you know there's one in there.You know, sometimes a film has a scene that you can just watch over and over again. I might be the only one on this, but I could do the same with Judy Davis's introduction in the story as Mayhew's secretary/lover Audrey. Just watch her face and mannerisms as she greets Fink at the door, they're priceless. Now Mayhew, every time he went into one of his drunken jags, he sounded to me just like Eddie 'Rochester' Anderson.Great performances all around here. Turtorro goes without saying, but John Goodman, Tony Shalhoub, Michael Lerner, all brilliant characterizations. Steve Buscemi looked a little like the Gollum character from 'Lord of the Rings', now there would have been a casting coup.Give the Coen Brothers some credit, they put memorable characters up on the screen with memorable stories. My favorite is still \"Miller's Crossing\", but this is right up there with the best. And if you think about that dance hall scene with the two military branches going at it, there was just enough grappling going on to give Barton the inspiration he needed for the wrestling flick, if only he could stoop so low.",

            "content": "Ever since the day those brave pioneers came out west from the east coast with dreams of sunshine and perfect weather conditions for making movies, that ideal known as Hollywood (not the place, but the state of mind) has dashed many hopes and dreams. Whether it be for the phoniness of the people, lack of artistic respect of how movies are made and the absence of creative aspects has turned off many artists. Writers have exposed the shady world of filmmaking, both in California and abroad, and when Hollywood does it and gets away with it, it is practically a work of genius.Praised playwright John Turturro finds that Broadway success make him wanted buy the biggest movie studio in Hollywood and when he arrives, he's fine he has been given a story he has no passion about. Struggling to find ideas in a dilapidated Beach Hotel, he meets wacky neighbor John Goodman (who turns out to be quite off the beam), finds a hopeful mentor in alcoholic author John Mahoney and falls in love with Mahoney's younger mistress/secretary, Judy Davis. Slowly but surely, Turturo finds out how Hollywood works behind the scenes, hiding scandal, building and breaking careers (and hearts), and ultimately how profit is more important than artistic integrity. Oh, and don't forget about the mysterious box that Goodman leaves behind.An excellent cast walks around a very avant garde set (which got a well deserved Oscar nomination) as if they were in an ongoing dream state. The hallway set alone in the hotel is worthy of that honor. Oscar nominated Michael Lerner plays the flamboyant but crude studio head, with Tony Shalhoub outrageous as well as the talent scout who becomes his adviser. Steve Buscemi also steals scenes as the hotel clerk dressed in bellboy attire. While Lerner is excellent, I would have preferred the Oscar nomination go to Goodman, then very successful on T.V.'s \"Roseanne\". For those who have gone to Hollywood hoping for some sort of success in film, whether it be in front of the camera or behind the scenes, it is a revelation especially if you have decided want you got there that it's not worth the destruction of your ethics. I am one of those who thought of a career as a film editor but unwilling to compromise my personal standards decided to remain a fan of the movies from afar. Like \"Sunset Boulevard\", \"The Bad and the Beautiful\", \"The Big Knife\" and others, this doesn't ask for apologies for biting the hand that feeds it, and in the end, got applause for taking a chunk out. It might not be for all tastes (as are most Cohen films), but artists should totally check it out.",

He could have made the film more interesting, but was not utilized. Barton's neighbor is Charlie Meadows (John Goodman) the common man who has never heard of Fink or his plays.

The Coens did a lot of those movie effects, including one at the end I didn't quite grasp, but it looked clever and perhaps was one of those things you assign you own symbolism.

The only Coen brothers movies I like are the Frances McDormand films: \"Fargo,\" \"Blood Simple,\" \"The Man Who Wasn't There,\" \"Miller's Crossing.\" The movies I've hated include \"Barton Fink,\" \"The Big Lebowski,\" and \"O Brother, Where Art Thou?\" You may have noticed that the categories I've assigned these films to does not depend on whether or not McDormand or Turturro are actually in them (and in at least one case, they're both in the same movie) but rather on the movie's tone. McDormand movies feel elegant and profound; the Coens are able to balance their obvious love of the macabre and bizarre with stories that carry with them an emotional significance. Turturro movies, on the other hand, are unpleasant and ugly, the stories feel arbitrary and glib and the Coens seem to be laughing at jokes only they understand.\"Barton Fink\" has a lot of promise, because it's about the art of creating, and the conflict that arises when an artist's idealistic belief in his art meets the cold, hard reality of commerce and public taste. But unfortunately, the Coens have cast their film with a bevy of ugly actors who all look their absolute worst, and keep the viewer at an emotional arm's length, so that we never get involved with Barton's story or care that much what happens to him. The film tries to be cerebral at the same time it's being visceral, and the result is a flop.John Goodman is the only actor worth singling out of the cast of Coen regulars. He delivers a bellicose performance that runs the gamut from nice-guy aw-shucksness to downright scary. No one could ever accuse the Coens of being unoriginal, and, if nothing else, I thank them heartily for that. But simply being original isn't always enough.Grade: C-",

            "content": "New York playwright Barton Fink lives in his own personal Hell. Whilst he purports to be the voice of the Common Man \u0096 of the two-bit salesmen and the fishmongers \u0096 he is not one himself. He presents other with the illusion of modesty, but he's knows that he's good at what he does and he loves to hear it. Barton claims to be a spokesman for the working-class, but his time is too important to be concerned with anything they have to say. Indeed, throughout the film, we hardly even meet any of these people whom Barton is said to represent \u0096 with the exception of his disruptive neighbour Charlie Meadows (played brilliantly by John Goodman), who turns out to be something more than a lousy insurance salesman.My opening description has inevitably made out Barton Fink (John Turturro) to be a horrible, instantly unlikable character, though, for much of the film, we are led to believe everything that he claims, and to be sympathetic with him. After one of his New York plays, 'Bare Ruined Choirs', becomes a tremendous critical and commercial success, Barton is hired by Capitol Pictures in Los Angeles to write the screenplay for an upcoming Wallace Beery B-movie about professional wrestling. The only problem is that Barton is suffering from quite a debilitating case of writer's block.At the 1991 Cannes Film Festival, the fourth film from Joel and Ethan Coen was unanimously awarded the prestigious Palme d'Or (Golden Palm). In an unprecedented occurrence in the history of the festival, 'Barton Fink' also left with the two other major awards, Best Actor (Turturro) and Best Director (Joel Coen). None of these accolades were undeserved \u0096 Turturro was extremely strong in the first leading role of his that I've seen, though perhaps a shade below his absolutely mesmeric turn as the slimy, double-crossing bookie, Bernie, in the Coen Brothers' previous effort, 'Miller's Crossing' (1990).It is best not to take the events in 'Barton Fink' too literally. The Coen Brothers' pictures are rife with stunning imagery and symbolism, and, due to the tight-lipped media habits of the directors, multiple unverified interpretations of the film's meaning continue to circulate, ranging from the film being a simple satire of Hollywood, an allegory for Hell or even a representation of the rise of Nazicism! In terms of film-making style, 'Barton Fink' is one hundred percent \"Coen-esque,\" though its heightened level of surrealism certainly invites comparisons with such films as David Lynch's debut masterpiece, 'Eraserhead.'A host of actors have made their careers through performing as Coen film regulars, and 'Barton Fink' contains at least three of them. Turturro ('Miller's Crossing', 'O Brother, Where Art Thou?'), as mentioned earlier, is brilliant in the main role, his character gradually changing from being likable to unlikable as we learn more about his nature. John Goodman ('Raising Arizona,' 'The Big Lebowski,' 'O Brother, Where Art Thou?') is fantastic as always as Barton's disruptive and deceptively \"common\" neighbour. Steve Buscemi, who seems to briefly appear in just about every Coen Brothers film, has an enjoyably quirky supporting role as Chet, the desk-man at the Earle Hotel where Barton stays. Other well-acted supporting roles include Jack Lipnick (an Oscar-nominated Michael Lerner), the fast-talking, no-nonsense head of Capitol Pictures; W.P. Mayhew (John Mahoney), the well-known but increasingly drunken writer; Mayhew's overworked \"secretary\" (Judy Davis); Capitol Pictures producer Ben Geisler (Tony Shalhoub), and Lipnick's unappreciated assistant, Lou Breeze (John Polito).As I've expressed in just about every other Coen Brother's film review I've written, 'Barton Fink' is brimming with stunning imagery, witty dialogue and a cast of enjoyably quirky characters. Try not to take everything as literally as it is presented to you, and I'm sure you'll agree that this is one of their best.",

Rather, they depict the mind of a writer as a hotel, an Aristotelian arrangement of cubbyholes into which one sets up shop. This is their most self-referential work to date: Writing about writing; pictures about pictures, wrestling about wrestling (with a biblical Jacob thrown in); various forces at work for control of his (and other's) head; work about working people. Investigation; queries. And love about death as depicted by a drunken Faulkner (and his lover/ amanuensis who orgasmicly dies).Along the way, trademarked satire of the industry and war.

He finds a way to make all those emotions  implied, so that you, the viewer, almost insert your own feelings of anguish and impotence into his role. Michael Lerner earned an Oscar nomination as  an enthusiastic director, who is critically self-determined, though  constantly shifting on what he is supposed to be determined about. John Mahoney,  Judy Davis and Tony Shaloub also turn in solid, dependable performances. But above all the other actors, it is John Goodman who shines in a  brilliantly conceived and brilliantly executed role.

            "content": "Barton Fink, much like a Lynch film as mentioned, or something along the lines of a totally surrealist work, plays on the themes like music, and offers up some waiting, strange images, even stranger, brand-name Coen-brothers characters, and a climax that plays into what the film is about so much it almost nails it hard on the head. At the same time, it's a dark comedy about the B-Hollywood picture world, and writing in general. Half of the movie, like 'Drive', is more straightforward, and then it goes right into the depths of a nightmarish mind-molder. A lot of times it's less funny than it is more tragic-comic, with it's hero occasionally meeting a character that provides laughs, big ones, and then quiet, brooding sensations. And that wallpaper that just wont stick. Starring is John Turturro, winning a Cannes acting award for his truly uncomfortable, often burnt and often perpetually uncertain but life-filled title character, is blocked. Who could blame him when forced by contract into a wrestling picture for an old-time studio head (Michael Lerner, who has show-stealer scenes), getting no advice from his once-idol-now-drunkard writer Mayhew, and only company being a surly, un-commonly genteel fellow from next door named Charlie (John Goodman), and the writer's 'secretary'? As Fink tries to find what the 'essence' of what he needs to write for this formulaic picture, Charlie keeps stopping by, things keeps revolving around him in the frustrated Hollywood scheme, and he goes in over his head. But what makes him go over his head? The Coen's solve this possible problem in terms of their surreal-like, trick-playing and mood heavy technique by making the hotel Fink is staying at have its own sort of character, the walls and the images (i.e. the painting, typewriter, ceiling) all apart of what's closing in on him. Roger Deakins, first-time DP with the brothers, gets long, cavernous hallway shots. And then there's Turturro himself, quite the eccentric here and there, but really is the most sane guy when given the other characters. There's such eccentricity here, and so many potentials for deranged humor and even beautiful shots of this sort of 'hell', that you almost can't hope but think something has to come out of this. What climaxes is indeed one of the Coen's very best. I've seen Barton Fink twice now, and I've almost had the same reaction to it both times, with a greater appreciation for all of the dream-like qualities of the film this time (and also having gone through more of the Lynch and Bunuel and films like that). But you do have to 'give' yourself to the film (hate to use that term, but it's true for here). I could see someone getting bored with this movie- certainly not I, though then again it's such a particular thing (unless dealing with Fargo or O Brother Where Art Thou) to recommend a Coen brothers movie to the masses. Especially this time around, when the duo were working their way through a block on a much more 'mainstream' movie for them (Miller's Crossing), that some of the symbolism, if it even is sometimes, will go over people's heads. Indeed, here and there I could sense a possibility for pretentious moments to slip through. They didn't for me, and that was thanks to the main three things the film won for at Cannes- the calm, seething direction, the inhibited, magnetically odd acting from Tuturro, and the production values all combined. When it comes time to read off the names of the best surrealist works of the last twenty years of the 20th century, this deserves a place among some of the more well-know Lynch and Cronenberg films.",

This appears to be about a simple Simon, named Fink, lured by money or an agent to embark on a career in old-style Hollywood. Following the frequent mentions of wrestling and Wallace Beery, I fathomed it was set in the time period circa 1930-33. Beery made a wrestling picture called Flesh in 1932. Fink meets another writer said to be modelled on Faulkner, but who also seems to have traits of Scott Fitzgerald, including a significant other resembling Zelda. It occurs to me that there is often vomiting in the Coen movies, and the Faulkner/Fitzgerald character is first come across while vomiting. The Zelda type is portrayed by Judy Davis in a very memorable performance. There are other encounters. The desk clerk emerges from a subterranean domain, and repeatedly emphasizes his name, which is Chet. He may be standing in for Cerberus. The dead-headed lift attendant ferrying residents may represent Charon. Fink has a room on the 6th floor. It might as well be floor 666.His neighbour is Charlie, aka Mad Karl Mundt. Could he be standing in for The Devil ? There are also two cops, who are proto-Nazis. Then there are some Hollywood executive types. Geisler; maybe a form of Thalberg. Jon Polito is, unusually, a humiliated gopher. Then there's an alarming mogul, possibly a cross between Cohn, Mayer and Warner, one of whom used to keep a photo of Mussolini in his office. He later wears a uniform. When this tycoon is displeased with Fink's film script, he fires Geisler instead. He had earlier kissed Fink's shoe.The film ends with a beautiful lady stranger on the shore. I have to confess I was mystified and bewildered by this entire production. The hotel is ultimately engulfed in the flames of the underworld. The finished work is alleged to have helped the Coens to come up with Miller's Crossing. Make of it what you will.

What, for instance, is the significance of the kitschy calendar art on the wall of Barton Fink's room? It's a painting of a girl in a bathing suit looking out to sea. It's given prominent display in the film and is reprized in real life at the end. Yet it doesn't seem to carry any symbolic weight, unless it's some banal observation such as, \"We're all trying to find something.\" It has less significance than the recurring Tap. Tap. in Finnegans Wake.Not that the movie is without substance underneath all those stylistic pyrotechnics. Of course it's a shot at Hollywood. It's been done before, but it's done particularly well here through both the acting of the studio heads and their minions and through the script. \"I told Wallace Beery we would have to set his wrestling picture back and he was heart broken. Devastated.\" (This from Louis B. Lepnik or whatever, who has become a beribboned full colonel overnight, just like Darryl F. Zanuck did.)Then there is the theme of Barton Fink, his idealism, and his writer's block. How can you have writer's block when you're writing a Wallace Beery wrestling movie? It's like blocking while trying to write a dirty limerick. Myriad people seem to have felt that Fink was an arrogant snob, unwilling to listen to the tales of his common-man neighbor, John Goodman, an affable insurance salesman who has tales \"that could curl your hair.\" (I'll bet.) But in the end, Fink comes through with what he considers an artistically respectable script for the film, which is of course rejected by Lepnik and which sinks Fink's career in Hollywood. That shows a certain amount of principle, doesn't it?Then there is the William Faulkner figure -- an uncanny lookalike -- to whom we are introduced by watching him kneel fastidiously on a bathroom floor and yoik up his liquor into the toilet. Mahoney gives a riotous performance. He invites Fink to visit him in the afternoon but when Fink shows up he is not admitted to the bungalow, and we can hear Faulkner raving drunk in the background -- \"Where's mah HONEY?\"Then there is the theme centered around John Goodman, but this is the one that really twists the movie up. What's in the box? Why is the hotel on fire? Did he kill Fink's family? How could he blast somebody with a shotgun in Fink's room without waking Fink up? What the hell is going on? The dialog, never realistic, varies from richly comic to the surreal, if by \"surreal\" we mean an oneiristic, nightmarish discordance between what we see and what we hear. Two detectives interrogate Fink about a murder. Except for their lips they never move, just stare intently at Fink's goggling eyes. Detective One: \"The victim was an eye, ear, nose and throat guy, all of which parts were missing.\" Detective Two: \"Physician, heal thyself.\" Detective One: \"Good f****** luck, with his head gone.\" Detective Two: \"Well, he had a little throat left.\"There is a lot of imagination and creativity built into this movie. It's a stylistic masterpiece in its own unquiet way. And funny too despite its sometimes morbid content. It's the kind of movie that gets plaudits overseas while we give money and prizes to the multi-billion dollar blockbusting bores like Titanic and Pearl Harbor. It's no wonder the Coens give us a Hollywood filled with Philistines.",

Like all their movies it can be watched over and over and each viewing is as rewarding as the last. It's basically a film about writer's block (it was written when the Brothers Coen were struggling with 'Miller's Crossing',in the midst of their own block) and how lonely the \"life of the mind\" is. But the message here is that a writer must do everything he can not to be isolated from his fellow man. Barton is trying to write a screenplay for the common man but won't even listen when one such common man (his neighbor in the Hotel Earl, played by John Goodman) tries to tell him stories. He's too interested in spouting clich\u00e9s about the nobility of the art of writing and the great service he is providing in his works. From the above Barton Fink may sound a little dry but it is anything but and as is customary in Joel and Ethan's films, the narrative never goes where you think it will.

            "content": "This film, set in 1941, tells the story of the eponymous Barton Fink. He is an up and coming New York playwright whose latest work has opened to rave reviews. This leads to calls from a Hollywood studio. He flies out and moves into The Earle, a hotel that is rather rundown. After complaining about the noisy man next door he end up striking an unlikely friendship with him. He introduces himself as insurance salesman Charlie Meadows. Barton goes to the studio and is told they want him to right a wrestling film; a genre he knows nothing about. He can't get started so asked an established writer, who he respects, for help; he soon gets close to the man's PA/girlfriend... then things get sinister and rather bloody.It may be easy to describe what happens in this film but it is strangely difficult saying what it is about. On the face of it, it is just the tale of a writer caught up in disturbing events but there is an almost unreal feel to much of what we see. By the time it ended I was left wondering if what I watched was real, within the context of the film, a story within a story or some strange dream... I suspect the first but just don't know... this wasn't a bad thing though; if anything it made the film more interesting. The shocking event that I won't describe in any detail, comes as a real surprise and leads to a sudden and increasingly surreal genre switch. The cast do a fine job; John Turturro impresses as Barton Fink as does Judy Davis as Audrey Taylor however it is John Goodman who dominates as Charlie a character who is in turns friendly and menacing, and occasionally both at once. The setting is also important; the bright outdoors contrasting brilliantly with Barton's dark, dank room where the only brightness is a picture of a girl on a beach. Overall I'd say this won't be for everybody but if you enjoy films where not all questions are answered and you are left wondering about what you just watched I'd strongly recommend it; it is certainly a must see for fans of the Cohen Brother's work.",

Barton takes residence in the dilapidated Hotel Earle, and sets to work, but gets severe writer's block from the start. He meets his neighbor Charlie Meadows (John Goodman) an outwardly friendly man, but who may or may not be a serial killer. Barton also meets novelist WP Mayhew (John Mahoney) and his mistress Audrey Taylor (Judy Davis) who struggles to put up with Mayhew's constant drinking. When Audrey is unexpectedly killed while visiting Barton, Charlie recommends that they keep it quiet from the police. Soon Barton completes the screenplay but Lipnick chastises him for it. The acting is great all around. Turturro is fantastic as Barton, and Goodman fits the character of the jovial yet sinister Charlie perfectly. It's really hard to imagine anyone else in the role. Barton Fink is one of those movies where you really have to pay attention in order to know what's going on. We follow Barton through his week at Hollywood as he tries to write, but witnesses all these strange occurrences while there. All the strange and bizarre parts of the movie add to the existential and surreal tone of the film. Although definitely a comedy, Barton Fink could probable also be considered a horror film. Not something like Dracula or Frankenstein where it's clear, but more like Eraserhead where the tone builds on the creepy atmosphere. And it's done in only a way that the Coen brothers could do it. An atmospheric nightmare that can make you laugh. If you like the Coen brothers, watch Barton Fink if you haven't already.",

The acting was first-rate, full of colorful characters, Turturro is great as the lead but Goodman steals the show, a great character actor does it again with his Charlie Meadows character.

            "review_title": "An Analysis of a Wonderful Film",
            "content": "I'm going to try to break this movie's symbolism down. This is just my opinion, you're open to your own of course.Personal Interpretations:Barton Fink: Barton Fink represents a member of the intellectuals, claiming to write and make a difference for something that he doesn't truly understand, the common man. While pursuing self- fulfillment through his medium of art, he ignores his muse (Charlie), writing him off as insignificant. Fink thinks of Charlie amiably but does not take his plight or his perspective seriously, ignoring Charlie's own personal struggles and concerns. Fink acts more and more self-righteously towards the common man the longer he stays in Hollywood, evidenced by his behavior at the USO dance. The Hotel: Fink has descended into hell. By leaving New York City and the theater, he has left his ideals behind him, exchanging them for money by selling his soul to the devil (Hollywood). Evidence of the Hell analogy: Chet's arrival to greet him from a subterranean room, the 666 elevator reference, the ever increasing heat in the rooms, and, of course, the consuming conflagration at the end of the movie. Notice also the broken pencil with the dust outline in his hotel room. This symbolizes that Hollywood is not a place to be writing anything significant, nor has it been for a long time.The Peeling Wallpaper: The walls are a metaphor for Fink's mental stability. As the movie progresses and Fink's life falls apart, more and more often the wallpaper can be seen peeling away. Charlie has ruined Fink's life since the pair's first meeting. Distracting Fink from his work, murdering his lover, killing his \"friend\" (and possibly family), and getting Fink in trouble with the cops. The wallpaper crumbles like Fink's psyche. The Mosquito: I see this as Hollywood and the work that Fink has been tasked to do sucking him dry of willpower and artistic integrity. The bloodsucking causes him to look ugly to the audience. The film's score (specifically the strings) also sounds very similar to the buzzing of a mosquito. The turning point of the movie is when he kills the mosquito on Audrey's back. It isn't until after Fink kills the mosquito that he is able to write anything he deems meaningful. Whether his script is good or realistically represents the common man is unknown to us but Fink once again has purpose as he writes something for himself, not Hollywood. My guess is his script still doesn't represent the common man since after he completes it, he goes to the dance and still talks down to the military men. This script is more about fulfilling Fink's artistic needs.Charlie: Charlie can be interpreted as having multiple meanings within this film. He seems to be some type of fallen angel, a sinner stuck in hell selling \"fire insurance\". He tries to help people but all his good intentions are ill-advised as all he causes is trouble wherever he goes. He sees that Fink does not listen to the common man or his plight. He watches as Fink pursues wealth over ideals. He hears as Fink literally gets in bed with Hollywood. Charlie kills Audrey. Fink has abandoned Charlie in favor of a new muse (Audrey) by asking her for help with the common man's story instead of listening to Charlie the common man. He had abandoned who he has sworn to write about. Charlie kills Audrey and Mayhew as both a punishment and a lesson for Fink about what selling your soul to the devil will get you. They represent Hollywood over the common man. All Charlie wants is for someone to represent him, the common man. Charlie also represents the rise of fascism at that period of time. You could argue that he represents Hitler's regime. It was something that many people considered harmless at first (Fink's initial impression) that slowly got grimmer and grimmer with time. Many intellectuals of the time just couldn't understand why fascism could be so appealing to the common man. Notice once again how Fink writes Charlie and the common man off, not listening to his ideas or stories. Fascism had a certain allure to the common man that the intellectuals ignored and refused to understand, costing people dearly. The Detectives: It's important to note that the detectives' names are Mastrionotti & Deutsch, stereotypical Italian and German names, respectively. These two, who Fink refers to also as \"common men\", further the allegory of common men under Fascist regimes. The two read Fink's script, not understanding it or particularly caring for it. The two also frown upon Fink's Jewish heritage at one point. This metaphor gets a little hazy since Charlie kills them both. I'm not exactly sure of its significance. The Picture and the Box: Throughout the movie, Fink's eyes are drawn to a picture on his hotel wall. It shows an ocean and a girl, the blue water juxtaposing his current position in hell. This represents his artistic ideals, just a snapshot but not readily attainable to him. Notice as he often looks at it familiarly, as if he's seen it somewhere. At one point, he hangs Charlie's picture in the corner of the frame in an attempt to possibly gain better understanding of the common man. At the end of the movie when the picture is recreated in front of him, Fink is experiencing enlightenment. Has Fink finally regained his moralistic ideals after denying Hollywood the script they wanted? Charlie has given him the box which belongs neither to Charlie nor Fink. It is the box representing the plight of the common man. When the lady asks if it's his, Fink replies that he doesn't know. Fink must decide whether he wants to actually take up the plight of the common man or continue to write shallow artistic pieces about the common man that only please the upper class.",

            "review_title": "One of the Coens' blackest assaults on Hollywood",
            "content": "Barton Fink is another gem from the brothers Coen. Their range and talents knows no bounds. In this day and age of repetitive story lines and same old scenarios, a film headlined by Joel and Ethan Coen is a breath of fresh air. Nethertheless, anyone familiar with the Coens' work will know that beneath their exquisitely stylised sets and impressive visual details is a strain of black, gallows humour that weaves its way like an unsettling tapestry. And Barton Fink is one of their most terrifying films to date. So be warned!Set in the Hollywood of 1941, struggling playwright Barton Fink (John Turturro) has had huge success with a play he penned that he despises. Barton is a man who wants to write material that appeals to the common man. And when he receives an offer from a Hollywood film studio to write a script about a wrestling picture, he doesn't like the idea of \"selling out\", but the offer is too good to turn down.When he arrives in Hollywood, he checks into one of the most bizarre hotels you could ever have the misfortune of being in, the Earle. This is not like any hotel I've ever seen. The lobby is dimly lit. The concierge (Steve Buscemi) emerges from a trapdoor in the floor. And there's an unsettling atmosphere that hangs over the place. Electric fans everywhere try vainly to offset the stifling heat. The hotel service bell has a chime that hangs in the air almost like an afterthought. And the corridors of the Earle seem to just stretch into infinity.Trapped within the confines of his tiny room, Barton is a prisoner of his own imagination. He is struck with a severe case of writers block. There can be nothing more horrifying to a writer than a blank page. And that endless image of a blank page slowly starts to drive Barton mad. A situation not helped by the bizarre dimensions of the Earle, and the people he turns to for help who only add to his growing trauma.After watching Barton Fink, you may find yourself asking what this film is about? One thing that struck me is how similar it seems to Stanley Kubrick's The Shining. The Coen brothers are known fans of Kubrick's work, but I have to say, Barton Fink is a much better film than the one the Coens' idol came up with.The Shining had a potentially promising setup that unfortunately overbalanced into broad senseless violence, as well as the fact it was undone by Jack Nicholson's mugging, and supported by additional characters we couldn't care much about.But Barton Fink shows how the story could and should have been told. The Earle is quite an extraordinary setpiece, and just as impressive as anything Kubrick did with the Overlook. The Coens' were clearly being handed creative freedom on bigger and bigger budgets, something that would reach its zenith with their following film, The Hudsucker Proxy.I love everything about the Earle, and how its designed to do everything within its power to unsettle and unhinge Barton's mind. There are lots of wonderful little details that intensify the frightening nature of the hotel. I like the way whenever you open or close a door at the Earle there's an unsettling 'whoosh' sound. It never fails to make me jump. Or the wallpaper that peels. Its an eerie sight because it does it so slowly. And the muffled sounds of fellow boarders who are only heard. Never seen.But it wouldn't be half as good without great performers. And as usual the Coens' have assembled another terrific ensemble cast. John Turturro can seem an unlikable person at times as Barton, but in my last viewing he seemed much more sympathetic. He's a person who had one idea in his life that paid off, and now he's got nothing left. His creativity is spent. And the hotel seems determined to strip him of his humanity too. And its wrenching to watch.But the one performance that stands out is the always excellent John Goodman as Charlie Meadows, the boarder next door. I was impressed with the way the film introduces his character. Barton complains to the concierge of the racket next door. We hear the sound of a muffled telephone ringing. Muffled talking. The camera remains fixed on the wall the sound is coming from. Footsteps. A door opens. This is all heard remember. Not seen. Then the camera moves slowly towards Barton's door. And finally someone knocks, and it sounds booming. The door opens to reveal Charlie's imposing frame.Whenever the Coens' cast John Goodman, they always make sure to cast him against type. Instead of the good hearted gentle giant he usually plays, in their films he's always a whacked out weirdo. And so it is here. At first Charlie seems pleasant and sympathetic to Barton's problems, but their friendship turns sour when Charlie is not all that he seems. Those final moments in a burning corridor with Charlie blowing people away with a shotgun screaming at the top of his lungs is one of the most terrifying scenes to ever emerge in a Coen film.Barton Fink is also a scathing satire on the Hollywood film industry. The Coens' portray prolific authors as over the hill alcoholics, or media moguls as jaded, bottom of the barrel swindlers. I wonder if this mirrors the Coens' actual sentiments towards the industry they work for.Although I'm a big fan of the Coen brothers and I think Barton Fink is a classic, its a film of theirs I enjoy in small doses. It doesn't quite have the addictive appeal of Fargo or O Brother, Where Art Thou? It's a film that always leaves me physically drained. Just like poor Barton. But then, that may have been the Coens' intent. And the overall point of the film.",

Their comedies have some laughs in them (usually one huge one at the end, especially the more modern ones). So I guess I'm not a huge Coen aficionado. But they do make interesting films, and one of them is Barton Fink, released in 1991. Set in the early 1940s, it's symbolic, metaphoric, heavyhanded and occasionally boring. Not to mention confusing. At least John Goodman was in it.Barton Fink (John Turturro) is a somewhat successful playwright who is offered a job in Hollywood to write a B-movie, a wrestling picture. Living in a small hotel, he becomes friends with Charlie (John Goodman), his next-door neighbor. Barton gets writer's block and falls for his mentor's girlfriend (Judy Davis). Then mysterious events occur.Much like many movies of the early 1990s, Barton Fink isn't really exciting, it's just non-boring for the most part. There's nothing really in it that could really be considered exciting. There's some symbolism, like the wallpaper and the shot of the drain, but visually it's nothing really that new or breathtaking. Sure, there's the Hell references about the place where Barton stays, but the movie needs more than that to keep the viewer interested in its overlong two hour runtime. But like I've said, it's not boring, just non-exciting. Any movie with John Goodman in it can't be all bad, and it definitely isn't.The look at Hollywood in its emerging years is pretty fun to look at, however, and Barton's story is interesting enough. The Coens wrote enough about each character so we could get to know them and their exploits. Granted, some of the subplots went nowhere, and some came out of nowhere (much like the Coens to do, also). The great cast, though, saves the movie. We have Turturro, Goodman, Davis, Tony Shalhoub, Steve Buscemi, typical Coen actors. Each of them put something into Barton Fink to make it just a little more eccentric. If that's possible. Barton Fink is such an odd movie, I think that I'd recommend it to die-hard Coen fans. Not even semi-fans like myself, just the people who think that The Dude is a prophet. At least John Goodman's in it.My rating: 6/10Rated R for language.",

            "content": "\"Barton Fink\" sticks Turturro out front as a NY playwright who comes to Hollywood to write for movies, holes up in a two-bit hotel, gets writer's block, and finds himself in a variety of unpleasant situations which become increasingly surreal/supernatural.  The flick has the Coen's fingerprints all over it with that same kind of sweaty, noirish, plodding \"Blood Simple\" feel though it is a lesser film. \"BF\" takes an easy road to critical acclaim by creating open-ended situations with no clear purpose or resolution; something critics adore as it gives them fodder for subjective interpretation and their usual heady speculation about a film's meaning. Bottom line here as with most films is...does it entertain? Answer: It entertained me as a curiosity but did not at any point engage me emotionally. An okay watch for those with special interest in the Coen's work, fans of the principals, filmheads and students, etc. Probably not for the general public unless surfed on cable. (B-)",

It all looked very pretty and very characterful and all that sort of thing but I always seem to feel with Coen brothers films \u0096 what's the point? As with Fargo, I found the quirks of the characters interesting and watchable, but not very engaging. It was difficult to care who was doing what and why. There always seems to be a certain distance, which I felt in this and Fargo and Hudsucker, where the cleverness of the set ups kind of distances the audiences \u0096 the sort of problem that Barton faced whenever he held forth on his ideals.

            "content": "What the heck was this all about?Well, let's start with the obvious, shall we? Barton Fink is a writer who had a successful production in New York and then was invited to write for Hollywood with a capital H. But all they wanted him to write was... A boxing film with a small b. What eventually - after the long film - Barton came up with was, as he called it, the script of his lifetime. There a person is not in a literal battle but rather a battle against his soul. His manager did not like this but rather than firing Barton because \"it would be too easy\", sent him away to try again.Basically Barton is an artist with a big desire to write about the \"common-folk\". But when his neighbor - the most common-folk you can find - comes to him and begins to tell his story, Barton interrupts him and speaks about his writing struggles.One of the reviewers suggested that Barton doesn't like knowing the true nature of what he's writing about but he is rather obsessed with their idealistic appearances. This is a great comment: Fink never opens the box but he carries it like it matters. Fink in my opinion murders the woman he sleeps with because maybe she would make it all work out, but that would be too neat for him, wouldn't it? And Fink is obsessed with the picture of the girl in his room perhaps, as this same reviewer mentioned, because he cannot see her face.Also, what stroke me is just how many strange things happened without Barton really delving into them and trying the understand why those things might have occured. For example how the bird fell at the end, or how the body was murdered. It almost felt like he lacked curiosity. I mean, even his glasses when he watches the film of the wrestlers in Hollywood reflect it all, almost like they don't allow that 'cheap trash' of a film to reach his brain.The whole film experienced a descent into madness. It all began quite normal and turned crazy just like Barton's mind did - defying reality by the end of the film.However one shot that makes me question whether the film was not just an illusionary thing in Barton's head is the beginning image upon which the credits roll. There we see the same wallpapers as the hotel to which Barton arrives a later. The camera dollies in on the pattern and due to Coens' extensive use of subjective perspective, this suggests that we as an audience might in Barton's head reflecting upon the reality in a snippet of time.What is clearly evident, is that there is too much pressure on Fink. He is asked to do what he isn't ready for. The whole system cheers for him, heck the manager even kissed his foot on the behalf of the studio, but all this does is make Fink madder and madder and makes him attach more importance and otherworldliness to what he does.",

            "content": "This film is not for everyone. Not sure it was for me. It reminds me of jobs I've had, which means basically that just because someone offers you a job doesn't mean it's good or they know what they are doing. It may be better than unemployment, but just barely. It demonstrates the fleeting nature of fame, and the fact that there are more than a few people running around loose who are not all there and some of them are staying at fleabag hotels and others are heads of movie studios. Barton Fink (John Turturro) is a socially conscious New York playwright whose specialty is writing about the people living at the fringes of society. Because he has just written a celebrated play in New York, he gets an offer to become a contract writer for a big film company. It is 1941 just before the war (so far as Americans were concerned) started.When he gets to Los Angeles, it is as though he has arrived in career hell. The studio head is a fast talking fellow behind a big desk in a luxurious office who assigns him the job of writing a wrestling picture. The studio head will not take no for an answer or even let his listeners get a word in edgewise. Meanwhile he meets a famous southern novelist W.P. Mayhew, who must be patterned after William Faulkner who wrote for Hollywood for a while. He tries to gather advice from this eminent writer but he is seemingly constantly in a raging drunk. They are having this talented writer write \"wrestling pictures\" too.So he goes back to his hotel, which is an unmitigated dump. Wallpaper peels off the walls, the plumbing sings, and the walls are paper thin. While complaining to a neighbor about the noise, Charlie Meadows, (John Goodman), he makes his acquaintance with him and he becomes his only friend/confidant. Meadows says he is an insurance salesman who does his best to buck him up and help him out of trouble.Unfortunately Meadows is crazy as a loon as well. Unpleasant things happen such that you are hoping he just wakes up from a nightmare.When I think of the hair that Barton Fink has in this film, I am strongly reminded of another surreal film, David Lynch's \"Eraserhead.\" Just like that film, things happen that are never explained. The characters exist in unremittingly bleak surroundings and, above the oscillating fan at the writer's desk where Barton Fink suffers from severe writer's block, you see a girl sitting on the beach. He brought a box tied with string that Meadows had given him before leaving for New York, and, strangely, while walking on a similar beach meets the girl on the beach in the picture back at his hotel. I could guess what was in the box, but you never see it.",

John Turturro gives his all time best as the anxious playwright looking for some sort of peace (also he has one of the best dance numbers in this), John Goodman is devilishly good as Charlie Meadows, the strange insurance salesman with a secret, and when the unsettling secrets start to come forward, strap in for one hell of a conclusion. The film is unpredictable, darkly humorous throughout and full of symbolism hiding in the open ready for viewers to catch with multiple views.

            "content": "The story is set in 1941. Playwright Barton Fink (John Turturro) is hired from a Hollywood studio for writing some scripts. He moves to Los Angeles and settles in the hotel Earle. He is first assigned to write a script about a boxing film, but has the writer's block because of the unfamiliar subject. Then he hears some noise and the cause is Charlie Meadows (John Goodman), an insurance salesman that lives next door and which he becomes friends with. Barton meets with Audrey Taylor and make love in his room, but the morning after she is found violently murdered: Charlie has the idea of disposing of the body without calling the police. Soon after, Fink is visited by two police detectives that inform him that Charlie Meadows is a fake name for Karl Mundt, a serial killer that beheads his victims. Fink manages to write the script in only one setting and after Mundt shoots the detectives in the hotel ingulfed by flames, he escapes on a beach identical to that of the painting in his room.This is probably one of the strangest movies by the Coen brothers because of many factors: the atmosphere, the performances, the twists and turns, and many subtle touches only the Coen brothers could have set up. John Turturro is great in one of his few leading man roles and the same goes for John Goodman as a man who doesn't look really who it seems. Some of the strangest moments actually reminded me of FAMILY GUY, and now I am wondering if those writers saw this.Overall, one of the Coen brothers' strangest movies and a nice satire.",

            "content": "I've glanced at some of the reviews for this film left by members of IMDb. I've seen bizarre, surreal - they fit for sure. I wouldn't call \"Barton Fink\" a comedy, a dark comedy, or a drama. If I had to choose a genre, it would be horror film. And that seems to sum up the Coen Brothers' view of Hollywood.John Turturro is Barton Fink, an intellectual playwright whose hit play garners him an offer from Hollywood in 1941. He'd rather stay in New York to help usher in the theater of the common man, but he takes the job. It's $1,000 a week, and possibly more, but he chooses to stay in a $25.50/week art deco hotel, The Hotel Earle, where the mosquitoes bite, the wallpaper peels off of the walls, and there's noise from the neighbors. He meets his mercurial new boss Jack Lipnick (Michael Lerner), possibly modeled on Harry Cohn - the tipoff is that the character is supposedly illiterate, and he makes a comment that his studio doesn't make B pictures.Fink is assigned a producer, Ben Geisler (Tony Shaloub) who couldn't care less about getting a script from Fink - until Lipnick calls him. Meanwhile, poor Barton has writer's block.He has two friends in Hollywood - his neighbor, a burly insurance salesman named Charlie, and Audrey, the secretary (Judy Davis) of his idol, the literary drunk W. P. Mayhew (John Mahoney) - he's got a disturbed wife living in the south, so you know here we're talking F. Scott Fitzgerald. When Fink is ordered to Lipnick's house to tell the story of his script, he calls Audrey in a panic for help.To say this is an unusual film is a gross, gross understatement - it travels quickly from comedy to drama to horror in what seems like a matter of minutes. Underlying all that is a pretty heavy statement.The only real problem I have with this film is where the plot is placed historically, though I understand why the Coen brothers placed it there. The common man's theater and works like Fink supposedly writes or wants to write, a la Clifford Odets, all happened a decade before.Fink in Hollywood is assigned a wrestler movie, a B picture for Wallace Beery. The formula for the plot sounds suspiciously like \"The Champ\" or \"Flesh,\" again, ten years earlier. None of this distracts from the film, but as a film historian, it bugs me.The most fascinating part of this movie for me is who Barton Fink is as opposed to how he sees himself. He wants to write about the common man, but he never once asks his neighbor to elaborate on any of the stories he says he has. He doesn't seem interested in getting to know any common men, and he seems to have no curiosity about anything.When Charlie leaves him a box before going out of town, Barton never opens it. Does Barton know how to write for the common man? And if he doesn't, will he learn?I love the Coen Brothers - I wasn't prepared for the direction this film took - to which I say, good for them. It's unsettling, but in a world of predictability in cinema, I applaud it. \"Barton Fink\" forces one to look beneath the surface - under all that Hollywood flash.",

People not used to the films of Joel and Ethan Coen always have different reactions to their films. The beauty of the pictures is that each one speaks to different people in different ways. As weird as it may seem, Steven Seagal movies appeal to a certain crowd who can connect with that obscene masculinity. The Coen Brothers' pictures, and I mean pretty much all of them, connect on a cerebral level, and people interested in being intellectually challenged by a film. Before the achievements of Wes Anderson and P.T. Anderson, etc. the Coens were challenging viewers with a different kind of film. A slower paced picture, but one that you could watch a hundred times and continuously love. Every shot so carefully planned that their movies play like a series of paintings pieced together. Barton Fink is no exception to this. It might be, in fact, the epitome of what the Coen Brothers are trying to accomplish. John Turturro, in probably his best performance to date, plays a young, idealistic New York intellectual, who has tasted critical success for his work and accepts a job writing for the pictures in Hollywood. His intelligence and passion for change is not important to his new boss, and he is given a wrestling picture as his first effort.  Outside of Turturro, everyone plays an equally important part as a supporting character, but the most screen time goes to John Goodman, who takes full advantage of every second he's on the screen. The Coen Brothers seem to love Goodman, using him in a lot of their movies, and every time he gets better and better. All of the supporting characters are amazing, however, and the dialogue is so carefully constructed, there's never a moment where the viewer feels like they're watching a Hollywood movie. From beginning to end, this is a solid movie, and young screenwriters should memorize this, as the script is nearly flawless. Hopefully Joel and Ethan Coen will continue making films for a long time; they seem to have the Midas touch. Rating: 36/40",

            "content": "There have been a lot of movies made about Hollywood, the movies and the dreams and situations involved with that. But, never before has it been detailed quite like Barton Fink, a Coen Brothers tale that seems to criticize what is deemed socially good and helpful and does it in a very bizarre and memorable way.As the story goes, the idealistic Barton Fink is a hit on Broadway, so he is commissioned to Hollywood to write a screenplay; a Wallace Beery wrestling picture to be precise. He is nervous, but anxious to put his thoughts down on paper and achieve his goal of writing for the common man. But, he quickly develops writer's block and soon he is drifting away from the actual story while talking to his hotel neighbor (John Goodman in an excellent role) and spending time with a fellow writer and his \"secretary (John Mahoney and Judy Davis, respectably).I will not go into further details of what happens to Barton Fink as they are almost too unbelievable without seeing it first. However, know that this is almost certainly the most philosophical and meaningful film the Coens have ever made with its multiple, complex layers of symbolism and double meanings. Lots of theories have surfaced about the end and the journey of Fink in general, but I find it difficult to surmise which one is the definite answer. I'm sure the Coens had in mind for it to be open to many people.One thing is clear though; this is a very well-made film. Roger Deakins collaborated for the first time with the Coen Brothers here and it is a haunting, dark film with lots of shadows and secrets amongst the settings. The acting is quite tremendous with John Turturro playing the title role as a bewildered but hopeful man who may have only had one play in him and would be unable to write any screenplay. Goodman comes off as very warm and tender and that pays off later in a very strange way. And Mahoney and Davis both bring their roles a lot of emotion and meaning all the while confusing poor Barton even more.What this film really seems to be about is the Coens themselves. For they also started out small in writing their own little independent film and then moved to Hollywood where the temptation to sell out and forget your original intents is strong. Yet, there is also the other end of the spectrum and going too far with your vision so that it blinds you to everything that is visible. As I said, there are a lot of layers to this film and the more you think about it, the more ideas come to mind. If nothing else, this is a film worth thinking about, so you might learn something from the confused Barton Fink.",

            "content": "Barton Fink is a writer who claims to represent the common man. Turturro, at first, presents a rather meek and uninspiring portrait. When his latest play opens to critical success and a round of applause, he slinks away backstage, blinking nervously. And when he gets the big call from Hollywood, he pretends, just for a second, that he has better and more important things to write and do. How often that much can be gleamed from an initial outburst of indignation. Then he accepts anyway, but compromises by staying, not in a pristine Californian mansion, but in a modest, mostly empty hotel. He has convinced himself that it is here where he will find and embrace the common man, and write for them. In Hollywood, no less. His lack of awareness contains a hint of irony, and more dangerously, a solid dose of self importance. This hotel is magnificent in all its grimy splendour. Some have commented that it is a metaphor for the writer's mind, constantly in chaos. There are only ever two other characters that appear in its rooms. So Barton is constantly haunted by these rogue noises, but they do not appear to have a source except from his own room - the noisy wrestling with Charlie, the sex with Audrey, the buzzing of the mosquito. Deakins has created such a vivid image with his lighting - the ray of sunlight ala Edward Hopper that simultaneously brings the room alive, but in a dull sort of way as if the frame is a postcard portrait of a faded painting. The yellow-greens that stick to the walls suggest a heavy, putrid atmosphere where creativity and inspiration come to die. The little postcard painting on the wall is the only exterior outlet in the room, but although the camera slowly zooms until the frame is fully enveloped, it offers no solace from isolation and confinement. The wallpaper is sticky with humidity and dripping like Charlie's ear, and as it peels itself off with a speed that seems accelerated by Barton's paranoia, he hastily pats it back down. He doesn't look for meaning or understanding, but convinces himself that these are the conditions to pen his common man masterpiece.The common man is of course Goodman's Charlie, whom he plays with a rotund, jovial manner that is instantly approachable, even for a recluse such as Barton. In a Coen twist, he is serial killer, but this does not seem to dilute his message. In fact, it heightens all his intricacies and experiences on the road. He comes hands full into his room with the miracles and stories of the common man, and Barton listens, without particularly much thought, and rattles on pretentiously about his own magnum opus. Earlier on, he calls to complain, but shrinks instantly when confronted with an accusation. Meanwhile his whole career is seemingly falling away beside him in disarray; the studio executive talks at a hundred miles an hour about a love interest and raising a young orphan, his idol has been consumed by Hollywood and outed as a semi-fraud, and he is suffering from writer's block. The Coens characterise this with these hauntingly slow zooms which bore into the object they are targeting; a terrified glance at the ringing telephone, taking us into and through the typewriter and wall-plaster, as a mosquito's spiralling descent finds blood to feast on, and as Audrey and he has sex, burrowing down the sinkhole. And twice, we get extreme closeups of keys clacking, before the reveal is of a secretary typing away, not our famed writer. There is another interpretation that bears merit. Fink's Jewishness, and in turn the Coens' own roots, are repeatedly stamped upon and dismissed. At an impasse in his all important career, he sells out but continues to stuff his ears and convince himself that he is the champion of the common man, all whilst Hollywood is booming and quite ironically, becoming what the common man flocks to see. Clearly, he should have stayed a playwright. In 1941, even as the boss dresses up in military uniform and berates his lack of social awareness and the predicament of the war-front, he continues writing what is to be a never seen piece of work. Do we ever see more than the opening lines of his typewriter? Do we hear more than the closing lines of his critically acclaimed stage-play? When he finally hits that epiphany, he goes and celebrates with the common man, and is assaulted with a cacophony of jeers and insults and seems shocked that he is not revered for his work. He ends up wandering on the beach front. This is not a faded painting, this is the picturesque ocean and sand in all its beauty. And a girl, too. \"Are you in pictures?\" he ventures. He is so out of touch with the common man that when he is confronted with a common woman, he is completely entranced by her beauty. It has to be something that Hollywood has snapped up, does it not? Barton is not as pathetically despicable as Jerry in Fargo, nor is he as pitiful as the self- loathing, mentally-blocked Charlie Kaufman. But he is eternally perplexed. He has penned a masterpiece.

            "content": "Joel and Ethan Coen's BARTON FINK is a fairly self-important film that the two brothers wrote during the filming of MILLER'S CROSSING. It's a film that originated from the creative entanglements accompanied with a writer's block, and so the viewer will have the honor of carefully observing the creative duo's semi-biographical process of writing a movie. This relatively simple contemplation is only one part of the film - characters go aloof, genre conventions blends, heavy-handed themes occur, and symbolism is dearly welcomed. Expected yes, but it's managed in a way that's better than most, and the extraneous surreality that many finds bothering, only added to my interest of the movie. Fine performances all around, and Coen-companion Roger Deakins does a brilliant job.",

            "content": "*Read this review only if you've seen Barton Fink and want to read analysis, not if your thinking of seeing the movie.First of all, Barton Fink is some serious brain candy.  There are so many issues and so many symbols in this movie that are great to discuss.  To name a few big ones, think companionship, jealousy, damnation, fascism, racism, vigilantism, interventionism, pretentiousness, creativity, the right to be a jerk, corporate power and dumb Hollywood style all rolled into a movie that IS writer's block.   Like the other Coen brother's movies, there is an absolutely unique feel to the movie, created mostly by fabulous imagery and a handful of great characters.  The acting is about the best I've ever seen in a movie.  The cast has a lot of 'hey I've seen that guy' guys who are all awesome.  They include:John Turturro - Is there a better actor in the business?  No.  The Coen brothers and Spike Lee seem to know this, when will the Academy?  Turturro carries the movie as Barton Fink, there's amazing depth to his expressions. I love his trance, sort of a \"what the hell happened\" expression during the scenes on the beach and beside the pool... does the serenity of water signify something about that... maybe a serenity he desires yet would kill his writing?  Who knows, there's A LOT to think about in this movie.Michael Lerner - This guy was fabulous as Lipnick, the studio boss.  While his long, loud, chatty lines, are extremely funny but not particularly original, his praise of Barton is genius, hitting a ridiculous high that is absolutely hysterical.  Like the other characters, listen carefully to his lines, (if you're not laughing too hard), the second time you see the movie you'll undoubtedly notice something very funny about the line, \"Never heard of it. Let's move him to the Grand, or the Wilshire, or hell, he can stay at my place.\"Tony Shaloub - He's a great actor and he shows it here.  He's a stressed out producer who seems to be the last one to know what movies he's producing. He has a couple great lines.John Mahoney - He was great in Eight Men Out and Frasier, and he's good in this movie too as a drunk southern writer (Faulkner?) who is somewhat belligerent but at the same time very lofty and whimsical, explaining that he writes simply because he loves to create, the antithesis of Barton's belief that a writer must have pain.  It's classic how Barton very quickly turns from admiring him so much to thinking he's a son of a bitch.Steve Buscemi - He is the perfect cast as Chet (Charon?) the friendly but very eerie hotel clerk.  The hotel is already quite bizarre with its odd wallpaper and long empty hallways and Buscemi is the perfect complement to it.John Goodman - He truly elevates this movie to greatness.  His performance was perfect.  He captures the essence of the everyman with astounding detail.  In his handful of simple scenes with Turturro he is so convincing and genuine that his truth is hard to stomach, could the everyday man slip into evil so easily (Nazism?) and still be such a nice guy?  The transition from the very authentic real life feel of the movie to the ridiculous and allegorical conclusion follows Goodman, and he absolutely makes it happen. The transition is jarring at first, but when you think back on it, it makes perfect sense and there are many clues that lead up to it.  It is a fantastic finale to an all-time great movie.",

            "content": "Anyone who already knows the Coen Brothers WONT be reading this review. He or she will be watching this brilliant movie, because he or she knows that these twin directors belong to the absolute pinnacle of independent movie making. However brilliant this picture is, I wont advice you to go watch it, UNLESS you can stumach a lot of mental anguish.To put it like a character in the movie itself exclaimed: \"this is a fruity picture about suffering\". This is not one of those pictures I would therefore ever dare recommend to my friends or family if they just wanna be entertained. \"Barton Fink\" however is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED though to every movie geek or arthouse movie lover who doesnt care about leaving the cinema with dark and mentally disturbing feelings. Because having just watched \"Barton Fink\" feels as if I have just been mentally gutted. But in a \"good\" way... You know what I mean, some movies just have that mesmirizing ability to keep me glued to my seat watching the most disturbing scenes. Not physically disturbing, but mentally. Yet these mentally sewer like scenes are photographed, acted, edited, scored with such craftmanship that it is simultaneously devastating and exhilarating to watch. These opposites are typical for the brilliant direction style of the Coen Brothers.Just ike a character in \"Barton Fink\" also claims, this is probably the best work ever written by the Coen Brothers. But it certainly is also the darkest one. It starts out pretty and charming and funny though, but then I slowly get pulled in deeper and deeper into a sewer of despair which plagues the main character John Turturro, who is a writer with paralyzing writer's block. He slowly seems to lose his mind, fighting deamons inside his head.Photography is done by Roger Deakins and it deserves a special mention, because these scenes are photographed with such marvellous attention to detail, that almost every scene looks like a painting. It is just jawdropping gorgeous to watch hell being portrayed with such an abundance of colors, shades and depth. There is a lot of ear candy as well. Carter Burwell's soundtrack deserves all the praise for his eery yet wonderfully mesmirizing soundtrack. The rest of the sound department must also have had a field day with this picture, because some usually bland sounds, like opening a door to a hallway sound as if a vaccuum to insanity is set ajar. You will know what I mean once you have heard it...It are these hypnotizing photographic and sound details that make \"Barton Fink\" such a joy to watch over and over again. As I have been doing for the past several decades, experiencing so much joy and mental anguish simultaneously... Just brilliant!",

Just lifelike enough for us to neither like, dislike, of care about him. We don't care that he works for a raving lunatic of a studio boss,  we don't understand why he lives in a huge, seemingly empty hotel with walls sweating off their paper.It is not explained why the bellhop comes up through a trapdoor behind the front desk, nor why the elevator operator is apparently near comatose.\nSeemingly, the only other guest on Fink's floor is John Goodman, playing a manic version of Dan Conner, and doing a bad job of it; you don't believe him for a second.Although it may have received a certain critical acclaim, do not inflict this turkey on yourself under any circumstances.  This is not funny-bad, its REALLY bad!  It has all the charm of a dirty toilet. Life is a God-given gift.  It is surely sinful to waste two hours of it watching this absolute rotting garbage.",

But this film was full of ambiguous symbolism. It reminds me of people at my church that can make symbolism out of everything... twist it to be whatever best supports their mood. If you are looking for something to twist, to mull over then this film is for you. By the end of the film, you don't know if ANY of the characters were real. And you'll never know. There is no fight-club-ish moment of truth that makes you want to rewatch the film. This was the least satisfying mind-job I've ever had. If you want to feel smart and insightful, then watch this movie. I would recommend fast forwarding over any part where a single violin can be heard. Don't slow it down til dialogue resumes. As a matter of fact, fast forward over the whole film. Watch some flies buzz around and make some symbolism out of that. It would be just as productive.",

            "content": "In the opening scene of Barton Fink, Barton is standing nervously in the wings watching his play being performed. Watching the film for at least the 4th or 5th time the other day, I realized that the off-camera voices of two of the stage actors were--I would bet money on it--John Turturro and (Mrs. Joel Coen) Frances McDormand (uncredited, of course)! The solipsism of John Turturro as Barton Fink listening to his own voice as one of the stage actors in his play blew my mind. But that's just a bit of trivia--I doubt very much there was any intentional irony there.Trivia aside, Barton Fink is a masterpiece of satire, rich in atmosphere and symbolism, boasting razor-sharp writing and career performances by John Turturro, John Goodman, Michael Lerner, and John Mahoney, as well as fine contributions from Jon Polito and Judy Davis. As an allegorical story, the surrealism is introduced slowly but sure-handedly, until all hell breaks loose, literally and figuratively--well, literarily and figuratively--in the third act.Barton Fink, as you surely know, is a New York playwright who wants to forge a new theater about and for the working class. His noble aspiration is tempered by his obvious dilettantism bordering on condescension. His first meeting with Everyman Charlie Meadows, he spouts off about the theater ignoring the \"common man,\" but every time Charlie says \"I could tell you stories,\" Barton cuts him off and continues pontificating.Barton is lured to Hollywood for one reason: money. Despite the fact that Barton's New York success is hardly solidified, he buys his agent's thesis that a successful screenplay could finance any number of plays, and immediately heads for what Bill Mayhew (John Mahoney) archly refers to as the \"Great Salt Lick.\" He has barely set foot in Hollywood when the surrealism is introduced by the bell at the front desk of the Hotel Earle, which continues to sound for a good minute like one of those (what do they call them?) \"infinity chimes\".The Hotel is so palpable, it's almost a separate character in the unfolding tragedy that befalls our poor protagonist. It's so oppressively hot, the wallpaper is peeling off the walls. The hallways stretch eerily to the vanishing point. As Barton settles into the mother of all writer's blocks, inspiration hovers tantalizingly over his typewriter in the form of a tacky painting of a mysterious woman sunbathing on the beach. The words of the opening paragraph upon which he has found himself stuck taunt him from the very page of the hotel Bible.I could go on and on. This is the Coen brothers at the peak of their powers. It's Raising Arizona meets Fargo. Small wonder it swept Cannes in unprecedented fashion.",

But I have found that, among all that variety, you can normally separate those films into two categories: they're serious thrillers (FARGO etc) and their weird comedies (O BROTHER, WHERE ART THOUGH? etc). Both types are usually good, although the comedies sometimes turn out badly in my opinion. Maybe I just don't get them. In any case, BARTON FINK is great AND I felt it is their one film that straddles the line between the two categories, and it does a great job at it. For that reason, it is unique among their films, while still feeling very much like a Coen brothers film, having elements of both types.It tells the story of Hollywood screenwriting in the golden days, like a SUNSET BLVD for a new generation. It features fantastic performances from John Goodman and others and the story is wonderful and unpredictable. You'll never guess what happens. It's not the Coen brothers' best film, but it's one of their best. Highly recommend.",

            "content": "I always say that my favourite Coen brothers movie is the last one I watched, because almost all their movies to date have been brilliant, and it's very difficult to choose THE best. But lately I've been leaning towards 'The Big Lebowski'. In the back of my mind there's always been 'Barton Fink'. For some odd reason I have never owned this movie and I have been waiting for a DVD release to rectify that oversight. Eventually I got sick of waiting (and for 'Miller's Crossing') and went out and rented it again, and it's just as great as I remember it to be. So now I'd say it ties with Lebowski as my favourite. Both movies are wildly original and funny works that draw upon many genres. They also both feature John Goodman, John Turturro, Steve Buscemi and Jon Polito. But people's reactions to the two greatly differ in my experience. I haven't met anybody yet that I've brow-beaten into watching Lebowski that didn't enjoy it, but 'Barton Fink' is more of an acquired taste, and often doesn't go down well.  Some people just don't \"get it\". Maybe it's too dark for them, maybe it's too esoteric talking about \"Wallace Beery wrestling movies\" and \"that Barton Fink feeling\", I don't know. But I loved it! And for me it is almost as hilarious as Lebowski. Turturro gives a great performance, Goodman an even better one, possibly the best of his career to date. Their scenes together are absolutely brilliant. I also loved the bits between Turturro, Polito and Michael Lerner. Lerner is fantastic in this, easily his best role. And I also really enjoyed John Mahoney's portrayal of a William Faulkneresque alcoholic writer. But really EVERYBODY is superb in this movie, I can't fault any of them.  And the script, direction, editing, sets, costumes, music are all amazingly well done. 'Barton Fink' is a masterpiece and I cannot recommend it highly enough.  It may not be the Coen brothers most accessible movie but it is definitely one of the best movies they have made to date.",

A Sturges-like screwball satire of dyspeptic Hollywood, a Polanski terror opera about claustrophobia, carrion and heat, a moody noir, a Kubrickian essay on the relationship of creativity to murder, and an Eastern European-feeling allegory of the Holocaust, FINK has more impacted layers than a nine-bean dip. And the Coens are in immaculate control of every last sprocket: each framing, each camera movement, the nuances of each performance are served up with a silent headwaiter's mastery. Funny, chilling, altogether indelible, BARTON FINK is the brothers' one work to date that can stand at the front ranks of American movies.

We, too, are reluctant for him to leave New York.  We know, as deep down he knows as well, that from the moment the ink is dry on the studio contract his whole life, slowly but surely, will spiral down the drain, into the sewer, and beyond.And so it does.  It's all done with a fine attention to detail, for Fink is as mindful of the little things as the Coen brothers are.  It's not enough that he live in a crummy hotel room with the wallpaper peeling off - the wallpaper must make NOISES as it peels off, and then peel off only half way, and hang precariously while Fink watches in an agony of suspense.  I have only begun to describe the finer points of Fink's torture.  And the strange thing is, every moment of it is riveting.Of course, all the big things go wrong as well, for which Fink himself is, in a way, to blame.  As with all great tragedies the hero has one minor flaw for which he is unmercifully punished.  But we like Barton.  We forgive him his unimportant faults.  At any rate, they're not the reason we take such guilty pleasure in his destruction.  It's not because we're sadists, either. We're simply responding to quality.  The Coen brothers have fashioned a witty, cast-iron script; a good use has been found for John Goodman (who I never thought much of until I saw this film); and John Turturro keeps our eyes glued in affection to the title character.We also get to see that great rat-faced guy from `Fargo'.  I don't even want to know his name.  I'll just continue thinking of him as the rat-faced guy from `Fargo'.",

Coen Brothers are not new to period dramas but they have pushed a notch higher in giving attention to detail here. While the consistency with their trademark quirky characters in Goodman and Lerner are omnipresent here, what rubbed me good and bad was the abrupt meta finish of this movie.Set in the 1930s, Barton Fink (John Turturro) is a budding stage writer who tasted his first success and gets immediately pulled by a Hollywood big shot Jack Lipnick (Michael Lerner). He is assigned to come up with an entertaining script about a wrestler while he is accommodated in a small time motel in Los Angeles. With the condition of his room deteriorating due to heat and a loud, intrusive neighbor Charlie Meadows (John Goodman), Barton hits a writer's block. With time running out, he befriends the secretary cum wife Audrey Taylor (Judy Davis) of a yesteryear's great writer W.P.Mayhew (John Mahoney). One day everything goes from bad to worse.First commendation goes for the excellent set pieces, art direction and attention to detail for the period. The script does occasionally have its pace breakers featuring John Mahoney's thread, otherwise it is quite entertaining. John Goodman gives a terrific performance as an intrusive neighbor who knocks the door at the wrong time and couldn't stop blabbering about the trivialities. But Michael Lerner steals the show with his breathless lines and impeccable comic timing leaving you wanting for more. I am unsure if I am impressed or disappointed by the abrupt closing credits though it looks beautiful, but I am sure surprised knowing other works from the Coen Brothers. There are quite a few theories floating around the internet justifying the climax, none comes even remotely close to convince me. The turn of events with John Goodman's character comes off as expected but is a little underwhelming. Though the atmosphere is perfectly set for a thriller, it does not reach the levels set by standard so high for a Coen Brother's filmExcellent performances in a rather rare and slightly undercooked script.",

            "content": "John Turturro is Barton Fink, a young NYC playwright who's become a hot property after the success of his current work. Soon, he is hired to fly out to LA to write for the movies. Meeting with studio mogul Jack Lipnick (a great Michael Lerner), he is then hired to write a B level picture about wrestling. The trouble for Fink is that he knows zilch about the sport, and inspiration just won't strike. There are also distractions, such as Finks' gregarious next-door neighbour Charlie Meadows (a memorable John Goodman), with whom Fink develops a friendship, and Fink encountering washed-up novelist W.P. Mayhew (John Mahoney), who's now an alcoholic, and Mayhews' long-suffering secretary / companion Audrey Taylor (Judy Davis).Made around the time when the Coen brothers were going through their own period of writers' block, \"Barton Fink\" is certainly one of their most interesting efforts. This viewer really didn't mind its eventual descent into the utterly grim and bizarre. It's incredibly atmospheric - the viewer gets the oppressive feeling of the low-rent hotel at which Fink stays, complete with stifling heat and wallpaper that is always coming unglued. The dialogue contains some very entertaining exchanges as characters discuss the writing process, with Fink taking himself a little too seriously and being pretentious about the whole thing. The characters are all thoroughly engaging, and brought to life by a typically eclectic cast for a Coen brothers film: also co-starring are Tony Shalhoub, Jon Polito, Steve Buscemi, Richard Portnow, and Christopher Murney. Lerner has only three brief scenes, but he makes the most of his screen time, and he earned an Oscar nomination in the process. Turturro is right on point as the troubled, artistically inclined Fink, and Goodman is just a delight, even though his character does ultimately become over the top.Enhanced by its cinematography (regular Coen brothers collaborator Roger Deakins was the D.P. here), production design (by Dennis Gassner), and a typically wonderful Carter Burwell score, \"Barton Fink\" might not be for everybody, but it's definitely of a piece with other Coen brothers films, and should definitely hit a nerve with anybody who's ever done any creative writing.Eight out of 10.",

I have seen every one of their films from Blood Simple to the recent Ladykillers. The later, in my opinion is the only bad movie the brothers have ever made. But Barton Fink is something of an oddity. It's the most abstract of all their films and leaves almost everything to the viewers own interpretation. There are so many questions left unanswered. The photo of the woman in the hotel room that comes to life at the end and the screaming coming from the sink drain, just to name a few. A lot of people have interpreted this film from a biblical standpoint and that's definitely justified. But my main problem with this film is that it doesn't seem to have a point. It's one think to leave some details to the viewers imagination, but to have an entire film based in abstraction and to end it with absolutely no resolution is another. Frankly, this film left me wanting. And with nothing but questions that can't be answered. So to sum up, Barton Fink is by no means a bad movie. It's just a muddled one. Albeit, a muddled one with outstanding performances. We feel much the way Turturro's character feels at the end; Lost, confused, and unsure of the events that have just transpired.",

This Coen brothers project was artsy, eccentric, and strange. The characters and even the scenarios were all hyperbolized.Barton Fink was a playwright from New York. He wanted to make a little more money so he took a job with Capital Pictures in Hollywood. Once he reached the west coast and settled into his tiny weekly rental room he began running into strange people and having strange interactions. I don't know if this was a true representation of 1940's Hollywood or just a depiction of how strange it can be. In any case, the only real conflict and drama was whether or not Barton Fink would finish a script in time for a wrestling movie--and if he did--would it be acceptable.They were able to hone in on Fink's listlessness and inability to write such that it was more dramatic than it should have been. Other than that I'd say the picture was rather random.",

            "content": "I've only read the first page of the reviews posted here on IMDb but I'm still astonished that none of those makes the connection - crystal clear imo - of Fink/Clifford Odets and Mayhew/William Faulkner which leads me to the conclusion that to a man those reviewers on the first page are either 1) too young to have first hand knowledge of American Literature in the thirties and forties or 2) too ignorant of the same subject in the same time-frame. Fact: Clifford Odets wrote a One-Act Play, Waiting For Lefty, about a strike amongst taxi-drivers in 1930s New York. The play was clearly biased in favour of the 'workers' and was produced by The Theatre Group, a well-known left-wing outfit. On the strength of its instant success Odets was invited to Hollywood and wrote a screenplay, The General Died At Dawn, starring Gary Cooper, released in 1936, set in China with not a wrestler in sight. Unlike Fink Odets never experienced writers' block and went on to write many successful stage plays - Golden Boy, Clash By Night, The Country Girl - and movies - Humoresque, Deadline At Dawn, The Sweet Smell Of Success plus an adaptation of his own successful anti-Hollywood drama The Big Knife. For reasons best known to themselves the Coen Brothers and John Turturro contrive to invest Fink with a striking resemblance to the real Odets. Novelist William Faulkner, later to win the Nobel Prize for Literature, wrote many highly acclaimed novels beginning in the late 1920s which made little or no money; in the early 1930s he received an offer from Hollywood, accepted it and was introduced to Howard Hawkes with whom he formed a lasting friendship based on a mutual love of drinking and hunting. Although married he had a long affair with Hawks' secretary, Meta Carpenter, and again, anyone with even the most cursory knowledge of Am Lit would make the connection. In my case these 'homages' are a leading selling point of Barton Fink which tends to lose me once the pretentious meanderings take hold.",

            "content": "\"Barton Fink\" is, my very, personal favorite Coen brothers movie, and John Turturo gives a marvelous performance in his role as the titular Barton Fink, a playwright who is ready to take the big step and write script for a feature film in Hollywood. Barton will have to face a severe writer's block while peculiar literary personas and his mysterious neighbor (John Goodman) in the -hellish- hotel that he now resides. As the plot progresses, our protagonist will have to face a nightmarish scenario that involves finding a murdered woman in his hotel bed, totally ignorant of what happened.The point in \"Barton Fink\" is not a very intricate and labyrinthine plot, but the characters and the remarkable dialogue written by the Coen brothers. All characters, except Barton himself, possess a bizarre cartoonist quality that gives the movie a hyper-real dimension. The Capitol production director Jack Lippnick, portrayed impeccably by Michael Lerner, the suspicious hotel employee (Steve Buscemi) and the renowned literary giant W.P. Mayhew (John Mahoney) all have a caricature aspect.There are also actors in the cast that have cooperated with the brothers many times such as Jon Polito in the role of Lipnick's sidekick, Lou Breeze.The movie is somehow self-referential for the Coen brothers, there is a kind of meta- feeling -especially in some parts- and I could easily imagine Barton Fink as Joel or Ethan. There are a lot of interesting arguments and ideas here and the viewer should be focused on the great dialogue through which the above originate. In my personal opinion, \"Barton Fink\" along with \"The Man Who Wasn't There\" and \"Fargo\" are the top-3 films created by Joel and Ethan Coen. It should also be mentioned that this film's production began when the two auteurs made the bold decision to take a break in the shooting of \"Miller's Crossing\" taking advantage of this hiatus to create \"Barton Fink\". So the film was, in a way, a side-project for the brothers and the result is what we saw one screen. Another cornerstone for the Neo-noir genre, yet this movie even though it shares some common characteristics with the genre's requirements, it cannot be strictly confined in just one genre. I would claim that it permeates more than four -perhaps- five genres at the same time. We need more pictures like this and inspired creators like the Coen duo.",

            "review_title": "A Coen morality play",
            "content": "'Barton Fink' is a difficult film to categorize, even for a Coen brothers creation. On the one hand, it's extremely funny, on the other, profoundly dark and disturbing. It's more akin to 'Fargo' than 'The Big Lebowski'.It is also reminiscent of some of David Lynch's films, especially 'Mulholland Drive' which also deals with the toxicity of the Hollywood movie industry. 'Barton Fink' ventures well within the boundaries of surrealism and shifting dimensions and dreams.'Barton Fink' and 'Mulholland Drive' both have, as leading protagonists, young, idealistic, na\u00efve and talented people who, having made it big back home, come to Hollywood to make it big in pictures. Hollywood destroys both of them in the end. Barton Fink's destruction is much less grizzly and horrifying than Lynch's hapless heroine, but it is nonetheless destruction, perhaps even more awful because Barton lives. I'm not sure if he lives in a real world of contractual obligations that have doomed him to penurious slavery to a production studio or whether he has checked-out into a fantasy world of his own and is in reality strapped to a bed in a lunatic asylum which we never see. Or do we never see it? The Hotel Earle, where Barton finds himself upon arrival in Hollywood, seems to qualify as a setting for a madhouse to me. The ever-present, awake and polite bellboy, desk manager and shoe-shiner, Chet, played with insouciant, almost robotic, aplomb by Steve Buscemi, is the first of the inmates Barton encounters. Chet is non- threatening, helpful and efficient, but with the detached air of a lower angel who has orders not to interfere with the destinies of the inmates in their charge.Then Barton goes up into the bowels, as it were, of the hotel, to his room. That room! Here is where much of the film takes place and it is a deeply disturbing setting. There is an element of comic-book satire about the set, yet, for those who have lived in Hollywood under similar circumstances, all too familiar. The peeling, gooey wallpaper, the lone killer mosquito buzzing around at night, the sounds of fornicating strangers coming through the wall behind the bed, the sudden mysterious thumps and moans from the floor above- all contribute to upsetting the viewers' equilibrium. The atmosphere of dread prevails from the moment Barton arrives at the Hotel Earle, but there are many felicities along the way. Moments when normalcy seems to alive and healthy. Judi Davis is the single character who offers relief from the phantasmagoria surrounding Barton. She is Audrey Taylor, the girlfriend of W.P. Mayhew (John Mahoney), a famous writer, clearly based upon F. Scott Fitzgerald, who has succumbed to whisky to escape the hell he is living in. He exists only to sign large paychecks while Audrey writes his books for him.Judy Davis injects wonderful humor and worldly wisdom and sympathy into what would otherwise be a relentless, brutal attack on our nervous systems. But Hollywood takes no prisoners, except perhaps Barton, and Audrey, well, I don't want to give away one iota of the plot because it is so shocking, so I'll won't say anymore about Audrey or Bill Mayhew. John Mahoney is just as brilliant in this role as Judi Davis is in hers. The humor is very dark and cynical, yet these two are endearing and one has a deal of compassion for their fates.John Turturro plays Barton Fink. An arrogant, self-absorbed, condescending pup who has made it in New York with a play. He dons an Eraser-head haircut which endears him to the viewer in spite of his childish know-it-all approach.John Goodman, typically, steals the show, as he does in 'The Big Lebowski'. Charlie (Goodman) is similar to Walter, his character in 'Lebowski' accept that Walter is not... once again I can't say anything more about this because the outcome of Goodman's character is also a stunner.Audrey, at one point, is explaining to Barton about the basic structure of a wrestling film, it being a simple morality play. That's what this film is too. And it's right out of the Brothers Grimm. The film switches gear at one point and something happens, we flip into an alternate universe. The camera closes in on the sink in the hotel bathroom and proceeds to go down the drain. The meaning is clear cut and needs no explanation. From here on out Barton is doomed, everyone is doomed. The hotel becomes a scene of surreal activities. At first I thought the Coen's had failed miserably to create some sort of apocalypse but after years of watching this thing it has dawned on me that it isn't supposed to be realistic. Which has led me to think that Barton has checked-out of the Hotel Earle (his reality) and gone on to someplace else, some purgatory meaningful only to him as he sits out his term of indenture to the bloated demon, the producer, (Michael Lerner) who has chained Barton to his leg. Barton has become just another creature, chittering away at his master's feet.I remember when I was invited to a friend's house to see this film for the first time she said 'I'm afraid to watch this film again.'All who would pursue fame and fortune in Hollywood, without familial or connubial connections, be afraid, very afraid.",

Even though it takes a break from the comedic social commentary the Coen brothers are content with, it is a surprisingly dark study of the minds of screenwriters, which is very strong commentary of its own.Barton Fink, a screenwriter in 1941, wants to make it big in Hollywood, but suffering from writers block, being secluded in his hot and moist hotel room, and constantly being interrupted by his overly outgoing neighbor, (John Goodman) he soon discovers the dark but true nature of L.A.John Turturro is absolutely phenomenal in this, he really gives us the struggle of artistic determination in a place that wants nothing but cheap entertainment. His philosophical study of the \"life of the mind\" and \"the common man\" are implanted through several layers of themes in the film, making for multiple re watchings. Every scene is dripping with atmosphere, as we get deeper and deeper into the madness going on in this man's mind, and what eventually unfolds into a world of random unluckiness that becomes his downfall.The set pieces, the dialogue, and the characters put you into the environment, and valiantly display the evil representation of corrupt production companies, as well as the complexity of the common man.This film is not as appreciated as other Coen films.

            "content": "The Coens are truly equal-opportunity cynics. In this brilliant riff on the movie business, they lampoon serious writing and studio dreck, and the people responsible for both, with the same artful abandon. Employing a story line that, by the last half of the movie, is itself a Hollywood period piece, circa 1941, they pile irony atop irony, torque twist around twist. The result is always entertaining, if frequently cerebral, and laugh-out-loud funny. I enjoyed just counting the many MacGuffins that alluded to other MacGuffins of the period. See that box? It functions here just like the word \"Rosebud\" in \"Citizen Kane\" (1941) or the statuette in \"The Maltese Falcon\" (1941). See that inebriated Southern writer, here the author of \"Nebuchadnezzar,\" working, when he is capable of working, as a Hollywood hack? He's just like Nobel Prize winner William Faulkner, the author of \"Absolom, Absolom!\" (1936), who in fact intermittently wrote screenplays -- \"To Have and Have Not\" (1944) and \"The Big Sleep\" (1946) -- for Warner Brothers in the 1940's. See Charlie Meadows (John Goodman), at the end of the film, grip the bars of Barton Fink's (John Turturro) flophouse bed? The scene alludes, ironically, to the end of \"The Maltese Falcon,\" where Brigid O'Shaughnessy (Mary Astor), being hauled off to jail, is framed behind the bars of an old-time elevator door. See that over-the-top studio boss in a military uniform from wardrobe, here appropriately named Lipnick? Of course, he's a take-off on Jack Warner, whose studio produced the staunchly pro-war \"Sergeant York\" (1941). John Goodman is fabulous as the heavy -- and I do mean heavy -- Charlie Meadows. John Turturro, in a wild hairdo, plays the naif Barton Fink with Odetsian fervor and total innocence. Judy Davis does a fun turn as the Southern writer's, uh, secretary. Michael Lerner fills the set as the Warner-like Lipnick. Add to these strengths the top-drawer costumes, set, music, and cinematography, and you have a fine fine film.",

What the film seems most concerned with is the difficulties facing writers - the search for artistic truth, struggling with writer's block, and being pressured by corporate executives interested in profit over beauty and meaning. At the same time, it's amusing that one writer (John Turturro) empathizes with the \"common man\" intellectually but is so wrapped up in his own theories that he talks over one in a conversation, and another writer (a stand-in for William Faulkner) has all but abandoned his craft to that he can drink to excess all day long.The film as a whole seems to be an allegory for a writer selling one's soul by going to Hollywood. Turturro's character checks himself in to a personal hell of sorts and lives a nightmare. What's in the box, we wonder. Is there really a box? Is it just a burden he has to carry around for having compromised himself artistically? Something he dares not open for fear of revealing that his life has become a phony, like the picture he sees of the woman on the beach and then finds himself living?

            "review_title": "Fascinatingly enigmatic ...",
            "content": "John Turturro is Barton Fink, an established playwright who just signed what seems to be his masterpiece: a story about fishmongers. As the play concludes, Fink, standing in the backstage, recites the last lines, riveted by the greatness of his own words. New York Critics are rave and his reputation earns him a ticket to Capitol Pictures, in Hollywood, where he's assigned to write a screenplay for a wrestling movie.Barton Fink, both the film and the character, is an enigma wrapped up in a vision that belongs to the author, both the character and the Coen brothers. The most famous directorial team made many multi layered masterpieces that defied every attempt of genre-branding, and \"Barton Fink\" is no exception, it has elements of horror, surrealism, noir, comedy and buddy-movies, but ultimately, it transcends all these categorizations.It's even stranger that the screenplay was written in three weeks after they faced a mental block while writing \"Miller's Crossing\": to me, the opposite would have seemed more plausible. But as they said: \"It's always a bunch of instinctive things that feel right, for whatever reason.\" And it's right that it feels right: generally speaking, depending on the film's genre, you either expect an emotionally, aesthetically or intellectually satisfying ending, which Fink provides none, unless you have an IQ of 200 or a doctorate in philosophy. Yet the ending is quite satisfying, because it's not about which questions are solved, but how they are asked.And this is why the most neutral (and in all humility, appropriate) genre I can use to define \"Barton Fink\" is 'character study', which doesn't make the film easier to get. Which character are we studying? Fink? His job consists on diluting himself into characters, his obsession being the common man, a leitmotiv he never ceases to evoke. He's even afraid that Hollywood would disconnect him from that sacred link. In fact, although the use of the word is incongruous, there is one \"obvious\" thing about Fink and it's his total disconnection from the concept of the 'common man', if only because he turns it into a concept.Logically, he chooses to be lodged in an unglamorous location in order to stay focused. Yet, in the Earle hotel, which seems to have only two residents, and a friendly bellhop played by Steve Buscemi, Fink is so isolated that his inspiration gets clouded by the nightmarish claustrophobia oozing from each pore of the walls. Places play a significant role in Coen's movies, but in that case, with its lousy 30's art deco, a view on 'nothing special', peeling wallpapers, buzzing mosquitoes and a pin-up picture as only decoration, Fink's room in a character in itself, reminding of the hotel in \"The Shining\" where Jack Torrance was desperately seeking inspiration.Progressively, the room becomes a microcosm compensating the blank paper's nothingness. The paper is Fink, and the room mirrors the traits of his neighbor, Charlie Meadows, an insurance salesman played by the scene-stealing John Goodman. Charlie is a sympathetic average Joe displaying a natural deference toward the intellectual figure Fink personifies. He is eager to share his personal stories but Fink is so absorbed by his own fascination that he never lets Charlie speak, which hardly surprises us: it's very revealing of intellectuals' hypocrisy to speak in the name of people but not for people, for upper classes maybe, if not their little ego.The friendship between Fink and Charlie is only a facade, the truth lies in Fink's experience with the room, and they're not the most pleasant. Even when he puts himself in Charlie's shows (literally) he's uncomfortable. Is it to highlight some negative aspects about the common man? Well, giving the hints on the rise of Anti-Semitism and Nazism and the apocalyptic climax, it's fair to assume there is some 'double-edged' sword complexity in that notion of 'common man'. The Coens distance themselves from Fink and make us wonder whether the source of his mental block is his ignorance of the truth, or his unconscious pretension to know it.That misconception is comforted by the third important character: Lipnick, Michael Lerner as the Hollywood mogul who admires Fink's intelligence before finally putting him in his playing, and admitting his contempt for that left-wing intellectual arrogance. In my review of \"Miller's Crossing\"', I was critical regarding Lerner's performance, for which he was Oscar-nominated, I retract myself, but still wonder how come neither of the two Johns (Turturro and Goodman) got a nomination. That's an enigma even more puzzling and frustrating than the mystery surrounding the box or the final scene.So, there is no personality to be taken for granted, that doesn't reveal an uglier truth underneath its pleasing nature. A revered and distinguished playwright \u00e0 la William Faulkner (John Mahoney) is a phony; his secretary (Judy Davis) is his ghost writer, which takes a darker meaning when you see the film. But each one plays his role, for the sake of entertainment \u0085 and its money-grabbing audience. So what's the role of art and ultimately cinema in all that? Is art a restricted gift that can only satisfy a privileged class or a mass-appealing medium that can therefore be used for most malevolent purposes? Fink's concluding lines, by not saying much, say everything. He doesn't quite know where he stands for either, as a victim, a fraud or an accomplice.\"Barton Fink\" won the Golden Palm, and the Award for Best Actor and Best Director at Cannes Festival, it was a critical success but not so in terms of box-office. In a way, the film proved its own point. If not autobiographical, \"Barton Fink\" is a self-referential 'character study within the character study', where the authors (the Coen brothers) question the relevance of their own work through a character who does exactly the same thing.It's an endless mirror with no beginning, and no ending, but an undeniable brilliance can be found somewhere in-between.",

It's about the creative process of writing. It shows how the mind of an artist works. In the beginning there is Barton Fink who has just finished his first play with raving reviews and now is under the pressure of following up to that. It's about the insecurities he feels as a writer. Will he write something the audience wants or what is in his heart? Is there anymore ideas left in him or was the play his only one? It feels like the ideas are right in front of him under the surface but he just can't see them. (the peeling wallpaper and Charlie as a common man who is much more than he seems to be). Bill Mayhew again is an artist who has turned into the business of writing screenplays that Hollywood wants and it has destroyed him and his inspiration (the drinking and the fact her secretary writes his stuff for him.) He might be there to show what Barton fears would happen to him or just to show the pitfall of an artist who gives up to the demands of the large audience (Hollywood executives). The turning point is when Barton must get something concrete for the meeting in the morning and calls Audrey. The scene with her in the bedroom is to show the inner struggle of him as a writer. Will he follow the path of Mayhew and give up on his ideals? Will he satisfy in writing something mediocre or will he follow his heart?The murder of Audrey is then highly symbolic. After she's dead Barton goes into the meeting and after struggling decides not to tell the executive anything because he doesn't want to follow Audrey's advice. Along with her died the option he had in his mind about writing the clich\u00e9d screenplay with action and a love story. Now the pressure of writing about what people want has gone and only through that can the real creative process start. Finally he can concentrate on writing.The fact that Charlie was the killer might be just that he was another part of Bartons mind. He was the courage Barton needed to kill Audrey and Mayhew (his inner fears) and get on with his work. I think Charlie needed to be Crazy Mundt just to show that every common man is more than he seems and there really isn't even such a thing as a common man. Everyone has an interesting story in them when you just know how to look. In fact in the beginning Charlie says many times: \"I have stories but Barton is too caught up in his inner struggles to listen (Charlie says this in the end: \"You didn't listen\").Not really sure still about the burning of the hotel and the killing of the detectives. Maybe it was all just a manifestation of all that action and bursting in Bartons mind now that he finally got the flame of inspiration.In the end his script is turned down but he knows he has given it all he had. He finally reaches the beach he's been looking at in the picture. He's found his fulfillment in making the right choice creatively. You can't write thinking about what people will want to see, you have to write about what's in your heart. That is what creating is all about. That is what gives your mind peace. So basically for me this movie is just about the \"life of the mind\" of an artist. What goes on there during the creative process. All the insecurities, pressures and pretentiousness that you must conquer to get into that place in your soul where true art comes out from. And finally there is still the fear of what the common man wants. You want to write for him but does he only want mediocre entertainment without anything deeper? Maybe the box is just to resemble how you need to shut all that out of your mind and hide it to overcome your block.Of course that ain't a perfect interpretation and there is so much more and so many different levels in this story. That is what I feel makes it such a great movie. Something you can watch multiple times and always find something new.",

            "content": "Although popular belief considers the Barton Fink, W.P. Mayhew, and Jack Lipnick characters to be roman a' clefs for Clifford Odets, William Faulkner, and Louis B. Mayer, they're actually composites.Despite the fact that the John Mahoney/Mayhew character initially recalls William Faulkner with his heavy drinking, Southern accent, and contempt for Hollywood and his own role as screenwriter, there is mention of an institutionalized wife, a clear reference to Zelda Fitzgerald, wife of another failed alcoholic sellout to Hollywood, F. Scott Fitzgerald.Many assume that the John Turturro/Fink character is based on Clifford Odets, who, after his critically-acclaimed WAITING FOR LEFTY opened on Broadway, deserted New York to work on a Hollywood wrestling movie for Wallace Beery, just as Barton Fink does. However, Turturro's hairstyle and glasses seem deliberately designed to make him look like another playwright-turned-screenwriter of the period, George S. Kaufman.While the Michael Lerner/Lipnick character (which earned the underrated veteran character actor an Oscar nomination) would seem to physically resemble MGM production head Louis B. Mayer, Wallace Beery's boss, in looks and demeanor, Lipnick's love of military uniforms and cigars would also clearly reference Fox studio chief Darryl F. Zanuck.In addition, Judy Davis's Audrey Taylor character seems based on Howard Hawks's assistant, Mehta Carpenter, another Mississippian, who worked with Faulkner on his Hawks films and engaged in a long-time affair with the novelist.Although this movie is not for everyone, it showcases the Cohen Brothers flair for conveying claustrophobic paranoia and gives a unique insight into the role of the screenwriter in 1930's Hollywood studio system.",

There's hardly any flow to the narrative. It's little more than a series of rather incongruent scenes strung together into a feature length.

It is both scathing and empathetic to the writer.  It's a story about Barton Fink, a dynamo playwright from New York who is hired to go out to Hollywood to write screenplays for Wallace Beery wrestling pictures.  This film is a masterpiece on three distinct levels:  1) It characterizes Hollywood as a self-imposed hell.  (I'm sure other comments about this movie will elaborate on that) ... 2) It is a scathing commentary on the politics and ironies of Hollywood and of producing art in general.  Nowhere is that better personified by the brilliant Michael Lerner, who just like Barton is put in a position he has no business being in.  And 3), most importantly, the core of this story is Barton himself, his pretense, his talk of \"the common man,\" his writers block.  Barton cannot write successfully about the common man because he hobnobs with artsy-folk and knows nothing about the common man, until he meets W.P. Mayhew, a miserable drunk, and \"Charlie Meadows,\" a common man.  Mayhew shows Barton that art comes from pain (even if Mayhew is the inflicter of pain), and Charlie gives Barton a chance to do some real art, by taking him out of \"the life of the mind\" and putting him in a situation where real pain takes over.This movie may seem dull or slow upon first viewing, but watch it again and you can truly see what an important film it is.",

So when such authors fail, the studios enslave them by implementing the very letter of the contracts they had signed without reading the small print. They cannot write for anyone else and then they are paired with some secretary who is going to write what the studios want under the name of the author who does not write anything at all. We cannot even call that humor. It is cynical exploitation and on the side of the Coen Brothers morbid and death carrying sarcasm. The film does not really stand a second viewing.

At the end, Fink says to the studio head that he wanted to show something beautiful and something that we can all relate to (the struggles of the mind) in his script, but the hotel scenes are neither. So as the studio head says, why would I want to watch this.I rented this movie because Blood Simple was so good. Stick with other Cohen movies if I were you.

It has a lot of reminiscences of the Fellini of the '50s, as well as Bergman (in the 70's, maybe), but yet, it keep a personal touch that makes it just what it is: a must see picture for anybody who takes seriously the author-like cinema. Turturro and Goodman performances establish them as two incredible actors, and even when both the visual (mainly) and the implicit script lines turn extremely complex by moments (it may require from some classic movies and directors knowledge in order to fully understand/appreciate some blinks, and there're a lot of them along the film), it's a truly experience to watch this movie, if you don't care about some intellectual work (a lot of metaphores, symbolisms and relations between such different concepts as literature and philosophy are used permanently on the film).

Barton Fink might be their strangest, most ambiguous movie, but at the same time, it's, for the most part, very simple. The plot is simple, and the characters are scarce, with only two leads (John Turturro and John Goodman) and a few back-up actors. The camera work is amazing, and this is one of the greatest looking pictures. The Coen brothers always make great looking movies, but this is one of, if not the best looking of their films. There really isn't much bad to say.The year is 1941. Barton Fink (John Turturro) is a meek and mild mannered play write hired to write a film about wrestling by one of the big studios. To write the script he goes to stay at a hotel in Hollywood, with a salesman next door neighbor, Carl (John Goodman). Barton cannot think of anything to write, and even the wacky antics of Carl can't pop any ideas into his head. Secrets are revealed, a murder occurs, and totally effective craziness ensues.The end of this movie will either have viewers scratching their head with anger and confusion, or trying to figure out what's going on. Either way, viewers will be scratching their head, and either way, you have to judge what has just happened. I personally, found this to be a perplexing, but perfectly fitting ending. It was great in it's strangeness, and strange in that it was so great, yet the question still remains, \"What?\".Everything about this film was top notch. The acting was great, with Turturro and Goodman playing off each other very well. The movie moved at a slow pace, but it was never boring. Something interesting was always happening, or even if not, I was constantly watching, waiting for what might be around the bend. The cinematography is perfect. Who knew an ugly old hotel could look like this. All the angles and the slow pan shots were so well thought out. The only thing I could see people not enjoying is the pacing, and the ending, and I found both to be excellent additions to an already great movie.Such a bizarre twist has never been so satisfying, and this movie leaves you completely satisfied, but thinking days later, \"What can I make of this?\".My rating: **** out of ****. 110 mins.

Maybe they roared with laughter in the theaters.This film appears to be about a writer's descent into a delusional world of his own making. After some success in New York, always supposed to mean that he was indeed a real success, he signs up as a screen writer, which always means that he has sold out his genuine New York success for false fame and dirty money in California, writing for the rubes that populate the rest of the country outside the bastions of culture on the Hudson, which is not a proposition that impresses people who have lived in Missouri and Illinois.So this sell out great writer is driven mad by the flippant stupidity of the Hollywood moguls and he ends up on a beach with a girl in a calendar picture. Along the way his sensitive soul is crushed by a drunken southern writer of great fame, an insurance salesman who is really a Nazi axe murderer, a group of Jew hating cops, who are probably part of his delusion, and a pack of harried middle management types, the sort that harass and harry us all.There is an unopened package that, we assume, contains the head of a victim of the axe and shotgun murderer,, but which is never opened. I believe that is what passes for symbolism in this picture.The film is lovely to see, and it isn't really awful, it's just boring and pompous with a parade of clich\u00e9s, the fat salesman, the fat executive, the drunken southerner, and so on, passing in review before the unresponsive Barton Fink who has no clear reaction to any of them. Perhaps he is just not up to the pace what is happening, a feeling most of us know, but most of us also don't find it worth watching.I find most of the characters in this film simply embarrassing.. I kept having the feeling that I shouldn't be watching them make asses of themselves. It's like watching your sister fight with her husband when you can see perfectly well where and how the misunderstanding started but you can't do anything but sit by and watch them blow up. It isn't that it isn't of some instructive merit, it's just that it is impolite to be watching and wishing that they would just stop it and get on with life.The best thing about this dog of a Hollywood excuse for an insightful drama is that I'll never have to watch it again.",

The story is quite enigmatic in many ways but it does make some clear points. One of them is about how difficult it is to make an artistic statement within the big money world of commercial cinema. Another is about the pretensions of the artist himself. In this case the central character Barton Fink is a very self-obsessed man who thinks he is 'making a difference' in service of the 'common man'; whereas in reality, he doesn't pay any attention to what the one ordinary working man he meets has to say. Fink thinks he speaks for the masses but really he seems to only speak for himself.Barton Fink is a film about Hollywood and the movies. The mechanisms of the studio system are invoked quite effectively through certain well-drawn characters such as the overbearing studio head at the top, the edgy producer who works under him and at a level further down a writer who has been driven to alcoholism. This clear chain of command shows how the power and influence really works. Fink himself only truly understands this by the end of the film; he realises that the reality of the movies is in entertaining the masses, not creating high-brow drama.The performances are of an exceptionally high standard. These are very well-drawn characters indeed. John Turturro, Michael Lerner, Judy Davis and John Goodman are the ones who drive the film. But there is also very able support by the likes of Steve Buscemi, Tony Shaloub, John Mahoney and Richard Portnow. What makes the film especially interesting is that it isn't a straight drama. It's very stylised and in fact ends up somewhat surreal. The Hotel Earle (hell?) is as much a character itself. It's weird d\u00e9cor and absence of all but two guests makes it a little disconcerting. The production design here is great. Fink's room is memorably dingy with wallpaper that continually peels and a mysterious picture of a girl on a beach. The hotel almost feels like a strange dream-world, a place where nothing really is as it seems. In actual fact by the end of the movie that turns out to be true in some alarming ways.

I'm no stranger to symbolic and surreal movies (Eraserhead is one of my very favorites), but this is something (like Barton himself in the film) that bears no substance and is purely superficial. What makes it so much worse, and most ironic, is that the movie attempts to disprove that in its message but ultimately ends up being just as much a part of it (if not moreso due to its aforementioned intention and execution).It's not surprising given its reputation among so-called \"\"\"cinephiles\"\"\" but it's all the more frustrating because I fell for it. I admit, I was thoroughly engrossed by the film, largely due to its beautiful set design and unconventional narrative structure. Not to mention, it has some good bits of black humor as well, but beyond that there's nothing there. And in the end, it left me feeling dumb for having played along.",

            "content": "There are so many ways in which you can draw comparisons between 'Barton Fink' and other films made by the Coen Brothers: the male protagonist, Barton Fink, is very similar to other, almost tragic heroes, portrayed in their films.  I would draw a comparison from their latest film, 'The Man Who Wasn't There', where Ed Crane is simply looking for something more, yet it all falls down on him.  Yet, with Barton Fink, he doesn't go looking for something more, it finds him, and then falls down on him.  Fink's almost Catch 22-like situation, where everyone in Hollywood is insane apart from him, from Steve Buscemi's subtlely mad bellboy, Chet, to Michael Lerner's loud-mouthed, fickle studio executive.One of the Coen's main talents is to distort the audience's perceptions of situations.  Barton Fink walking down a burning hallway slowly, carrying a box and a typewriter, seem strangely comic.  The same applies to John Goodman's Charlie Meadows, who despite having just murdered all of Barton Fink's family, still manages to come off as almost a lovable character.Along with the rich characters, this is also a satire of the movie industry. Jack Lipnick's lack of respect for Barton Fink's wrestling movie, which Fink sees as his finest work to date, is dismissed angrily due to the protagonist being more than just a one dimensional wrestler character.  You can't help but get the feeling that the Coen Brothers are having a dig at demons from their Hollywood past.As with most other Coen movies, this is very slow moving.  It's deliberate and an obvious criticism, but I found it frustrating in this movie, and in some points there just isn't enough to keep the audience interested.  It seems as if the main part of the plot is about to start about 75 minutes into the film with the murder of Audrey Taylor, only to be seemingly deceived. But you know that Joel and Ethan are sitting at home, laughing at that criticism, after all, it's all a bit of a private joke.7/10",

However, his agent convinces him to go to Hollywood as a contract writer for Capitol Pictures to earn a lot of money fast, which would enable him to write the great stuff later.Fink goes to L. A. and moves into a seedy hotel filled with bizarre staff. The first night he calls to the front desk to complain about the noise his next-door neighbor is creating. Thus he meets Charlie/Karl (John Goodman) who portrays himself as an uneducated insurance salesman who sells peace/piece of mind. Fink goes on about his own desire to tell the story of the \"common man\" but talks very condescendingly to Charlie.Fink also deals with the studio head, Jack Lipnick (Michael Lerner), meets a famous Southern writer, W. P. Mayhew (John Mahoney), and Mayhew's \"secretary,\" Audrey Taylor (Judy Davis). The studio wants Fink to write a movie about wrestling, \"men in tights\", but not something too thoughtful or \"fruity\". Fink immediately has severe writer's block and can come up with nothing.In desperation the night before he is to give a story outline to Jack Lipnick, he calls Audrey for help. She comes to his hotel and is very reassuring, telling him he just needs some \"understanding.\" When Fink wakes in the morning he discovers Audrey in bed with him, murdered (think of the horse's head scene in \"The Godfather\"). He asks Charlie for help, and Charlie takes charge and disposes of the body and tells Fink not to worry, it's all taken care of.Soon Charlie has to leave for a few days and leaves Fink with a box that holds his most precious possessions. Fink soon learns from two stereotyped 1940s detectives that Charlie is actually Karl Mundt, a serial killer who decapitates his victims. Fink looks at the box Charlie left with suspicion, but never opens it. He is hit with writing mania however and writes what he thinks is a masterpiece about the inner turmoil of a wrestler.He celebrates completing the manuscript at a dance, but when he returns he finds the detectives in his room reading his script. They now accuse Fink of collaborating with Mundt in the death of Audrey, and her boss, W. P. Mayhew. They handcuff him to the bed. Suddenly the hotel is on fire, Charlie/Karl returns and kills the detectives and releases Fink. Charlie/Karl tells Fink the box is not really his. He also verbally blasts Fink for not really listening to him. Fink escapes with his manuscript and the box.By the end, the studio hates Fink's script, but will not release him from the contract. He wanders on the beach, meets a woman who resembles a woman in a picture in his former hotel room. He has not been able to contact his parents or uncle in New York; Charlie/Karl mentions having visited them. The movie ends.There is much speculation by critics on the deeper meanings of the film, and who some of the characters represent. That may all be true, but I think it is best enjoyed as a quirky Coen Brothers movie.",

And he is really pissy somehow.While he is trying to create something the couple near his room have sex every time he tries to work. This displays six sexual repression and his isolation from the man who doesn't produce.While trying to create something it's pretty clear for the common man.. that he has not a total connection with the common man.

Every single one of their films is so dramatically different from the last that you never know what to expect going in. That was how I felt when I saw Barton Fink for the first time. Out of their entire filmography I had only seen The Big Lebowski, and I thought it was a good, but not great. The story didn't go anywhere and a lot of the plots that the movie sets up never really finish, but I think that was what they were trying to go for. With Barton Fink, I can't think of a single problem with it. Everything is great, the direction, the writing, especially the acting, with John Goodman once again being the highlight. Another great thing about the film is its cinematography from Roger Deakins, who worked on most of the Coen Bros movies. The story is as follows: Barton Fink (played brilliantly by John Tuturro) is a playwright who is offered a chance to write a film for Capital Pictures. Once he gets there, he suffers from Writer's Block and seeks help from his friend, Charlie, among others. That's all I'm going to say about the plot, because I don't want to ruin it for you. The film has an almost dream-like setting, and a lot of the visuals are fascinatingly strange and intriguing. Barton Fink is one of the greatest movies about movie-making I've ever seen (topped only by Ed Wood) and I strongly recommend you watch it, especially if you're a film student.",

The resulting picture is a bewildering, enigmatic, entertaining and frightening reflection on all the things that don't work in Hollywood, viewed through the eyes of a dissatisfied writer (the most obvious parallel with Billy Wilder's noir masterpiece).The writer in question is Barton Fink (John Turturro, in his best role ever), a successful Broadway author who gets enlisted by studio head Jack Lipnick (the Oscar-nominated Michael Lerner) to write a wrestling picture which would serve as a vehicle for the big star Wallace Beery. During his stay in Los Angeles, Barton resides at Hotel Earle, where he befriends the outgoing and very mysterious Charlie Meadows (John Goodman), whose presence serves as the clearest indication that the disillusioned protagonist might actually be in Hell.Hollywood as Hell: not exactly a new concept, yet the Coens manage to make it fresh and engaging, giving life to the idea's most literal meaning. There is very little doubt that Hotel Earle is in fact the Devil's domain, or that Lipnick and his associates (Jon Polito and Tony Shalhoub) are almost demonic in their attitudes. Crucially, Fink is no Dante either, his role being that of the ultimate incarnation of Hollywood's hypocrisy: Barton may claim to want to tell the stories of ordinary people, but whenever someone tries to tell him such a story he doesn't pay attention, just like his bosses ignore his attempts to make the movie he is working on more \"artistic\". In the film's most ironic twist of perspective, perhaps the psychotic Meadows is the sanest person in the story.The film won an unprecedented three awards at Cannes: the Palme d'Or, Best Director and Best Actor. The rules have changed since (no picture can receive more than one award, with rare exceptions), but the Coens and Turturro deserved every bit of praise they received. The latter is flawless and cunningly supported by usual suspects Goodman and Steve Buscemi and newcomers like Lerner and Shalhoub (plus a splendid cameo by a pre-Frasier John Mahoney), each one of them adding new layers of meaning or mystery, depending on the point of view, to this creepy comedy about the movie industry gone bad.Like most films by the Coen brothers, Barton Fink is an enriching and singular experience. Worth checking out along with the other weird account of a writer's struggles released in 1991, David Cronenberg's Naked Lunch.",

This is one of those movies that baffles you at about halfway thru. It appears to be about a highly-touted playwright, played by John Turturro, being called to Hollywood in the early 40's to write screenplays as a contract writer of a major motion picture company. He is put in an empty hotel room to accomplish this task and he doesn't get much help other than his first task is a wrestling picture with Wallace Beery. He befriends his neighbor, played by John Goodman, in hopes of capturing more of the common-man's point of view. Suddenly, strange things start to happen after a beloved writer's secretary(aka. lover) responds to his plea for help on writing the picture. At this point the movie seems to turn inwardly and becomes something in the writer's imagination. You can't tell this write away, but while writing this review it was revealed to me that this is what was happening. Turmoil starts coming into his life(which is what he says is needed for a writer to really overcome a writer's block) and he just happens to be facing a deadline for a treatment to the producer.

I think to throw it around to a few films that come out each year takes a lot away from it's meaning, and at this point there are less than fifty I've ever seen that I would title as such. So it should say something that of those less than fifty, the brothers Coen have been at the helm of three of them. It should say even more that of those three, Barton Fink stands at the top. Films that are open to interpretation leave, naturally, a lot to ponder on once the viewing is over. Anything that resides itself in symbolism and themes generally can't be properly appreciated on one viewing, maybe not even two or three. I know there are some films of the realm, like Robert Altman's 3 Women, that just left me puzzled after my first viewing and even though I knew there was something to admire I wasn't quite sure what it was until subsequent journeys into it.Barton Fink is one of those films that is very open for the viewer to make up their mind on what it all means, but the beauty of it is that even on your first stab it is wildly impressive. After a night of internal discussion, I myself have come to my conclusion of what I think it all means, but anyone else could have their own interpretation and be just as right. That's the best part of what Fink manages to establish that a lot of films in this vein don't; it's not so broad and interpretative that you are completely lost after one viewing, but it's also not so simple that there is just one explanation. The Coen brothers walk a tight wire at the top of this journey into the mind of one writer (or the mind of every writer) and they make it all the way across without losing their footing for a moment.They are also to able to make it an exciting journey even for those who don't feel like spending the time trying to dissect a film. Just on the surface it's an extremely entertaining piece of mystery, thrills, romance and Coen comedy with great performances and terrific wordplay. The ending will leave anyone thinking, but for the majority of the film if you don't feel like putting in hours of work into your opinion on it, you don't have to and you can still find a lot to enjoy. For me though, it required a lot of exploration into the symbolism and general antics displayed on screen. Barton Fink can represent a lot of things for a lot of different people; the hotel could be hell and Charlie Meadows (played to perfection by John Goodman) represents Satan, it could all be a metaphor for Nazis and the Holocaust, it could boil down to the greatest movie about writer's block, Charlie could be the polar opposite of the devil and instead be Barton's guardian angel or it could be a condemnation of Hollywood and the way the industry works. Hell, maybe it's all a dream. It could be a thousand things if you take the time to study it and interpret it the way that you so desire.",

He holes up in a decrepit hotel, where he comes down with a massive case of writer's block. The Coen Brothers use this story to explore the creative process, selling out, and probably a lot more besides--though, due to their fondness for symbol and metaphor, these other topics are buried a little deeper.When I was halfway through the movie I felt like it was getting predictable. The notion of an idealistic, blocked writer struggling to survive in commercial Hollywood is nothing new. Nor is putting him in a love triangle, when he becomes attracted to the lover (Judy Davis) of the alcoholic writer W.P. Mayhew (John Mahoney, parodying William Faulkner). And every night, Barton chats with Charlie Meadows (John Goodman), the self-described \"big lug\" in the room next door to him. This friendly neighbor who keeps dropping in seems like something out of a sitcom. Still, the movie is never less than entertaining, because of its distinctive Coen Brothers style. The dialogue delights in old American slang and speech patterns, the actors play their oddball roles with humor, and the visuals/cinematography are interesting.And, just when I thought I could see how the movie was going, the plot takes a massive turn. The Coens return to one of their favorite motifs, an almost apocalyptic sense of violence, and Barton's life in Hollywood becomes increasingly surreal. This twist, however, has been carefully set up: just look at the eerie atmosphere of Barton's hotel, or the number of times the dialogue has used the words \"head\" or \"mind.\"\"Barton Fink\" obviously functions on several levels, and one that I find most rewarding is the exploration of Barton's character (played by Turturro with many hilarious facial expressions). He has high ideals and one successful play, but he is also strangely disconnected from the world. He prefers analyzing his own writing process to actually writing, and he shies away from interacting with other people--which is the kiss of death for a playwright.In one scene, Barton denounces playwrights who \"insulate themselves from the common man, so naturally their work regresses into empty formalism.\" He lacks the self-awareness to realize that he's doing the same thing; yet this also seems like a self-aware joke on the part of the Coen Brothers, whose work has also been accused of \"empty formalism.\" The second half of \"Barton Fink\" is indeed strange and stylized, and maybe it wouldn't appeal to \"the common man\"--but there's depth there; it's far from empty.",

Barton Fink is definitely different and I think that this is its strength. The setting is very surreal and I found the hotel corridor set to be very striking which is important as it is seen quite often. I am a person who appreciates a good set design such as the ship in Event Horizon and find that the appealing simplicity of sets such as the hotel whose only member of staff seems to be the ubiquitous Chet played by Steve Buscemi works really well.The 1930's Hollywood scene is really enjoyable and I think Michael Lerner and Tony Shalhoub's performances are brilliantly hilarious. John Turturro also gives a good performance and I particularly like the penultimate scene in which John Goodman's Charlie lets him know that he doesn't listen.I won't pretend that I understood the whole concept of this film but I did find it compelling and would probably watch it again.",

Fink soon realises the implications of being under contract within the Studio system, suffering severe writer's block as he tries to complete his first project - a Wallace Beery wrestling picture.With the emphasis on the script and dialogue, 'Barton Fink' presents an increasingly bizarre narrative and a central character who spirals down into paranoia and madness. Fink suffocates in his seedy hotel room, increasingly irritated by the unwanted attentions of his travelling salesman neighbour, played by John Goodman. The living nightmare of his situation mixing fantasy and reality before literally becoming Hell on Earth.The Palme D'Or winner at Cannes in 1991, 'Barton Fink' is a superb piece of cinema. Heralded on release, opinion has since cooled, the film charged with being pretentious for its own sake. Time will show the critics were right first time round - an outstanding film from the Coen brothers who have proved themselves truly great American film-makers.BEST SCENE - Fink's introduction to studio boss Jack Lipnick played with sinister zeal by Michael Lerner.",

Mayhew might be symbolic of Virgil, but he is only a partial guide to Barton Fink's Dante... The most puzzling addition is Goodman's Charlie - the largest character both physically and metaphorically. He towers over the film - half Satan, half redeemer. His throwaway line near the end - Heil Hitler - is perhaps a link to the looming Second World War which shadows the film. This imagery-rich movie is a far cry from the Coen's usual (excellent) fare. It is rarely funny, often deeply disturbing, always riveting. I can't believe all the reviewers who were bored by it - I was enthralled! A superb, affecting, well written film. Highly recommended.",

There can be many interpretations of a dialog, a scene, a character and his actions. Barton Fink is a writer who abhors the Hollywood System and wants to create space in theater for common man. When such a guy asks a girl \"Are you into movies?\" She replies \"Are you silly?\". Just for this dialog I can derive many interpretations. Are movies Silly? Is it foolish of him to be thinking of movies? And likewise many more.So a film, that's highly symbolic would be an understatement to this, there should be a better statement. Coz, this has a great treatment and wonderful acting in a story that's minimal in content and yet humongous in exploring the little content in the story.John Turturro is a revelation in this film and John Goodman shows why is so good at. These are two underrated actors I believe in the last 20 years. John Goodman was superb in a few films, though he did actually act in very few than his contemporaries, his choice was good in terms of script. John Turturro is a terrific actor whose potential was unleashed in very few films, mostly by Coen Brothers though.From the poster of this film, till the last scene, there is an intrigue that's typical only to a Coen Brothers film. if anyone is thinking, what is a mosquito doing in the poster? I recommend them to see this film to know it for yourself. I am happy to have seen this now fully in one ago, though earlier I tried to see it in parts, but could not finish. Indeed, it was a rewarding experience that threw many challenges in terms of narrative and treatment.I love this film and will watch it again soon. A 4/5 for this film.

It is a fine period piece movie, a little slow in spots, but original and ultimately engaging.Barton Fink, played with fidelity and deep concentration by John Turturro, is an idealistic New York playwright experiencing his first success. He is called to Hollywood to write screenplays under the old studio system. Lerner, in a burlesque performance that is strikingly and hilariously over the top (you've got to love the shot of him in open robe and bathing trunks by the pool, his ample, hairy belly vividly displayed, perhaps as a symbol of a devouring cauldron), plays the movie mogul who instructs Fink to write the script for a \"B\" wrestling picture starring Wallace Beery. This is a kind of Coen and Coen joke, part of the satirical intent of the movie since what Wallace Beery did star in were boxing pictures. Same difference, one might say. (Actually, Beery did star in at least one wrestling movie, Flesh (1932), I discovered by checking at IMDb.)Anyway, Fink of course knows nothing about wrestling, and finding himself in an old Los Angeles hotel (where one may stay a day, or ominously, a lifetime), begins to unravel since he can't get beyond the first couple of lines of the screenplay. We are treated to closeups of all that white space on the paper as it sits rolled up in the old manual typewriter. The satirical idea here is to measure the great gulf between literary art and writing film scripts for a mass audience, an audience further dumbed down by the expectations of studio execs.Next door to Fink is Charlie Meadows (John Goodman) ostensibly a life insurance salesman. Goodman works hard to portray a monstrous (in more ways than one) sort of guy. He huffs and puffs his way into friendship with Fink, showing him a wrestling move or two. At this point it is impossible to tell where the movie is headed. Are they going to become more than friends? Enter Judy Davis as Audrey Taylor the \"secretary\" of an alcoholic novelist working in the \"Writer's Building\" at the studio (reminding me of a similar set from Billy Wilder's Sunset Boulevard). Fink gets an undisguised yen for her and manages to get her to help him with his script. And then comes a characteristic Coen and Coen twist, and all heck breaks loose.Memorable in a small role as the desk clerk and bellhop is Steve Buscemi who is first revealed to us coming enigmatically out of the hotel's cellar where God only knows what he was doing.They loved this at Cannes because just about every aspect of the Hollywood industry is made fun of, except the actors, who interestingly enough, make nary an appearance. Clever those Coen brothers.This is a dark, nasty but somewhat redemptive writer's movie, an art film about Hollywood that afficionados will not want to miss.",

His first assignment is to write a wrestling script, something uninspiring to Fink, and he develops a bad case of writer's block. That's the obvious story here. There are many non-obvious stories, and I'm sure they had very specific meanings to the Coen brothers when making this film, but the result is too muddled to be considered a good. I give it a less-than-satisfactory rating.\nI enjoy several of their movies very much -- O Brother, Fargo, Hudsucker Proxy, Man Who Wasn't There -- but certainly am not a Coen fan who praises everything they make. I like that they experiment a lot, with liberal whimsy in their films. The problem I have with BARTON FINK is this -- no matter how well-intended or how meaningful a story is, if the normal attentive film-goer has to re-watch and re-analyze a movie, then read other reveiwers' comments to make sense of it, then the movie is not totally successful. Turturro is great in his role, as are John Goodman and the others. The mood and images are intriguing. I enjoyed watching the film.

Filled with great direction,amazing cast,a wonderful script,a fantastic score and great cinematography, Barton Fink is The Coen Brothers at their best.Set in 1941,Barton Fink tells the story of New York Playwright Barton Fink(John Turturro)who after a critically successful play is asked to come to Los Angeles to write a Wrestling picture for a big Hollywood studio. When Barton starts to write the story he starts suffering from writer's block and can't continue writing. But unfortunately for Barton writing is the least of his problems as Barton has to go through a bizarre and weird journey in Hollywood.Barton Fink is an absolutely brilliant underrated and overlooked classic from The Coen Brothers and is a film that funny,stylish and very weird and surreal and is a film experience that you will never forget after you watch it. The idea came from The Coen Brothers who while writing they're equally Underrated Gangster Masterpiece Miller's Crossing suffered from writer's block and decided to write Barton Fink and what a great idea it was to write this overlooked gem. One of the great things about watching and looking at Barton Fink is that the film while funny and dramatic doesn't fit in any genre category. Is it a Comedy? A Drama? Satire? Mystery? Horror film? A Surrealistic film? You can say that Barton Fink is all these things and more because right from the start of the film you are pulled into a journey that is darkly funny and unique in a way that only The Coen Brothers know how. Barton Fink is a surreal film because a lot of the things and characters in the film are exaggerated beyond belief and you feel like any thing that can happen will happen and nothing is true to reality and all of the things and events that happen in the film are from Fink's point of view so as a viewer you are wondering is all of the events really happening or is all a dream in Barton's head and that is one of the great things about Barton Fink is that The Coen Brothers and the film makes you as a viewer of the film draw up your own conclusion and allows you to fill in the blanks because Barton Fink is like a puzzle and you have to put the pieces together while watching the movie. I love the Dark Comedy and Satire in the film and the way BF makes fun of Hollywood showing Hollywood executives in the 1940s as fast talking big wigs who hire screenwriters to write motion pictures during that time period. The dark Comedy is also works in the way the main characters and situations are so weird,wild and over the top that you never know where the film or the characters are going to go and it seems like every one of the insane situations gets crazier and crazier as the film goes along. The cinematography by Roger Deakens is amazing and visual stunning with Deakins using colors dark and light colors to great effect and giving the film a realism to it. Barton Fink is another classic character from The Coen Brothers because Barton truly believes in what he is doing as a writer and playwright in writing for the working stiff and the common man man and it works in New York but when Barton comes to Hollywood it doesn't work and Barton becomes isolated and really doesn't know or understand the Hollywood system or the people around him. Barton in some ways speaks for and represents The Coen Brothers and the movie audience and we are going through what he's going through. A great character in a great film. The Screenplay by Joel and Ethan Coen is great and absolutely brilliant and well-written with great dialog that is odd,weird memorable,stylish and funny. The amazing dialog just comes off the movie screen. The ending of the film is just amazing and is truly matches the dream like feel of the movie. Barton Fink's ending is a great cap off that is ambiguous and one of the reasons Barton Fink is a classic.The whole cast is excellent. John Turturro is brilliant as Barton Fink,with Turturro bring intensity,depth and electricity the role. Turturro's greatest performance. John Goodman is fantastic and funny as Charlie Meadows,Barton's Hotel neighbor,with Goodman having great scenes and chemistry with Turturro. Judy Davis is wonderful as Audrey,W.P Mayhew's assistant and lover who becomes Barton's friend. Micheal Lerner is amazing as Jack Lipnic,a studio executive. John Mahoney is delightful as W.P Mayhew,a drunken novelist Barton loves. Tony Shalhoub is hilarious as Ben Geiser,a studio man. Coen Brothers Jon Polito(Lou Breeze)and Steve Buscemi(Chet)are great in their small roles. Richard Portnow(Detective Mastrionotti)and Christopher Murney(Detective Deutch)are a great laugh riot as police detectives investigating Barton.The direction by The Coen Brothers is brilliant,with The Coens always moving the camera using close-ups,low and high angles and slow camera movements giving the film a dream-like visual style. Great direction by The Coens.The score by Carter Burwell is masterful,haunting and beautiful and adds to the dark and nightmarish tone of the film. Wonderful and powerful score,Burwell.In final word,if you love The Coen Brothers films,films about Hollywood,Surrealistic films or films in general I highly suggest you see Barton Fink,an underrated and unforgettable classic that will stay with you after you watch it. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",

But often their films has these three elements.Barton Fink has these three aspects in a very balanced and abundant way: It has a lot of drama and dark comedy, and a lot of thriller as well. And it is exactly what makes it so special. It's probably the film which you really do need to see in the Coen's filmography. And the allegorical aspects in this film are by far heavier than in their other works as well. Barton relationship with Charlie can be seen as the relationship of the man, always arrogant and helpless in his condition, with the devil. It's fantastic. The acting by John Turturro is once again top notch. His interpretation of a nervous awkward writer is priceless. His variation of temperament, coming from sad to a 'comic' personality(and vice-versa) is so carefully done that we almost don't have the impression that he is acting at all. John Goodman did as well a very good job; his most impressive work to date.Being said, Barton Fink is a very good film which deserves a watch. 9.0/10",

He claims to be writing for the common people, but he doesn't even socially interact with other people - he admits that at the end of the film when he cries in despair over his loneliness.\nBasically, Barton Fink is a highly overrated writer, who tells us cliched stories about writers' suffering, and how misery is the only \"true inspiration\" that writers have. What is his misery? That he's stuck in a hotel? That seems to be the reasoning behind John Goodman's climactic final appearance - he is really just laughing at Fink and looking down at him. Fink doesn't know real suffering, he's really just full of sh*t. Fink's arogance is fueled by the Hollywood producers, in an obvious exeggarated parody of The Writer as The Ultimate Creator. In fact, Fink plays along with this idea. This is illustrated in several scenes. In one of them he sees his own lousy script appear in the Bible instead of the Genesis (the most important part of the Bible, obviously). In the dancing scene, he gets into a fight with a bunch of guys and then shouts out how he's misunderstood and mistreated although he is better than everyone else because he is The Creator! \"I create! Can't you understand?\"I can understand the theories about Barton Fink as a modern version of Dante's Inferno, but taking into consideration that this script was written *while* the Coens were experiencing writer's block on another script (\"Miller's Crossing\"), I think the idea about Fink being a self-parody of The Writer makes even more sense.",

            "review_title": "A Nutshell Reiview: (DVD) Barton Fink (1991)",
            "content": "This is my first time viewing a Coen Brothers movie, so why not start with one which had won them the 1991 Cannes Film Festival Palme d'Or award for Best Direction, and a movie which had also garnered an award for Best Actor in that same festival year for lead John Turturro as the titular character.Barton Fink is a successful playwright, the talk of NY City after the staging of a highly successful play to the delight of critics. His ability and dream of writing for the theatre about the common man, for the common man, strikes box office gold, and while his intentions are noble, let's face it, a man's still gotta pay his bills. An opportunity arose with an offering from Hollywood in getting him to write a studio's wrestling picture. So off he goes to the West Coast, but all he could muster was one line, before being struck by writer's block.His prima dona demeanour and intentions somehow strike a chord in me, in that there are folks out there who have a distain for the rather formulaic Hollywood movies that get churned year after year. There's little creativity that goes around to come up with something different, and plenty of rehashing the same old tried and tested material to pull wool over audiences. With Barton's passionate speeches about his noble ideas, you can't help but to agree with the imperfection of the system.And there are plenty of wry humour in the movie, most of which slyly prods the Hollywood studio system of yesteryear. You can't help but laugh at the veiled references, especially that of having a clueless head honcho who's in the film business not for the love of films, but in it for the profits (hey, it's a business after all). But it's not always about the movie business, as a good part of the movie also focused on Fink's friendship and camaraderie with his hotel neighbour, a certain insurance salesman called Charlie Meadows. an affable man who's more than meets the eye. I'm quite certain that Barton Fink has more subtexts and harbours a lot more depth that I would have gleaned from superficially from the first viewing, and certainly, this movie deserves at least a second viewing or more. With plenty of interesting dialogue laced with quick, dark wit, and interesting incidents encountered by Barton Fink, this movie is beautifully shot, especially the finale containing an pseudo action sequence.",

Instead, I felt as if I was watching yet another campy independent film where some young film student was aching to be seen as incredibly artsy. The dialogue was dry, and the many attempts to be surreal, and somewhat metaphysical were bleak. Throughout this desolate atmosphere of utter decay and self loathing, I came to find myself liking the only person I could relate to. That being John Goodman, despite his role as a madman serial killer. The ending leaves a viewer feeling as if despite sudden inspiration, Barton Fink will never be a screen writer, and is to be doomed as yet another faceless nobody in a world portrayed as a wasteland.

            "content": "This was released at the peak of the Coen Brothers creativity and followed their almost endless string of classics with Blood Simple, Raising Arizona and Miller's Crossing, before culminating with the sublime genius of the Hudscucker Proxy and the later, Big Lebowski. Unlike the films that came before, with perhaps the exception of their debut work, Blood Simple, Barton Fink uses elements of comedy not as an integral factor within the story, but instead, as a subversive device in order to create a piece of work that is darker and more grotesque than anything they would ever attempt again. As far as I'm concerned, it's the greatest horror film of the 90's hands down; drawing on notions of mental-anguish, loneliness, isolation, paranoia, defeat and despair, though layering these themes in tandem with the usual Coen idiosyncrasies, which creates a film that is, as a result, even more disturbing.This film sees the Coen brothers plunging headfirst into the kind of territory made-famous by films such as Repulsion, Rosemary's Baby and Eraserhead... don't believe me; take a look at the use of sub-text. The use of the Holocaust as a recurring visual motif, or the Nazi ideology at play within the later parts of the film are straight out of Polanski's psycho-sexual thrillers of the 1960's (of which his later film the Tennant could also be listed), whilst the walls that excrete a seed-like puss, coupled with the orgasmic moans from the other rooms (not to mention John Turturro's Jack Nance hair-do) are all ripped from the films of David Lynch. This creates a brooding and foreboding atmosphere that few films can equate, with the Coen's continually leading us down a maze of dark alleyways and throwing us narrative curve balls at will; so, just when we think we've got the whole thing worked out, it shifts, and we, much like the eponymous hero, are left bemused and utterly bewildered.The performances from all involved, particularly Turturro as Fink and John Goodman as the seemingly amiable Charlie Meadows are spot on, even finding a degree of pathos in the Coen's deceptive dialog, whilst the supporting players, Judy Davis, John Mahoney, Jon Polito, Michael Learner, Tony Shalhoub and Steve Buscemi, though essentially archetypes, are all on fine form. Meanwhile, the whole look of the film, from the seedy design of the Hotel Earl with it's endless corridor, smoky foyer, hundreds of rooms (though we never see a guest) and billowing fires that rip through the building as if it were the bowels of hell, create a nice contrast to the plush, white art-deco of the Hollywood exec offices, the writer's bungalow or the opulence of the mogul's mansion. The photography too, from soon to become long-time Coen collaborator Roger Deakins, brings out the whites and blacks, with only musty browns, deep reds and shimmering gold allowed to breach the carefully constructed pallet of the film, all coming-together to create possibly the most beautiful American film of the last decade (alongside Soderbergh's King of the Hill, that is).Barton Fink is one of the all-time great Coen Brother's mater-works and an easy contender for that 'Greatest Film Ever Made' tag... It's one of those rare works of contemporary cinema that is ably to be both funny and frightening, surreal yet believable, approachable though fiercely intelligent, whilst also acting as a strong reminder of what American Independent cinema used to be. It's the kind of film in which you'd find screaming fat men showing us the life of the mind, corpses in bed, laconic, foul-mouthed policemen, drunken-writers, big-men in tights, and, one of the greatest 'what's in the box' enigma's this side of Seven and Pulp Fiction. Added to that, we also have that gorgeous ending with Barton wandering the beach in the hot Californian sun... the mysterious box... the bathing beauty... that final kiss-off and, of course... that seagull plunging lifelessly into the water as the credits begin to roll. This is, quite simply, cinema at it's finest.",

The latter, of course, sees Charlton Heston collapsed on the beach as the whole premise of the film is revealed to the audience in a memorable denouement. And likewise with Barton Fink, which also sees the main character sitting on the beach as the whole premise of the film is revealed in another memorable, but deeply metaphorical, ending.The film is good, very good, but also hard work. You have to concentrate. Its full of symbolism and metaphor, mainly about writing and film. But the main metaphor of the film is the painting on the wall of Barton Fink's hotel room. A beautiful woman, with her back to the viewer, sits on a beach and looks out to sea. Fink stares at it constantly as he tries to write a film about the \"common man\".But Barton Fink cannot write about the common man, even though its exemplar lives in the very next hotel room (and many of the reviews here explore this).So, cut to the ending. A truly amazing ending which is so abrupt, so puzzling, that you cannot help think about it long after the credits have rolled. Barton Fink is on the beach carrying what could be a real, decapitated head in a box; a box he has not had the wit to open. He sits down, the box by his side. In front of him is the beautiful woman, striking the exact same pose as in the painting. He gapes at the art, the idealistic expression of his mind, and not reality and its gritty truth, even when it is right there and presented to him.For Fink, art is reality.Even though this film has many metaphors working on many levels, I suggest this is the key to understanding the whole masterpiece.",

            "content": "Barton Fink thrusts us into the world, indeed limelight, of performance in the very opening scene when a production of a play is playing out to a packed audience. We begin backstage with stage hands looking down at what's unfolding, looking less than impresses it might be said. A track of a few seconds later, and the worried; angst-ridden face of the titular character played by John Turturro fills the screen, his expression making more of an impact on us due to the previous characters' reaction to such goings-on. We may very well hear the play but we observe what's going on behind the play. Very quickly, the directors of the piece, Ethan and Joel Coen, have got across the sense that this will be a tale of those that work on said productions more than it will be a film about the said productions, or at least those that perform in them. As it turns out, Barton Fink is the writer of the play and the film documents both his exploits and misadventures in the so-called hallowed turf of Hollywood, home of the movies, right about smack in the middle of the classical era: 1941.That sense of hierarchy is present in Barton Fink, a film with one eye on delivering a riveting drama about the plight of a talented guy in an area that doesn't suit him but with another on both a sense of symbolism and history. After coming to dominate the theatrical circles, rave reviews from audiences and critics alike, Fink comes across as the sort of guy in a situation that sees him 'promoted' to the world of Hollywood, California \u2013 in doing so, leaving behind his roots of theatre and moving onto a 'bigger' and 'better' challenge. The problem being that Fink, for all his skill and imagination, comes down with a frustrating spell of writer's block; particularly annoying given the fact he's been employed by his studio to write a piece which is given all the build up as being something short; sharp; formulaic and relatively routine.Fink's problems begin on arrival. His hotel is down-market, but deliberately so on Fink's choosing so as to break himself into the city without all the promised glamour. It would seem few people inhabit said hotel - we very rarely see anyone else and it dawns on us that why, in such a lush and pleasurable locale of Hollywood, would they inhabit such a gloomy, dank hotel? But, with resident clerk Chet (Buscemi) seemingly doing more work than often what appears to be required, embedding an uncanny sense about the man omnipresent from Fink's initial meeting with him and neighbour Charlie Meadows (Goodman), an insurance salesman, in tow - nothing will be as simple as Fink would like. Like most of the people he meets in this new place they call Hollywood, Meadows is big; brash and when their physical appearance isn't documenting the sort of person they are, they're still evidently larger than life and usually somewhat eccentric. The stark comparison between new and old in where Fink finds himself is made apparent very early on in both the film and his friendship with Meadows; a conversation that sees Fink talk of his fondness for people of Meadows' ilk, the \"common man\" of whom he writes about for theatre thus creating a distinction now between theatre and cinema, and that in this new realm that sees him struggle, the common man has gone and more escapist themed characters must take precedence.Fink's task sees the studio give him what's known as a 'wrestling picture' premise to do a screenplay on. He cannot seem to start, persistently beginning his piece with humble backdrops of market places and downtrodden people that inhabit said place; this before knowing he has to branch out into more dramatic, more archetypal content. It drives him mad, so much so that trips to scatty agents and film stock vaults, in which he gets to see some rushes from a wrestling picture in production, do much more harm than good. The frustration born out of the watching of the rushes, and the repetition of the clips, systematically representational of Fink's realisation that the studio probably want his script nary too indifferent to what he's seeing and that the piece is, essentially, all spectacle; with the writer not seen as someone that has a lot of creative input with regards to the process. Barton Fink is a sly, nifty little film; taking something as drab and unspectacular as a run down hotel room and turning it into a cave full of tiny, distracting wonders. The film captures that broad sense of the trials of writing really well, and in being a product of the Coen's own writing block whilst penning 1990's Millers Crossing, that idea of having people interrupt you; pictures or items on the wall just coming across as so much more interesting as they ought to be when you know there's work to be done; while tiny little noises such as the high-pitched buzzing of flies and that drawn out, slurping noise peeling wallpaper make are accentuated within the zone. As far as a film goes documenting the tumultuous and tough times an individual is going through, Barton Fink is barely misguided; finding a nice balance between juggling the absurdity and the natural humour of the situation, with the rather ominous weight hanging over what's at stake with if he doesn't deliver to his boss who's this larger than life, somewhat aggressive pool side dwelling fat-cat. The film is one of a rich kind, rich on attention to detail within a predicament and rich on the sorts of symbolism that come with arrays on answers. Barton Fink is a wild and ambitious piece; one might say, due to their own writer's block at the time, this is the Coen's most personal film \u2013 there will be those that'll furiously argue it's their best.",

The title character is an idealistic New York playwright summoned to Hollywood in the 1930s and suffering writer's block after being commissioned to script a Wallace Beery wrestling picture. He's an artist out of touch with reality trapped in a city out of touch with reality, and his massive creative block (plus his subsequent anxiety) is aggravated by the stifling environment and unrealistic expectations: how can he write anything when the producer of Capitol Pictures (scene stealer Michael Lerner) is, literally, kissing his feet? The big tease about 'the box' and its contents is little more than just that, and the bloody death of Judy Davis doesn't present the shock of truth it's meant to have: for several scenes afterward it could almost be another of Fink's paranoid delusions. But unlike the merely visual wallpaper of their earlier movies, the Coen's patented mock portentous attitude and tongue-in-cheek claustrophobia is at least made to serve a purpose, becoming the perfect manifestation of (in Capitol Pictures mogul Jack Lipnick's phrase) \"that Barton Fink feeling.\"",

SPOILERS BELOW!Even the people who like this film either don't pretend to know (or care!) what it's about, or disagree about it's interpretation, so it's not really surprising that there are also a large number of people who really loathe it. I fall somewhere in between - I like a lot of things about the movie: the acting of John Goodman and Michael Lerner (although not so much John Turturro), the surreal feel of all the scenes (not just the ones in the hotel), and the way you are given lots of clues as to what might be going on which ALMOST seem to coalesce into a \"proper\" explanation. This helps keep the attention during the first 1.5 hours during which not much actually happens, and I don't really mind \"mood\" movies rather than \"plot\" movies.There seem to be two strands to the movie: the surface plot about the East Coast writer getting writer's block in Hollywood, and the \"Life Of The Mind\" of Barton Fink himself, which takes the main focus. The classic phrase that comes to mind is \"wrestling with one's inner demons\" (namely Chet and especially Charlie).The Hotel Earle is clearly meant to be some sort of Hell, but my take on it is that it is a hybrid of Fink's own personal hell and his mind itself. I don't think we can take any of the scenes in the hotel in any way literally (especially the murder of Audrey and the subsequent police investigation and apocalyptic final scenes). The whole movie can be interpreted simply as a surreal representation of Fink's mental processes.I would've been happy for the movie to end at the point where Fink breaks down crying in his room - thus completing the cycle whereby he heard sobbing just after he first entered the Hotel: the Hellish curse having been \"passed on\". However, I really enjoyed the actual ending where Fink replies \"I don't know\" to the two questions \"What's in the box?\" and \"Is it yours?\". The box is a really nice device, reminiscent of the Schroedinger's Cat paradox, the point being that you can't find out what's inside by opening it (drat!).What I see as the major problem, however, is that this could have been done in a MUCH less cryptic way. The film could still have been surreal, wacky and funny without being so opaque. I don't think the \"point\" of the movie is weighty enough to warrant this kind of \"think deeply about it yourselves later\" approach.",

            "content": "Set in the early 1940s, this film tells the story of a successful New York City playwright named Barton Fink (John Turturro) who moves to Los Angeles to try his luck as a Hollywood screenwriter. But in L.A., his life turns desperate, as he finds himself unprepared to write a shallow, meaningless script about wrestlers, at the insistence of his film agent, the flamboyant Jack Lipnick (Michael Lerner).What Barton really wants to do is to write a meaningful, in-depth film script about the common man. So when he gets to L.A., he rents a room at the seedy, rundown Hotel Earle, hoping to immerse himself in the lives of ordinary, simple people. Here, he meets Charlie (John Goodman), his next door neighbor, a guy who seemingly meets Barton's criteria as simple and ordinary.The problem that I had with this film is the main character; Barton Fink is not likable. With that weird hairdo, his heavy accent, and a tendency to take himself too seriously, he was annoyingly self centered. Although John Turturro is quite a good actor, I did not care for him in this role, at all.The film's plot pace is very slow. Many scenes have the camera just staring at Barton, as Barton stares blankly out into space ... with his mouth open. The film's secondary characters also are not very likable.The color cinematography is acceptable. But Barton's hotel room, where much of the plot takes place, is drab and depressing. It's one of those rooms where the cheap mattress squeaks and the tacky wallpaper peels. Background music for the film is minimal and irrelevant, and thus a missed opportunity, given the historical era. The film's ending is bizarre and makes no sense, except perhaps as symbolism.Written and directed by the Coen brothers, \"Barton Fink\" may have terrific thematic value, in some obscure way. But the lack of entertainment value rendered the movie boring to me. As such, I had no interest in trying to decipher any symbolism or hidden meanings the film may, or may not, have tried to impart.",

            "content": "***Some Spoilers Follow***Barton Fink is the kind of film which defies simple categorizations. Those who expect to be spoonfed and given some clear-cut answers to many twists and turns in the picture should be advised to stay away from watching Barton Fink. This film is not about good and evil but about the mutual entanglement of both. At its core, Barton Fink is about the internal demons of any creative work.Many commentators have hastened to pass overly harsh judgments on the character of the young Jewish New York playwrite Barton Fink (brilliantly executed by John Turturro) as a conceited, arrogant, haughty, self-centered and pretentious son-of-a-bitch. But it is probably beyond any doubt that Fink is a person of significant talent and promise, and that he is NOT motivated by attaining cheap and fleeting glory and fame \"here and now.\" Fink's main problem is that he craves, he yearns for greatness and for influence but not of the ordinary kind. He wants to produce something which would be \"great\" not due to the recognition by the Hollywood \"big shots\" and defined not in terms of commercial success. He wants to destroy the very terms by which success and fame are measured and allotted. Fink indicates to us that he feels that he is \"onto something big.\" He is plagued by the complete absence of any boundary between his own sense of self and his work.He IS his work. Yet Fink's problems are even more deep -- he seems to be motivated by deploying his own \"masterpieces\" (and he expects ONLY masterpieces from himself) as a weapon for \"clearing up the field,\" for revolutionizing the art world, and more ominously, for immortalizing his own name.In one of his confessions to Charlie (the infernal character fantastically played John Goodman), Fink confesses -- \"it might be that I am just a one-play writer.\" The implication of this statement is that Fink is torn between two internal impulses. The realization comes to him that, while he possesses formidable powers of imagination, he sorely lacks broader life experience. Fink feels that to produce something else, he needs generate another message, which, however, cannot ripen within him without having to immerse oneself in the world around. Fink painfully comes to the understanding that he needs to learn, to listen to others. But his narcissistic pride and convictions that he already knows everything about life that he needs to produce his masterpieces obstruct his capacity to grow emotionally and intellectually. He resolves this dilemma through a convenient compromise: he selects to \"listen\" to the stories of the ordinary and folksy traveling insurance salesman Charlie, his hotel neighbor. But in reality he is unwilling to listen (at the end of the movie, \"Charlie\" levels this heavy accusation against Fink above everything else!). Fink wants the \"ordinary folks\" to just confirm and validate his already preformed notions; he just wants to glean facts, as it were, from his interlocutors and then just plug them in into his conceptions and ideas. \"If facts do not correspond to theory, too bad for the facts!\"But even these considerations do not exhaust the problems which congested Fink's mind and soul. I think that Fink is actually both dying to produce his masterpieces and at the same time is existentially mortified by the prospect of converting the message of his \"inner self\" into public knowledge, public property. He is frightened (perhaps sem-consciously) by losing the only reason for going on living which he seems to have -- producing his masterpiece. What if he is really a one-play writer and his writing is his only source of personal identity? What if after that masterpiece, there is only one logical step which remains -- to die? Fink is afraid of existential exposure and depletion. The unopened box symbolizes this torment between wanting to produce and wanting to conceal. The box which Fink carries in his hands is his talisman, his eternal secret, his mystery which allows him to be inspired without being afraid of \"solving all the world's secrets\" and having to live (or not?) in the world totally denuded of any enchantment and puzzlement.Fink's relationship with Audrey is very much a projection of his own fears and needs, his immaturities and childishness, as is Charlie aka Karl Mundt, the madman serial killer aka Lucifer. Charlie is a monster created by Fink's mind, by his irresolvable tensions between a genuine good will and commitment to creativity \"not for sale\" and his approach to his work as a path to personal salvation, to gaining existential uniqueness, to eternalizing his own self in history. All in all, Barton Fink is about the pains of learning and growing, while at the same time preserving the faith in one's own unique and original mission.The overall atmosphere of the film is disturbing and haunting. Brilliant conversations and allegories are top-notch and re-affirm the Fink-centric nature of everything occurring in the movie. Not a single episode of this film is superfluous, so watch it very closely and with a lot of attention to details and seemingly insignificant asides. One of the great and controversial masterpieces of the Coen brothers.",

            "content": "Only the Coens' fourth feature film, Barton Fink made history at Cannes for being the first motion picture to sweep the Palme d'Or, Best Director, and Best Actor awards. Their film also scored three Oscar nominations including one for Best Supporting Actor for Michael Lerner. One of their very best works, Barton Fink is a psychological drama that is laced with the brothers' trademark oddball humor, stylized dialogue, and some exaggerated acting, in what is a surreal tale about a talented playwright who has trouble writing for the screen.His name is Barton Fink (John Turturro). Fresh from penning a critically-acclaimed play about the \"common Man\", Barton's sudden fame lands him a ticket to Hollywood where he meets a couple of bosses from Capitol Pictures who demand that he writes a screenplay for a wrestling B-picture. Only given a week to show what he has got, Barton confines himself in his hotel room only to find that he is out of ideas after typing a few lines on his typewriter By the way, the hotel he is staying in is one of the weirdest I have ever seen. It is damp, stuffy, and strange-looking. Did I also say that it feels like hell on earth? Well, when you got someone who walks up a creaky stairs from below, unlocks and opens a hatch to attend to you, and a lift operator who mutters \"6\" three times on your ascent to your room on the sixth floor, it is hard to argue against that claim. And I haven't mention about wallpapers peeling off to reveal sticky, melted glue, and irritating mosquitoes disfiguring your face while you are having a shut-eye.Barton has a neighbor called Charlie (John Goodman), who becomes good friends with him despite being complained by the former for disturbing the peace with his incessant laughter. Now, that's something pleasant to hear. The relationship between Barton and Charlie is one of mutual admiration. Charlie is someone Barton would describe as a \"common Man\", while Charlie is very impressed with Barton's intellectual pursuits. Until something horrible happens\u0085 The Coens are blessed with the ability to create vivid, eccentric characters that are collectively anchored in real-world believability, yet each retains his (or her) distinct individual traits \u2013 very often quirky, occasionally peculiar and kinky, but rarely uninteresting ones \u2013 which are a complete joy to watch and savor, especially when the actors playing these characters are at the top of their game, and they very often are under the Coens' immaculate direction. Think for instance Frances McDormand's Marge Gunderson in Fargo (1996), or Brad Pitt's Chad Feldheimer in Burn After Reading (2008).Barton Fink delivers a fair amount of psychological suspense as the Coens deal not only with Barton's external environment but also with his psyche. Carter Burwell's minimalist music coupled with the Coens' use of slow zoom-ins and close-ups, and cinematographer Roger Deakins' use of odd color schemes effectively translate the nature of Barton's character into what I would describe as a self-doubting being lost in a space of surreal desolateness.Is Barton a gifted writer of promise or merely a one-trick pony? His journey into the heart of darkness that is Hollywood reveals much of his inability to question what is around him. Does he ask why when his room's wallpaper peels off? No, he just sticks it back on. In the film's final scene, he sees a beautiful girl in a sunbathing suit sitting on the beach (an identical image appears in a picture hanging on his room wall that he lusts upon), but he does not pursue any further than a short one-liner conversation.Barton Fink is a fine character study that could also double up as an allegory of what is rotten about Hollywood filmmaking. The need for independent voices is real, and who better to illustrate this than the masters of independent cinema themselves \u2013 the Coens.GRADE: A (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved.",

Others here have commented on the fine performances of Michael Lerner and John Goodman, and I agree - they enhance the film greatly. John Turturro is also perfectly cast, as are John Mahoney, Tony Shalhoub, and Judy Davis. But for me, what really makes this a great work of art is that it so open to varying interpretations such that each later viewing is, in a sense, a new experience. What can be made of the Charlie character, i.e., the \"everyman,\" given what we come to learn about him, for instance? Or of the relationship of the artist to the everyman? Or artist to businessman?

John Turturro plays the title role, and his acting is touching and emotional. John Goodman, playing Barton's next door neighbor, is frightening and hysterical at the same time (he again shows how excellent an actor he can be, as usual with his performances in the Coen's films). Michael Lerner and John Pollito are hilarious, and John Mahoney does a great job. Judie Davis is also pretty good. It's a little hard to tell about the story without spoiling it, but here it is: Barton Fink is a rising play writer on Broadway in the 1940's, and after his latest play receives great acclaim and praise, he is employed by a big Hollywood studio to write movie scripts. He moves to LA, but when given his first assignment (a B-type boxing movie) he hits a writer's block. At the same time, he meets his neighbor in the hotel in which he's staying, who is a good-natured, simple salesman. They strike a friendship, as he represents to Barton the simple people of America, the subject of his writing. From there the story continues to unfold in various directions, until a horrible murder occurs. Telling more would be a sin, so I'll stop here, but I hope I've caught your attention. The camera work in this film is fantastic (as usual with the Coens), and there are some great, memorable parts in the film (the peeling wallpaper, the picture in the hotel room, the mosquito and more).

I would even dare call it inaccessible. The film is going to make you think. Even though the Coens openly admitted that they did not go into the film with allegorical thoughts in mind, it can be easy to suggest that they had some thoughts about fascism, or the bad side of Hollywood, or writing scripts for entertainment in general. The script is excellent. The characters are three-dimensional, and the actors breathe life into the words that were written for this film. I also really enjoyed the ending because that is what got me thinking more about the story. The directors left the film ambiguous for a reason. I know that frustrates people looking for a simple movie to watch on a rainy afternoon. Then again, this movie is not for you especially if you want to watch nothing but aimless blockbusters.The script for this film actually came to be before Miller's Crossing came out. That particular film seemed to be giving the Coens a hard time trying to finish the script. The result was writer's block, which happens to be a main focus in this picture. This script was made with both Turturro and Goodman in mind and it served its purpose as a diversion allowing the 1990 gangster film to be completed. Both scripts are fantastic, by the way. It can be difficult to label the movie in terms of its genre as it is customary with the Coen's filmography. I think it is a dark comedy that blends elements from film-noir and horror. There is also a bit of Hitchcockian thriller I noticed. This film is also an example of a postmodernist feature. It subverted the audience's expectations by changing the narrative structure in a way to determine how far audiences are willing to suspend disbelief. Another goal of the genre, which works perfectly with this narrative, is to break down the division between high and low art. Barton Fink is a writer trying to write for \"the common man,\" yet his first foray into Hollywood is to write a mainstream picture for a huge movie star with the goal of profit in mind rather than art.The Coens had some people in mind that they based their characters off. The main person is playwright Clifford Odets. Odets was a politically-charged playwright who found success under the Broadway lights before moving to California for a movie career. The directors took inspiration from various Odets plays to give Mr. Fink his character traits. Another person they had in mind was William Faulkner who was a famous author and alcoholic. The casting of John Mahoney as Faulkner may have been pure coincidence but their face likenesses are striking. The studio head, Jack Lipnick (played brilliantly by Michael Lerner), is a combination of studio heads of the time such as Jack Warner. The Coens always seemed to have that one loud, crass person of authority that loom large over the picture. Michael Lerner is that guy here and I loved his portrayal. One of the scenes, where he has an army suit made for him, is one brilliant scene.Set in the early 1940's as the Nazis were waging war in Europe, Barton Fink (John Turturro) is a successful yet idealistic playwright who moved to Hollywood to begin a career in the film industry. He is hired to write a script for the wrestling drama starring Wallace Beery for the eccentric Jack Lipnick (Michael Lerner), head of Capital Studios. He is unable to finish the screenplay because of a case of writer's block. He locks himself inside the seedy Hotel Earle, whose only inhabitant is the traveling insurance salesman, Charlie Meadows (John Goodman), a larger-than-life fellow. Fink may have no choice but to take inspiration from Meadows and a secretary of fellow writer W. P Mayhew (John Mahoney) who goes by the name of Audrey (Judy Davis). Very quickly does Barton Fink learn that Hollywood is ready to eat him up alive.I loved the performances. Actors tend to develop eccentric personalities in any film the Coen Brothers make and this one is no exception. Turturro comes into own as the writer who is a bit of an oddball but trying to make a name for himself. I knew there was more than what meets the eye when it comes to Goodman's character. I liked where his character path went. Michael Lerner goes over-the-top as the studio head, a type of personality that you don't see in today's more corporate Hollywood. There are smaller performances so don't miss the blink-or-miss performance from Steve Buscemi.Like everyone else, I was weirded out by Barton Fink upon initial viewing. I was not truly sure what kind of film it wanted to be. As the fires raged in the dumpy Hotel Earle as the film came to a close, I began to understand. The production design is excellent and I loved the comparisons between Hotel Earle and Lipnick's studio, a fair contrast of dark versus light. Carter Burwell's score fits the mood and is a good one. Barton Fink is not for everyone. It is not straightforward and will make you think about the characters and what they stand for. It is ironic that the Coens say how well Hollywood treated them yet they made a dark comedy about something completely opposite of their experiences. This is a demanding, exhilarating film and no one would expect less from the Coens.My Grade: A-",

            "content": "\"Barton Fink\" is a masterpiece.  A masterpiece!  If only for Goodman and Turturro's A+ performances.  Turturro is Fink, a struggling playwright who just moved into a mysterious Hotel in Hollywood.  Goodman is Fink's neighbor, a friendly and passionate insurance salesman.  Fink immediately gets writer's block and struggles sadly throughout the movie to come up with a screenplay for a B movie wrestling pic that a company wants him to create. All the while Charlie helps.Turturro delivers a performance so passionate that it rival's Nicolas Cage's screen-writer in 2002's Adaptation.  Goodman is what surprises you though, bringing vibrant life to his role so well that you'd even say it was Oscar-worthy.  The supporting players - consisting of greats like Jon Polito, John Mahoney, Judy Davis and Steve Buscemi - also do quite well.And, of course, the Coen's script is perfect.  You'll feel so sorry for Barton and fall in love with Charlie - which only makes the end more tragic.Speaking of which...<<Pretty major *SPOILERS* ahead>> ...the ending was brilliant - though a tad tragic.  Barton comes home to the hotel one day after Charlie has left and finds two detectives waiting for him.  He learns that Charlie is really a mass-murderer...but that's not all! A few days later he gets a visit from the detectives and Charlie all at once...and he learns that Charlie is the Prince of Darkness himself.  Sounds a little odd for a drama about a screen-writer right?  Well, that's the Coens!  Two more points about the ending: one, I'd have to say its the Coen's best \"unpredictable ending\" yet.  \"The Big Lebowski\" was surprising, but nothing new.  \"Miller's Crossing\" was more of a subtle implication, and I really wouldn't say \"Fargo\" was unpredictable at all.  \"Barton Fink\"'s ending was out of nowhere, which made it all the more better.  My second point is how the Coens turned Goodman into a reluctant Satan.  He says lines like (regarding Hell) \"You think I made your life hell?  Look around! You're a tourist with a typewriter, I live here!\".  I'd say its realistic, because I don't think anyone would like being in the situation he's in (I'm still very far from liking or feeling sorry for the devil though).<<No more *SPOILERS*>>\"Barton Fink\" is by far an offbeat classic, 8.5/10.",

            "content": "Barton Fink is an artist's movie. It is about artists, inventors, and people who \"create\" for a living. I so believe it appeals to these kind of people in turn. Not that it is inaccessible; many movies written and directed by The Coen brothers over the years are insular to some degree, but Barton Fink is one of the more challenging tales that tends to be a love it or hate it kind of experience. It sets up symbols and allegories that are meant to be funny and serious at the same time. This is also one of my favorite movies, and a lot of that comes from the fact that I agree with a lot of what The Coen Brothers are talking about. Barton Fink is the first of the intellectual trilogy of films they directed, the others being A Serious Man (2009) and finalizing with Inside Llewyn Davis (2013).John Turturro stars as Barton Fink and is amazing to watch perform. To get inside a character like this, I find the actor usually has the opposite traits as a real person, hence I believe him to be someone who is humble and unselfish in reality unlike his counterpart as a character here. Turturro is one of the most underrated actors of our times, simultaneously being able to play the biggest nerd or the biggest bully.The enigmatic film is based in the 1940's and is very much a satire on mainstream Hollywood filmmaking. At the same time however, it is pretentious for the sake of being pretentious, and includes random scenes thrown in just to do so, ergo making fun of itself. The best art movies have to know that the process of making cinema is a little silly, and Barton Fink is a very self-aware kind of film. Eraserhead, Repulsion, Persona, Adaptation- look at these films and you'll realize Barton Fink is the equal of them, a writer's block infused storyline disguising a higher meaning.Truly existential questions are asked throughout Fink's Journey: What is reality? Does the devil really exist? Will the hero of the story get the girl, or is their love doomed? Should the studio literally and figuratively kiss artist's feet? Well, you see what you want to see. It is a very laid back film, it does not force its opinions on you.To say the Coen Bros. are all style and no substance is ridiculous, yet I hear it all the time. People need to respect the style and courage in which they make films, they are perhaps the best directors we have got these days. Barton Fink is the oddest movie they have made to be sure, but it serves as their own personal allegory of misplacement in the world. It holds the record to this day as the only film ever to win all top 3 prizes at Cannes Film Festival held in Paris every year, which is the most respected film festival worldwide. This fact alone means it is one of the best films of all time, but why is it so divisive among viewers? To watch a movie this free and spirited is to truly feel alive. I recommend this movie to anyone who thinks movies are more than just mere entertainment but something to ponder over your whole lifetime.",

On the other hand, John Goodman, Fink's next door neighbor at the hotel; Michael Lerner as Jack Lipnick, the studio chieftain; John Mahoney as A. P. Mayhew, the famous novelist on a perpetual binge; and Judy Davis as Audrey Taylor, Mayhew's lover and sometimes collaborator -- all have meaty parts portraying colorful characters and they make the most of their opportunities. It's not difficult to divine who Fink, Mayhew and Lipnick are modeled on. And Mayhew and Lipnick are nailed to the board as neatly as Tina Fey has nailed Sarah Palin.

When the ode is made by the Cohen brothers, the result is clear and is not to be missed. The storyline develops slowly, very slowly, and a little in the style of Kafka's stories showing us the depths bordering to madness of the mind of the writer.

But, to be honest, 'Barton Fink' wasn't less enjoyable only because its concept turned out to be familiar to me (I couldn't have known that beforehand). It lacks dynamism a bit too much throughout its first two thirds, exactly to serve its purpose better in making the contrast with the last third clearer. But that's to the detriment of the experience. I'm as much a fan of the Coen as of the Kaufman brothers; this is their only piece I didn't get to like so much. However, I understand their purpose. They were simultaneously attacking the myth of the common man (cultivated by the main character in the plot), and the world of stupid, incoherent, illogical, sensationalist and actually-not-even-so-spectacular Hollywood blockbusters. Such a clear purpose, however, predictably turned all their characters into plot devices. And the message is a bit self-righteous I think. They essentially sent the message here that they are special, exempt from rules binding for the mainstream as well as from the rules of indie film-making. The only reason one can forgive them for that is that they are indeed special. I'm glad this is their only film where they focused on that fact itself.

So he is offered to write movies. He travels down to L.A.(this is in the 30's by the way) where he is offered to write a movie about wrestling. Supposedly for a company that makes B-movies.He has a hard time trying to write such crap. While there, he makes friends with his neighbor(played by John Goodman) at this strange hotel.

That was unfair to Fink and unfair to me. This film is not the Last Word on What it is to Write, but it is... good. Interesting. Clever, mostly. And I wish that didn't disappoint me so.The good: There are some moments of brilliant imagery here, particularly the slow-motion USO brawl and the \"life of the mind\" John Goodman sequence. The theme of academic pretension toward populism is particularly well-drawn, the central character's solipsism is cleverly explicated, etc. Ho-hum.But for all the things that happen in this movie, nothing really happens: John Turtutto's Fink is thrust into bizarre situations and gives immediate reactions, but there is no arc or transformation there. I love the idea of diving into a sick creative mind, but when everything we see is so devoid of context, what's the point? We know nothing of Fink beyond his half-assed admiration of the common man, so how can the Coens justify the barrage of non sequitur violence? Fink dreams of murder, fire, and war--that's fine, but don't just slap it all on, build it into the damn character. I don't fault a film its surrealism, but Fink's surrealism is completely unearned. And it's not nearly as thought-provokingly ambiguous as it thinks it is, spoiler it's a head what the hell else would it be.And so the Coens let cleverness trump character. Barton Fink isn't a bad film, Joel and Ethan don't make bad films--but they do make disappointing films sometimes. And Barton Fink is unfortunately one of them. TK 9/26/10",

            "content": "This film is choke full of the standard Cohen brothers themes: Ignorance, duplicity, and duality in the human character. Its difficult to put one's finger directly on the meaning of every piece of symbolism, but generally speaking, the film seemed like a scathing critique of pompous intellectual writers.Fink is blissfully unaware of the fecund, \"common man\" reality that teems around him. Material abounds with which he could defeat his writer's block, but through Fink's reticence to put words on paper, we come to see his true character: Fink's \"genius,\" the \"Barton Fink feel\" is really just the absolute most derivative and sentimental of the New York genres that satiate the intellectual elite's need for a taste of the fanciful fiction they mistake for \"reality.\" Also interesting is the continuous repetition of the phrase, \"The life of the mind\" by Fink. I interpreted the irony here as being that the life of the mind Fink seems to occupy is a dull life indeed; a mental reality of isolation and stagnation. Films like this are refreshing because they let me know that there are others out there who question our culture's blind idolatary of the \"writer\" and \"author.\"",

            "content": "SPOILERS ALL OVER IT\"Barton Fink\", often ignored and misunderstood when talking about great movies of the nineties, is Joel and Ethan Coen's best picture and one of my favourite movies of all time. It's great because it manages to work in a lot of levels and to deliver a lot of speeches without actually never choosing one single direction. It's basically a dark comedy about writer's block, but it's also an acid joke about Hollywood, the role of the artist in society and even Arthur Miller-type writers, and it's also a metaphor for Hell, and of course a character study put in comparison with a familiar alter ego like no other, as well as a plot rich in references to classic cinema, and a homage to the great director Roman Polanski (who directed the Cannes jury in 1991 when this movie received the three major awards, and by George it deserved all of them and a few more!).A lot has been said about all these meanings and a lot of critic has been written about them, so I won't explain or justify my aseverations, just as the Coens don't in the movie. Let's just say that I can perfectly understand why most people don't like it. It's deliberately obscure, slow-moving and the jokes are far too complex and often too dark as to provoke laughs in people that don't have an odd sense of humor like I do. And don't try to watch this movie if you are not familiarized with Coen cinema -I mean it. Their unique style joined in this film with this particularly complex and twisted as Hell (all right I had to make my own pun, everybody does it) might put you off pretty fast. Try first with \"The big Lebowski\", \"Oh Brother Where Art Thou\" or \"The man who wasn't there\". If you don't dig their style (they have a whole cowboy thing goin' on there\") you're not the man for this movie.A brief note about the great performances of John Turturro, John Goodman, Judy Davis, Michael Lerner, Steve Buscemi, the amazing Tony Shalhoub and the star from \"Frasier\" (the best sitcom out there in my opinion) John Mahoney. And the cinematography by Deakins (a good substitute for previous Coen cinematographer Barry Sonenfeld, who left to became a rather lousy comedy director). And the music by Howard Shore. I'm an absolute Coen fan and this movie ranks high on my golden list (wich changes way too often, but this one always has a place).By the way yes I'm being deliberately fatuous.SAY NO MORE",

This is symbolized perfectly by the eerie hotel in which Barton stays, and the eerie neighbors who surround him, especially Charlie, a very strange insurance salesman played by John Goodman in a show-stealing performance.A beautiful human story with a powerful climax, \"Barton Fink\" is a complex masterwork filled with offbeat humor and an unusual feeling of uneasiness throughout.

            "content": "Many films are weird. Many films are incoherent tripe, pretentious drivel and frivolously executed. I'm sure every one of those movies wants to be \"Barton Fink\" - a film by the Coen Brothers that is so brilliantly made and superbly told it blows other bizarre movies out of the water. It's almost of David Lynch's weirdest fantasies, yet mixed with John Waters's craziest caricatures. Everything about \"Barton Fink\" is wonderful - the Coens created one of their top three films and maybe the top of their form with this surrealistic, bizarre and original fantasy that gave Hollywood a run for their money - it's not of any formula, sequel opportunity... it's its own brilliant piece of modern art.The plot follows an acclaimed popular playwright (played by John Turtorro) sent to Hollywood, California in the 1940's. He's lured into Capital Pictures by Jack Lipnick (Michael Lerner) where he learns that he must first rank up the system before he's writing pieces on the common film. His first assignment is a new Wallace Beery (\"The Champ\") wrestling picture, while he's somewhat trapped in the low grade, dumpy Hotel Earle. It's here he develops a severe case of writer's block, and asks upon his next-door neighbor, Charlie Meadows (John Goodman) for inspiration on what the common man is like, and how he can incorporate those themes into his picture, and also befriending a naive secretary Audrey Taylor (Judy Davis). It takes a little bit, but as he unravels the meaning in his picture, he discovers the true hellish, dark fantastical reality of 1940's Hollywood as the plot does spin abouts on the audience.I'd consider the movie a piece of craftsmanship that maybe no other filmmaker rivaled at the time; it's its own original piece. The Coens are superb at getting to know these odd, eccentric characters and caricatures. We follow along every minute, encapsulated by what's on the screen - we're shocked, compelled, and fascinated. The thoughts of the film are nightmarishly thoughtful, bleakly funny, wildly banal and positively, freakishly insane. It's a stunning, wildly emotional piece of work. What is even more astounding is that this isn't even the Coen's very best film. Their visual style is unique and maybe even beyond expressive... Their own interesting surreal twist with their character representation visuals is fascinating.The closing shot of the film - and I won't spoil it - is plainly, leanly haunting. It's a masterful piece.Barton Fink (1991)4 STARS (OUT OF 4)Written and directed by the Coen brothersStarring John Turturro, John Goodman, Judy Davis and Michael LernerRated R128 minutes.",

            "content": "As Barton Fink is, on certain days, my favorite movie of all time, I've been doing some research:  The Coens, usually closed-mouthed about any aspect of their films which breaks through the surface plot, freely admit to being influenced by Polanski's The Tenant and Repulsion in the making of Fink.  So to shed some light on things, you might try watching these, as well as Luis Bunuel's earlier Belle De Jour, which contains the same actress as Repulsion in a startlingly similar scenario.  Only in Belle De Jour, the slipping into insanity and loss of distinction between reality and dream world for the viewer is all the more clear, all the more nuanced, and all the more ground-breaking.  So I think what you will draw from these other films is the conclusion that, yes, as has been suggested, a good part of this may or may not have happened, up to and including the whole damn thing.  As a last note, I feel there is also some clarity about the film to be gained by watching The Seventh Seal.  We have a similarity of images where the waves break on the rock, we have a confusion of the roles of devil-like and religious or god-like characters...among other things...but the most important connection is that we have two films here which are self-referential in their exploration of the making of performed art.  Fink is a movie about writing a movie...for the common man.  I think the biggest irony of Barton Fink is the nature of the Coen's films to be both violent and a little childish, borrowing from b-movie conventions, and then to add high-falutin' theoretical subtexts and what-have-you, making them, literally, art films for the common man.  They can be enjoyed on both levels.  What better film to reference in this context, then, than Bergman's Seventh Seal, which was THE movie which first established film as an art form instead of merely a lowely entertainment.",

Barton Fink is a harrowing and horrific journey into the mind of a mad genius. It is a very well acted, well directed, and well shot film. However, what makes the film worth seeing is it's challenging qualities. Many people will walk away from the film confused. The ending to this film provides the viewer with a rather bizarre puzzle for him/her to solve. This is probably one of the most challenging American films ever made.

They don't cohere into anything meaningfully substantive, at least not for any significant period of time. There are all sorts of annoying loose ends in the film, like the whole Audrey storyline.

The film's cast includes names such as John Goodman, John Turturro and Steve Buscemi, and is helmed by the Coen brothers (directed, written and produced.) Described by some as a surrealist homage to the films of Roman Polanski, the film offers a narrative rich in symbolism and enigma for audience's to interpret. The film's begins with a euphoric scene in which we see Barton Fink (John Turturro) awkwardly accept his rigorous applause following the success of his play. He is quickly summoned by a film company to LA, where he is adored by eccentric executive Jack Lipnick (Michael Lerner). Lerner commands every sequence he is in, imposing not only his flesh onto Barton but his plans for his contracted writer to create an outstanding film about wrestling. As Barton checks in to a hotel, he realises that he is suffering from writer's block and is struggling to get started on his screenplay. From what feels like a steady, accentuated beginning, the film's pacing suddenly increases as Barton's deadline looms. Whilst meeting the instantly-likable Charlie (John Goodman), and the not so likable W. P. Mayhew (John Mahoney), Barton travels on a trip of self-discovery and reflection, climaxing in an extraordinary final act. Perhaps the film's greatest strength is that it manages to effortlessly blend moments of comedy, tension and violence into a mixture of haunting cinematic magic. The Coen's linger over shots for often uncomfortably short periods of time, planting images in audience's heads. The image of the wallpaper in Barton's room peeling resonates particularly strongly. Barton Fink marked the beginning of the Coen brother's introduction to mainstream cinema audiences, and the film's impressive performances, editing and perfectly handled pacing means that it may be one of their finest films to date.",

I can only guess that they were brought up in an environment where the expectations to learn, explore, and enjoy myth and legend; and the aspirations, foolish and noble, of human beings was to be celebrated and enjoyed. Apologies ahead of time for the rambling nature of this, but to sum up this movie in a thousand words would mean spending more time and skull-sweat on this than I can afford right now.I have read that Barton Fink was the child of the brother's writer's block while creating Miller's Crossing; my take on it, if this was the situation, that Barton Fink represents the Mother of all creative purgatives! I am surprised that this film didn't win any awards for best sound design. From the opening credits, I found the sound underlying everything to be a major component. The number of mechanical, background, annoyingly repetitive sounds was quite astonishing, and they got progressively weirder as the movie progressed. Fan sounds, elevator sounds, repetitive ringing, all designed to drive us slightly insane as we try and follow the situation and motivations of the characters.Barton's resemblance to Lynch's seminal Eraserhead, while also channeling some of the best manic intensiveness of Gene Wilder at his most extreme was genius. Intentionally invoking what some might call pretension? Perhaps. What better period in which to set this film, as the colossal studio system was gearing up to support the government, marshaling the armies of contract artists and crew to \"fight the good fight.\" The studio system was a microcosm of the fascism America was readying itself to conquer (well, the Brits needed some help, didn't they?). Evidence of the play on the war situation may be found in the real name of Charlie; as well as the German and Italian names of the cops who are trying to catch him; or at least find someone to pin the crimes on.In the end, we really don't know what is fact, what is fiction, and is Barton just imagining everything, or has he gone insane? John Mahoney's Faulkner/Fitzgerald character shows us one way that the writer can go in the Hollywood of the \"golden age.\" Barton's Sysiphean sentence to write, yet never have his material see light through celluloid, truly would be a sentence to hell.This movie, from script (10+), casting (11), production design (10) through sound (11!) is one of the best films I can ever remember seeing. It lauds creativity, while also putting extreme ego of the creative types in their respective place. It goes to weird places in the psyche of humanity, and says things about what people will do to be heard in ways that I find funny, repellent, and touching at the same time. See this movie. Think about it. Listen to it. In the end, it won't change your life. But it might change how you think about life.",

            "content": "I've only seen a handful of the 'Coen Brothers' movies so far, and each time, I'm left surprised by the range of their oeuvre. I haven't necessarily liked all they've had to offer ('Intolerable Cruelty' is the first that comes to mind), but they've transcended so many genres through their movies that they've come to define their own. And regardless of the purported genre, whether it be a Western or a Musical, a Comedy or a Slow-Burning Drama, they've never failed to leave that indelible impression on each of their outings, one that reassuringly proclaims from the moment you see their names in the opening credits that you're witness to something special. 'Barton Fink' is no exception - it's a beautifully-crafted, ably-acted and soundly-written drama, that is unlike any other 'Hollywood-Writer' drama you've ever seen before.Barton Fink is a New York playwright, and when we're introduced to him, he's right at the cusp of fame and success, having written a 'common-man' play that's received rave reviews from audience and critics alike. Although, fame, he doesn't seem to desire, and success, he wants on his own terms, believing that his best work is still ahead of him. Despite his strong beliefs and principles, he's reluctantly convinced by his agent to accept a studio contract in Hollywood, in order to cash in on his new-found fame. Although once he gets to Los Angeles, he finds himself completely out of his element, while rubbing shoulders with a motley of characters - the flamboyant studio-head whose praise and reverence for Barton seems conditional on his ability to make him money; the established Hollywood screenwriter that Barton looks to for inspiration, but quickly realizes has his own share of personal demons; the beautiful and charming secretary who could easily have been reduced to a prop in a lesser movie; and of course, the mild-mannered and ever-smiling neighbour that provides much-needed companionship to the ill- adjusted writer. And the cast did a commendable job in bringing these characters to life - Judy Davis was every bit as charming as the character she portrays; Michael Lerner as Lipnick stole every scene that he graced, and provided much-needed comic relief to an otherwise somber movie; it was great to see Mahoney & Shalhoub outside the TV roles that've made them so famous; and John Turturro, it seems, was born to essay this soft-spoken, ill-at-ease, anxiety- ridden writer. But the highlight of the movie was definitely John Goodman, whose affecting candor and lighthearted personality is the centerpiece of this fine drama. The movie is rich in symbolism, for one who is willing to pay attention. For one who isn't, it's still a beautiful tale of a man's struggle, with himself as much as the outside world, and of finding poetry in the routine and the mundane. That was one of the aspects I highly appreciated - the symbolism and subtle layers in this movie aren't stuffed down the viewer's throat; the movie can be watched within or without that context, and it would still be a rewarding experience. The movie touches upon a number of themes as well - the difficulty of the writing process, the classification of high versus low art, the subjective nature of artistic assessment, the commercialization of art in recent times, the struggle to find meaning in one's life, the beauty that lies in the life of the common man, and of course, the life of the mind. Some people might take issue with the inherent ambiguity of the film or certain unresolved strands that are left for the viewers to untangle. And I do concede that there are movies where I find such tactics annoying, seemingly employed by the makers in the name of post-modern artistry to hide the fact that they were at a loss to resolve their tale with a satisfying ending. But the Coens lay no claim that this is movie is a straightforward one, imploding as it is with abstract moments and hidden meanings from the first frame. It therefore is only consistent that the ending be such as well.As to the reasons I've shaved 2 ratings off this title, they are two-fold - one, I reserve a perfect score of 10 for a select few movies that shake me to the core, and this, despite being an excellent film in its own stead, wasn't one of them. And two, I wasn't entirely convinced behind the motivations of a certain key character in this film, or more likely, enough time wasn't devoted by the Coens to explaining the motives, which I feel was essential since it forms such a crucial aspect of the storyline. I also felt a couple of characters deserved better from the script than just a passing mention in the second half and never to be seen of or heard from again. But these are trivial complaints against a highly competent and enjoyable film, and if this movie were ever to serve as a subject matter in the debate of high versus low art, I've no doubts it'd be unanimously placed in the former.",

            "content": "This is a great critique of pomposity. In \"Barton Fink\", the Coens mock the faux-populism of the eponymous character (John Turturro). Fink is a promising playwright in New York who, after receiving great acclaim for his first play, is offered the opportunity to write movies in Hollywood. He imagines himself a chronicler of the plight of the working man, but he doesn't really recognize a working man when one enters his life in the form of his next-door-neighbor at the hotel, Charlie Meadows (John Goodman). Fink finds himself lonely in a strange hotel, unable to complete the writing assignment given him studio executive Jack Lipnick (Michael Lerner). His life takes strange turns as he holes up in his hotel room and attempts to complete the writing assignment.The Coens take some shots at those who take themselves overly seriously. This would be in keeping with their irreverence-as manifested in the humor of films like \"O Brother Where Art Thou?\" and \"The Big Lebowski\". The ennui characterizing Fink's hotel is in stark contrast to the luxurious surroundings in which the movie executives work, contrasting Fink's mental uneasiness with the luxury in which the executives work.The film retains an unsettling mood throughout. The hotel itself should have received billing, so key a figure is it in the movie. It is a six story hotel but we never see anyone other than Fink and his next door neighbor Charlie Meadows (John Goodman) living in it. Clerk Chet (Steve Buscemi) is odd and unusually uses a trapdoor from the basement to enter the hotel one time. The wallpaper is peeling off the walls in Fink's room and it annoys him but he never gets it fixed. Therefore it continues to fester and annoy him. There is a fly which Fink can never quite kill which further contributes to the tension in the film.The acting in this movie is really excellent. Judy Davis is great as a loyal but abused assistant to novelist JP Mayhew. John Mahoney as Mayhew is fantastic. He is an intelligent man with a serious drinking problem which has deprived him of much of the energy which made him great. Michael Lerner as hard-driven studio head Jack Mitnick deservedly received an Oscar nomination for his work. He conveys a great deal of passion as a loquacious, fast-talking exec. John Goodman as Charlie Meadows is fantastic. He gives a big performance, conveying the impression of the hale-fellow-well-met that makes him a convincing everyman. Few people have given better performances depicting characters with such different sides. John Turturro as the title character is great. He imbues Fink with neuroticism and idealism but still not the wisdom to believe he isn't as sympathetic to the common man as he believes. Jon Polito is very good as Mitnick's dutiful assistant and agent Ben Geisler is as blunt as an anvil in his depiction by Tony Shalhoub.This is a very original movie, one that will have you thinking about it for a long time. It's unusual for directors to mock pomposity, but the Coens do it here in inimitable style.",

            "content": "Barton Fink The Coen brothers may not be the most conventional auteurs in the world, but this is strange even by their standards, switching tonally from their usual screwball comedy to David Lynch style nightmare as the film goes on and changing genres almost flippantly. In short it deserves to be a better known film than it is and is surely one of the most inventive films of the 90s. the problem is that it's so weird I'm finding it impossible to review.It tells the story of Fink (John Turturro), an Arthur Miller-esquire realist playwright hired by a Hollywood studio to write a screenplay with \"that Barton Fink feeling\", the trouble being that its not a soul-searching drama, but a b-movie about wrestling and as a result he develops severe writer's block. As he sits in his festering hotel room his only sources of inspiration are a secretary (Judy Davis), who is secretly a literary genius, and Charlie (the brilliant John Goodman) his insurance salesman neighbour who seems to represent the everyman he needs to channel. However Fink is cursed with an inability to listen to others and just as things are going right he is implicated in a murder and his world falls apart.As with all Coen brothers movies the cast of characters is a real gallery of eccentrics. Aside from the pretentious, absurdly boufanted Barton, there's the loud overbearing producer Jack Lipnick (clearly modelled on Warner and Meyer), who answers all his questions as soon as he asks them, permanently soused writer W.P. Mayhew (who it emerges has never written anything) and a pair of ball-busting detectives who seem determined to implicate Fink as an accomplice to John Goodman's insurance salesman turned head collecting serial killer. To this list we might also add the hotel, a kind of 1 star version of the Overlook with sickly yellow lighting, peeling wallpaper, mosquitoes, drains that may lead to hell and only one apparent employee (Steve Buscemi's enthusiastic bellboy Chet).As you have probably guessed by now the film doesn't make a great deal of sense, but the Coens' excellent writing and direction, coupled with terrific performances from every cast member, means that while often confused the viewer is never bored. The climatic depiction of Hollywood as the 9th Level of Hell is in itself sufficiently dreamlike and thought provoking to make the experience of watching it worthwhile.Overall though, its just bloody strange.5/5",

It has some brilliant scenes, but no plot, nothing resembling a plot, tension as the eponymous Fink (why that name, you will wonder) struggles to fulfill his Hollywood assignment but the plot was axed by the movie executive in favor of what is, after all, a Dadaist wrestling movie. You'll understand that comment after the movie.If you enjoy a tightly plotted film in which template characters pursue a goal (e.g., the Mission Impossible films), and you just want a story, without an admixture of meaning, you will probably hate this film. The brilliant scenes -- most of them involving John Goodman -- are character pieces, not plot devices. They advance nothing but themselves. Because there's no plot, remember. I could appreciate several great scenes, including the conversations between Barton Fink and his neighbor, the overbearing film director, and the two caricatured police detectives, but frankly the Mulholland Drive -- like nonplot drove me nuts.

            "content": "It makes sense that I should write a review of Barton Fink right after I write a review of Blue Velvet because they actually have a lot in common. Barton Fink is a strange movie, even for the Coen Brothers. Much like Blue Velvet, it maintains a pervasive sense of general darkness throughout and insanity is a driving (and ever-mounting) force. By the end, it was hard to tell what is real and what is a dream or Fink's imagination or the story he's writing, which is again, similar to Blue Velvet. It's not a happy movie or funny or light-hearted like other Coen Brother movies have been. Yet it was superbly written and acted.Actually, writing and acting is what this movie relied upon, given that this had to be a low budget film-- no glitzy special effects here (in fact on the contrary, it seems to relish in its own simplicity and starkness). John Goodman was a super and very evil bad guy who reminded me of a ramped-up version of his role as a crooked Bible salesman in O, Brother Where Art Thou?. John Turturro's character, our protagonist, was misguided and self-centered, like many writers are perhaps, though I'm not sure if he really deserved all that befell him in the story. Since he was also lonely and sad; it seems his only real crime was to complain about the noise coming from the hotel room next to his. Or was that just a symptom of a deeper flaw? Hmm...The secondary characters were not your clich\u00e9 stock characters, rather they were very interesting: Tony Shalhoub was an eccentric and in-your-face studio exec; Steve Buscemi was a quirky hotel receptionist (Like Wes Anderson, the Coen Brothers like to use the same handful of actors in just about all of their movies, in one role or another); the actor who played the father of Frasier in the cit-com (Steve Mahoney) here played a drunken, washed-up famous author (who I've heard the Coen Brothers based on the life of William Faulkner); the actor playing the producer did a great job making him an awful combination of a mobster (like the boss in Miller's Crossing) and Jerry Cromwell (the evil producer from the novel Karoo by Steve Tesich); even the elevator operator was unique.Other than the great acting, this movie was full of symbolic/intellectual cinematic/literary 'elements' (I'm sure there's a more accurate term for them)- like the obnoxious mosquito buzzing just out of reach of the camera and the hotel being so hot that the wall paper glue melts and finally the entire floor catches on fire. Being the talented and clever writers/directors they are, the Coen Brothers added in these symbolic 'items' as the cherry on top of their screenplay, to offer a secondary layer of reflection/representation of its bigger themes (like mounting insanity or an evil being let out of the box)- these 'items' also add to the mystique and fascinating character of the film.I guess that the Coen Brothers are known for writing interesting characters and clever stories that are offbeat and that make you think. This one was no different in that regard; Barton Fink was just one of their dark movies. I'd say it's in line with their Blood Simple and No Country for Old Men, both of which are tragic and gruesome stories. So all in all, I enjoyed it while at the same time found it nerve-wracking and awful- and that's why I respect it and consider it a well-made movie. Maybe if it were cheerful instead of gloomy, it would get a higher rating.",

            "content": "Barton Fink is the Coes Brother's satire of 1940's Hollywood studios and writers. After writing a successful play, Barton Fink (John Turturro)is offered a contract with a movie studio, and he only reluctantly accepts, because he is afraid he will have to sacrifice the freedom to write about the plight of the common man. Fink's first assignment is a wrestling picture, but he just can't quite connect with the subject matter, resulting in a horrible case of writer's block. His inability to connect with the wrestling picture genre reflects his disassociation from the common man, whom he claims to admire and respect, and the fact that he does not recognize this as his problem. Fink tries to get ideas by asking people for advice and watching dailies from other wrestling pictures, but his hopes are ruined when he learns that his favorite writer, W.P. Mayhew, is an alcoholic who relies on his secretary and mistress, Audrey, (Judy Davis, in a great performance) to write his stories for him. Fink tells Mayhew that he is separating himself from his work by drinking, but he does not realize that he does the same thing by dismissing common people. He doesn't listen to his neighbor, Charlie (John Goodman), an insurance salesman, even though he tries to tell him tons of stories; at one point, he even tells Fink to use him as his model for the wrestler, but to no avail. In another scene, Fink is dancing in a nightclub when a Navy sailor asks if he can dance with Fink's dancing partner, because he is going to fight the Japanese soon. Fink refuses and asserts that his chosen \"life of the mind\" is a great contribution to society, comparable to the man's naval service, which gets him a good punch in the jaw.I won't give away the twist(s), but the film takes an unexpected turn that involves Audrey and the real identity of his neighbor, Charlie, and shortly afterward Fink is cured of his writer's block and he finishes his script. But the Studio Executives reject it. Michael Werner plays Jack Lipnick, Fink's boss, who claims to appreciate artistry and originality, but he really just wants conventional pictures. He is just as intellectually bankrupt as Fink feared. All too often it seems that unoriginality is the price of success for writers in any field. We are left to ponder why Fink got over his writer's block, and I think it has to do with the meaning of two objects in his hotel room: a picture of a woman in a bathing suit, sitting on a beach, and a box that Charlie leaves for him. There is a clear, literal meaning of the box, but people have speculated that, metaphorically, it contains Fink's mind. I like this interpretation so I am sticking to it, but it is left wide open. I am a little more puzzled about the picture; perhaps Fink is enamored with it because it represents the Hollywood beauties that he has no connection with. In the last shot of the picture, Fink is on a beach, staring at a woman who is almost an exact replica of the woman from the photo. He asks if she is in pictures, almost as if he hopes she can give him some advice on how to write them. The movie also leaves us to ponder whether Fink was just a one hit wonder, or if he really became a great writer. Either way, it seems that Fink can't appeal to common people, because he just won't listen to them. My review might have been a little dry and serious, but this does not entirely reflect the nature of the movie, because it really is funny. The film has a perfect cast. Turturro makes a good bumbling Woody Allen type. I was most impressed with John Goodman, however. He plays the part in a totally innocent, genuine way, which makes the twist at the end very effective.Barton Fink is a great intellectual black comedy. I have seen six of the Coen Brother's movies so far, and this is my favorite. It is one of the best examples of their style of blending comedy with serious subject matter. It is not as popular as Fargo, but it deserves to be right up there next to it.",

I can really relate to Barton. Although I haven't had quite the same adventure that he has-I still find he's a great representation of the \"common man\". Both of these men show top of the line performances. Perfect outlines for character development.  Another that I enjoy in any film is dialogue. I really enjoy the dialogue in this film.

But what really gives the movie its power is that much of the background action is symbolic, and often only affects one character in a scene. This makes you question what is real and what isn't, giving everyone a different idea of the meaning of the movie. Meanwhile, the surface plot is about an arrogant writer who advertises himself as a writer \"for the common man\" but can't even recognize his neighbor who really is the quintessential \"common man\". This movie ranks with the Coen brothers' best, and is tied for my personal favorite with The Man Who Wasn't There.

This second part doesn't work in any way with the context of the first, and the two pieces never find an easy segue.  In fact, the overt horror of the murders and the insanity within never really makes much sense. As you can imagine, this means a film that badly derails.Now for the weirdest part - that does not make this a bad movie.  It won several awards at Cannes, and it's easy to see why:  technically, the film is virtuosic.  If you want to find witty, subtextual banter in this screenplay, start at page one and keep going.  The Coens have a gift for dialogue that makes wannabe writers celadon with envy.The acting is also fantastic.  Michael Lerner's whole career was practically created by his turn as Jack Lipnick.  John Goodman captures Charlie's good-natured everyman-ness while adding in a dash of the wounded anger bubbling under the surface.  Tony Shalhoub's studio producer is the epitome of vindictive, impatient studio politics.  John Mahoney and Judy Davis are also spot-on as the souse great writer and his tortured supportive lover. Turturro as Fink is no weak link, either.  What a cast!Nonetheless the film takes a surreal turn about 2/3 of the way through, and never recovers.  I have no idea what the Coens were trying to express in this picture.  Commentary on it indicates they were expressing their own personal hells of the writer's block they went through trying to create another film, Miller's Crossing.  But it doesn't shoehorn in here, somehow. I shouldn't have to check the trivia category on the IMDb to 'get' what is superficially a comedy.  I began to disbelieve the dreamlike nature of the proceedings, waiting for the filmmaker's other shoe to fall, to explain how this is all illusion, like the last 20 minutes of Brazil.  But it's not - or is it? Even the Coen's don't seem to know in their final scene.I guess they should have issued a booklet with commentary, definitions, and explanations.

From their heavily noir influenced debut Blood Simple (1983) right up to their most recent film, (the heavily noir influenced) The Man who wasn't there (2001) they have delighted in confusing and confounding both audiences and critics. And Barton Fink is no exception.The film comes off as an odd mix between Tim Burton's Ed Wood (1994) and Robert Altman's The Player (1991), with it's use of a small story within a larger story to look at the Hollywood cycle in detail, even if this film is much more subtle with it's \"attack\" (The Players' message of the death of the writer and creativity by the Tinnseltown machine couldn't of been clearer). But the idea of Hollywood destroying the small creator is handled very well; which brings up all kinds of questions about the shift in tone at the end of the film, as Barton's imagination spirals out of control, or does it?Beside being about film making, or more importantly film writing, the film is also highly stylised, with an odd sense of terror and paranoia about the way the Coen's (along with director of photography Roger Deakins) chooses to shoot and light the long corridors and damp, sweaty rooms of the Hotel Earl, the place where Barton takes residence. The film takes cues from Polanski, with definite nods to Repulsion and The Tenant, with its \"man in the room\" scenario. The Coen's also throw in some nods to religion, Barton being persecuted for his Jewish ness, and the nazi metaphors that crop up towards the end of the film, not to mention the whole heaven and hell theme the film seems to use.The acting and witty and clever writing are fantastic, John Turturro and John Goodman give the performances of their careers (as yet) and there is some fine support by established character actors (John Mahoney, Judy Davis, Michael Lerner, Tony Shalhoub, Steve Buscemi) all giving great performances that only help carry the film. This film is just pure genius and should not be missed if you're a fan of odd, independent cinema with a strong touch of surreal. There is just too much to talk about, the depths this film goes is extraordinary, with one of the best and strangest endings ever. The Coen's should be commended for giving their film a last line that seems to reflect everything that Barton has gone through in the last twenty minutes of the film: \"Don't be Silly\"... 10/10",

A left-wing playwright (Turturro) gets called on to write a wrestling movie after the overwhelming success of his first play. Stricken with writer's block after only one sentence typed down, Turturro befriends an insurance salesman (Goodman) who has a twisted dark side to his personality.Along the way, we encounter many colorful characters within the alternate neither world of Golden Age/pre-WWII Hollywood: W.P. Mayhew (John Mahoney), a drunken Faulknerseque writer, Audrey (Judy Davis), his long-suffering assistant and Ben Geisler (Tony Shaloub), a desperate producer.Michael Lerner really commands the screen for a brief period of time as the arrogant studio chief Jack Lipnick. Lerner's ability in switching emotions from butt-kissing pleaser to disgruntled bear is nothing short of brilliance. His performance really deserved that Academy Award nomination no doubt about it.BARTON FINK also represented a second chapter in the Coen Brothers' legacy for a reason: Roger Deakins. The British cinematographer jumped at the chance to redefine their visual style after Barry Sonnenfeld left for a spotty directorial career. Although the camera-work is atmospheric and subtle, it never gets boring and pretentious for Turturro's out-of-control mind.The overall message shows that sometimes writer's block can lead to a great movie like this.",

Maybe that is the beauty of this movie, it's different for everyone.\nThe movie starts off as described, a playwright/author with high ideals convinced to move to LA, only to experience writer's block. However, there are, to start with, small clues right from the beginning that subtly gives the impression that something in this universe is not quite in order.\nWhen we arrive at the LA hotel some of the subtly is dropped, the strange but interesting Chet the clerk that emerges from what appears to be a very deep basement, his precise check-in and conversation and asking, \"Transient or resident?\", the number of keys behind the desk, the elevator operator. This is not your usual hotel for a brilliant up & coming writer that is the toast of the town.\nWe are given more visual clues as Barton walks down the hall to his room, and the visual clues continue in his room with the focus on the picture on the wall, and later at night the wallpaper and mosquito. And then the audible clues start, the noises of other residents, specifically his next-door neighbour Charlie, who befriends Barton.\nThese visual and audible clues continue throughout the movie as Fink meets all the other characters and we get to see their peculiarities, the fun and the disturbing. Each person's character is not waisted, they all have a clue to share.\nBarton's infatuation with Audrey, his admiration of W.P., his realisations of their flaws and our first sight of mental illness, Fink's anger at Audrey and their passion that ends in shock for Barton and the viewer. The clues do not stop.\nAs we get nearer to the end the clues become louder, like the Police Officers investigating murders committed by Charlie and now the possibility of a second copycat murder. And the fire, yes, the fire that engulfs the hallway, increasing the discomfort of all but never concerning or burning. Is this representation of Hell?\nLipnick pretty much spells it out for us \"the lunatics are not going to run THIS particular asylum.\"\nThe last clue is for us on the beach, the final wrapping for the gift we have just received.\nI enjoyed he movie, I have been meaning to watch it for an exceptionally long time because of the rave reviews I've read but I felt that this movie was different, and I wasn't ready for it, until now.",

            "content": "Every once in a while, there comes a moment when something so beautiful awaits just in front of us but we are simply unable to grab it. When I have finished watching Barton fink & it was not that long either, just twenty-five minutes back. In the first ten minutes I could not figure out anything about the movie, not a clue. I could not understand why I had been waiting for Barton fink so long. Then I began questioning myself was it really worth waiting for! was it really worth downloading...but after a while, situation has changed so dramatically. In the next fifteen minutes, things started falling into places in my head & I found the inner beauty of Barton fink.When the movie. \"Barton fink\" had started to redeem the nature of its complex simplicity in me, I was stunned like I have never been before. If Lester Burnham was here, I am pretty sure he would say \"It's a great thing when you realize you still have the ability to surprise yourself\" & honestly, that was exactly what was happening inside me. To me, Barton Fink is about a person, \"Barton Fink\" who happens to be very sensible intellectual individual. He wanted to restore the beauty of simplicity of a common man's life in his creations as well as within, deep down to his soul in spite of being surrounded by the elite circle of people of 40' New York. He was quite a famous in there. He truly believed in the power of Neo-realism which was just about to knock at the door of world of movies or rather Hollywood's \"larger than life\" arena. But at the same time, he was lured by the money which was the industry offering. So, he made a eventual deal with himself to abandon art for money but inside he had a secret plan that he might be able to implement his way of thinking about reality, about common people's day to day life into the glamorous movie making process in Hollywood. He left Broadway Theater & came to Hollywood making a long term contract with a big shot production house. But quite ironically, he wasn't able to write anything what he was asked for, a movie-script about wrestling. Someone of that much potentially talented as Barton Fink should not be struggling to start off but he did. At least some adequacy of his talent should have been broken through but we see our protagonist could not deliver a single thing into papers & frustratingly ended up sticking with one line which was not even original.Why? Well there comes the beauty of this movie & so to speak the genius of Coen Brother's. They created the character of \"Barton Fink\" very unique. Here he was one soft-spoken nebbish famous writer for class who wanted to write about the common man's story but quite reluctant to listen to them whenever the opportunities came by. Somehow he was living in a fool's paradise. The initial ambivalence of his character prevented him to reach further levels though he had a good intention to reach. So, there came the much needed entry of the character,\" Charlie Meadows\" who gave him the inspiration to write his masterpiece in a very surreal manner. Charlie Meadows took Barton Fink into the grater levels as well as the movie & showed him the true meaning of life & Neo-realism, in a very brutal way though or perhaps the word brutal is very relative here because we never know what was inside in that \"BOX\". In a way, Charlie Meadows was a liberating force with a corresponding dark nuance.The ending was distinctively unusual & different from the nature of rest of the movie. In the whole movie, there was always an extreme intensity flowing beneath the ground surface where as the ending boiled down with a surprising sense of calmness & it was ambiguous too. May be the ambiguity of the ending adds a new dimension to the movie or may be it distracts audience, I really don't know but either way it makes this movie more exciting. I do not want to justify it. As Bernardo Bertolucci once said \"I leave the endings ambiguous, because that is the way life is\", perhaps life is like that only & so is my review.",

            "content": "The Coen brothers are some of the best around at delivering character driven movies. They seem to be equally adept at both comedy and drama, often throwing in more than the odd tip of the hat to classic Hollywood cinema. Barton Fink is no exception to this, but it also betrays something of a distaste for the Hollywood machine, despite an affection for some of its products.Like many of the Coens' regular stable of actors, John Turturro is an underrated performer, capable of much more than he has been given to work with in his more high profile roles of late (i.e. the Transformers films, which also featured another Coen favourite, Frances McDormand). He carries the film well in this instance, the passionate, yet naive writer he portrays leaving plenty of room for everything from clumsy awkwardness to the depths of despair. He's not the only one to shine.The supporting cast of John Goodman, Steve Buscemi, Tony Shalhoub, John Mahoney, the list goes on, are superb. Each bringing their own unique flavour to proceedings, as well as their characters providing plenty in the way of larger than life bluster. The majority serve as the antithesis to Turturro's Barton, his slightly withdrawn, almost shy disposition battered senseless by the onslaught of greedy industry types. A weak man he is not, but most certainly not accustomed to the brash insensitivity that he is subjected to. Dialogue is integral to this kind of material and, as usual with these film-makers, disappointment is not a factor that comes into play. Considering the fact that the majority of the film takes place in the halls and rooms of a low rent hotel, there is much to appreciate visually. Framing and composition are one of the movie's strong points and there's a Shining-esque dread that hangs over many of the eerier scenes. What the sets deliberately lack in vibrancy, they more than make up for in the subtle subtexts that really set the tone of the flick. This also facilitates some nice contrasts, particularly in colour, between the hotel and the more richly lit offices of the studio moguls, all blinding lights and polished glass.The plot takes some surprising turns, considering the confines in which it takes place, weaving enough intrigue into the writer's predicament to keep us from joining him in his panicked and disillusioned state. The scenes between Turturro and Goodman are particularly worthy of note in this respect and the relationship between their respective roles is pivotal to the success of the film. These moments are also where the bulk of the humour lies, though this is definitely a picture that showcases the darker side of the Coens' catalogue. These factors combined result in a flick in which fans of their work will find much to appreciate.",

The story -> A brilliant play writer Barton Fink (a perfect John Turturro) is asked to do a B-movie script in Hollywood during the 1940's (1941 to be exact). Barton checks into a strange and eerie hotel (where some of the movie's thriller-style filming comes in), where he struggles with writer's block on the script. He befriends his neighbor, salesman Charlie Meadows (a terrific John Goodman), who is Barton's only relief of stress from writer's block. When Barton is on his own, he has much running through his head as he just sits and stares at his typewriter. But the things that go on outside of his head are even stranger - like meeting an alcoholic screenwriter, a soon-to-be-suddenly murdered woman, and two mysterious detectives.The humor of the movie is brilliant, however not everyone will catch on to it. The Coen Brothers have a very different style of humor, which, unfortunately, not everyone gets - the Coens do more of the non-gross-out-thinking-man's humor.The story and acting overall is nothing short of genius.

Barton opens a Bible and looks at the book of Daniel, in which we see the following: \"And the king, Nebuchadnezzar..\" Nebuchadnezzar, that was the name of the book by W.P. Mayhew.

The movie is a journey through many aspects of the human being\u00b4s psychology, as well as the internal aspects of their souls. It is not a movie based on the \"story\". It does however have a basic plot (No spoilers, just the essential information): The main character, Barton Fink, is a writer for theater plays in New York. He suddenly gets an opportunity to write a movie script in L.A. Despite not being very excited about it, the man flies to L.A. and into a freaky hotel that might reminds us of many typical hotels from different movies. Once established in his room, he realizes that he suffers from the \"writer\u00b4s block\", but I prefer to extend that concept to the \"creator\u00b4s block\". You can take it from there because what follows is a series of very freakish events that might seem incoherent to many, yet I think they have a poetical purpose.If you\u00b4re sensitive to good direction, like me, then the movie is going to be an emotional journey that sometimes will make you laugh, sometimes it\u00b4ll touch you and sometimes it might even scare you.This movie shares many similarities in terms of style, with my other all-time favorite \"Man who wasn\u00b4t there\" (Also directed by the Coens) which holds the same qualities.If you\u00b4re exploring different waves and tendencies of the cinema, if you have no idea of who the Coen brothers are; or if you simply haven\u00b4t seen the movie, give it a try.

They are both pop entertainment - designed to give you a few hours of entertainment with characters you want to root for in situations of peril. Its like comparing Fellini's 8 1/2 with Three's Company - it just doesn't work.  That's not to say that both are not worthy of praise, but rather that they serve different functions.The function of Barton Fink is not simply to make you laugh, cry and say it was better than \"Cats\".  It provokes you as the audience.  It asks you to come along for a ride of absurdities and bizarre characters - and the payoff is great.  This is still one of my favorite movies and a source of creative inspiration for me.  It makes no compromises and presents a very unique and original vision.

Both films are similar to Vertigo in their mercurial destruction of the audience's pre-conceptions, and the spot-on performances given here by Turturro, Goodman, Lerner, Davis, and especially Tony Shalhoub enhance a daring, marvellously paced film directed with a perverse brilliance.

I'm an author, currently a novelist, with a casual interest in films about writers, \"casual\" because I have not yet found one that represents my own experience. For example, I have never experienced writer's block. Further I don't believe it exists, except as a hackneyed trope in fiction and film, or as laziness or procrastination in real life. Were I so fortunate as to be charged with writing a Hollywood film script about wrestling for Wallace Beery, I know I could do it. I realise that's partly what the film Barton Fink is about. Barton ends up writing what he calls his greatest work, not the B-picture script Mr. Lipnick demanded. What prompted me to write this review was another aspect of Joel and Ethan Coen's representation of the playwright turned screenwriter. I've been an author for forty-five years. Starting out, I wrote on a manual typewriter much like the machine Barton has in 1941. Typewriters were noisy. Noise is a central trope in the film. Barton makes a noise complaint at the start and Charlie Meadows reminds him of it at the climax. Yet the Coens make no reference to the noise Barton's typewriter would produce in the hotel. If Barton can hear Charlie moaning in the next room, wouldn't he or other guests be disturbed by the noise of the typewriter? The hotel has paper thin walls, after all. The Coens certainly draw attention twice to the noise of the typewriter Ben Geisler's secretary is tapping away at, each time hinting at first the hands at the keyboard are Barton's. Why does Barton Fink's typewriter not produce the same noise? Because Barton Fink has writer's block? Or because the character is merely the stereotype of a writer? At first he cannot write. He struggles. Then he can write. But since it is a Coen film, he ends up producing the wrong script.",

Hell is first the literary scene in New York, then Hotel California (unpeeling wallpaper, the living dead as help), writer's block, a movie studio mogul, a drunken Fitzgerald-type novelist, murder, the dance floor, a blazing inferno (starring John Goodman as the devil - he even wrestles!) and finally Califonia and the beach itself. Throughout the film our attention is drawn to a picture on the hotel room wall, of a girl in a bikini looking out to the ocean. Turturro/Fink staggers onto the beach with a box probably containing the severed head of a woman. He meets a pretty girl and asks her if she is in pictures, which she denies. The last frame is a real life reproduction of the picture in his room. California is the last stage of hell, at least for a New York writer who is so wrapped up in his own mind that, as John Goodman tells him, he never listens.",

            "review_title": "The Coen's personal hell",
            "content": "A metaphor for hell, Barton Fink (Joel Coen, 1991) uses the landscape of Hollywood in the 1940s to trace the deterioration of a Broadway writer. Through visual and narrative elements, the Coens relay this message to us from the film's onset.The first image the audience sees is of the red, flame-like wallpaper of the Hotel Earle.  Though we do not at first know the significance of this textured background for the opening credits, we quickly recall it as we see it through Fink's eyes when he is typing at his desk.  Our attention is redirected to the wallpaper at several other moments in the film, as it seems to keep falling off the wall.  The connection between the wallpaper and Charlie Meadows (aka Carl Mundt) is drawn when the same white viscous substance drips from both his ear and the wall.  And the wallpaper shows its function as a foreshadowing device when the walls erupt into flame during Charlie's final entrance. That the walls of the Hotel Earle are covered either symbolically or literally in flames is only one of many indicators of its symbolism.  On his initial entry into the hotel, Fink is greeted by the bellhop Chet (played by the deathly pale Steve Buscemi), who ascends, as if from the underworld, from a trap door behind the front desk.  Fink is also asked to sign his name to the registry.  This can be likened to signing your life away to the devil through selling your soul.  Also, the most blatant of references is the location of Fink's room on the sixth floor.  On the ride up to his floor in the red hued elevator, Barton and Pete make mention of the number six in conversation three times.The Biblical references are also part of one of the elevator rides.Barton Fink: Have you read the Bible, Pete? Pete: Holy Bible? Barton Fink: Yeah. Pete: Yeah, I think so. Anyway, I've heard about it.This furthers the notion that members of the Hotel Earle residential population and staff know very little of the ways of God and good. Additionally, we have W.P. Mayhew's book (which we later find was really penned by Audrey), Nebuchadnezzar, introduced as a reference.  We see the king's name again in the Bible that Fink finds and reads in his desk drawer. Appropriately, the verse he reads, Daniel 3:20, posits Fink as the interpreter of `living men.'  `As for me, this mystery has been revealed to me, not because I have greater wisdom than other living men, but so that you, O King, may know the interpretation and that you may understand what went through your mind.' (New International Version)  As Fink turns to the beginning of the Bible, we see the setting of his script under Genesis 1:1.From the film's beginning, Fink has been pegged as a god of sorts.  As the author of the highly acclaimed Broadway production at the film's beginning, he is the man behind the scenes orchestrating the action, as some believe that God manipulates the people on this earth.  That Fink's text becomes part of the Bible continues thought in this vein.  Fink attempts to be a man who represents the `common man.'  This idea is strung throughout the narrative.  When Fink shows concern to Garland about leaving Broadway for Hollywood, Garland says, `The common man will still be here when you get back.'  Later, while explaining his profession to Meadows, Fink says that he tries to `forge something real out of everyday experience' and write about `the average working stiff, the common man.'  When on Earth, Jesus attempted to be `one of us' as well.  But, as we see in Fink's case, in putting himself out to be representative of an entire group of people, he necessarily becomes or tries to become better than the common man for who he speaks.  This is precisely why Meadows claims to punish him.  At the film's beginning, Meadows attempts to tell Fink the stories that he claims to want to relay to his audiences, but Fink won't listen.  `You think I mad your life hell?' Meadows asks Fink, `You're just a tourist with a typewriter. I live here.'  Though it seems as if Meadows, who may represent the devil or just one of his minions, is letting Fink leave, we realize after his meeting with Jack Lipnick that he will be forced to stay until his contract expires. Neither the audience nor Fink seems to be aware of when this will occur. We are left in as hopeless a place as Fink \u0096 a place where the devil wins in the end, not a comforting notion.Though the narrative provides a direct link to the metaphor, so too does the visual aspect of the film.  The use of aerial shots shows the trapped nature of the person in the frame \u0096 Barton Fink.  The first aerial shot, though it doesn't include Fink, is of the registry book spinning.  This spiraling motion of the book foreshadows the eventual downward spiral of Fink himself. We see Fink from above many times throughout the film.  First, we see him pinned by Meadows after his wrestling demonstration.  We see several similar shots of Fink in bed sleeping.  After Fink awakens to find Audrey dead, he runs into the bathroom where we get another aerial shot.As Fink struggles to write `simple morality tales,' we see him fall to his demise.  The more good he tries to put into the world, the more evil he encounters.  But, as Audrey tries to tell him, ` you don't have to type your soul into it.'  This film not only comments on the ruthless nature of the Hollywood film industry, but is also purported to represent the specific struggles of the Coens, who wrote this script while experiencing writer's block during the writing of their 1990 film Miller's Crossing.",

I thought if I watched it closely enough I would \"get it\", but understanding everything was never the purpose here and I'm fine with that. When they brought in the two detectives to investigate a murder it started to seem like they were piling things on to intentionally obfuscate the genre and meaning of the movie, but they didn't do it in a way that seemed smarmy & egocentric like Lynch's Mulholland Drive did. I found Goodman to be firmly believable the entire way through his character arc and liked him a lot better here than I did in his movie from a couple years later, Born Yesterday.",

            "content": "A mind bending journey into the mind of a screenwriter.\n\nJoel Coen's neo-noir, psychological drama, black comedy Barton Fink (1991) contains multitudes of ideas, styles, and entertainment. I found Barton Fink to be captivating in director Joel Coen's eerie atmosphere and haunting depiction of Hollywood. John Turturro is both pathetically sad as a narcissist scriptwriter as well as funnily naive and how out of his element he constantly is in every scene. You believe Barton Fink is losing his mind due to stress, anxieties, and deadlines. I must mention the unforgettable force of nature that is John Goodman. His hardy and hearty Charlie Meadows. Goodman delivers lines like Joel Coen is holding a gun to his head with a particularly brilliant display of fearsome dramatic acting in the finale.\n\nJoel Coen's direction is dark and serious for The Coen Brothers, but he never loses focus on portraying old Hollywood. He grips you with a character study of a loser writer and all the emotionally broken people around Hollywood in similar situations. Judy Davis' frustrated and loveless Audrey Taylor is as tragic as John Mahoney's drunken writing legend W.P. Mayhew was wasting his writing talents within a bottle. Michael Lerner's screaming studio head Jack Lipnick is a riot as he desperately tries to pull a script out of Barton Fink with his raw charisma and supportive front. Jon Polito's Lou Breeze is dehumanized into being a loyal lackey to Lipnick with no dignity as a man or creative. Tony Shalhoub's producer Ben Geisler thinks he knows how to run things, but he's still subservient to Lipnick too. Even Steve Buscemi's content hotel concierge and bellboy Chet only lives to serve Hollywood types like Barton Fink.\n\nRoger Deakins' cinematography captures the hopelessness creatives feel in movie making with touching close-up shots to striking dream sequences like wide shots like the flaming hotel hallway in Barton Fink's unreal finale. Barton Fink is as well shot as Miller's Crossing or Fargo in all honesty. Joel Coen and Ethan Coen's editing skills are as sharp as ever with a steady pacing that draws you into the mad world of moviemaking for 117 chilling minutes.\n\nJoel and Ethan Coen's writing contains all manner of literary references and allusions to real writers or Hollywood figures. Barton Fink is fascinating as on one hand it's about the struggles of aspiring writers to overcome writer's block, find inspiration, and create something new and authentic, while being commercially successful in Hollywood's stifling corporate environment, wherein you are just another writer to them. Dennis Gassner's grimey production design shows how ugly and gross L.A. looks in his wretched set designs, while Carter Burwell's haunting score rises to the insanity of the filmmaking world with melodic shotgun blasts of sound.\n\nOn the other hand, Barton Fink is about how maddening writer's block and living in L.A. can be for young writers, especially in the brutally honest and cutthroat world of Hollywood. Thus, Barton Fink accomplishes the drama of showing how egotistical writers can be who are not speakers of their generation, nor voices of the common man and how crushing that realization can be for the author. In addition to the soul crushing world of Hollywood, Barton Fink parodies and satirizes how absurd writing for Hollywood is as Barton is ushered around from producer to studio head with no direction or real creative support. \n\nSo, Barton Fink ends up hilariously satirizing both writers and studio figures in serious critiques of how toxic this environment is for creatives, while remaining a downright delightful black comedy of Hollywood's absurdities.",

            "content": "In true Coen Brothers fashion, we get a film with fantastic characters and a strange, sometimes bizarre, plot \u2014 we also get John Goodman, John Turturro, and Steve Buscemi. Barton Fink follows Barton Fink (Turturro), an NYC playwright who takes a job in L.A. to write (lucrative) B-Movie scripts. When Barton arrives in L.A., it's as if he enters a new world, entirely. I'm a sucker for creepy, art-deco styled hotels \u2014 which are abundant in the city of angels \u2014 but it's more than just the lodging here that makes the city interesting. Every character Barton meets is fast-talking, charismatic, or just a little off, or a combination of two or three. In this area, I especially enjoyed Mr. Lipnick (Michael Lerner), Mr. Geiser (Tony Shalhoub), Detective Mastrionatti (Richard Portnow), Detective Deutsch (Christopher Murney), Goodman as Charlie and, although only in a few scenes, Buscemi as Chet. Early in the film, Barton passionately expels the virtues of \"the common man\" while continuing to cut off Charlie \u2014 a traveling insurance salesman, the epitome of the 1940s \"common man\" \u2014 from sharing \"some stories\". I think the film would've benefitted more from exploring this angle and its relevance to today's growing disdain for \"coastal elites\" who not only believe they know better than everyone else, but know better for everyone else. While I knew something was off with Charlie pretty early on, I didn't like the direction of the plot (not really a twist) or the ending. The ambiguous ending gives hard Hotel California \"you can check out any time you like, but you can never leave\" vibes, especially paired with Lipnick's perpetual contract (this is illegal btw, but I won't let my lawyer show) and the girl on the beach, but extended to all of Los Angeles. Barton Fink has fantastic camerawork and a very cool scene concerning the Bible. It also has one of my favorite lines in cinema: \"Jesus, throw a rock in here and you'll hit [a writer]. And do me a favor, Fink, throw it hard.\" (As I writer, I'm allowed to say this.) I'd bet if you asked a cinephile to name favorite Coen Brothers' movies, Barton Fink wouldn't even make the top 5\u20137, but it's a wonderful film only a solid ending away from cracking the (90)s.",

            "content": "John Turturro has had the strangest career. He has substantial roles in iconic films that established cinema giants like Spike Lee and the Coen Brothers, but cut to 20 years later he's mostly known for playing the most annoying character in film history in Michael Bay's Transformers movies (and probably cashed his biggest paycheck from those, as well). He and John Goodman are polar opposites in terms of career progression as character actors. But Barton Fink has got to be his career defining performance: a morbidly comic search for meaning, artistic expression, romantic satisfaction, and security that is jam-packed full of allegory and symbolism that functions largely due to the manic nervousness that Turturro brings to the character. It's almost a shame that he has to share the screen with Goodman, who is often completely absorbing and fantastic, taking attention away from the lead's contributions at times (not that removing Goodman from the film would actually be a good idea). The carciatures of the Hollywood stereotypes, from the studio executive with a flair for fast-talking and flash, to the laconic, Bogart-esque cops full of anachronistic quips, the film operates as a wonderful criticism of the peculirites of Hollywood, which made it a shoe-in for critical uccess that it still enjoys. The final half-hour, with its surreal imagery and wide range of interpretations, is entirely unexpected and wonderful. Expanding the Coenverse, maybe this provides a bit of background as to where Walter Sobchak sources his ready-made supply of body parts. (4.5/5)",

He made friends with his neighbor and Barton's stories become inspired after Charlie's true identity is revealed and things don't go as expected when he finishes due to the comeuppance done to him by charlie. A shot of interest is from 1:08:00-1:10:10 because it makes you think why did the coens zoom into the sink drain and it was a foreshadow of what was going to occur as you see later in the clip what the screams might have been. That clip is one of the most interesting of the most. I rate Barton Fink a 4 because it did have an impactful theme and was really entertaining. The way the Coen brothers had their character choice was great because it really fit them. Towards the end where charlie burns the floor, he and Barton stayed on showed condescension he had on Barton. The way they used to foreshadow and a lot of interesting factors like the zoom in to the drain or the chick from the poster in the room appearing at the end was great.",

Barton's work is all about the common man, but the story takes a turn when he finds himself checked into a hotel where he meets his new friend Charlie and seems to be incapable of recognizing the common man. The best part of this film is Baton's multiple encounters with W.P. (a drunk) and his wife Audrey, but especially Audrey and her dead body which is where we see a huge shift in the plot. W.P. is the writer Barton doesn't want to become, but that can be easily contradicted because W.P. doesn't listen due to his drunk behavior and Barton doesn't listen due to the intoxication of his own thoughts and this gets Barton into lots of conflicting trouble.",

Next they were close starting friends until later on found the truth about Charlie making Barton go out of his mind of not knowing what to do with himself all alone because he going through bad times and not Barton aware of it what really going on. My favorite part is when Charlie told Barton that he is leaving Los Angeles to New York and Barton beseech him to stay that he is the only person he knows that can help him through this time and Charlies telling him it's all going to be okay and that he got this, don't talk to anybody. I love this part because Charlie as the character is stalwart  and apoplectic  in away by seeing the good for Barton by giving him idea by thinking of story and stilling knowing what going on but have that bond making sure he okay at the same time end of the film.",

The film revolves around this writer named Barton Fink who made it to LA too write his first film of wrestling, after arriving Barton is stationed in this dilapidated hotel that brought many problems. Barton's boss Jack Lipnick acts rather bipolar or condescension, after the first few scenes in the hotel Barton meets his neighbor Charlie which already gave me bad vibes at the beginning later on they became the best of friends. When an unexpected death happens in Bartons room lingering questions start to be solved like how Charlie is Mad Man Munt a serial killer and burns down the hotel in the end but leaves Barton alive, finally finishing Bartons script after many writers block it is neglected by Lipnick and the movie then comes to an end. This film was pretty slow and unappealing to me which is a reason why its getting the rating that I stated, one of the interesting scenes is when Charlie finally reveals himself at the somewhat of the end of the film and kills the 2 detectives that had Barton at questioning. This was the start of the action that would later come and this is why it's an important scene and an interesting one. I suggest this movie to anyone who likes interesting and unexpected plots, if this applies too you then Barton Fink is the film for you!",

            "content": "The film, Barton Fink follows around a New York play writer and creator named Barton Fink. After one of his new plays debut he is offered a contract to write movies at Capital Pictures in Los Angeles. However, when he is trying to write his script based off his assignment, he suffers writer's block and no matter what he tries to do in his hotel room, he can't write. During this period at the hotel, we are introduced to Fink's neighbor named Charlie. Charlie sees that Barton has writer's block and does whatever he can to help Barton. From teaching him wrestling to giving him life advice, Charlie becomes a friend to Barton. After meeting his writing idol and his secretary, Barton goes to them for any work-related need but still continues to struggle putting his story together. After a very strange turn of events, Barton has to deal with inner challenges as he tries to write the perfect script to be used in the pictures. \n\n     My favorite scene from the movie begins at 1:39:27 when two detectives are looking throughout the hotel and interrogating Barton to find Charlie, and Charlie appears from the elevator and a chase scene in a way begins. The reason why this is my favorite scene from the movie is because of how it reminds me of my favorite scene from Miller's Crossing. My favorite scene from Miller's Crossing is when Leo single-handedly took down two members of Caspar's gang. This scene satirizes one of the best parts of Leo's scene which was the fire, however it is used in different ways. In Miller's Crossing, the fire is used as a sign for Leo to know that something is wrong versus in Barton Fink, the fire is used as a sign of magical realism. The fire in the background when Charlie starts charging the detectives with the gun and it's even more well used because as Charlie gets more intense and angry the fire gets larger and grows rapidly. As Charlie kills both detectives not only as a way to protect himself, but I think he risks turning himself in for Barton, which is why I enjoy this scene more. This hidden meaning that Charlie comes back to kill the detectives not only for himself but to save the reputation of Barton Fink, because any association between the two of them could be the end of Barton's career. This also shows how much Barton means to Charlie because despite the fact that Barton never truly listens to Charlie, those interactions meant a lot to him and he was ready to do anything for his friend, which is why this scene is both powerful and my favorite, because you don't see a relationship like this anymore in 2020 or in movies. \n\n\tI would give this movie a 3 out of 5 overall. The reason I would give this movie a 3 star rating because there were multiple scenes that I enjoyed a lot and had lots of deep hidden meanings that were powerful, but overall the plot line was very confusing. Like I said, there were some powerful hidden meanings, like no matter who you are in life or what you do, there will always be someone there for you, or it brings up the daunting paradox, that in your dream career, there are going to be times when you fail. Like I said before when talking about my favorite scene, when Charlie took on those two detectives or when Charlie and Barton were debating on what to do with the dead body of Audrey and what their story on what happened to her should be. Besides these two scenes there were a lot of confusing plot points, such as the cut to Barton celebrating and dancing happily at the USO Party. The reason why it was so confusing because it was a quick cut from a shot of Barton using the tears and death of his new lover to write his script for his movie. What makes it so confusing is that we the audience have no idea how'd he got invited to that party and why he is so happy after a death so close to him. I know most people who've gotten big projects completed shortly after a death, but they were still completely upset. The other main confusing scene, is why did Barton go to the beach for the final scene of the movie? We never saw Barton go to the beach or talk about going to the beach, the only beach related thing we the audience see is the postcard in his hotel room and the transition of the waves crashing on a rock on the beach. So to me it was really confusing, and unlike the first three films of the Coen Brothers, in which their hidden meanings were a little more clear and they didn't have any mystery scenes that were out of nowhere. The fact that they put these in just blurred the theme of the film and the entire plot of the film because if you end on a scene with no previous context the audience, including myself, are left to wonder, what just happened, in a confusing way. And in my opinion, the only time to say what just happened is after an epic action movie where it had a major plot twist, not a confusing ending, which is why I would give this movie a 3 out of 5.",

As like the man behind its scene. He is great but his prowess turns to hell. It's a plain character. There is so much symbolism in this film. Ambiguity at the end of the film.

            "content": "Barton Fink remains a masterpiece as far as filmmaking & narrative conventions go. Just as entertaining and unmistakably crafted with ambitions not just far higher than what could have been, \"good enough,\" for mainstream audiences or Studio executives...but also with the signature Coen Bros. feeling in every moment of every scene, every line of dialogue and the sets used to Kubrickian levels of perfection. \n  \nNo character has a small part, no extras are considered extras - as we've seen over the past few decades, the Coen Brothers ALWAYS make damn sure to pay just as much attention to detail (again just as Kubrick made The Shining the best horror film ever made by making such elaborate sets that had to be as close to the real fictional Overlook setting in the story). This is how their films hook you in with a sense of unique immersion, where we all feel personally served a special production that caters to our own idiosyncrasies. They do this by writing endless variations of eccentric main characters that we love to watch without ever stopping to wonder if we should be rooting for them, hoping they aren't kept from getting what their seek in whatever twisted yet morbidly accurate representation of the real world & our own societies they spiral around in throughout the whole film, usually running in place more often than not. \n   \nJohn Ford was amazing. Billy Wilder is one of the best directors ever. Period. But even those legendary filmmakers could never make movies that satisfy the audience completely in the first hour without even advancing the plot beyond the first act, and then using the second hour to treat you to a number cleverly sharp turns to disorient you, all before high tailing it to the credits in a comedy of errors - quite literally - where the stakes are always shuffling around for every face still on screen. Some get presented as the unlikely hero for an hour, but then they get killed with a hammer off screen in the final 30 seconds and we only hear that's what happened to them through a lighting fast, hysterically delivered exposition between characters we likely have no connection to at all until that moment. (Burn After Reading.) \n  \nLife is absurd. So their movies don't just operate with absurd stories. They play it honest and true to reality. The characters always seem like cartoon personalities, quirky for comedic purposes, and then suddenly one of them says something they shouldn't have & a mob boss orders the protagonist to execute the guy who is also a friend of the protagonist, resulting in a sharp turn from quirky comic relief B role performance to suddenly the most gut wrenching, heart pounding scene in their entire filmography, as Tuturro's big mouthed chatterbox uses around all five minutes of a single tracking shot to talk his way out of being hit by this mob enforcer who, again, is a guy he's always known and has no personal issues with. These all amount to cinematic masterpieces as isolated scenes in their body of work but also serve as small examples to prove that every scene in each of their films is loaded with significance, as well as being told in different ways that you've likely never seen done before until now. \n  \nBarton Fink is just as insane as the Big Lebowski, but the former has very believably serious stakes for the central character who wants to prove himself a writer by moving to Hollywood after succeeding on Broadway already. Lebowski is literally about a man child stoner who likes to go bowling, and one day some people think he's another guy but the same last name creates confusion - so for a few hours we watch Jeff Bridges & John Goodman go vigilante in LA to get justice after some henchmen urinated on the wrong Lebowski's (Bridges) area rug in a modest low income housing apartment...you see how these are weird in different ways, and neither would sound amazing if you hadn't seen trailers or known who the Coens were etc. But I found out I DID care enough to watch Jeff Bridges bowl, drink, take some drugs, cremate his bowling buddy who never shut the fuck up, and then there's Tara Reid's offer to blow him for cash, a butler played by a late great Hollywood megastar of an actor, fight some European nihilists who emphatically remind everyone they care about nozing!!! They eat in n out burger, Goodman draws his old Desert Storm service pistol on a registered sex offender/pedophile IN A BOWLING ALLEY, (but not because the guy is a sex offender; he's upset they scheduling of their tournament doesn't respect his recently adopted Jewish traditions that his ex wife supposedly once cared about...?).  \n  \nAND YET ALL OF THESE COEN FILMS IVE MENTIONED ARE BETTER THAN SOME GREAT DIRECTOR'S BEST WORK. I don't think James Cameron has ever made a film as good as a Coen Bros flick, and if he did, the only argument would be for Aliens. Everything else is just trash by comparison, (and a lot of Cameron's stuff is trash even without comparing it to other people's  work. Like, it's criminal how much he's touted by the Academy for such awful films when nominated next to actually great cinema. Good Will Hunting lost Best Picture because James Cameron filmed a boat sinking for 3 hours that also had the fake Hollywood cheese lovestory somehow happen in 3 hours during a life or death crisis...don't get my started on The Abyss. It never looked good, it's awful, and Avatar looks so pathetically bad for how hard it wants to impress you with its visual neon Ferngully narrative. Sorry, James Cameron is - at best - a lower tier/Michael Bay level director who is also an asshole & no actors are willing to work with him based on his reputation & shitty films.) \n  \nBut Coen Bros? They're the anti-Cameron. Go go go!",

And that's really what Barton Fink is about, a writer who can't figure out his story. Just the fact that this seemingly small problem is what this epic film centers around is mind blowing in and of itself. You think you know what's going on when you really don't, your mind wanders off and creates these complex hypotheticals. As the story unfolds, you start crossing off your long list of guesses until you are left clueless for about 2 minutes, then it suddenly clicks.\n\nIf I were to describe this film with one word it would be eerie. From the hotel staff to the tearing wall paper to Charlie's weird patterns of speech, the movie is just plain eerie; and this is what makes it so captivating. Everytime Barton struggles to start writing his opening words, you feel as if there is a heavy weight attached to your heart and it's you who can't put ink to paper. The film starts by making you feel uncomfortable at first, then clueless, and finally leaves you astonished.\n\nTurturro and Goodman are as compatible of a pair as the Coen brothers; it really is these two pairings that carry the film. \n\nIf you are a lover of dramadies (drama comedies) give this a watch. If you are a lover of film, watch this. If you've got nothing to do on a Friday night take out that large bucket of rocky road ice cream, snuggle up, and enjoy the show.",

In 1991 they treated us to Barton Fink a story revolving around the titular character. Fink is a successful playwright from New York and he is one day given an offer from Hollywood to be paid a thousand dollars each week for writing scripts. Fink makes his way out and stays at a strange hotel. The movie showcases barton's constant writers block as he thinks about the essence of theater, life and the crazy people he meets in out west.\nThe coen brothers always have a bizarre but uniquely funny touch to their films. The film is highly unusual but for some reason it grabbed me enough for me to continue watching all the way through. this story was scripted like something out of a woody allen film but again they add their own touch to it. it does make you think about the different kind of writers in Hollywood and how certain events can shape their screenwriter minds.\nI rather enjoyed this character Barton Fink. John Turturro did an excellent job with this unsual character. I couldn't help but laugh so much at this man's hair at was so weird. Fink is a man that cares deeply about the essence of theater and acting and finds himself fighting against the ways of Hollywood and its effect on the common man. jack lerner was the best part of the film. If one finds himself bored within the first few minutes lerner's jack lipnick will wake you the hell up! so much vibrance and hilarity it is sensational! John goodman did a fine job here as yet another strange character with slim to no eyebrows. his chemistry with turturro is uncanny every scene they nailed together even the crazy climax of the film\nthat painting is so prominent in the film its almost like another character. same with all of the sounds in the film there is such a heavy reliance on the element of visual painting and sound. very well composed score. the cinematography was great as well. the long shots of the hallway and closeups of barton were exquisitely done.\n\tBarton Fink is a definitely vintage coen brothers and anyone who is a fan of their work will find this to be tremendous.",

Barton checks into a hotel for a little privacy, and finds that he is frequently distracted by flies buzzing around his room, the constant peeling wallpaper, and most importantly: an extremely loud neighbour who can't seem to leave him alone. This is one of the Coen Brothers' more underrated films that sadly doesn't get talked about enough, and without spoiling anything, this film goes to some dark places in very unexpected ways with multiple ways to interpret the events that take place. The film stars Coen regulars such as John Turturro, John Goodman, and Steve Buscemi; with Turturro and Goodman giving stellar performances as Barton and the neighbour respectively. Their interactions begin innocent-enough; Barton fascinated by his blue-collar tales of being a traveling insurance salesman, but things take a sharp turn when we realize that Goodman's character is not who he says he is. This film is filled to the brim with visual and metaphorical symbolism, with an ending that still divides critics as to the true meaning. It's very difficult to discuss this film without spoiling the experience, so I will simply end by recommending this film highly for Coen Brothers completionists and for fans of the principle actors' work!",

In Fink's Hollywood, talented writers are taken in, chewed up, and spit out until they resemble very little of what made them good in the first place. It's also incredibly allegorical, referencing a number of biblical people and themes. Like most Coen movies, the writing is superb, with even the side players getting fleshed out. The Coens know how to create an entire world for their characters to play off of. The movie is certainly a lot to unpack and I don't think the Coens would have it any other way.

Sadly, it doesn't hold to that simple story. It is overloaded with symbolic gobbledygook that makes this movie nearly intolerable for me. I don't like when I have to do homework and analyze a film in order to fathom the writers' intentions, in fact I hate it. Some slight symbolism that might add some depth to the story when you look more closely is a fine thing to insert into a film, and it might even make it a more intelligent movie which I would appreciate. However Barton Fink wanders into a strange fantastical dimension where the laws of physics stop applying and people start saying things that make no sense, and suddenly I'm sitting there saying \"What in the world is happening right now?!\" It also kind of felt like the film was written and created just to appeal to the Hollywood artsy-fartsy crowd. It was so loaded with \"inside jokes\" that I could see other creative types just lapping it up but it sails right over my head. I didn't hate Barton Fink because, despite the rampant symbolic mumbo-jumbo, it did have a coherent story that I found entertaining at times.

            "content": "Review In A Nutshell:\n\nThere is something about films exploring about the passions of an artist, placing in situations that would challenge them and hopefully show their true potential. Barton Fink achieves similarly to what David Lynch has brought for Mulholland Drive; we are treated to a dedicated and brilliant artist to a world that is first unknown to them, and as their stay in sunny Los Angeles lengthens, they start to see sides of not just the environment but also of themselves that was never shown before. In Barton Fink, directed by the Coen Brothers, it is much more tamed and focused as compared to Lynch's, but throughout it remains surreal and terrifying.\n\nHollywood has been attacked by many filmmakers, as the heart of artistic destruction. They say this is the place where it lures the hopeful minds of the outside world and once they entice you close enough; they would devour everything that you once stood for and eventually become an empty vessel to meet their corporate desires. What I just said is no doubt an exaggeration of the real thing, but it is nevertheless real; there is this sense of restriction when watching the product of a Hollywood film as compared to someone who produced it outside the major studios, as creative control is always present in regards to the latter. Barton Fink's journey is definitely an interesting one and the way the Coen brothers depict this man's internal struggle for wanting to create something profound but also to meet the demands of his employers is terrifyingly real, and it does so without resorting to melodrama, but instead uses a hint of dark humour to create the exaggerations in its plot. The scenes that sticks on my mind when recalling the film, are the ones that involve Barton sitting across from his employer as these moments are the ones that represent the show business so well; the feeling of manipulation and artificial sincerity is filled during these scenes and through that I was able to really engage with the film.\n\nMy core issue with the film is with the dire twist that pops up in the middle of the film, as though it drove the plot forward and elevated its pacing, I did however find it to be too exaggerated and at the moment thematically confusing. I wasn't able to pick on the intentions behind it and the complete change in perspective towards one of the characters in the film, did throw me off with the film's flow. It is far from being completely ridiculous or abysmal, as one can feel the Coen brothers trying to speak something intellectually penetrating but one does need all the pieces, which I was unable to completely grasp onto during the initial experience, in order to fully appreciate it.\n\nJohn Turturro's performance in this film was the best I have seen from the actor, and has completely changed my view of him. I used to only connect his acting work with the low-brow films of the Transformers franchise and Don't Mess With The Zohan, but after seeing him in films like Miller's Crossing and Barton Fink, it shows that even some of the most sell-out or worst of actors in the mainstream Hollywood business have films that showed a sense of integrity towards their craft. John Goodman has yet to disappoint me in any films he has worked on, and my adoration for him could be traced back to the lesser-known animation films he has done like The Emperor's New Groove. Goodman brings that presence in the room, and I say not just in regards to his physical stature, there is also emotional depth to his performance that could be felt throughout the film. The Coen brothers does not create obvious shots that would shape its characters, a lot of the time the camera is quite distant, especially the scenes between Turturro and Goodman, and through those there is subtle tension growing and at times we don't notice it because we are concerned with the words being spoken to create understanding rather than on what we see.\n\nBarton Fink on paper seems like a straight forward drama, but under the direction of the Coen brothers, it becomes much more; there is a sense of passion to its characters, subjects, and ideas, and told so in a way that is surreal and profound; pushing the boundaries of the audience's expectations. I hope the next film I see from the brothers would be as great as what I have just experienced.",

I feel it's irresponsible to leave interesting circumstances unanswered, to create a distorted film and hide behind the concept of calling it an art is a cheap shot of making an entertainment film.\nThe Coen Brother's \"A Serious Man\" however, is an exception because the movie itself was about the frustration of unanswered events and questioning coincidentally unlucky circumstances. \nThis movie however is more or less pointless! other than that, GREAT and talented ACTING!",

The film stars John Turturro, John Goodman, Judy Davis, Michael Lerner, Jon Polito, and Steve Buscemi.\r\n\r\nBarton Fink (Turturro) is a writer living in New York City. He is a play write who has just received lots of praise for his new play. An offer comes to him to come down to Los Angelis to write for a film making company. While experiencing writers block, Fink receives a knock at his apartment door. Behind it stands his new neighbor, Charlie Meadows (Goodman), a salesman. The two of them hit it off pretty well. Fink is the upstate writer with lots of awards and praise, Charlie is the average every man who lives simply. As Barton struggles to write his script, Charlie keeps paying him visits. They sit and talk about their lives. Unknown to Barton is a\u00c2\u00a0terrible shocking truth.\r\n\r\nJohn Turturro and John Goodman are perfect in this film. The two of them have this chemistry that just lights you on fire. Their scenes together are priceless fun. That being said, the performances in this are all fantastic. The characters are quirky and very well written, as all Coen characters are. The film is wonderfully shot by Rodger Deakins. Each shot is inventive and looks good. The film is full to the brim of great clever humor, given to us by our leads. There's nothing I didn't like about this movie. It's perfect.\r\n\r\n\"Barton Fink'' is a bizarrely fantastic Coen brothers film. It's one of their best. The characters are great, the writing is phenomenal, the cinematography is sharp, the acting is superb, and it has an interesting ending. The film is driven by Goodman and Turturro's brilliant chemistry and performances, and also driven by masterful direction from Joel and Ethan Coen.",

Nevertheless, its creative use of twisted imagery and unnerving atmosphere also makes this film quite possibly the darkest vision the Coens ever came up with. Yet, the screenplay also makes use of some quirky sense of humour that makes it delightful while it is also able to distinguish itself among the numerous other films dealing with the theme of the writer's block.

The script is clever, and the plot is very simple, so what is required to make it work is good direction, a creative film style and a talented cast.\n\nBarton Fink is bereft of none of these things, and proves to be an Academy Award nominated artistic breakthrough for The Coen Brothers.\nWritten over the timespan of 3 weeks, Barton Fink features an insightful script which delves into the depth of characters faced with writers block, shame and the simple disrespect of being a human being. It conveys these messages by taking its basic plot and fulling it with in depth dynamics from a meaningful script which gives plenty of character insight and depth to the figures on screen, and it makes Barton Fink an excellent display of the human mind. \nAnd full of the stylistic direction that The Coen Brothers always manage to supply, Barton Fink is a simple artistic piece which benefits from their skills as filmmakers.\nAnd bravado performances keep it alive.\nAs an embodiment of the writers block the directors were faced with whilst writing Miller's Crossing, John Tuturro gives an excellent lead performance as a deep and meaningful writer faced in a challenging world full of fears. He constantly has a facial expression that makes it look like he is in serious thought and developing a great idea for his script, yet balancing it with a sense of uncertainty. His embodiment of The Coen Brothers themselves is a powerful performance, one of his career's best.\nBut John Goodman completely steals the screen in Barton Fink. His portrayal of a psychologically tormented everyman pushed over the edge by society is so organic and ripe with John Goodman's talent for aggression and deep meaning in line delivery. His passion as an actor is on full display in Barton Fink, and it's wonderful to behold as some of his finest effort.\nMichael Lerner was also good although needing more screen time, and John Mahoney supplied a genial presence and strong performance\nSteve Buscemi was also good, and Jon Polito was talented as always.\n\nSo Barton Fink proves to be a well constructed and cleverly written piece which shows off the fact that even in the difficult situation of writers block, The Coen Brothers can craft an excellent film.",

Each of their films are unique in their own way and this is very much the case with this impressive movie. A talented Playwright goes to Hollywood to start work on his first screenplay, and he discovers that Hollywood is much harder than what he thought it was going to be. The portrayal of Barton Fink is immaculate in the hands of actor John Torturro, who has done some impressive work with the Coens since. With this film, he really displays the talent that he uses to great advantage, and you are simply captivated by his performance.  This is a superb drama film that is among their best piece of work. With a brilliant cast at their disposal, and a well written script, Barton Fink is a must watch for viewers that enjoy a compelling dramatic work. Barton Fink isn't a perfect film, but nonetheless it is a fine example of why the Coen Brothers are terrific filmmakers who can tell an engaging story. Barton Fink is a well crafted picture that showcases great talent on-screen and it is a film that stands out among the Coen Brothers strongest efforts. That is a strong statement, because each of their efforts are well executed, well thought out storylines and effective performances that really make their work stand out among other directors. I really enjoyed the film, and thought that the cast and story were quite wonderful, and it could have been better in some areas, but overall this is yet another solid piece of cinema from two directors who know how to spin a terrific yarn.",

There are so many interesting things to say about this film. Instead of saying all of them I'll focus specifically on the analysis I concocted so that I might not be a repetitive reviewer.\n\nMy opinion is that this film is essentially a Flannery O'Connor short story, set in California rather than the South. 95% (no that was not scientifically proven) of O'Connor's short stories are essentially the same thing, and this follows it to a tee. To start, in O'Connor's work there must be always a intellectual, self righteous person that possesses enormous amounts of prejudice (Barton). This pompous character comes into contact someway with another character (Goodman) who appears to be more simple than our MC (main character). The MC mistreats this other character. The MC then discovers the truth about this other character, and is shocked to find out how wrong they were. In doing this, Character #2 offers redemption to the MC. This was most clearly shown in \"Good Country People\" and most famously \"A Good Man is Hard to Find.\" Also, as previously pointed out the girl on the beach was influenced by \"The Enduring Chill.\"",

With the paper thin walls of the hotel, it is perhaps not surprising for characters like Charlie to be enraged by their feigned sincerity, and for their abrupt and forced intrusion into their lives. Ultimately it is not this understanding that sells in the box office, but a much simpler method that could be achieved only by everyday people. What Barton Fink experienced was not a writer's block, but the inability to construct a simple story which his complex mind could not conjure. A beautiful premise behind a gorgeous film, but the film overall is really hard to fully apprehend as I am still left puzzled by several motifs and symbols.",

He takes the offer and checks in to a large, daunting hotel where he meets Charlie (John Goodman), an insurance salesman with whom Barton shares his ideas of the \"common man.\" As soon as Barton settles down to write his first movie script, he becomes burdened with writer's block. The wrestling picture he is told to write for is all too simple and undeniably a B-movie, thus Barton is unable to find the words. Throughout the movie are capable, decisive characters who have the jobs they do simply because they know how to handle them well, like the film studio executive, who mostly decides who stays in the industry and who goes. The \"technicalities\" are irrelevant. Charlie is introduced as a warm and considerate man who visits Barton often to help him with writing and to tell him stories. he seems like a simple-minded man. But, as Barton learns by the end of the movie, he himself has no clearer an image of the \"common man\" than Charlie does. The actors do a fine job of playing the varied and odd characters of the movie, and the setting, which is is often a room with little decoration, gives a feeling of the dread of something very close and inescapable, which we learn is the mind itself. Due to the rather simplistic story but the vast and complex ideas one is left to ponder, the movie remains fascinating, both during and after viewing.",

And even if you don't enjoy the Coens' particularly brand of humor, the script is still top-notch without it.  At the same time this is a movie that is simply littered in detail.  It's a film that has been dissected throughout the years for what it alludes to, allegories, relationship to real life people, the way Hollywood worked back in the old days.  It's a film that's been dissected so many times that I'm not even going to bother going into it, because people have already done so and done so much better than I ever could.  I think the movie would still be enjoyable even if you didn't dig want to dig deeper.  But it is a movie that sort of sticks with you hours, even days, after you watch it.  I think the film is a mystery to be solved and that's part of the joy of watching it, at least to me.  Because the more you find out, the more unsettling the film is.  The Earle Hotel certainly has a very surreal quality to it and it certainly makes you question the reality of the events that take place there, because things start to get worse around the hotel with Barton's deteriorating mental state.  This deterioration is excellently showcased by John Turturro's performance, you can sense how he is truly losing his mind over this wrestling picture that should, as several people mention in the film, is just about following a simple formula.  A formula that Barton simply doesn't wish to follow as he wants to do something great.  I also enjoyed how the film looks at Hollywood and how Barton adjusts to this world that he despises and how he is simply disposable in their world.  As mentioned the film's performances are excellent.  I loved John Goodman's performance specifically because you never know what his motivations are.  He's a very likable guy when he needs to be, but you can tell that there was something off about him, but you can never truly figure him out and where's he coming from.  John Goodman did a fabulous job here.  John Turturro is also tremendous, the best thing he brings to the table is that he delivers his line with absolute conviction, it's like this character was an extension of his own personality.  As mentioned, John Turturro does a perfect job at displaying Barton's physical and mental collapse.  I almost hate to ignore the rest of the cast, but the cast is truly perfectly cast, not a weak link to be found.  The more I think about it the more I love this film, it's one of those type of films and in another reason why the Coens are as universally respected as they are.  I'd HIGHLY recommend this film, because it is just tremendous.",

Coen Brothers are not new to period dramas but they have pushed a notch higher in giving attention to detail here. While the consistency with their trademark quirky characters in Goodman and Lerner are omnipresent here, what rubbed me good and bad was the abrupt meta finish of this movie.\r\n\r\nSet in the 1930s, Barton Fink (John Turturro) is a budding stage writer who tasted his first success and gets immediately pulled by a Hollywood big shot Jack Lipnick (Michael Lerner). He is assigned to come up with an entertaining script about a wrestler while he is accommodated in a small time motel in Los Angeles. With the condition of his room deteriorating due to heat and a loud, intrusive neighbor Charlie Meadows (John Goodman), Barton hits a writer's block. With time running out, he befriends the secretary cum wife Audrey Taylor (Judy Davis) of a yesteryear's great writer W.P.Mayhew (John Mahoney). One day everything goes from bad to worse.\r\n\r\nFirst commendation goes for the excellent set pieces, art direction and attention to detail for the period. The script does occasionally have its pace breakers featuring John Mahoney's thread, otherwise it is quite entertaining. John Goodman gives a terrific performance as an intrusive neighbor who knocks the door at the wrong time and couldn't stop blabbering about the trivialities. But Michael Lerner steals the show with his breathless lines and impeccable comic timing leaving you wanting for more. \r\nI am unsure if I am impressed or disappointed by the abrupt closing credits though it looks beautiful, but I am sure surprised knowing other works from the Coen Brothers. There are quite a few theories floating around the internet justifying the climax, none comes even remotely close to convince me. The turn of events with John Goodman's character comes off as expected but is a little underwhelming. Though the atmosphere is perfectly set for a thriller, it does not reach the levels set by standard so high for a Coen Brother's film\r\n\r\nExcellent performances in a rather rare and slightly undercooked script.",

The early 40s retro mood of the film is evoked by the sweltering heat, varnished wood, and peeling wall paper of Barton's decaying hotel room while he attempts to create a screenplay from the detritus of his surroundings. While others have described the film in terms of surrealism or being pregnant with symbolism, which might well be the intention of the film's creators, such artistic embellishments do not raise the stories content much above an illustration of a disturbed dream sequence in which the actors move mechanically through their parts as if they themselves were rehearsing the screenplay aloud. You feel no sympathy for any of the victims much the same as if a cartoon character were being killed. Don't get me wrong, this film is an artistic creation but it's just too much of the same thing which turns into prolonged scenery. The trapped feeling that you get is as if you stood too long in front of an interesting painting at the museum.",

It's the story about the successful Jewish playwright Barton Fink (John Turturro) who after a successful play on Broadway have been offered a job in Hollywood, which he barely accepts. He then move to Los Angeles and stays at a hotel that is in bad shape, where the wallpaper is falling of. Nobody in the industry seems to care about him. The only one he can talk to is his next door neighbor, a  suicidal lawyer named Charlie Meadows (John Goodman) who actually is keeping back a big secret that might cost Barton's carrier and life, but I don't want to give away the movie.\n\nBarton Fink is a strange film, in some degree surreal, specially when it comes to John Goodman's, whom we really don't where to put. There's also the always weird and creepy Steve Buscemi as Chet, the skinny and pale receptionist who certainly never seen the day of light, they all give this movie  the kind of creepy and alienatiet feeling. There's also a lot of Hollywood stereotypes, such as the overweight upper class movie producer Jack Lipnick who is mostly based on Louis B. Mayer. And there's W.P. Mayhew an author who Barton looks up to, but when he finally meats him, he meets an alcoholic and violent man who have been repressed by the Hollywood system.\n\nI just love this film for it's alienated, and isolate state of mind from the rest of the world. It's a criticism toward Hollywood, as it was in the 40s and how it is today, because it certainly hasn't change. I will not give away the ending but I promise you it's worth waiting for, but I have to warn you, the film contains much symbolism, and there's some questions that don't are answered. Thumbs up.",

Unfamiliar with the movies, with the wrestling setting of his first assignment or with anyone in town; Barton begins to sweat as- day by day- he accomplishes nothing. One night he calls a lady friend for help- and wakes up with her dead in his bed. From there, it gets\u00e2\u00a6 surreal.\n\nA lot has already been written about the symbolism in this film. It\u00e2(TM)s a lot to wrap our head around. Christ, the Wikipedia write up alone is 26 pages and 11,000 words. Gone With The Wind 16/7,000. And if the middle act wasn't so dull, I'm sure I would love this film more. It is rather flawlessly directed. Each shot seems so purposefully constructed; whereas in other Coen Bros movies, you might see more of a character domination. Not only that, no supporting actor is ever wasted. From the cops to the novelist to the insurance salesman; I was fascinated with each. But we spend too much time watching Barton climb the walls in terror of his writer's block.\n\nMaybe it's worth it to go through that in order to get to the payoff of what eventually becomes Fink's inspiration. And maybe the point is that the art that truly transcends the nature of man is only found in the pit of hell. Or maybe not. But don't stop paying attention.",

The hotel he is staying in acts as a sort of worm-hole between the reality of New York City and the fantasy of Hollywood (an obvious reference to David Lynch). The Coen Brothers's idea of Hollywood acts as both noirish an extremely Altman-esque. Robert Altman treated California as a surreal, dangerous, confusing, parallel universe and that is what the Coen's are doing here. Hollywood is transient, foreign and self referencing and so is \"Barton Fink.\" Like \"Blood Simple\" before it, \"Barton Fink\" is about movies.

Soon after Miller's Crossing was finished, the Coens began filming Barton Fink, which had its premiere at the Cannes Film Festival in May 1991. In a rare sweep, Barton Fink won the Palme d'Or prize, as well as awards for Best Director and Best Actor (Turturro). The process of writing and the culture of entertainment production are two prominent themes of Barton Fink. The world of Hollywood is contrasted with that of Broadway, and the film analyzes superficial distinctions between high culture and low culture. Other themes in the film include fascism and World War II; slavery and conditions of labor in creative industries; and how intellectuals relate to \"the common man\". Because of its diverse elements, Barton Fink has defied efforts at genre classification. It has been variously referred to as a film noir, a horror film, a K\u00fcnstlerroman, and a 'buddy' film.\nThe surrealistic, abandoned mood of the Hotel Earle was central to the development of the story, and careful deliberation went into its design. There is a sharp contrast between Fink's living quarters and the polished, pristine environs of Hollywood, especially the home of Fink's boss Jack Lipnick. On the wall of Fink's room there hangs a single picture of a woman at the beach; this captures Barton's attention, and the image reappears in the final scene of the film. Although the picture and other elements of the film (including a mysterious box given to Fink by Charlie) appear laden with symbolism, critics disagree over their possible meanings. The Coens have acknowledged some intentional symbolic elements while denying an attempt to communicate some holistic message.\nThe film contains allusions to many real-life people and events, most notably the writers Clifford Odets and William Faulkner. The characters of Barton Fink and W.P. Mayhew are widely seen as fictional representations of these men, but the Coens stress important differences. They have also admitted to parodying film magnates like Louis B. Mayer, but they note that Fink's agonizing tribulations in Hollywood are not meant to reflect their own experiences.\nBarton Fink was influenced by several earlier works, including the films of Roman Polanski, particularly Repulsion (1965) and The Tenant (1976). Other movies that influenced Barton Fink are Stanley Kubrick's 1980 film The Shining and Sullivan's Travels (1941) by filmmaker Preston Sturges. The Coens' movie also contains a number of literary allusions, to works by William Shakespeare, John Keats and Flannery O'Connor. Several religious overtones also appear, including references to the Book of Daniel in the Old Testament, King Nebuchadnezzar and Bathsheba.Brilliant performances of Turturro and Goodman in a strange and surrealistic movie.Does everything really happened(like the neighbour and the murdered lover) or it's all in Barton's head?",

Now a few months ago I did a review marathon about the films of the Coen's, which was of course \"The Coen Brothers Review Week\" and out of all of the seven films I looked at one was the Coen's 1990 gangster film MILLER'S CROSSING. Upon looking into that films back story I learned that the Coen's during the middle of writing that films screenplay suffered from a bout of writers block. To most Artists of any calibre any form of creative block can be the most dreaded thing that can happen to them. Even the fertile minds of the then young Coen's became subject to the horrors of Writers block and it's with that block the brothers stopped writing   MILLER'S CROSSING and wrote the cult classic 1991 film BARTON FINK.\r\n\r\nAs one of the lesser known Cult titles in the Coen's flimography BARTON FINK this year celebrates its 20th anniversary and 20 years on it holds up as one of the Coen's most surreal, artistically bold and most haunting films from the Coen's. BARTON FINK blends together elements of Film-Noir, comedy, melodrama, social commentary, horror & surreal movies in one disturbing and unclassifiable package. Despite the problem to classify what genre of film this is, it's just simple to call this a Coen Brothers Film because it inhabits a world of its own. And in this surreal nightmare the Coen's made what can easily be called one of the Coen's greatest films that ranks alongside the likes of NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN [2007], FARGO [1996], THE BIG LEBOWSKI [1998] & A SERIOUS MAN [2009]. So in the 12th review of my month long cult movie marathon the Coen's 1991 triple Palm D'Or winning masterpiece is today's Cult movie of choice.\r\n\r\nTHE PLOTLINE\r\n\r\nSet in the eventful year of 1941 in the later part of November and early December prior to the Japanese Attack on Pearl Harbour. The story opens in New York City on Broadway were a young Left Wing Intellectual Playwright called Barton Fink (John Turturro) strikes the big time when his debut play is a critical success. After mingling with a bunch of New York Aristocrats in a fancy restaurant (which is what Barton despises), Barton's agent meets him in the Restaurant's Bar with some big news. The Agent informs Barton he has just landed him a deal with Hollywood Studio Capitol Pictures to write for them. Barton at first hates the Idea and despises what Hollywood stands for and would rather stay in NYC and create \"the theatre of Common Man\" (even though Hollywood bet him to the punch), no sooner dose the agent mentions how much Barton could be paid , Barton's views are muted out and he heads for Hollywood.\r\n\r\nIn Los Angeles, Barton checks into the eerie, vast, and empty Hotel Earle which in the lobby only seems to be inhabited by the Bell Boy Chet (Steve Buscemi) & the Elevator Operator. After settling into his room Barton meets with the head of Capitol Pictures Jack Lipnick (Michael Lerner) and his assistant. Lipnick a fast-talking movie mogul in the meeting with Barton talks to him about writing a B-Wrestling Picture for the studio (while totally mute Barton hardly says a word) and an outline is expected by the end of the week. Barton upon returning to  the Hotel Earle starts to write the screenplay but after barley one complete paragraph is beset by the sudden bout of writers block and finds himself distracted  by ever since minor sight or sound in the empty and quite hotel. Barton hears a faint sobbing coming from the next room and rings the front desk to complain. Moments later Barton hears a knock at the door which turns out to be his Neighbour Charlie Meadows (John Goodman) who invites himself into the room for a drink with Barton. During the chat with Charlie, Barton barley lets Charlie get a word in as soon as the fact Barton mentions he is a writer come up in the conversation. After Charlie leaves Barton's writers block increases which starts to evoke a sense of panic from Barton.\r\n\r\nUpon talking to the Producer of the Picture who is not happy to be involved with the project tells Barton if he is having trouble with the story, talking to another writer is the best bet.  After meeting celebrated Novelist W.P Mayhew (John Mahoney) in a Restaurant's lavatory and asks about how to write wrestling pictures, W.P offers Barton to visit him at his Bungalow. Barton soon encounters the ugly truth about a person he idolises. W.P has become an alcoholic and is abusive towards his partner Audrey (Judy Davis). Barton starts to become emotionally involved with Audrey when he realises the deadline is fast approaching and seeks her help. After passing out next to her during sexual intercourse, Barton wakes up next to a dead Audrey.  With a possible murder on his hands, the true identity of his Buddy Charlie is reviled to him after a visit by the L.A.P.D and with the impending deadline while still suffering from writer's block, Barton's world starts to be consumed by a total surreal nightmare.\r\n\r\nTHE ACTING, SCRIPTING, DIRECTION, SOUND & CINEMA-PHOTOGRAPHY\r\n \r\nTo start with John Turturro was simply amazing as the ill-suffering Left Wing, Jewish Intellectual Playwright. Turturro won a Palm D'Or for the role and it's without a doubt one moving performance. With the performance by John Goodman oh my god was it amazing; Goodman has in some respect been in other non-Coen films typecast as a likable character actor. Here in this film the Coen's at first use that typical Goodman image to make the character of Charlie as a Likable person to offset the contradictory Fink in the first half of the film. When the pity of the suffering for Barton increases it comes as a shock to see Goodman's character is really (SPOLIERS) a stark raving madman called Munt in the closing 10 minutes of the film. Goodman is just terrifying in this role especially when he wants to show 'The True Nature of the Mind\". The rest of the cast are brilliant in their roles thanks to either the well written and brilliant supporting characters by the Coen's or just due to their performances.\r\n\r\n The Coen's created a truly fascinating story after the narrative to MILLER'S CROSSING caused a bout of writers block for the brothers. BARTON FINK loosely blends the Coen's comedic style with nods towards to films like Roman Polanski's REPULSION [1965], Stanley Kubrick's THE SHINNING [1980] & Preston Sturges 1941 comedy classic SULLIVAN'S TRAVELS. With the Coen's quirky style it's safe to call the brothers as auteur filmmakers and BARTON FINK is one of the best films to come from the minds of the brothers. Combine with every sound being amplified to terrifying levels and each shot of the Hotel Earle reflecting a weird hybrid cross between the visual style of Film-Noir movies of the 1940's (which is appropriate  in this films case) and the empty shots of the Overlook Hotel in Kubrick's THE SHINNING. BARTON FINK is a truly great film that deserves a definite 90% from me, it's just that good.",

The scripts like \"Bart you dont understand. You are a tourist, you came here for a while. I lived here my whole life. This is my home. You come to my house and complain I disturb you\". Then \"Hail Hitler\" and \"Fink is a Jewish name. Isn't it?\" These scripts unveil the theme and the skills of the Coen. Another masterpiece like Fargo, No Country for Old Men and Big Lebowski.",

The entire cast is brilliant with Turturro reminding everybody what he was capable of back then, rather than being reduced to the Transformers series of films today.His character's arrogance, pretentiousness and stout stubbornness prove to be his downfall amongst a crazy neighbour; played with a chilling quietness by John Goodman, a drunken peer and a studio mogul from hell.\n\nThe paranoid tale is great, although at times it overreaches itself with it's ambition. Certain scenes don't sit well it jumps into the unbelievable or over the top. The real gem is the attack on the writing industry which is played out brilliantly in the conflict between Turturro, Polito and Oscar nominated Michael Lerner. \n\nWhat else do you expect from real masters of their craft? f you like the Coen or John Turturro then see this film.",

After all, it is the plot synopsis of the whole movie. But underneath its clever facade is a deeper message, a darker message. And if you pay attention to all of the minute details, you might understand what Joel and Ethan are hinting at.\n\nBarton Fink is wonderful, but only for a certain audience.

It surely takes you by surprise - I will give it that. The production design is another highlight. The peeling wallpapers. The dark rooms. The typewriter. The old time elevator. The rundown hotel has the perfect atmosphere for this story. I can't imagine Barton writing his movie script anywhere else! The film itself is open to interpretation. Was it all in his head? You can look at the film in many ways but it surely deals with the block of creativity. When a writer or artist can't figure out how to get create his next masterwork. The film delves into the pressures and stress that come with it. Barton's main problem seems to be his inability to connect with his fellow human being. He's supposed to be writing a script about a wrestler but he knows nothing about wrestling. He can't understand another's pain or suffering. He is literally locked away from the world mentally and physically. I think the film throws us into his state of mind. All the madness and absurdity. Everything just comes together in the most nightmarish and surreal way. Its happening but it almost doesn't seem real. Like at any minute - Barton is going to wake up and we can take a sigh of relief. So, while I found the transition of the film from a quirky satire to a surreal psychodrama a little jarring - I felt like its exactly where the film should have gone. Overall, BARTON FINK is one of the most fascinating films of the 90's. View it atleast once.",

The hotel he is staying in acts as a sort of worm-hole between the reality of New York City and the fantasy of Hollywood (an obvious reference to David Lynch). The Coen Brothers's idea of Hollywood acts as both noirish an extremely Altman-esque. Robert Altman treated California as a surreal, dangerous, confusing, parallel universe and that is what the Coen's are doing here. Hollywood is transient, foreign and self referencing and so is \"Barton Fink.\" Like \"Blood Simple\" before it, \"Barton Fink\" is about movies.

The second half is laced with enough of the surreal that you're forced to wonder if the whole movie is one long dream sequence. It's not. The Coen's are experimenting. Don't get hung up on the surreal scenes at the end. Movies aren't real and the Coen's made a film that throws these rules out the window. Here is my take:\n\nThe audience is introduced to Fink just as he begins to gain accolades for his \"common man\" play. Immediately, Hollywood execs court him to come out west. Against his better judgment, he agrees and sell his soul to Hollywood. Fink arrives to California and checks into Hotel Earle (or Hotel California) the place that will represent the mind of Charlie, a neighbor Fink befriends. Charlie personifies the average man that Barton Fink endears. Yet, Fink's own self-importance acts as a barrier between him and those he aspires to write for. Fink becomes trapped in a state of writers block, finding no inspiration for the subject of his new wrestling themed writing assignment. When the one woman who can help him with his writing dilemma ends up dead in his own bed, all hope is lost. That is until Charlie saves the day by removing the woman's body and later giving Barton a human head sized package to take care of while he's away on business. Soon, Barton Fink is writing again, the mysterious package conveniently at his typewriter's side. The script is his masterpiece. Unfortunately the studio doesn't agree and wont shoot it or any of his future stories. Barton Fink's thoughts are the property of Capital Pictures, and he becomes condemned as a writer no longer able to create anything meaningful. He is in his own private writer's hell.",

The hotel is the most meticulously riddled with details; as Barton's base of operations for most of the movie, the great amount of time spent there greatly lends itself to interpretation and analysis.  The film is a descent into the kookiness of the artist's mind, delving further and further into surrealism and leaving us wondering just how much of the film actually transpired in the way it is shown to us.  The narrative arc modifies and backhandedly pays tribute to the many storied personalities of 1940s Hollywood, which ultimately attests to the power of the author to shape and modify a story using previously utilized narrative conventions, characters and events.   At some point in the movie, the fabula and sjuzet reach a crossroads and take off in separate directions which only further baffles and intrigues us as we wait to see what additional facet of narrative Hell (typically in the guise of the ironic coincidence) is unleashed on unwitting Barton.  The many complexities, playful transmogrification of various plot and historical elements make this film the Coen Brothers' most postmodern movie; that's saying something based on their track record of twisting generic conventions.  The actors all do a bang-up job staying true to their characters and embracing the lunacy around them.

He can't refuse the amount of money he is offered and instantly moves to Hollywood to begin his new job.  Once he arrives in Hollywood, he almost instantly experiences writer's block.  Barton seeks the aid of a local writer to break his writer's block while also receiving encouragement from his neighbor.\r\n\r\n\"Are you all right?\"\r\n\"No.  I'm fine.  Thank you.\"\r\n\r\nJoel and Ethan Coen, who worked on Fargo; O, Brother Where Art Though; True Grit; No Country for Old Men; Blood Simple; Raising Arizona; and The Big Lebowski, delivers Barton Fink.  The storyline for this picture is interesting, well paced, and unique.  The script is well written and the conclusion is brilliant.  The cast delivers solid performances and includes John Turturro, John Goodman, Judy Davis, Michael Lerner, and Steve Buscemi. \r\n\r\n\"We all want to have that Barton Fink feeling.\"\r\n\r\nI am a huge Coen brothers fan and DVR'd this picture when it recently aired.   I will say this movie is a little methodical and takes a while to get going; however, the ending is awesome, abrupt, and very intelligent (sounds like just about every Coen brothers movie).  This is definitely a must see for fans of the Coen brothers.\r\n\r\n\"I create for a living.  I'm a creator.\"\r\n\r\nGrade: A-",

That's also a good description for this film. Fun, because it is laced with the black comedy that Coen Brothers aficionados are accustomed. Intrigue and mystery, because the filmmakers needed to do something to spice up the narrative, which isn't all that exciting when imagined by itself. What percentage of the mainstream do you think would have rushed out to see a film that was ostensibly about a writer, alone in his room, trying to overcome writer's block? We must enjoy being romanced by the mystery and intrigue because if we are looking for explanations and explicit meaning, we won't find it. And the Coens rarely hint at what they have in mind. They just manufacture these stylish films that provide fodder for discussion long after the house lights come up.",

In fact his inspiration comes from something as abstract as a painting. At first sight, it seems like intellectual arrogance but as you go on you realize it's more than that. It's about your mind creating an identity of it's own and while you may want to project some idealistic vision, it has it's own fascinations. That's where Barton Fink is very similar to Polanski's \"The Tenant\". The concept of detachment of mind as a separate entity itself is what both movies seem to work on.\n\nThere are events & characters as well that just seem to be the manifestations of Fink's own mind. W.P. Mayhew played by John Mahoney seems to be a futuristic version of Fink himself who has accepted the domination of mind over ideals and same goes with two detectives who bring with them the characteristic humor of Coen Brother films. John Turturro is brilliant only to be outdone by absolutely magnificent John Goodman.\n\nBarton Fink is not a movie than can be fully appreciated in one viewing and one may find different details with repeat viewing which may even be contradictory and why not?...After all what is mind for but to induce contradictions!....",

There's commentary on how movies attacked the popularity of the theater but there's also a suggestion that playwrights arrogantly view themselves as being better than screen writers. The ultimate message from the Coen brothers for me is that movies, as bad as they can be, can produce art as good as anything we see in other forms. Where is this ultimate message you ask? Why, the movie itself of course. This has great performances from everyone on screen. Judy Davis in particular is mesmerizing. Her character is a wonderful parody of an old Hollywood actress and Goodman and Turturro are as good as I've ever seen them in anything else. Its visually beautiful and expertly constructed. Its a movie that will remain in your memory for good. So much can be read from the final scene that you could hold a conference or write a thesis. For me the box contains Finks creativity.

The performances in this film are some of my favourites, Turturro as the brainy idealistic writer who drives himself up the wall with writers block, not helped by Lynchian hotel he chooses and a \"noisy\" common man neighbour, played with creepy sweaty charm by Goodman. The writing is also sharp, and the film feels like a very personal work, indeed it was conceived by the brothers to let off some steam when writing on Miller's Crossing slowed to a halt. It feels like there could be a lot of brainy metaphors going on by the end, with head-sized boxes, hellfire and paintings coming true but I think that would just be too Barton Fink in itself.

            "content": "And so, Joel and Ethan Coen take on their most harrowing challenge yet: ...putting John Turturro in a lead role. I'm kidding, John Turturro is awesome, apparently as more than just a character actor, but I'm not entirely kidding when I say that we are dealing with a harrowing endeavor with this, \"The Fly III: The Rise of the Mosquito\"! I can't help but think a surrealist horror film of that nature when I see this film's poster, because the titular Barton Fink seems to be really freaked out by that mosquito, and looks so much like some kind of a combination between Jeff Goldbum as Seth Brundle, and Eraserhead, and... Woody Allen. I guess all New York Jew screenwriters look alike, and yes, I'm very, very well aware that Turturro is Italian, and therefore Catholic, but then again, New York Italians don't look that much different from New York Jews. Hey, he must have had the Coen brothers fooled, because Fink is by no means an Italian name, although it is pretty popular with - you guessed it - the Jews. Boy, when the Coens said that they \"didn't do any research, actually, at all\" for this film, they weren't kidding, yet here they are, deconstructing Broadway and Hollywood, just as they deconstructed Texas in \"Blood Simple\", and Arizona in \"Raising Arizona\"... probably because they even realize that their films are bland enough when they're not set in their hometown of Minnesota. Well, make no mistake, this film, as the Coens' first rewarding drama, by one heck of a long-shot, is a whole lot more exciting than Minnesota, to a certain extent, at least.\r\n\r\nSomething that I really appreciate about this film is its extensiveness as a character study, even in concept, and yet, I don't know if a narrative this intimate is layered enough to warrant a runtime of nearly two hours, dragged towards with overdrawn meditations on certain material and filler that all but stiffen pace, while leaving what layers there are to this drama to outstay their welcome. The film is driven by the titular Barton Fink's interactions with eccentric peers, and the more time it spends with one peer is time lost on another, thus, when focus shifts, it jars, resulting in some glaring focal inconsistencies that are almost, maybe even about as detrimental to a smooth sense of momentum as tonal inconsistencies. Now, there are more inconsistencies in focus than in tone, because it's not until more consequential conflicts come into play, a little past the hour mark, when tone takes a serious shift, but make no bones about it, when the humor chills down a bit for the sake of tension, the twist, no matter how gripping, is a touch too sharp, shaking dramatic momentum a bit, or at least reflecting an ambition for dramatic momentum. Although they had never been so inspired by this point, Joel and Ethan Coen, with this film, had not yet fully cleansed an almost awkward sense of ambition, and there are times in which they get too carried away with such ambition to get a comfortable grip on structure, which isn't to say that the generally tightly fulfilled ambition is the most relatively distancing aspect of this drama. The Coens' trademark directorial thoughtfulness, being backed by particularly intriguing subject matter, a particularly razor-sharp script, and particularly well-portrayed characters, is particularly effective, but considering the steadiness of this narrative, material lapses often, and when it does, I'm not going to lie, the film occasionally falls into dullness, and when it doesn't do that, it at least descends to a certain bland coldness which shakes the bite of the film's subjective value. Of course, it's not only the cold spells that shake substance, as it seems as though the drama tries a little too hard at times with its wit and subtle style, and when you combine these reflections of ambition with such reflections as hiccups in a movement to meet ambition with inspiration, the final product finds itself held back, but only shy of excellent. I don't know how far this somewhat minimalist film could have gone, but through the flaws of a project of only so much consequence are the strengths of an outstanding effort, the glimpses of which are plentiful enough to make a strong picture whose inspiration even touches art direction.\r\n\r\nExploring the high cultures of New York and Hollywood, in addition to some of the grime of the Los Angeles low culture, during 1941, this period piece has a potential for diversity to its settings that Robert C. Goldstein and Leslie McDonald go above and beyond with when it comes to fulfilling through art direction that distinguishes each set and costume with an immersive handsomeness that is augmented by the Coen brothers' first of many collaborations with the great Roger Deakins. Deakins' cinematography might not be stunning, but it is consistently sharp with its subtle lighting and coloration, with a visual style that is made all the more immersive by impeccable framing and sweeping camerawork, and defines the final product as, if nothing else, stylistically upstanding, which isn't to say that style solely defines the drama. While the story concept doesn't match the sharpness of its interpretation enough to craft an altogether excellent effort, this film's subject matter is not simply intriguing, but genuinely original, in its approach to intriguing themes on the artistic distinctions between stage and film, and the social and intellectual distinctions and pain between big-shots and simple men, while studying on the personal conflicts of a man in strange land that grow heavier and heavier as the land grows stranger and stranger, thus making for an interesting film idea that is done justice by plenty, but only truly brought to life by the Coen brothers' writers. As with any of the Coens' best films, this effort thrives on its being so incredibly well-written, and even if the interpretation of the script is not of equal quality, there's no seeing this film as good as it is without the biting satire that is distinctly colorful, yet not too over-the-top, thanks to a cleverness that is anchored by sparklingly snappy dialogue that needs to be heard in order to be believed, and helps in tightly defining colorful characters who are still best-defined by their portrayals. One might expect a drama this minimal to seriously limit acting material, but most everyone has his or her time to shine, whether it be the delightfully over-the-top Michael Lerner and John Mahoney as flawed Hollywood sensations, or the effective Judy Davis as a woman in love with a troubled artist, or the show-stealing John Goodman, whose chillingly intense dramatic twists break which reflect a certain instability to the Charlie Meadows character punctuate Goodman's classic charm at its most dynamite, especially when applied to equally dynamite chemistry with leading man John Turturro, who is the real treat of this picture, with a subdued charisma that makes the titular Barton Fink character effective as an avatar audience who is distinguished by his own right by remarkable layering that never lose passion, but gradually mold Fink as a man of vision and fear, both for his art and his life. As much as everyone justly praises Goodman, Turturro is a revelation, and if you see the film for no other reason, see it for him, but stay for the Coens' performance as directors, who admittedly make sticking around a bit of a challenge with their pacing issues, overstylization and overambition, but whose more subtle stylistic touches go a long way in coloring up the film, and whose more thoughtful touches are often given enough to work with to bite, whether it be with dramatic intrigue or tension that compel, often thoroughly. In a lot of ways, the film is so good, even excellent, and it's frustrating that natural and consequential shortcomings are recurring enough to hold the final product back from excellence, yet inspiration is never lost, entertaining and intriguing enough to make a strong drama.\r\n\r\nWhen the job is done, some questionable structuring that drags and finds inconsistencies in focus and tone, joined by some dull, or at least coldly distancing dry spells in direction, betray a potential for excellence, but just barely, for there is enough inspiration to immersive art direction which captures the era impeccably, handsome cinematography which captures style dynamically, and original and intriguing subject matter which is brought to life by sparklingly clever writing, great acting - especially by show-stealer John Goodman and revelatory leading man John Turturro - and effective direction to make \"Barton Fink\" a generally biting satire, intriguing drama and overall engrossing first triumph for Joel and Ethan Coen.\r\n\r\n3.25/5 - Strong",

So much is left open-ended that it really makes you wonder how much symbolism you can discover from watching this movie again. Like many of their movies don't expect to get a nice, clean, cookie-cutter, Hollywood ending, but the ending will really make you think much more than the regular stuff Hollywood spits out. What I liked was that many surprises happen in Barton Fink, that leave you guessing, suspending you on the edge of your seat, wondering how it's all gonna turn out in the end. Of course like all Coen-made movies, it has that subtle humor in it but I'd say this is a lot more drama and film noir than it is a comedy. Not like Lebowski or O Brother. No doubt Turturro's best role I've ever seen him in and Goodman is a good man for this role. Perfect movie. Released in theaters two days before I was born interestingly enough...",

The whole movie is about a writer who writes a great play and is asked to write a movie. But the only problem is that it is a B-movie. The writer can't figure out how to do that. So he he tries too hard and write what he calls his best work. The whole movie is filled with metaphors and things that would show up later in the movie. One of my favorite is the picture. In Barton's hotel room where he resides, there is a photo of a woman sitting on a beach that inspires him to write. In the end of the movie he experiences that photo. There is a whole story that is really complicated and can't even explain. If I hadn't seen tis movie, then I wouldn't think so highly of John Turturro (Mainly because of Transformers). He does such a good job in this movie. Who else could play Barton Fink, he looks like a Barton. John Goodman does well also. I think John Turturro should have been nominated or won an Oscar for his performance. I mean Anthony Hopkins won for The Silence of the Lambs. Where he only appears in the movie for like 2 and a half minutes.The Coen brothers should have won Best Original Scrrenplay. This is an all around great movie. but that's what you get with an awesome script, a great cast and perfect visuals.",

How much of what we see is fantasy is, again, impossible to understand, and the Coens would rather let you believe what you'd like rather than offer some form of elucidation.\n\nRegardless of what you may think of the story, there's no doubting that everyone involved is in top form, particularly Turturro, who perhaps exemplifies the most clearly Coenesque protagonist of any of their films.\n\nIf nothing else, like many Coen brothers films, any and all expectations will drift away as you realize you have no idea what's going to happen next.",

I just don't care enough. John Goodman is superb as Charlie Meadows and easily steals every scene he is in and while John Turturro is fine as Fink, for me, he just doesn't convince as he slides into madness as his life begins to unravel.

            "content": "A gnarled Faustian riddle of a film with an astonishing wealth of subtext. Barton Fink is an absolutely fantastic character, host to some of the Coens' most insightful sociological observation, and John Turturro is 100% on board with the person they're trying to create. I love the delicious narcissism he projects when he purports interest in the \"common man,\" but ultimately that interest is self-serving, a means to an end for his own intellectual fulfillment. When meeting a true paragon of the aesthetic he's trying to capture (John Goodman, who is excitingly awesome here), Fink is utterly unconcerned with his attempts to actually teach him or tell him stories of his life, gleaning only what he needs from their few conversations. It's a full-bodied, riveting characterization, and it's truly a shame that Turturro didn't pick up an Oscar nomination for his incisive work. (Michael Lerner getting a nomination for his one-volume-fits-all shoutfest, on the other hand, almost feels like a slap in the face.) \n\nThe rest of the movie, a visually arresting cautionary tale about reconciling the \"life of the mind\" with Hollywood's pernicious capitalism, is almost too cruel to put into words. Along with their typical emotional abuse of their characters, the Coens here subject Barton Fink to an immense amount of mental duress; the challenge in watching this movie is that Fink kvetches so much about every little thing that goes wrong for him that it's difficult to truly empathize with him. Sure, we understand that he's not a very good person and there's really no incentive for getting behind him, but it's that perspective that makes the movie's view of haughty intellectualism that much more cogent. Plus, the last half hour of the movie is a complete mindfuck, if you're into that sort of thing (which I definitely am). It's sometimes a tricky balance depicting a character's dissolving mental state on film and keeping it representational versus presentational, but what we see in Barton Fink is assumed to be no less than the truth, and the Coens play it totally seriously, in their darkly humorous way. They've never really warped reality in any of their films as they have here - some of their characters may act completely beyond human comprehension, sure, but here we're invited along for a ride through Barton Fink's personal hell. And it is great.",

John Turturro's performance is really good here, as he often has to carry scenes all by himself, but the real treat is John Goodman.

Miller's Crossing contained a depth of plot that knows few equals in Hollywood, particularly as far as gangster films are concerned. \n\nSo how do you treat a particularly bad case of block? By writing a film about writer's block where all of the worst possible things happen to a writer. This writer (John Turturro) just wrote a play that makes him the toast of New York, so he takes a contract in Hollywood writing films to help fund his true passionate subjects later. And then he gets stuck writing a B wrestling picture, when wrestling is the last thing he knows anything about. Even though he claims to write for the \"common man\", all of his speechifying and his complicated thoughts show how isolated he is. And boy does he pay the price!\n\n*Spoilers*\nEverybody he knows dies and his helpful neighbor, a wonderful John Goodman, turns into the personified wrath of the common man, a demonic figure followed by fire who shows Fink where he really went wrong. And on top of all that, the studio HATES his pretentious script and keeps him under contract while publishing nothing, effectively burying him and ending his career.\n\nIt reminds me of David Lynch's Eraserhead, written out of fear of becoming a father it takes the absolute worst thing that could happen to a new dad and projects it on screen. Barton Fink is the same way. What's the worst that could happen if Joel and Ethan can't finish the script? Well, everybody they know could die and their careers could be ruined forever. Cool!",

After checking into the highly atmospheric and somewhat seedy Hotel Earle, Fink (a high-strung and twitchy Turturro) finds himself struggling with an epic case of writer's block as he befriends easygoing and gregarious insurance salesman Goodman. The film works best skewering old time Tinseltown archetypes as cartoonish exaggerations (astute viewers will recognize ersatz takes on William Faulkner and Jack L. Warner - Michael Lerner doing a great job as the latter), but is less successful toward the conclusion as Fink's world seemingly comes crashing down around his ears. At that point, symbolism takes over for satire and interpretations start to abound about the nature of Goodman's character and what he represents. Puzzling, but the whole production is mesmerizing.",

It's something your either love or loath as they are so incredibly messed up. The cast are all superb, Goodman is outstanding,the man's a genius,it's hard not to like Charlie when you first meet him,he's so infectious,it makes it all the sweeter when you find out his real identity. Turturro is also perfect as Barton,this must be one of his best roles to date. The Hotel itself is a character,with it's wet walls and slimly wall paper. It would feel completely desolated and deserted of life,if it wasn't for the shoes. About the half way mark and the feeling of the movie changes dramatically. It starts to feel like a horror movie,the once wet walls of the hotel are now dripping with fire as Barton's sanity is pushed to it's limit. This is such a cleaver movie,this was written when the brothers had writers block whilst penning Millers Crossing. That alone blows my mind,that something this good was created that way.",

This one has a similar basic structure to their recent A Serious Man: it's about a nice but unexceptional man struggling vainly to deal with a series of baffling circumstances. This time it's John Turturro as Barton Fink, an earnest young liberal playwright in the 1930s who gets hired by Hollywood to write a B-movie. He believes his writing can help the proletarian \"common man,\" but is actually not all that interested in common men when he meets them. The supporting cast has some of the best character actors in the business: Steve Buscemi, Tony Shaloub, Judy Davis, and John Mahoney as a thinly disguised William Faulkner. Michael Lerner got an Oscar nomination for his hilarious supporting role as a blustery Hollywood producer who pretends to care about art but really is only concerned with the studio's bottom line. John Goodman also gets one of his best parts ever as Fink's suspiciously friendly neighbor. There are lots of great little touches, such as the multiple ways in which Fink's hotel is made to seem like Hell itself. There's the creepy sucking noise his door makes every time it is opened or closed, and the way the wallpaper keeps sweating and peeling. The movie goes along in a relatively conventional manner for a while before totally going off the rails and into crazy Coen territory in the last half-hour. The fact that this was only their fourth movie is impressive, and makes you wonder how these guys keep getting away with it.",

I've never felt as close to the character's struggle as when I tried to write a review for it.  But a few hours later, here it is.\r\n\r\nWhat's impressive about this labyrinth of a film and the Coen Brothers (as if they're not impressive enough) is that it was written in a matter of three weeks during a spout of writer's block while working on Miller's Crossing.  For such a quick scribble, Barton Fink has more layers than a pyramid scheme, steeped in social, political, and existential allegory.\r\n\r\nFink, played by John Turturro, is a New York playwright on the rise, chosen by a Hollywood studio to pen a wrestling B-movie.  He takes up residence in a run-down hotel where he tries to work out his mental difficulties, no thanks to the imposition of his loud, mysterious neighbor, Charlie Meadows (played by John Goodman).\r\n\r\nI could go on for days about the symbolisms displayed...The wallpaper peeling in the hotel room that represents Fink's mind, analogies offered by the very film Fink is working on, references to slavery as metaphors of the studio's ownership of Fink's creativity, along with other strong yet accurate accusations of the Hollywood machine (the studio head exclaims to Fink: \"This is a wrestling picture, the audience wants to see action, adventure, wrestling. They don't want to see a guy wrestling with his own soul!\") \r\n\r\nWhat I enjoyed about this film also were a couple moments where I thought to myself, \"is it okay to laugh here?\"  It's a think piece that defies the pigeonholing of genre placement, incorporating elements of noir, psycho-thriller, horror, and dark comedy.\r\n\r\nThere is a quick transition shot of the California coast toward the beginning of the film when Barton makes his move to Los Angeles that, for some reason - combined with a picture of that same beach hanging in Barton's hotel room - felt like a serene yet uneasy foreshadowing of a painful end.  A seemingly harmless 5-second glimpse of waves crashing into a large rock that I failed to shake throughout the film's duration.\r\n\r\nWith its many faces, Barton Fink opens itself up to varied impressions and analysis.  And with its complicated simplicity, this film offers a high replay value.  Discovering Coen gems I've missed, I feel a bit forced to tweak the order of my \"Favorite Directors\" list.",

            "content": "It's amusing to see something marvelous created out of the creation process for a more-concentrated piece of work that fell under the radar as a \"sleeper\" hit. The Coen Brothers drowned themselves in writers' block during the creative process of writing their mob piece 'Miller's Crossing', which in itself was a muse to make 'Barton Fink' happen a year later. 'Miller's Crossing', set in the 1930's Prohibition-era, was obvious more tedious in attention to detail, setting, camera work, lighting, costumes, and the consistency of creative mob-speak; 'Barton Fink', set only a decade later in the 1940's, was a much simpler route in production, as it was intent on limited setting mostly in a run-down hotel room, and far less characters, and far less of a puzzle of double-cross. Both films do, similarly, involve a noir-esque descent of the world on the protagonist of Atlas-proportions, but my opinion: 'Barton Fink' is the better film. It tells of our titular character - a 1940's idealistic playwright whose underground success of the stage leads to a financially-endowed opportunity to write for Hollywood producers. His Achilles' Heel is the fact that he was a Robert Bresson before Robert Bresson made films (nerd translation: Robert Bresson was a French pre-Nouvelle Vague film director whose prominent intent was to make films that strip away the sophistication and glamour of forced acting in order to document real life of the common man or woman in a fictional story - basically a study in realism). Barton's integrity is expected to wear thin once he enters Capital Films - a large production company who hires him to write a B-movie about wrestling. Hitting one brick wall after another, yet experiencing a chain of unusual and surreal events while exiled in his dark, crummy hotel room, Barton finds it increasingly difficult to sacrifice his literary integrity to come up with a wrestling story. In the meantime, he befriends his neighbor Charlie Meadows - played by an uproariously funny John Goodman. Charlie Meadows takes on the identity of what's considered the 'common man': a struggling insurance salesman living a moderate lifestyle. Also entering his life is W.P. Mayhew - played by a finely-acted John Maloney with a genuine Georgian tongue. W.P. Mayhew is almost like an idol to Barton's passion of entertainment writing, but soon finds out how much of a false life he's lived, by way of Mayhew owing his writing success to his secretary Audrey Taylor (played by a magnificent and seductive Judy Davis). By way of film noir, Audrey becomes something like a femme fatale and a passionate fantasy to Barton, and almost immediately, Barton's world spirals in hellish, downward descent. He begins to realize himself what it means to be a true \"outsider\" - an \"outsider\" to Hollywood as is incapable of sacrificing integrity for a piece of literary work, and an \"outsider\" to the \"common man\" he desires to portray in each story, since he isn't such the \"common man\" himself to fully relate to. In the end, he's just a \"tourist with a typewriter\". This one is actually the first film composed without the signature cinematography work of Barry Sonnenfield (their weapon of choice who almost single-handedly provided the Coen Brothers with their films' signature style and look with fast-acting character zoom-ins and wide-angle frame-scapes), but whoever replaced him behind the camera and lighting sure took note of the past films which shaped the Coens' career. The Coen Brothers have developed yet another perplexing artifice to destroy a protagonist - everything from 'Barton Fink', 'Miller's Crossing', 'The Big Lebowski', 'Burn After Reading' and even their most recent 'A Serious Man' - they all deal similar cards in giving one bold human being the ultimate run-around. This one ends with something of a brick wall, with plenty on the surreal side to ponder about. 'Barton Fink' is certainly one of the more sleeper successes of the Coens' career, and quite considerably one of their finest, most puzzlingly genius bodies of work - not to mention, perhaps their most passionately simplistic 116 minutes yet.",

            "content": "Movies with ambiguous endings stay with you forever. Think of the first time you saw Lost in Translation (what does he whisper in her ear!?) or pondering why the birds came in Hitchcock's The Birds, the briefcase in Pulp Fiction, Magnolia, Punch Drunk Love, Broken Flowers, Fight Club, No country for Old Men and even the Dark Knight all present endings and elements throughout that provide intense interpretations and lend themselves as prime subjects for Zoom-In analysis. However, one that presents itself as a highly metaphorical and highly ambiguous film is the Cohen Brother's 1991 film, Barton Fink. The first film to win all three major awards (Palme D'or, Best Director, and Best Actor) at the Cannes Film Festival. Also, it was unanimously chosen for the Palme D'or.\r\n\r\nThe entire film presents itself as a metaphor for heaven and hell. Barton Fink is played by John Tuturo (what ethnicity is this guy!? He plays everything) who is a critically acclaimed playwright who is hired to a contract in Hollywood to make the transition into film. He claims to write scripts for and about the \"everyday man.\" After being offered to bunk up in a Hollywood suite, he insistently declines in order to stay in an average hotel called the Hotel Earle. When Chet (Steve Buscemi, the hotel clerk) first appears he comes out of a door on the floor after it takes him a long while to reach the top, like if he was ascending from the underworld. - The word \"six\" is said three times in the elevator. - Hotel Earle can be an anagram of the words Hell and Erato, the Greek Muze of lyric poetry.\r\n\r\nCharlie (John Goodman) is Barton Fink's neighbor who Barton feels an attachment to. Most people concur that Charlie represents the devil. Instead, I think that Charlie represents the repressed rage that \"common men\" trapped in dead-end lives feel. The pealing wallpaper and heat represent the rage stewing just under the surface, the flames are when Charlie's pent-up anger and resentments finally explode to the surface. Barton struggles through writing his first film, with deadlines about a wrestler. He seeks aid in the help of a famous writer's wife (Audrey) who he ends up sleeping with and he wakes up to her dead (slashed, bloody) body next to him. He finds out that Charlie is a serial killer who chops off people's heads from the police who question Barton after finishing his script. The studio hates the script and Charlie arrives at home to his apartment lit on fire by Charlie who kills the police investigators that are waiting for him with a shotgun.\r\n\r\nThe Hotel beings to burn and the wallpaper (which has been ripping off throughout the movie continues to rip away). Charlie then says my favorite line in the movie, as the apartment is burning to the ground: \"If you need me, I'll be in my room.\" He then says he went to visit Barton's parents on the East coast where he is from and leaves Barton a gift in a box.\r\n\r\nBarton leaves the apartment and walks on the beach where he sits down in front of a beautiful women which resembles exactly the picture of a woman on the beach that has rested on his wall of the hotel room that he had gazed at for release throughout his time spent there. This brings us to the last lines of the film between the woman and Barton:\r\n\r\nBeauty: It's a beautiful day.\r\nBarton: Huh?\r\nBeauty: I said it's a beautiful day.\r\nBarton: Yes. It is.\r\nBeauty: What's in the box?\r\nBarton: I don't know.\r\nBeauty: Isn't it yours?\r\nBarton: I don't know. You're very beautiful. Are you in pictures?\r\nBeauty: Don't be silly.\r\n\r\nThe questions arise: what is in the box? what does the girl in the picture come to real life represent? and finally what does the wallpaper ripping off mean?\r\n\r\nHere are some explanations I have dug up:\r\n\r\nFirst of all this is like the briefcase in Pulp Fiction it is not meant to be known. I have always thought it was Barton's mind. He couldn't write before but once he got his mind back he was free to write away. Also at the end he finds out that Capital Pictures owns him and his mind so when the girl asks if that is his box he responds \"I don't know\" meaning he doesn't know if it belongs to him or to Capital Pictures.\r\n\r\nNow this of course isn't supposed to be taking literally I know his mind isn't actually in the box but it is symbolic of it.\r\n\r\nALSO:\r\n\r\nThe suggestion seems to be that's it's Audrey's head. Yet, there's a very \"Pulp Fiction\" aspect to it as well where we're not really meant to know. And yet, more than in \"Pulp Finction\"- where the mystery remains much more sublime than any attempt at explantion- we seem invited to seek out an interpretation here to find one that is more symbolic than literal. Barton's \"mind\" or \"the truth\" are good ones- \"mind\" could also be interpreted as Barton's creativity or even his soul (much like those slightly tedious interpretations of Marcellus's briefcase- I reckon it works better here.) The only real clues we have are the size of the box and Mudnt's confession that he lied and that it doesn't really belong to him (ie. does that mean it's Audrey's head or something belonging to Barton?)\r\n\r\nHowever, I think it's significant that Barton doesn't actually open the box- therefore doesn't actually release his mind/creatively/soul. The way I like to look at it is that it is that very mystery of not knowing what's in the box that finally releases his creativity (and so leaves the explanation unknown-like Pulp Fiction). The point that Barton also confesses that he doesn't know what's in the box- and therefore might mean that he doesn't know if he still owns his own creativity- is a good one, but it could work on this level too- ie. that he still doesn't know what's in the box and is- perhaps- still feeding of that mystery. Who knows? Do we really need to know? Sometimes unanswered questions are more inspirational than answered ones.\r\n\r\n\r\nPersonally I thought that what was in the box was the head of his parents who he went to visit, meaning that when you go to hell, you bring everyone you know down with you. What did you think?\r\n\r\nRotten Tomatoes give this move a 91% rating\r\n\r\nZoom In Analysis will DISAGREE with this rating and give it a 7.5 out of 10\r\n\r\nAlthough there is a lot of ambiguity and the movie definitely pulls on the critics strings hitting all the right notes, it lacks audience appeal, but a great flick for those who love to interpret movies. If only judging it as a well written story with long lasting effect I would agree with RT, however when popping this movie into a wide appeal audience it won't be for everyone.",

Many people find it boring. I understand and I can even agree but I also believe that I understand, at least in part, what the directors wanted to tell us.There is a lot of common between the Coen's and Barton Fink, an idealistic intellectual Jew who idolizes ordinary people and, therefore, cannot see how stupid they are (the Coen's can). Suddenly, Fink is hired to write the script for a mediocre B movie about pugilism. The kind of movie ordinary people pay to see even today. Of course the script, by an intellectual full of ideals, would never be useful in these kind of film because Fink didn't know how to adapt himself to the task. He is far above ordinary men to realize what they want to see and that is why he would never please them. This is not just with Fink: today, the majority of people don't like theatre or art because it has become too elitist and intellectual to appeal the masses (taking theatre and the arts as an example, we can still think of classical music or even cinema).From this point of view, this film is deeply intelligent: it starts out as a very intellectual and hermetic film which will make the most idiotic audience flee from the theater and, then, it gradually becomes more \"normal\" through action and violence. Even so, it always contains some intellectuality, through elements and moments that the film never bother to explain (the importance and content of the box that Fink receives near the end, for example, a thing that left me confused and curious). Its as if the film, even making an effort to adapt itself, never ceased to be what it really is. In the midst of it all, I enjoyed the work of Turturro, which gave life to the protagonist. He knew how to make his character naive and dreamy. Fink sometimes seems so oblivious to the world around him that he seems to be stoned. What counts for him is the world he has inside his head. Very interesting, but difficult to swallow for commercial audiences.",

Barton, whose last nameWhat \"Raising Arizona\" was to baby lust, \"Barton Fink\" is to writer's block -- a rapturously funny, strangely bittersweet, moderately horrifying and, yes, truly apt description of the condition and its symptoms. Barton, whose last name literally means blabbermouth, is an earnest young New York playwright whose widely praised new play, \"Bare Ruined Choirs,\" has drawn notice in Hollywood, the land where greater men than Fink have found their choirs silenced, their inspiration dried up faster than wet nylons under strong sun.\r A deco-period film by Ethan and Joel Coen, \"Barton Fink\" is in fact their own creative solution to the writer's block that plagued them during the making of \"Miller's Crossing.\" A triumph for the offbeat, grimly funny brothers, it reveals in its mythic fashion the vagaries of the creative process that plague every artist.\r The giving and gifted John Turturro stars as Fink, a self-absorbed and pompous naif who loses his bearings when he accepts a lucrative position with Capitol Pictures. Unwilling to give up all his snobbish principles, he checks into the threadbare Earle Hotel, a regal dump where he wrestles with his conscience, his assignment and his new next-door neighbor, Charlie Meadows.\r John Goodman plays this gregarious fellow, a traveling insurance salesman whose frequent intrusions give Fink a not unwelcome excuse for not writing. Meadows, who seems to embody the qualities of the common man whom Fink so arrogantly imagines he represents in his art, becomes the writer's closest confidant and eventually his wildly unpredictable muse.\r There is the decidedly rank smell of brimstone in the air at the Earle (its slogan is \"Stay a Night or a Lifetime\"), the primary setting for this latest version of the Mephistopheles story. It's 1941 in Los Angeles and a heat wave has settled over the city like a sticky gravy. It's so hot the wallpaper is peeling off in Fink's room, the paste running down the walls in gooey rivulets. That this is a leaky, living hell there is no doubt.\r The Earle is also alive with the sounds of night: the creaking of ceilings and the protests of bed springs, grunts, thumps, screams, wails and wheezing doors. Decorated in ghastly shades -- maroon, olive drab and bloodstain brown -- the Earle seems an organic being as crucial to this haunting tale as the spirit ship was to \"The Flying Dutchman.\" A gurgling, heaving purgatory, it seems a most likely place to teach understanding and punish arrogance.\r And Barton Fink is assuredly a smug whelp deserving of a lesson. He claims to be interested in the stories of the common man, in establishing a theater for the masses. Yet when Charlie says, \"I can tell you stories that would curl your hair,\" Barton, all wrapped up in how magnanimous he is, barely notices. Dire consequences await.\r The Coens have as much compassion as contempt for their hero, who looks vaguely like a cross between the brothers, a goofy intellectual at once shyly baffled and supercilious. Neither a talker nor a listener, Barton sometimes calls up visions of the kidnapped baby in \"Raising Arizona.\" Fink, Turturro shows us, is only a babe among the fast-talking big kids of Hollywood. Still, he's his own weird man, a victim less of the system than of his own unexamined leftist ideals.\r The movie takes an irreverent poke at the industry, setting the hero against such marvelous old-style blowhards as Capitol Pictures' studio boss, Jack Lipnick (Michael Lerner) and the slippery producer Ben Geisler (Tony Shalhoub), who has been assigned to supervise Barton's first film. Puzzled at Fink's reluctance to begin the script, Geisler loses patience: \"Wallace Beery, wrestling picture. What do ya need, a road map?\"\r Barton next turns to a fellow writer, W.P. Mayhew (John Mahoney), for advice. A Faulknerian novelist who drinks heavily and abuses his secretary, Audrey (Judy Davis), Mayhew also sees through the posturing of Fink. Audrey, part belle, part dame, tries to nurture the younger man's talent, but her efforts unfortunately come to a very bad end, which propels the tale to its obscurely symbolic but ultimately penetrable conclusion.\r The winner of an unprecedented three prizes at the Cannes Film Festival this year, \"Barton Fink\" is certainly one of the year's best and most intriguing films. Though it defies genre, it seems to work best as a tart self-portrait, a screwball film noir that expresses the Coens' own alienation from Hollywood. A cineaste's landmark on a par with \"Blue Velvet,\" this is an experience to savor over and over.",
