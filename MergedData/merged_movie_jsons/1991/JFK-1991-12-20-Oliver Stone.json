            "content": "On the field of storytelling, \"JFK\" reminds of Costa Gavras' \"Z\", a political thriller meticulously deconstructing a politician's murder in a fictional Fascist country. Yet it owes more to Akira Kurosawa's \"Rashomon\" which presented one reality from as many angles as levels of subjectivity. It's interesting that these films, all one-word titled, were made in the same intervals of time and like \"Rashomon\" and \"Z\", \"JFK\" is less a name than a code that encapsulates behind the mystery and the patriotic mask, a more universal truth about humanity.Still, patriotism is seriously involved and it's very significant that Oliver Stone, one of America's most prolific political film-makers, much more a Vietnam vet, handled the subject of Kennedy's assassination. As a man who practiced America's ideals on a muddy battlefield, Stone is entitled to question these values he fought for and the integrity of the leaders that sent him out there: indeed, why would America send soldiers to fight foreigners in Vietnam? Why so far when Cuba is so close? Money is the key. There are no warmongers but businessmen who generate money out of all the steel, the guns, the helicopters, the machines that are blown to pieces in Asia. In fact, Stone didn't make a Vietnam and a President trilogy but a colossal oeuvre about Politics and War. And to a certain extent, Kennedy can be regarded as one of the Vietnam War's victims, as a collateral damage: he was against the conflict and got killed before putting an end to it. It doesn't point an accusing finger on the Army, but it highlights at least one serious motive for Kennedy's assassination.And that's the essence of the investigation lead by District Attorney Garrison, Kevin Costner at the peak of his bank-ability. Garrison isn't satisfied with the conclusions of the Warren Commission that validated the \"isolated killer\" theory, incarnated by Lee Harvey Oswald (a remarkable Gary Oldman) who conveniently died before his trial. What was his motive anyway? The Commission closed the case, leaving a bunch of altered testimonies, witnesses silenced before exposing their truth and so many unanswered questions. Garrison smells something fishy and who wouldn't? And the compass to guide his investigation is the elementary question: who benefits from the crime? And this is where Kennedy's assassination takes a sort of legendary aura, playing as a modern version of Julius Caesar. Kennedy could have made a lot of enemies everywhere: CIA, Russia, Cubans, although I wouldn't regard it as an omission, the film didn't even mention the possibility of an involvement from the Federal Reserve Bank since Kennedy always defended the sovereignty of the dollar. But as the film progresses, it gets clearer that Kennedy was a man to eliminate, and one of \"JFK\"'s highlights (which is saying a lot) is carried by the revelations delivered by Donald Sutherland as Mr. X, in Washington.There are two levels in \"JFK\", the mystery surrounding the murder and the investigation, what happened and what is known. And both interact in a masterstroke of editing, probably one of the most complicated, intricate and brilliant ever committed to screen, certainly a school-case for wannabe editors. Literally, \"JFK\" is served like a salad of documents, flashbacks, excerpts from the Zapruder film, archive footage, memories, truths and lies, shot in every possible way (sepia, 16mm, amateur, black and white) and as Roger Ebert pointed out, the film would have been harder to follow with an unchanging shooting. The salad is rich but digestible.And like a 1000-piece puzzle, \"JFK\" is an assemblage of different portions of reality that tend to get Garrison, if not closer to the 'final image', further from the Warren's conclusions. On that level, the film provides an extraordinary cast of supporting characters, from Jack Lemmon to Joe Pesci, from Kevin Bacon to John Candy, each one leading to one certainty: there was a conspiracy. The analysis of the Zapruder film revealed the timing between the first and last shot, making implausible the 'one-killer' hypothesis, even if he's a sharpshooter. And this very implausibility implies the presence of a second person, which is enough to validate the idea of a conspiracy.And last but not least, there's the excitability of some interrogated people who know that they put their lives at stakes if they talk. The film is driven by a sense of paranoia that conveys its greatest thrills. What can be more emotionally engaging than a quest for truth anyway, especially when it undermines the deepest beliefs of any good citizen? One of Garrison's employees, played by Michael Rooker, can't accept the possibility of Johnson's involvement, even Garrison's wife (Sissy Spacek) represent this side of America that wants to turn the page. Garrison has detractors and it starts in his own private circle, before he becomes a target for the media.Garrison embodies the struggle of a man who wants to reconcile with America's ideals, he doesn't fight the government because he's against it, but because the government acts against the people. He feels like owing this to Kennedy, to his vision of America, to his sons, and as his investigation goes on, he witnesses the deaths of Martin Luther King, of Bobby Kennedy, and realizes that the system that killed Kennedy still prevails. Garrison's struggle is magnificently conveyed by the sort of inspirational score that only John Williams could have performed.\"JFK\" works on every cinematic level, it's one of the best political films and best conspiracy movies ever made because it doesn't try to tell its own truth but to belie a fallacious version. It starts with an axiom: there was a conspiracy, and as long as it won't be solved, there's an emotional wound in America's heart that would never be healed.",

            "content": "Is there any crime or event in American history that has more mystery surrounding it than JFK's assassination? The number of books, lectures, articles etc. dedicated to it could fill the Superdome. For Americans anyway, it is up there with who is Jack the Ripper, who built the pyramids, and did we really land on the moon. OK. Take out that last one. I just wanted to see if you were paying attention.\"JFK\" was a magnificent movie. I've only watched a handful of three-hour movies in my life (Ghandi, Malcolm X, Heat, Lion of the Desert, Das Boot, and maybe a couple of others), yet I don't think any captivated me as much as this one did. I figured it only had high marks because of the subject matter or because of a strong cult following. Well, if that's the case, count me as a cult member.For a three-hour movie with little to no action and much deliberation and dialogue, this movie did wonderfully. I attempted to read a voluminous book on the JFK assassination, but I petered out after one volume and I'd only gotten as far as detailed evidence about the bullet. \"JFK\" goes into the assassination like nothing I've seen or heard before. I'd probably say that not a thing was left out. There was even real footage which came in incredibly handy during the movie.No expense was spared in this film and no corners were cut. They went all out with quality actors, a flawless script, and seamless cohesive plot. This is exactly what you'd want to see from a movie detailing the JFK assassination: put the rat on the table and address the elephant in the room. I didn't think Oliver Stone could outdo \"Born on the Fourth of July,\" I was wrong.",

I've watched it several times, and finally bought both the original theatrical version, and the director cut. While both are excellent, I recommend the director's cut which has added material.I had turned 10 a month before the assassination of President Kennedy. I'm now 71. I thought we'd know the truth by now, but we don't. Or do we? Perhaps the movie JFK IS the truth.As I stated before, this is a fascinating and thought provoking film and I think every American should see at least once.A big thank you to Jim Garrison for digging for the truth and sharing his findings. And a huge thank you to Oliver Stone for putting it on film, not once, but twice, and then revisiting it in documentary form in the 2020's.We may never know the truth about the assassination, but we should keep looking for answers, and remembering.",

Stone is in no way saying Garrison's theory is what happened to the President. He is basically telling people not to be naive when it comes to the government. I think the last few years have really hammered that home.My friend's dad was second in command for the FBI in Dallas when Kennedy was assassinated. For years and years, her journalist husband tried (in vain) to get something out of him. He was quite casual about it - oh, you know, I just read such and such. And his father-in-law would say, oh, really? NADA.I don't think we'll ever know who was responsible for the assasination. But if you want to see a compelling film, this is it.",

            "content": "Despite JFK is considered a classic to this day and it has a very high score of 8,0 on IMDB I only saw this movie three months ago and I am glad I did it since I could see why it's highly praised to this day.The movie is about Jim Garrison's (Kevin Costner) journey to find the truth about the Kennedy murder that happened on November 22, 1963. During the course of his investigations he comes across all the people that knew Lee Harvey Oswald (Gary Oldman) before the murder. After a long series of meetings, personal crisis with his family (since his wife thinks that he is more concerned in the Kennedy murder case than his family) and a long trial he still thinks that he hasn't found the truth yet.I'll discuss what I liked about this movie. The acting is exceptional by everyone involved: Kevin Costner gives one of his best performances of his career and in my opinion he should have won the Academy Award for Best Actor. All the supporting roles are played by famous faces of those years: Michael Rooker and Wayne Knight play Jim Garrison's colleagues, Kevin Bacon steals the scene as a male prostitute that gives Garrison some shocking revelations about one of Oswald's friends with which he plotted the murder while in Cuba: Clay Shaw (Tommy Lee Jones), a Louisiana businessman that was subsequently acquitted after the trial; also Joe Pesci and Donald Sutherland give great scene-stealing performances. And in supporting roles, despite they don't share scenes together, Jack Lemmon (as a journalist) and Walter Matthau (as a senator).The direction by Oliver Stone is very good and the cinematography is very slick and stylish. The soundtrack is among the best musical scores from 1990s movies (second only to SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION) and it will remain stuck in your memory even hours after you watch the movie. The script is very clever. As I wrote in the summary it may be a very long movie at 3 hours and 17 minutes but I accepted it since it's a movie based on a true story and the long running time was useful for letting the viewers (especially the ones interested in this historical period) know all the details.In substance, this is a true masterpiece thanks to great cinematography, great direction and great acting by everyone and I would probably consider it Oliver Stone's best movie (second only to BORN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY). Truly a masterpiece that deserves all the praise and positive reviews and worth recommended.",

            "content": "\"JFK\" was and remains so controversial that any positive reviews (not to say they were characteristic) it received were dwarfed by the trashing to which it was subjected in the official press, which started well before it was released.  This was disturbing, for what is the big need -- it is just a movie.  But to so many \"JFK\" was not, it was somehow threatening.\nUltimately, it does not matter whether JFK's conclusion is correct, and I am even willing to give a little more license than I normally would to more-substantive, as well as less-important, inaccuracies, although I have my limits here too.   But this movie's significance is just that it was made.  For although other films had chronicled the events surrounding the assassination, none had in any substantial way sought to discredit the Warren Commission, as was so absolutely merited.Regardless of your opinion on what really happened, it is my view that everyone should be critical of the media, which were so obsequious to the Warren Commission.  The New York Times from the start referred to Oswald as the \"assassin,\" not the \"suspect.\"    Life Magazine altered photos strongly suggesting a shot had been fired from the grassy knoll.   Many years later, when being interviewed by Dan Rather about his film, Oliver Stone said to his face, referring to the event:  \"Where were you, Dan?\"\nIndeed, in a documentary he made, Rather said, \"in the absence of any CREDIBLE evidence, we can only...\"  This fallacy is a betrayal of the legal definition of evidence, with Rather's poor characterization of the word \"credible.\"  There is enormous, indeed endless, evidence contradicting the Warren Commission's view, and much of it is certainly credible, including all the evidence of the Commission's own efforts to conduct a dishonest and incomplete investigation and intimidate witnesses into changing their testimony to support the version it wanted.  In fact, I consider it Gerald Ford's greatest character flaw that he served on it and backed its conduct and conclusion, a far more disturbing matter than his pardon of Nixon. Whether the evidence to which Rather referred is CONCLUSIVE is another story; that is up to us, the jury.  The sort of smugness Rather shows has been characteristic of much of the media, and I do not know all the reasons they behaved as they did.  Thus, we needed a more courageous, enterprising person like Oliver Stone to step in and fill the gap -- the overwhelming majority of people believe the Commission got it wrong.Stone's enlistment of mere hypotheticals, theorized by Garrison (setting aside the final scene--there were moments before) or whoever, has been subjected to unfair, ill-conceived criticism.  Most people who knew anything at all about the assassination believed there were problems with the Commission's version before they saw this film, and came out of it with an elaboration and hypothesis, not a mindbender.  Even if we concede that some younger viewers knew little about the assassination, the notion of the critics of \"JFK\" that the film would automatically program their minds is an insult to their intelligence, of the ability of people in general to think and come to their own conclusions.  Indeed, no one to whom I have EVER spoken has betrayed a view of events that reflects even most, if not all, of Stone's conclusions.  If any programming is called for, it is to program people against the Commission's version, not, as its defenders would wish, against Stone.  For no one can be programmed to accept Stone's alternate view.OK, some inaccuracies of Stone can be criticized, such as his portrayal of Garrison (All-American Kevin Costner, natch) as a wholesome hero, and the time-between-shots issue (it is now generally conceded that there was enough time, based on all the evidence, for Oswald to have done it, for those who believe he did).  Perhaps the speech by David Ferrie never occurred, but it still reflects the widely held view that the CIA and Mafia worked together in this matter.  Certainly, many people in the government despised Kennedy, and there were substantially more elements of this hostility than portrayed in the film.  Anyway, we can go on and on.  The Warren Commission tried to cover up overwhelming evidence that Ruby knew Oswald, that a shot was fired from the grassy knoll, that a dark-skinned man fired shots from the Dallas School Book Depository, and that Officer Tippit was killed by someone other than Oswald (actually, two people).  Well, at least some members resisted the single bullet theory (I guess that passes Rather's definition of \"credible\"), although they ultimately signed the report.I do not agree with Oliver Stone's specific ultimate conclusion about the central moving force of the assassination.   But he has the right to suggest the U.S. government was involved, and many, including myself, think it was involved somehow, but that what is debatable is merely to what extent and how far up.  Hats off to Stone for his courage and thoughtfulness in making his necessary statement.9 out of 10",

            "content": "Oliver Stone's epic film which follows the real-life events of New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison is a monumental movie event.  It should have been named the Best Picture of 1991 instead of The Silence of the Lambs.Everything about this film is perfect and it shows that when an intriguing story comes together with all other elements of filmmaking that are executed brilliantly, the film works on so many levels.First off, Stone's direction is as good as it gets.  He has an incredible passion for the subject, knowledge of the art and relationship with the camera.  All of his footage goes together seamlessly and makes the 3 h 08 min running time blow by.  He gets a strong performance out of the entire ensemble cast especially Costner, Jones, Oldman, and Pesci.Scalia and Hutsching's editing is a work of art and tells the complicated story with incredible precision.  Richardson's cinematography lights up the screen in both colour and black and white.  Both of these technical aspects of filmmaking are molded into sheer artistry by these three men who have all deserved their Oscars for this film.John Williams' score is one of his best (right up there with his Indiana Jones and Star Wars).  The script is intelligent, thought-provoking, mesmorizing and heart-wrenching.  Costner's closing speech to the Jury is finer that Nicholson's in A Few Good Men, McConaughey's in A Time to Kill and Jackson's in Pulp Fiction.  It is Stone and Sklar's best work.The subject matter is incredibly controverial and subjective but Stone's delivers it with such emotion and raw power that his alternate myth to the Warren Report seems factual.  The film is an investigation into the human spirit and how the vigour and dedication of one man and his team of associates can rise above the highest powers of the world and encode a message into the minds and hearts of millions.  John F. Kennedy has countless achievements and qualities as a president which makes his life and term one of the most incredible and worthy of deep study.Oliver Stone's JFK should go down in film history as one of the most important American films ever produced.  Watch it with an open mind free of prejudice and predisposition and you will find yourself wanting to go to the library and learn more about this global tragedy.",

            "content": "I have stated many times that Oliver Stone is an incredible film maker whose films sizzle with excellent cinematography, good acting, and original storyline. He makes controversial films that are sometimes unappreciated by the public and the critics. I said and believed all this even before I watched \"JFK\".\"JFK\" is a film that stars many A-list actors in major and minor roles, but they give deep imprints nonetheless. Tommy Lee Jones, the Oscar nominated actor of the film, gives a performance that I almost missed due to my not recognizing him. Jones plays Clay Shaw, a powerful figure in New Orleans and a secret homosexual who knew about the plot to kill the president. Gary Oldman is fantastic as the widely publicized murderer, Lee Harvey Oswald. Joe Pesci, fresh from his Oscar in \"Goodfellas\", as Dave Ferrie, a man who is struggling to cope with the heavy accusations and mysteries of the JFK murder. Donald Sutherland in an Oscar-worthy performance, as an informant that talks to Jim Garrison, played wonderfully by Kevin Costner. Other great appearances include Kevin Bacon, Sissy Spacek, Michael Rooker, and even Walter Matthau in a bit appearance.Many of these fine performances were worthy of Oscars, but if there is one man that deserved an Oscar more than anyone else, it would have to be Oliver Stone, who did not win Best Director OR Best Picture. Who did he lose to? \"Silence of the Lambs\". While I do consider the film to be an excellent thriller featuring one of Anthony Hopkins' greatest performances, I must say that in terms of scope and daring, \"JFK\" was a far superior film. The cinematography was far more varied and ambitious, as well as the subject matter itself. I can understand why \"JFK\" was passed over, but the reasons are not fair to the extraordinary film given to us.The appearance of \"JFK\" is astounding. You are taken to a time of much distrust, horror, confusion, corruption, and cover-up. The murders of JFK, Martin Luther King, and RFK all influenced the time periods and the peoples. Many people tried not to think about it, or else they were scared into silence. Some, like Jim Garrison, tried to present the truth of \"JFK\", and their efforts are being felt even now.Before I saw this film, I had seen Oliver comment that \"JFK\" was a movie in which he got all the crazy theories and presented them. He was not implying that everything was true, and some of it isn't true. But after seeing this film, I am convinced there was definitely more to the story than was originally told, as I believed even before I saw \"JFK\". This gave me a knowledge of the period, and awareness of the people participating in the drama of the time.The point of the film is not entirely based on the story of the JFK assassination. It is an outcry from Oliver Stone to remind us that truth is never simple, nor is it always presented by the government. People must struggle to find the truth sometimes, and if it is covered up, it could be lost forever. The film is an attempt to show us that the murder of President Kennedy was a time of much confusion and mix-up. So what was true and what was not? Many eye-witnesses gave conflicted views, while other circumstances were strange in their origins and happening. And while he gave us this, Oliver Stone also presented us with the best film that he has yet made, and his resume is incredible as it is.I have seen the films \"Platoon\" and \"Born on the Fourth of July\": films that Oliver Stone won Best Director for. Why did he not win for \"JFK\"? Why did it only win 2 Oscars? For me, it is another example of how disappointing the Oscar results can be. I urge all to see this epic film of mystery and deceit, of truth and lies, the work of a master film director known as Oliver Stone.",

            "content": "JFK is a movie that always frustrates me. I am not frustrated because it is bad or the historical inaccuracies people point out. Rather because it's so good it always angers me how underrated this masterpiece is. This of course did receive generally good reviews with a 83% on Rotten Tomatoes and a 72 Metascore, I think this deserves more than just \"generally favorable reviews\". Many trash this movie which I, with all due respect, don't get why. If you haven't seen this movie I demand you to stop reading this review, get up the couch and go buy this movie right now.\nAs you can guess from the very \"creative\" title, this movie is about the investigation of the JFK assassination centering district attorney Jim Garrison played by Kevin Costner. This movie is even speaking visually a masterpiece. The editing is excellent using both black & white and color masterfully to create this sense of mystery. The performances are all excellent with the obvious ones being Kevin Costner and Tommy Lee Jones who give unforgettable performances, and the score of course is phenomenal. But what makes this movie so wonderful is how this it is perfectly written. If there is a way to describe this movie, it is that the conspiracy gets uglier as it gets going. What I mean by that is first the film starts with a pretty simple well known hypothesis that Oswald actually did not kill Kennedy. But as the three hour runtime proceeds, the conspiracy gets as big as the involvement of LBJ and the White House. As the facts get presented you can see how the truth is uglier than what we know from the Warren commission, and how there is a bigger power preventing us from knowing the truth. At the climax of the movie, Oliver Stone challenges us, \"Is the justice system we live in really practice justice?\" This is a movie that we all want to ignore to avoid the most shameful truth of our justice system, but as Americans we must face this and question the system we currently have.\nOverall this is a terrific movie that is very criminally overlooked. I honestly can't understand why this is not on the IMDb top 250 in a world where Hachi: A Dog's tale and a bunch of Bollywood musicals can make it in. This is a perfect example that IMDb overlook real masterpieces like this one and are just obsessed with Indian movies (Like seriously! Why is IMDb obsessed with Indian movies!). Though I don't give a lot of these, I give this one a 10/10 and a A+. It is very unfortunate the maximum rating is 10/10 in IMDb, since if there is no limitations I would rate this a 20/10.",

            "content": "In the time since I first saw the film \"JFK\", I have found myself inexplicably drawn to the events in Dallas, TX on November 22, 1963. I have researched online and in libraries to learn the truth of these events, and I would say that my outlook on those matters has changed substantially. But underneath that, and the controversy that developed from it, there is one universal and almost indisputable truth regarding the film: JFK is simply an excellent movie. And no difference of opinion can refute this.I have seen my fair share of films over the years, I'm not a cinema maniac by any means. But I think I can judge a quality product when I see one and that's simply what this picture presents. It is, as Tom Wicker of the New York Times said at it's release, propaganda; but the same can be said for every film by Michael Moore... of whom I'm NOT a fan... but they are still strong pictures.JFK runs the difficult task of presenting fact, fiction, conjecture and opinion, twisting them all to present the increasingly difficult to dispute conclusion that Lee Harvey Oswald did not act alone (and according to director Oliver Stone, did not act) in the assassination of President Kennedy.The films accomplishments though, past this controversial thesis, are many: 1.) Kevin Costner turns in one of the greatest performances of his career. While his accent is stronger than Garrison and the physical resemblance not astonishing, Costner three dimensionalizes a character and lives in it throughout the film.2.) An impressive and versatile cast is used superbly. The film is loaded with quality stars such as Kevin Bacon, Tommy Lee Jones (in an Oscar nominated role), Gary Oldman, and Joe Pesci (who share an intense and crucial scene); as well as character actors and actresses such as Michael Rooker, Sissy Spacek, and Jay Saunders. Stone even navigates a dramatic turn from the late comedy great John Candy and utilizes Hollywood legends Ed Asner, Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau and Donald Sutherland superbly.3.) With the possible exception of the lone gunman theory, every possibility of truth is explored, at least in dialogue. Because the case has never been fully elaborated on no one can say for certain what the truth is; Stone presents all views while advancing his theory.4.) The film is a masterwork of editing. It won the Oscar for film editing in 1991, and deserved it. I once read in Entertainment Weekly that a normal film has roughly 200 cuts in it; there are more than sixty in the opening minutes alone here. Even more impressive when you consider the variety of film used.JFK is not absolute fact, it does not truly pretend to be. By Stone's own admission, Laurie Metcalf, Michael Rooker, and Kevin Bacon play composites or dramatized characters, not the real thing. But standing alone as a movie, JFK is untouchably excellent. And if it does force you to question, as Costner's Garrison asks in the closing moments \"of what is our government made?\", then it's all for the better.",

            "review_title": "A Stunningly Well Planned and Articulated Film",
            "content": "Oliver Stone is undoubtedly one of the most controversial directors of all time, his work has included horrifyingly real stories of Vietnam, stories of the corruption of politics and a much-despised account of Jim Morrison's life. No matter the subject matter, Stone always gives it his all and sometimes the world's response is positive and sometimes it's negative. With JFK we are faced with one of his films that was probably one of his most successful (next to Platoon of 1986). This is a rare instance in which the public loved the concept of conspiracy in their own country, and took special interest in the debates that it caused amongst the government upon release. The best thing about this film is that it is and was treated as so much more than a film. My honest opinion is that this response was created not because of a more plausible theory but because of Stone's fantastic and unique job putting the story together.The film opens on a surprisingly suspenseful scene of the murder of John F. Kennedy. The chopped style of the scene lets you know that something is not right, dramatic black and white shots spliced with the blurry grain shots of the home video taken by a witness (it won Academy Awards for Best Film Editing and Best Cinematography). This, accompanied by John Williams' excellent original score helped do an excellent job of creating a mood, just for this very first scene. Often times a director will stop after this, give it his all for style and then stop after the first scene, but Stone doesn't do this. He makes the film so much more than a boring investigation; he takes you in to each of the puzzle pieces  (indeed, it feels like you're with Kevin Costner \"digging\" through hundreds of events.) For 90% of these clips that lace the film's concepts together, the camera is not kept steady, it is, indeed, like you are there witnessing it. The human eye doesn't only look at what is important, and a situation of trauma can make everything seem broken, confused. Oliver Stone doesn't try to make sure you understand what's going on. Some frown upon this, but it's realistic and that's what counts.Kevin Costner plays Jim Garrison, the district attorney of New Orleans who investigates the murder of John Kennedy. Sometimes you are expected to disagree (at first) with some of Garrison's presumptuous statements, and when you do there is always at least one character around who will agree with you. Stone realizes most viewers aren't devoted enough to believe everything Garrison says no matter what it is throughout the film. Stone has said that he wants people to \"rethink history\" and that this film is not guaranteed fact, but an \"alternate myth\" to the myth that has been presented before. The story is not solid because very few ideas or people or events in life are. What I mean to say is that Garrison's comments are not necessarily ridiculous, it's just a matter of how hard he tries to support them. The focus constantly changes -- yes, Costner will smile a bit when he makes a ridiculous remark that everyone rolls their eyes at, yes, even at the end of the film some clips will be left unchecked, and yes, you will see that there is no way that the question \"who killed JFK\" is answered as simply, solidly, and, dare I say it, Hollywood-esquely as a one man killing. If you watch this movie looking for real life, without dramatization and without guaranteed entertainment and fun, you will be impressed. This is not a popcorn movie.And finally a word should be said about the actors' enhancement of the realism of the film. Most notable are Joe Pesci as the frantic David Ferrie who pretends to be a victim but truly (we see) had much more to do with it than he pretends (although convincingly was not an assassin -- he blows the whole thing out of proportion \"this is too f*cking big for you, you know that?\") and Tommy Lee Jones as the wry ring leader Claw Shaw, who seems to be a pompous upscale member of society that has been doing the dark business of conspiracy behind closed doors. The fact that these characters can appear real to us and not just appear as familiar actors taking on a role (as you might feel in Ocean's Eleven) truly does the film justice in driving it forward.This is in fact one of my top three favorite movies, but I tend to refrain from mentioning it as just this to my friends-- I'm sooner to mention Memento or Fight Club. The reason for this is that the movie is almost an acquired taste, and certainly not normal entertainment for a teenager. It's honestly written for a generation above me, but everything that makes it (up to and including the \"kings are killed\" and other political themes) are intriguing to me, and for me anything intriguing grows to be a favorite. Even if the subject is not something that ever really impacted me, I take themes to heart, and I always love a good \"enigma wrapped in a riddle.\"NOTES: -Maybe a point off for being inconsistent in goal. Though as admirable in a movie as any other characteristic, I found this to be the most restricting on ability to follow along. -Also notable is the fact that it's very release sparked opening of sealed governmental records on the subject.OVERALL: A+",

            "content": "JFK (1991) **** (out of 4) Is there really a need to go into the plot? Oliver Stone's film still manages to stir up all sorts of controversy. I first saw this movie when I was just eleven and I still remember every single minute that my friends and I had inside that theater. I had never quite seen anything like this movie and even though Stone would use this style in future films (like NATURAL BORN KILLERS) there's still no question that he created something quite powerful here. I really don't care what side of the decade you're on, this film will at least get some sort of emotion out of you.Watching the film again on its theatrical re-released, I must admit that it has held up quite well and it's pretty amazing that Stone is able to take this rather confusing story without countless plots and characters and maintain your focus throughout its long running time and make it to where you can understand everything going on. In a recent interview Stone said having such an all-star cast helped the film so much because you know the actors so you can believe what they're telling you or what Stone is trying to sell. This is certainly true because it's rather amazing how many terrific actors are in this thing and its even more special today considering how many of them are no longer with us. The cast is without question exceptional and this is especially true for Kevin Costner who turns in a terrific performance as Jim Garrison, the New Orleans D.A. who decides to bring up charges in the Kennedy assassination. Tommy Lee Jones and Joe Pesci are especially memorable in their roles as are Gary Oldman, Kevin Bacon, John Candy and Sissy Spacek. Michael Rooker is another one who stands out and how about that long speech that Donald Sutherland must give? Then you have vets like Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon. Flawless casting all around.The screenplay obviously wants to sell its opinion that there were many conspiracies around the Kennedy assassination. I can't say I believe everything that's being sold here but it does make for an interesting jumping off point in regards to debating what really happened. The way Stone uses black and white footage for the flashbacks was quite terrific and then you have the brilliant score from John Williams that really hammers home the best moments of the film. The final act takes place inside the courtroom and these moments are among the most chilling that you're ever going to see. This is also where the editing is so important as Costner's character tries to sell the conspiracy theory. I know its impossible to bring this movie up without all sorts of controversy but I've never thought that was a bad thing as long as it could lead to an interesting debate. There's no question that Stone had a mission with this movie and he completely succeeded with one of the best of the decade.",

            "content": "An overwrought, frustrating, tense growing political drama. Riveting in spite of all these obstacles. In watching this film again for the third time since it was released, it's obvious that this is a movie consumed with itself important, overly cinematic and frequently unintentionally funny. The combination of director Oliver Stone and leading man Kevin Costner as well as an ensemble of some of the top stars of the past 60 plus years (many in quick cameos that get uncomfortable giggles) has this taking a very serious subject matter (the investigation into the assassination of a president) and using very quick editing that at times has the viewer riveted and other times rolling their eyes in frustration at the audacity.Much of the film is vintage news real footage of the events leading up to the assassination of President Kennedy in November 1963. District Attorney Kevin Costner is viewing everything as it happens, and somehow becomes involved in an investigation that tries to prove that Lee Harvey Oswald was either uninvolved or not involved all alone. Much of the storyline focuses on his marriage to wife Sissy Spacek, neglecting their family and causing her to debate whether she should walk out on him because of his psychological obsession with dealing with nothing but the investigation and not spending quality time with their children, but eventually she begins to understand why it is so important and he begins to balance I'll do investigation with their family life.Then there are the cameos for supporting roles of people he interviews or cross-examines or has arrested, and they include such powerful actors as Tommy Lee Jones, Joe Pesci, Kevin Bacon and most impressively Donald Sutherland who explains in very dramatic detail exactly what led to Kennedy being assassinated and who and why were behind it. There are also comic actors in dramatic roles including Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau and John Candy, as well as a few newcomers who have risen up the ladder of success since this came out. It is like going under the Christmas tree and finding far too many presents and wondering which one has the most desired gift in it. A bit too much to handle.Certainly the movie was automatically ripe for parody, leading to the Oscars that year including other films discussing the Kennedy assassination in film clip edits, and there are moments where you begin to wonder what Stone was thinking in creating such an operatic viewpoint of a tragedy people still discuss in remembrance of what happened on that fateful Dallas November day. It is a film that you can rip your shreds with its conspiracy theories if you don't agree with them or find fault with because of the structure in which the story is cold, but it's undeniable that's a film is impressive in many ways even though I can't give it a full 10 out of 10.The storyline involving a New Orleans gay businessman somehow being the main suspect has chuckles because of the obvious playing stereotypical gay men. Pesci, wearing a hideous toupee, gives a memorable performance, but the hairstyle is a rival to Barbara Stanwyck's in \"Double Indemnity\" for silliness. Spacek is always watchable and gives a very warm performance, while Costner overdoes the sincerity and the obsession, even though you can't help but admire him. It's Sutherland who comes off the best, although the intensity of the editing in that scene does become a bit too much. It is far from flawless, but there are many things that one can find mesmerizing while many others just create the head to shake and the eyes to roll. If watching this on video made me feel dizzy at times, imagine how I must have felt 31 years ago when going to the theater to see it.",

            "content": "The first film in Oliver Stone's films about the American presidency, JFK is a historical drama exploring a popular conspiracy theory regarding John F. Kennedy's assassination, adapted from the books On the Trail of the Assassins by Jim Garrison and Crossfire: The Plot That Killed Kennedy by Jim Marrs. On November 22, 1963, President John F. Kennedy was shot and killed in Dallas, Texas, allegedly by Lee Harvey Oswald (Gary Oldman). The inciting incident occurs when New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison notices several inaccuracies in the Warren Report (the official investigation of the assassination) and decides to reexamine the case of Kennedy's death. Garrison and his team pursue the truth at all costs, and eventually take Kennedy's death to court to ask: who really is responsible for killing the President?Clocking in at more than three hours, the film has a definite focus on its story, with every element of the film being used to further the plot. Garrison is a modern hero in the film, a city DA that rises to the enormous challenge of investigating the President's assassination. Kevin Costner seems to perfectly capture this type of character (also achieving a thick, charming southern accent) and connecting with the viewers. He is surrounded by an all-star supporting cast, all of which truly become the real life figures they portray. Stone writes believable and engaging dialogue, but since the film focuses so heavily on story, he spends little time developing the characters. Oliver Stone is a controversial director, and his style can be very polarizing, but personally, I enjoyed his strange method of storytelling. The costumes seemed appropriate for the setting, and the set designs were extraordinary, particularly the recreations of 1960s city streets such as Dallas and New Orleans.John Williams was responsible for writing the film's score, and was nominated for an Oscar for his efforts. Williams was busy writing the score for Hook around the same time, so he actually wrote themes for the film before the film was shot. This resulted in Stone cutting and editing the film to the music, instead of the typical method of fitting the music to the film. Williams gives JFK a tragic, but heroic theme, but also incorporates pulsing synthesizers for the investigative scenes (an unusual tactic for the composer). This resulted in an effective score and a seamless integration with the film. The cinematography was unusual, but played a very important role in the story. The film opens with a montage of newsreel clips from JFK's presidency. It slowly intersperses Stone's own clips, but the lighting and coloring (black-and-white and grainy film) make the clips all seem genuine. Much of the film is shot in this manner, giving a very real sense to the story, very similar to a documentary. I can honestly say this film would not have been the same had it not been for this unique approach to cinematography.JFK (rated R) contains strong language throughout, and the assassination scenes may be too graphic for young viewers. The 3-hour runtime will bore some; however, any lover of historical dramas or investigative thrillers will finish the film asking for more. The film is an emotional journey, and viewers will always find themselves rooting for Garrison and his seemingly impossible quest. I give this film a B+, finding it \"guilty\" of keeping me on the edge of my seat.",

            "content": "I've avoided watching this film intentionally ever since it came out because I didn't want to be inundated with another whole set of conspiracy theories involving the assassination of John F. Kennedy. I've generally accepted the idea that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone, but if the story here of District Attorney Jim Garrison's obsession with the facts is even remotely accurate, then there's probably some room for doubt. I'm not saying I'm convinced, but what I am saying is that director Oliver Stone pieced together an intriguing and compelling film here, even if one were to hold fast to any prior opinions. What struck me as interesting was when Garrison (Kevin Costner) stated to his legal team that even if his prosecution of Clay Shaw (Tommy Lee Jones) failed, his long term goal was to give the American people ample opportunity to weigh all the conflicting evidence and eventually force the government to reveal the classified information on the assassination. Of course, with the film made in 1991, it's already coming upon the twenty five to thirty year time span referenced by Garrison and we're no closer to finding the truth. I kind of doubt that we ever will know what really happened on that tragic day in Dallas.For true devotees studying the Kennedy assassination, an excellent companion piece for this movie would be the 1998 documentary, \"Image of an Assassination: A New Look at the Zapruder Film\". It won't put to rest any of the vast conspiracy theories, nor does it try to. What it does is present an intriguing story of how the Zapruder film came about, and how it captured a defining moment in the history of America, tragic as it was. Not for the queasy or ill at ease, it's a serious piece of film making that will affect you almost as much as the actual event did for those who were alive during the era to witness the tragedy as it unfolded on television.",

            "content": "Few events in American history stand out quite so heavily as the assassination of President John F. Kennedy on November 22, 1963. Besides the shocking nature of the event with the American president being gunned down in broad daylight in a major city came the psychic scars caused by unanswered questions due to an alleged assassin gunned down before he could ever be tried and an official investigation that was at best botched and, at worst, a whitewash. Perhaps no single film or work of fiction has done more to raise questions about the event than Oliver Stone's 1991 JFK with its exploration of events through the perspective of Jim Garrison, the New Orleans District Attorney who brought to trial of the one alleged conspirators.Stone, along with his co-screenwriter Zachary Sklar, craft a peculiar film around the biggest unsolved mystery in American history. Indeed, JFK as a film owes much both to political thriller films such as Z (which also focuses on the assassination of a government official with multiple versions of the same events seen from the perspective of witnesses brought forth by a determined investigator) and the murder mystery genre. The only difference is that this is a murder with far more scope, far more suspects, and far more consequences than your garden variety murder mystery. It's a tale that takes in a large portion of still recent history and an era in time before distrust in government would reach its zenith (and perhaps has never truly subsided) and when terrible things very likely lurked in the shadows. Incidentally, anyone convinced that Stone's vision is overly paranoid should seek out the published script book for the film with dozens (if not hundreds) of annotations. The film's vision, while leaning perhaps a bit far in cases, turns out to be far plausible a vision than it's often given credit for. The result is at nightmarish with its implications, so perhaps it's no surprise that the film led to an act of Congress to release more of the classified files related to the assassination which is still being released even as I type these words.To bring the story to life, Stone assembled a first-rate team both in front of and behind the camera. Borrowing another trope from some of the better-filmed murder mysteries, the film has an all-star cast of actors in roles both big and small. Leading it is Kevin Costner as Jim Garrison, the New Orleans District Attorney who becomes both investigator and the audience's guide into the twisty world surrounding the assassination. Costner, though quite different from the real Garrison who was taller and more built, was nevertheless a perfect piece of casting as the intelligent everyman armed with a large amount of dignity and a determination to get to the truth no matter where it leads. Costner's performance plays up all of these elements and even the dark side of Garrison's obsession while also creating someone the audience is willing to follow for the three-plus hours the film runs for. The rest of the film's cast is equally as strong. The Garrison investigation turns up a number of fascinating characters, any of whom could very well the protagonist of their own film, ranging from Tommy Lee Jones' quietly menace as Clay Shaw, Joe Pesci's eccentric David Ferrie, John Candy as the ever-shifting lawyer Dean Andrews, and Kevin Bacon as Willie O'Keefe (a composite character, one of several the film uses) among many others. There is also Gary Oldman's Lee Harvey Oswald is not only uncanny in his resemblance but a fascinating portrait in its own right, presenting many different versions of one of modern history's most enigmatic figures. The film also has its fair share of strong female performances from Laurie Metcalf as an assistant DA to Sissy Spacek as Garrison's wife torn between supporting her husband and being drawn into the world he's uncovering. That's without mentioning the effective cameo appearances from the likes of Edward Asner, Jack Lemmon, and Walter Matthau or the scene-stealing monologue delivered by Donald Sutherland as the mysterious insider known as X. Few films can claim to have perfect casts but, for my money, JFK is one of them. Those behind the camera are the other half of the equation. Stone's team includes superb costume and set designs from Marlene Stewart and Victor Kempster which gives the film its sense of time and place. Yet as cerebral as the film is, a thinking person's thriller in many ways, it's also an immensely visual work with Stone often relying on the editing of Joe Hutshing and Pietro Scalia as well as the stunning cinematography of Robert Richardson. The three of them together weave in footage both archive and newly shot together into a tapestry that captures the viewer's eye as well as their brain. Underpinning it all is John Williams' score, perhaps one of his most underrated, that plays up not only the sense of unease but also the sense of what was lost all in the space of the film's opening titles and haunting themes elsewhere in the film. It's a remarkable tapestry all around.Indeed, that is a nice summary of the film as a whole. Stone's JFK is, in essence, a murder mystery. One whose stakes have a firm basis in reality and based on a crime whose particulars are still hotly debated decades after the fact. With his cast and crew, he created a fascinating piece of film-making that crosses genres and time, presenting an incredible and paranoid vision of an earth-shattering event. Except that, if what's in the film is even half true, has deeply disturbing implications. That thought and the fact that the film led to documents being released speaks to the power of film-making and JFK as a film in particular.",

This movie stirred up a lot of controversy for inaccuracies and what not, but I don't know much about the case and I don't care about digging deep. What Oliver Stone brings to the screen is an astonishing and exhilarating plot about the mystery and conspiracy behind Kennedy's death, as well everything that could make a film as fantastic as could possibly be.The assassination of president John F. Kennedy in 1963 remains one of the most infamous and debating mysteries in American history. JFK is based on two books that dig deep into the case and uncover varies wild schemes about the assassins that connect to the FBI, CIA, mafia and others. I have never seen the theatrical cut, only the 205 minute director's cut. Absolutely not one single solitary minute was wasted. By no means was the movie stretched. It is rare that a movie as long as this can keep your eyes glued to the screen for that long. No other epic movie I've ever seen has gone by faster than JFK. Protagonist Kevin Costner investigates everything about the assassination for the whole movie where truths, secrets, and lies constantly unfold and twist throughout the movie.Kevin Costner plays real life district attorney, Jim Garrison who is shocked just as everyone else to hear about the president's assassination. He has his suspicions, but trusts everybody that handled Lee Harvey Oswald (Gary Oldman) as the patsy. Three years later, Senator Long (Walter Mathau) reawakens Garrison's interest in the case and Garrison's eyes open and he does all he can to seek the truth. Over the next few years, Garrison buries himself in the case where he makes many enemies and isolates himself from his wife (Sissy Spacek) and children. Absolutely nothing stands in the way between Jim Garrison and the truth.Costner gives the performance of his career as a paranoid lawyer who is obsessed with something he will never achieve. A really cool aspect of this is the star-studded cast that follow Costner in supporting roles. Sissy Spacek, Gary Oldman, Joe Pesci, Jack Lemmon, Ed Asner, John Candy, Sally Kirkland, Walter Mathau, Tommy Lee Jones, Kevin Bacon, Wayne Night, Michael Rooker, Frank Whaley, Laurie Metcalfe, Vincent, D'Onofrio, Brian Doyle-Murray, Donlad Sutherland, Bob Gunton, and Jay O. Sanders are all the familiar faces I saw. With a cast of this talent, even the littlest scenes are awesome as heck.I officially believe what this movie says about the Kennedy murder. The killers must've had ties with the government. The records will no be available for circulation until another decade from now. If it wasn't an inside job, how come they have tried so hard for so many decades to keep in under wraps? Then there's the \"magic bullet\" theory: one bullet could have hit 6 (I think that's the amount) different places at different angles that went through parts of the body. The way Kevin Costner describes this theory is just genius. And Lee Harvey Oswlad was not the only killer. There's no way he could have used a rifle and fire six rounds in three seconds. Cosnter goes frame-by-frame and shows which angles the bullets come from. Eye-witnesses even say they heard gunshots from different areas. Then there's Oswald's murder either hours or a day after the Kennedy murder. There's so many pieces of evidence that prove Oswald was not the only killer. And I was sold on the president's death being an inside job.The way Oliver Stone makes this movie is incredible. In some of his movies, it is evident that he is interested in style for style's sake. But the way Stone edits the movie and does all the cool camera tricks is merely a reflection on the story and characters.This is purely a phenomenal movie.4/4",

            "content": "Spoilers herein.I have my own theory about film. There is always an explicit acknowledgment that what you are seeing is a film, distinct from reality. Many films incorporate that recognition into their being; the simple ones are just films about films and filmmaking, but there are other sophisticated ways of self-reference.It is my belief that there is a constant `distance' in these matters. So for example when we have a fantasy film like `Spy Kids' that has a film world within it as part of the story, the distance between that inner film world and the film we watch (the distance between the world of Floop and that of the Kids) is the same as the distance between the world of the kids and that of the us, the viewers. I think this is a matter of hardwiring in the mind.So it is no surprise to me to see how Stone has handled the three realities of this project. We have the reality of that day, burned into the memories of those of us that were around. We have a different `reality` that is abstracted from that by the hundreds of assassination investigators of all types. All of these, regardless of their credentials or position seem to have created not a reflection of reality but another reality altogether. Exactly where the line is between lies and wishful invention is lost forever for the thousands of people involved, from the hapless Arlen Spector to many of the witnesses.(Arlen himself would make a career out of cinematically informed faleshoods, most famously in his role in the Clarance Thomas hearings.)Stone has taken those two realities and added a third, an abstraction from both the reality and the hundreds of already abstracted pseudorealities. Stone's abstractions are completely cinematic: the nature of his Garrison has little to with the real guy and everything to do with Gregory Peck's Atticus Finch, down to the unctuous scene with his boy on the porch swing.And it has everything to do with rigid conventions of the film detective story, where `clues' have to be dramatically and visually exaggerated and narrative flow simplified.That's why Stone doesn't mind at all changing things radically from Marr, Garrison and Prouty: here, Ferrie actually confesses (never happened); Shaw really is a spook (we know now he wasn't); Bacon's character is gay and doesn't need hypnosis and drugs to `remember' a mention of the conspiracy. Stone doesn't mind, because his world is cinematic and that is the only way it makes sense in cinematic terms. That he really believes this himself (as opposed to the makers of `Forgotten Silver') is the really fascinating thing, but it makes sense because the world of film IS different.And it does work as a film. Stone's recognition of shifts in levels of abstraction is reflected in the variety of camera types, film media, camera positions and motions, narrative perspectives, even battling editing rhythms. It is a masterpiece of filmmaking, very much along the lines of `Citizen Kane' which dealt with the same issues of reality, invention and mixed cinematic narrative.Depending on what else I find from that year, I may put it on my list of the two `must see for cineliteracy' films of that year.Even though Stone really believes this stuff and takes it dead seriously, his intuitions still rule. So he selects one of the fakest actors available to play his narrator. To emphasize the fakiness, he uses flat lenses in his glasses. This is one of the biggest no-no's in all filmdom. Every novice knows you do not do this.Real glasses have curved surfaces in their lenses, fake ones are flat. Flat glasses have the disadvantage of reflecting the lights, crew and camera of the filmmaking process, something that Costner's face does hundreds of times. To a moviewatcher, this makes that character more like the figures in the courtroom model of the plaza than like us.In fact, the only realistic acting in the whole project is by Lolita Davidovich. Her piece is great.This film is bound to become famous again when Mel Gibson releases his similar fiction on Jesus, also leveraging conspiracy, also driven by the laws of cinematic narrative in the face of truth if need be.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",

            "content": "The assassination of American President John Kennedy is one of the most talked about events in American history so making a film about such a talked over event was going to be no easy task but Oliver Stone pulled it of perfectly and may just be the best film he's ever given us next to Platoon. This film has an extremely long runtime and there's nothing wrong with that as long as they use it to the films advantage and they do, the first 30 minutes of this film takes the time to explore the effects of the assassination, the reasons why it effected To so many people and sets up the main character and his motivations played perfectly by Kevin Costner. I truly think that this is the greatest performance Kevin Costner has ever given because he perfectly strikes a balance between his obsession with solving the assassination and his commitments to his family, the character is just so well written, you understood why he was so obsessed and was an easy person to get behind. Tommy Lee Jones gives a performance like we've never seen from him before, he was fantastic in this film, he was such a despicable character and was the perfect foil for the plot of this film. A very young Gary Oldman was also great in this film as Lee Harvey Oswald, he leaves a really big impression for the rest of the film to follow and when we start to learn more about Oswalds character, Oldmans performance remains consistent. This film could have been extremely boring because of the amount of information that it has to give out but it never is. The film takes entire sequences to add emotional weight to the assassination and the masterful editing in this film allowed us to take in the information better. I really liked the fact that Stone didn't paint the assassination as just an act of pure evil, we begin to understand why JFK was killed and while you never support them, you understand why the assassins chose to kill him and made the film much more interesting. Another thing I loved about this movie was the sub plot of Garrisons family, it added to Costners character as we begin to see that his obsession with this case is becoming unhealthy, yet through conversations with his children we begin to further understand his motives and was really heartwarming at times. JFK is a masterpiece, it's engaging, never boring and extremely intriguing. While I'm not entirely sure if this film is completely accurate, it's probably somewhat close to the truth. It has fantastic performances, particularly that of Kevin Costner and may just be Stones best film. 100%/A+",

            "content": "Greetings from Lithuania.Wheter or not do you believe the things shown in this movie are true (or at least mostly) - \"JFK\" (1991) is a one great movie. First time seen just now in 2016, it kinda blew my away because i didn't expected that director's cut which i've seen, that runs almost 3 h 20 min will be THIS entertaining, involving and provoking at the same time. Cast is probably one of the very best (if not the best) i've ever seen, and while some of them played a bit over the top (J.Pesci), there isn't a weak performance here - that is because of a great director working in his best form. Now i do believe that this Oliver Stone's (who's movies are a bit uneven sometimes but ALWAYS interesting to watch) movie is probably his most ambitious ever, as much as i love \"Platoon\" and \"Born on the Fourth of July\" and highly admire almost every other (well except for the poor \"Alexander\"). Script of \"JFK\" is brilliant. Many times watching this movie i asked my self a question - did this really happen or this is a pure fiction? I do not ask these questions in my life often (almost never), as i do not believe in big conspiracies overall (fake moon landing and fantasies of haters in that spirit), but this movie is so superbly written that during the movie and closer by the end i started to have my doubts. I do not honestly know many facts about the killing himself, just as much as probably everyone else, therefore seeing things in \"JFK\" made me think otherwise to official story and a theory that was presented by the end by Jim Garrison sounded very, very convincing to me. So who actually killed Mr. Kennedy? Lets leave it to the history.Overall, \"JFK. The Director's Cut\" is a superb drama in all directions. At running time 3 h and 20 min (!) it is, hear this - never boring or uninvolving for a second! The pacing (amazing editing), writing and directing are one of the kind and with a cast witch involves almost every well known face in a Hollywood this is a must see movie whether you like conspiracies or not. Great movie.",

            "content": "How much of what Oliver Stone presents in JFK is actually true? Certainly not all of it. Certainly not none of it. There's definitely some truth in there but Stone obviously takes some liberties as well. It's quite a challenge to make a film that purports to be a true story when nobody actually knows the true story. You end up interpreting history rather than documenting it. Stone obviously believes there was a conspiracy in the JFK assassination so of course that is the story his film will tell. The conspiracy is presented as fact. And Stone certainly makes a compelling case. He hasn't solved the JFK case. But after watching his film you may well think he came much closer to doing so than our government ever has. Stone made a great film. And perhaps more importantly he made a convincing film. You're buying what he's selling.Stone uses New Orleans district attorney Jim Garrison to make his case. Garrison was in fact the only man to ever bring anyone to trial in connection with the JFK assassination. It is Garrison's dogged investigation which drives Stone's film. There are so many obstacles in Garrison's way but he is determined to get to the truth. But in this case truth is almost impossible to find. Tales of shadowy conspiracy emerge but no matter how much Garrison digs it becomes evident he's never going to get to the bottom of this. He makes the best possible case he can given the circumstances. But the real truth, the scary truth, always remains elusive. Kevin Costner turns in an excellent performance as Garrison. He makes you believe in Garrison, makes you believe that this man is doing the right thing. Costner is the strong center around which the film builds. Everything swirls around him. And in this film there is always something, often many things, swirling. There's an awful lot going on. Stone's film careens past three hours and you get the sense it probably could have gone on for three hours more.The film does go on for quite a long time and it throws so much information at you. There is a lot for the audience to process here. But the film never really gets bogged down. It is entertaining, compelling and thought-provoking throughout. Costner is the standout performer but the rest of the cast is stellar as well. Gary Oldman makes for an eerily convincing Lee Harvey Oswald. Tommy Lee Jones and Joe Pesci bring unique personalities to the roles of two possible conspirators. Jones is calm and suave as Clay Shaw, Pesci nervous and manic as David Ferrie. Donald Sutherland, Kevin Bacon, Sissy Spacek and a host of others play their parts well. Familiar faces pop up in even bit parts, the likes of Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau and John Candy helping to move the story along. No part, no performance, is wasted. Stone weaves his web expertly. It is a very tangled story, there is the sense that in the end maybe all the strands of the story didn't quite come together. But how could they? This film is a \"true story\" in which nobody actually knows the truth. Ultimately Garrison, through a powerful performance from Costner, lays out his version of the truth. Through this character Stone tries to convince us. How much of what Stone presents you choose to accept as truth is up to you. You can question Stone's version of history. But there is no question that in JFK he made an excellent film. It may not be a perfect history. But it's a near-perfect film.",

Plot In A Paragraph: Jim Garrison, a New Orleans District Attorney, discovers there's more to the JFK assassination than the official story.Does anyone still believe Lee Harvey Oswald was the lone gunman?? Sorry too controversial?? I'll rephrase that...... Do you know anyone who believes Lee Harvey Oswald acted all by himself in killing Kennedy?? I certainly don't. Now on to the movie Itself. Watching this movie, It's impossible to believe the Warren report, because the physical evidence makes its key conclusion impossible: One man with one rifle could not have done it. If one man could not have, then there must have been at least two. Therefore, there was a conspiracy. But we just don't know who!! Maybe it was the CIA, maybe the FBI, it could have been Castro, or the anti-Castro Cubans, the Mafia or the Russians, or all of the above, were involved. We just don't know.What we do know, we know by heart. The grassy knoll, three shots in 2.6 seconds, Lee Harvey Oswald in Russia, the Zapruder film, Jack Ruby, the hobos in dress shoes, the parade route, the Bay of Pigs, the eyewitness testimony, the woman with the umbrella, the palm print, the wrong shadows on the photograph etc.JFK is a masterpiece. It's huge cast is perfect. Gary Oldman, Kevin Bacon, Joe Pesci, Donald Sutherland, John Candy, Walther Matthau, Jack Lemmon and Sissy Spaseck. Special mention must go to Jay O.Sanders and Michael Rooker too, I always like seeing him and screen, and here is no exception. Of course Tommy Lee Jones was nominated for an Oscar for his work here. But truthfully most of the main and supporting cast could have been. None more so than KC, who gives a passionate performance. The writing, the directing, the acting, the editing, the music (by John Williams) the photography, are all brilliant. It's one of those movies where EVERYTHING is on point. I honestly expected the movie to sweep up at the Oscars, I was shocked Silence Of The Lambs won what it did, when it was up against this, and many others. I hadn't seen the movie when it won what it did, and was unimpressed when I did (but that's another story) JFK was nominated for 8 Oscars (winning 2) and I think it should have been more, with KC being robbed of a nomination himself. He was certainly more worthy of winning than Anthony Hopkins in his glorified cameo!! Hardly in the movie, but he won best actor. KC helms a 3 hour epic, and is ignored.I suspect the movie was too controversial to win, as was KC's character, too controversial for a nomination!! Stone received a lot of criticism at the time for having Garrison as the \"hero\" of the movie. If I was to make a boxset of KC movies, for future generations to get a grasp of KC as an actor, this movie would be in there, along with Dances With Wolves and Field Of Dreams. Despite being viciously attacked in the media, before it was even released. JFK ended the year, the 17th highest grossing movie of 1991 with a $70 million domestic gross. More than Thelma & Louise, the popular comedy Hot Shots, and action flicks Point Break and Last Boy Scout. Another classic, and 10/10 for this reviewer",

Of course, when you are only presented one side of an argument, yours can sound pretty good, too. That's the problem with this film and the viewers who watched it, not stopping to think how biased it was in the first place. One thing for sure, to be fair: it's an entertaining film. Kevin Costner, Kevin Bacon, Tommy Lee Jones, Laura Metaclf, Sissy Spacek, Gary Oldman and others make up a pretty impressive cast. The cinematography is slick, too, all making the long film (189 minutes) pass fairly quickly.Thus, it's good entertainment but don't be sucked into thinking is the truth.....as in any film.

On the other hand I was a bit underwhelmed overall. Not dissapointed mind you, just a bit underwhelmed.There are a lot of things that the movie heightens a bit for ... you know movie purposes. I'm not a scholar and Stone does try to include as many things in this as possible. Like almost any theory that existed about Kennedys death. Let's be clear there are a lot of uncertainties and there may be more to it than the goverment let us know. I doubt we will ever know the full extent of it.Still nicely put together, even if not as coherent as a movie by Aaron Sorkin - was not about JFK but felt similar mood wise. Anyway, there is enough thrill to keep you occupied and enough actor recognition to be awed by too. Not my favorite of Stones, but you can't deny his skills as a filmmaker anyway.

            "content": "In 1969, New Orleans D.A. Jim Garrison brought noted New Orleans businessman Clay Shaw to trial for conspiracy to murder President John F. Kennedy. To date, this is the only trial of any individual in reference to the Kennedy assassination. This controversial 1991 film follows Garrison's investigation into the Kennedy assassination from the day of Kennedy's death to the conclusion of the trial--and it has prompted almost as much controversy as the assassination itself.How much of this film are we to take as fact and how much of it are we take as fiction? Critics have noted that as a historian, Stone is a great filmmaker, and with JFK Stone creates a vision so extreme that even some conspiracy theorists have denounced it as completely impossible. But that may actually be part of the film's point: that we live in a society that typically subverts the truth, a world in which facts are hard to come by and in which speculation runs wild.However you wish to take the film, there's no denying that it is exceptionally well done. Much of its power rests on visuals. JFK is presented on different film stocks with various grains and color qualities, and these scenes--some of them lasting only seconds--are combined like pieces of an jigsaw puzzle to create a slowly emerging picture of American politics at its worst. The script, largely based on Garrison's book ON THE TRAIL OF THE Assassins, works in much the same fashion, shifting rapidly from scene to scene and back and forth in time. In combination, cinematography and script have a cumulative power that is most impressive, and Williams' haunting score adds greatly to the effect.The ensemble cast is easily one of the best I've ever seen. Kevin Costner is not, perhaps, ideally cast as Jim Garrison--but he plays in an extremely low-key manner completely devoid of any \"star\" trappings, and thus throws focus on the myriad of characters who swirl through the story. Gary Oldman is uncanny as Lee Harvey Oswald. His performance is such that you're often unsure if you watching Oldman or news footage of Oswald, and Brian Doyle-Murray achieves a similar effect with the smaller role of Jack Ruby.But perhaps the most memorable are the host of actors who appear in unlikely roles and who acquit themselves exceptionally well. Joe Pesci gives a typically aggressive performance in the strange role of a right-wing paramilitary homosexual, Kevin Bacon is completely unexpected and flawless as a hard-bitten gay prostitute, and Tommy Lee Jones is impressive as the influential Clay Shaw. Other memorable performers include Ed Asner, Jack Lemmon, Sissy Spacek, Laurie Metcalf, Sally Kirkland, and Donald Sutherland--and in a wicked twist of irony Jim Garrison himself appears as Justice Earl Warren.The film is available on VHS and in several DVD packages, including a \"director's cut\" special edition that includes a number of extras, including an often interesting director's commentary, an interview with famous conspiracy theorist Prouty, and a documentary on certain intriguing records recently declassified by Congress as a direct result of this film's impact.Historians and theorists will probably wrangle over the JFK assassination for decades, perhaps centuries to come. But whether you buy into Oliver Stone's scenario in whole, in part, or not at all, film is both extremely well-done and provocative to the max. If you want to stir conversation, this will do it.

            "content": "Seen the cast list for JFK ? Tommy Lee Jones , Gary Oldman , Sissy Spacek , Kevin Bacon , Jack Lemmon , Walter Matthau , Donald Sutherland and John Candy in one movie . Even if you're not keen on some of the aforementioned actors you'll be impressed by all of their performances and for this reason alone JFK is essential viewing . The only actor I wasn't impressed with was Kevin Costner but I don't recall ever being impressed by him in anything he's ever done . But don't let that put you off because the rest of the cast are superb If that's not a strong enough recommendation let me point out the technical endeavor this movie required of mixing stock film footage and reconstructions which could have ended up making this movie a jarring unwatchable mess . Joe Hutshing and Pietro Scalia's editing is flawless while Robert Richardson's cinematography is outstanding and Oliver Stone maybe accused of over directing his later movies ( Notably NATURAL BORN KILLERS ) but here everything works perfectly from the directorUnfortunately Stone's script has to come in for the movie's most serious criticism - It's paranoid speculation , so much so that there's a danger JFK goes beyond fiction and becomes fantasy . First off it insinuates Kennedy was killed because he wanted to pull out of Vietnam . Considering there's little evidence of this where does this source information come from ? It's a well known fact that Kennedy was a fan of special forces and increased the budget and manpower for the green berets . Does this strike you as a man who'd totally pull out of South East Asia ?Secondly Vietnam would have meant very little from a pentagon chief to the American on the street in 1962/63 so we're to take it a country hardly anyone had heard of led to the murder of the President because he was going to pull US advisors out of Vietnam ? In that case I wonder why no one murdered Reagen because of he didn't send advisors to aid Christian phalangists in The Lebanon or why no one murdered Clinton because he didn't send advisors to aid the Northern Alliance in Afghanistan ?Thirdly , there seems to be an agenda in the screenplay that Kennedy was murdered so that the Vietnam war would generate money for American companies. I can't disprove this conspiracy theory of course , but think about this - Why would America sacrifice 58,000 war dead , have another 250,000 Americans maimed for life and lose all moral prestige in order to build a few thousand helicopters ? They could have easily supplied billions of dollars worth of military equipment to South Vietnam ( America did do this under the Vietnamization program in the early 70s ) without getting caught up in the quagmire themselves Oh and there's several other points the script kicks up that can't be proved or disproved like Lee Harvey Oswald being a double agent working for the CIA against world communism , a mysterious character only known as X who sees senior military chiefs planning to do away with Kennedy etc , things that only probably only exist in the imagination of Jim Garrison and Oliver Stone. Stone also wrote the Oscar winning screenplay of MIDNIGHT EXPRESS , read the source book by Billy Hayes and you'll realize that the screenplay to the book is a series of mass exaggerations and inventions on the part of Stone . He's done the same with JFK I don't want to give the impression that I disliked the movie because I didn't . However much of the movie makes claims and insinuation that can't be backed up by facts and if you think there's nothing wrong making a conspiracy theory blockbuster involving human tragedy think about this : Someone makes a movie called 9/11 where Mossad agents are seen covertly entering the United States , everyone in the WTC called Rubinstien and Goldberg phone up sick on the day of the attacks and a fictional character in the film states that he's seen documents in the White House proving that the war on terrorism is a big conspiracy involving Israel's government and American oil companies who were both behind the attacks carried out on the 11th September 2001 . Does anyone else feel disgusted we might be seeing this production in the future ?",

            "content": "This is an Oliver Stone film which delves into the tumultuous intricacies of the entire JFK assassination issue! Kennedy was a controversial president from the offset, primarily for the reason that he was stigmatized by many Americans because of his religion. Besides the problem which many voters perceived about Kennedy's Catholicism, a great deal of Americans were skeptical regarding Kennedy's election campaign tactics. Many citizens felt as though he orchestrated some scandalous chicanery in Chicago in the process of winning the 1960 election. All throughout his presidency, Kennedy was subjected to a ubiquitous and disdainful criticism from all sides of the political arena! Kennedy's nefarious presidency included alleged sexual indiscretions with many women, including prominent stars such as: Marilyn Monroe and Gene Tierney! The most intriguing angle which director, Oliver Stone, focused on, was the aspect of the depraved culture dissemination which prevailed in the United States during the Kennedy administration's reign. Kennedy's assassination led people to believe that our government was motivated by hate and fear, and not egalitarian democracy. Kevin Costner played a district attorney from New Orleans, Jim Garrison, someone who became ideologically wounded when he heard about Kennedy's assassination! His wife (Sissy Spacek) perpetually misunderstood Garrison (Kevin Costner) concerning his vehement pursuit to unravel a conspiracy theory relating to the whole gruesome Kennedy assassination incident! Conjecture which arose from the Warren Report, particularly with regards to the \"Magic Bullet Theory\", became a cumbersome and ambiguous documented fiasco which invoked a hasty dismissal to this entire affair. Dallas was fast and furiously becoming a city which embraced a bevy of secret service men who were in quest of evidence which pointed to potential political espionage that could be linked to the assassination of John F. Kennedy! The invidious aura to Dallas, back in 1963, made the city precariously conducive to being a venue that would get involved in a malignant nationwide political scandal! What the film \"JFK\" ultimately purported was not just that the assassination of a United States' President was a conspiracy, rather, this film wished to reiterate how deep rooted this covertly heinous conspiracy actually was! The CIA was now a corrupt arm of the law that became responsible for an egregious subornation by appointed officials to catalyst a nationally unprecedented form of deceit and collusion! The diatribes which Jim Garrison elaborated on, established a callous dichotomy between political temerity with the CIA, and an ideologically emblematic badge of justice with the American people. The scapegoat who expedited the JFK assassination, Lee Harvey Oswald, was believed to be a spawn of Fidel Castro's Communist insurgency. When Jack Ruby murdered Lee Harvey Oswald, this merely fortified the concept that a politically volatile conspiracy was the culprit to this infamous string of murders. Rumination of this entire matter, allowed director, Oliver Stone, to engage in an acute portrayal of the disconcerting vindictiveness which was prevalent in America's boll weevil culture. All three movies; \"Natural Born Killers\" \"Talk Radio\" as well as \"JFK\" were Oliver Stone films which depicted the numerous demented mannerisms that are indicative of many reprobates in the Dixie region of this country. This is not to say that the South is any worse than any other area of the United States. It is simply to point out that they possess a certain style of belligerence which correlates to the assassination of John F. Kennedy. \"JFK\" did not win for best picture in 1991. The year, 1991, was a year in which \"Silence of the Lambs\" swept everything at the Academy Awards Oscars Ceremony! \"JFK\" was an intellectual film which possessed an alert articulation with the American people that their nation witnessed a pejorative, yet mandatory, transformation in their social pattern of behavior when John F. Kennedy was shot! This necessitated a revolutionary counter culture mindset that erupted virtually overnight! In 1963, much of the United States bore a solid resemblance to the 1950's. JFK's assassination evoked a concise revelation to the emerging and indelible culture of the 1960's almost instantaneously, and, with a very intrepid disposition as well. The whole Kennedy assassination affair brought on a neon accented metamorphosis to the American people that U.S. public officials were indeed, extremely sordid, and, that they were anything, but, squeaky clean paragons of virtue! The acting ability in this film is amazing! The list goes on: Kevin Costner, Sissy Spacek, Kevin Bacon, Donald Sutherland, Tommie Lee Jones, Joe Pesci, Jack Lemmon, Walter Mathau, Ed Asner, and so many others! \"JFK\" is a lengthy film because it is filled with poignantly detailed dialog, not because it is hindered with a tedium of verbosity! This movie is one of Oliver Stone's greatest, and the wry authenticity to this film makes it one of the finest in the history of the silver screen! Without question, it is a 1990's classic! THUMBS UP!! PERFECT TEN!!",

            "content": "JFK (the director's cut version) is like a history lesson taught by an unconventional, usually thought provoking, and ultimately inspiring professor, transferred brilliantly onto celluloid.  In fact this film, which has been put down by various critics (not film critics mind you) for it's lack of truth and tendency to go off on conspiracy theories.  These critics, and there are plenty of them, entirely miss the point of the picture.  This is the ONLY kind of film that a film maker like Stone could make, one that is a challenge to the system, one that questions, and with questions that, after such a hefty lesson, makes a whole lot of sense. JFK is in reality a film ABOUT America, about the feelings that go with a national tragedy, the assumptions, the cover-ups, the fears, control, and head question- why?Stone makes Jim Garrison, played by Kevin Costner in one of his few superb performances, as a man who starts off believing the Warren Commission following the assassination on the day 11/22/63.  Years later, he begins to get gradually drawn into the idea that a conspiracy could be, and after various interviews and queries, he finds that there may be more, his mind opened to the possibility of truth.  He takes Clayton Laverne Shaw, alias Clay Bertrand (played to a deserved Oscar nominated stance by Tommy Lee Jones), to court, that he was in cahoots with not only Lee Harvey Oswald (Gary Oldman), but much, much more.  Personally, amongst other small items, I agreed with two main points on JFK - 1) there had to have been more than one shooter for the notion of the magic bullet theory, which states that a bullet went back and to the left, not to mention that the footage that shows this, within the film by Abraham Zabruder, is kept out of public view to this day.  2) in the exceptional cameo by Donald Sutherland as Mr. X, when he refers to the military industrial complex, and to the fact that in other parts of the world people already were hearing the entire history of Oswald was the killer before people in the United States even knew about the man, also to the black operations, which I definitely don't doubt exist.However, by the end of the 205 minute investigative epic into the \"coup de-ta\" of our 35th president, even those who may question Garrison's (as well as Stone's) views can still see the film as a masterwork of feelings, an atmosphere of a specific time and mood of a country.  The photography and editing, both Oscar winning, make the film all the more compelling, spell-binding, and very much unforgettable.  Along with Sutherland's near show-stopping bit, other actors make very noteworthy appearances- Kevin Bacon, John Candy, Walter Matthau (in the plot thickening moment), Jack Lemmon, Ed Asner, and especially Joe Pesci, who's eyebrows steal his scenes. Based on books by Garrison and Jim Morrs.  A++",

The distances are not remotely far enough to require a sharpshooter. Millions of people who have never touched a gun before would have a good chance of pulling this off with only ten minutes practice with the rifle.There is some hilarity. Kevin Bacon's character is entertaining and has a hilarious line. The Mr X character, very convincingly and soothingly played by Sutherland, cautiously carefully meets Garrison under the radar AT THE LINCOLN MEMORIAL THEN STROLLS WITH HIM THROUGH THE NATIONAL MALL.Yes, there are a lot of suspicious things with the case, but wholesale making up stuff hardly contributes value.",

            "content": "The fact I believe Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone doesn't reduce my sincere admiration for this involving, brilliantly packaged indictment of the processes used to affirm his guilt. As a movie, \"JFK\" rises above any duty to history to develop what director- writer Oliver Stone calls a \"countermyth\" to what he calls the myth of the Warren Report.In short, it became a template for inculcating what I would call \"paranoid chic,\" a desire to question comforting ideas that goes beyond all rational objections to fashion a mesmerizing if flawed piece of entertainment. \"JFK\" is, in more than one way, revolutionary.New Orleans, November 22, 1963. While news of the assassination of President John F. Kennedy filters through barrooms and reaches the office of district attorney Jim Garrison (Kevin Costner), an argument between right-wing hothead detective Guy Banister (Ed Asner) and his alcoholic gopher Jack Martin (Jack Lemmon) over strange goings-on in their office escalates into a violent assault. In time, this becomes the lynchpin of an investigation Garrison undertakes that becomes a re-investigation of the Kennedy murder, one that will lead to the only indictment of anyone accused of the president's killing.Garrison spends much time trying to unravel the \"tangled web\" at the heart of the killing, with much attention paid to the unique character of New Orleans, a city where accused assassin Lee Harvey Oswald spent much of his life. With a flair for detail and a pregnant line, Stone puts us at Garrison's side as he closely questions a bizarre character named David Ferrie (Joe Pesci) who drove to Texas on that fatal day, he says for some ice skating and geese shooting. Big Jim shakes his head.\"I find your story simply not believable,\" he says.\"Really?\" Ferrie responds amiably. \"What part?\"It's a welcome moment of levity that demonstrates Stone's complete command of the material. For more than three hours, he brings up a slew of bigger-than-life witnesses who either convince us with their honesty or repel us with their sinister indifference to what happened. In time, Garrison is mocked on national television, betrayed like Jesus by one of his closest aides, and faces divorce before getting the chance to make the case he has built to a jury in a lengthy yet gripping courtroom sequence, one of the finest ever made.The sequences work as vignettes, many of them worth watching over and over. Lolita Davidovich shines in a brief turn as Beverly Oliver, a self-described \"two-bit showgirl\" who once saw Oswald at a club with his future killer, Jack Ruby (Brian Doyle-Murray). Tommy Lee Jones oozes southern charm as the man Garrison eventually brings to trial, Claw Shaw.Only a couple of sequences hint at a larger truth, that Stone is throwing up a lot of clay pigeons in his attempt to fashion his countermyth. One witness, Jean Hill, is ridiculously dragged screaming from the murder scene to be told by officials in a ludicrous scene that she didn't see or hear what she, and we, just did. There is also some misdirection thrown in the direction of three tramps picked up at the scene, which Stone in his 2001 director's commentary admits turned out not to be the assassins the movie paints them as being.But in the main, the film holds together very well by keeping the focus on Garrison, who speaks forthrightly about what he believes. As in his performance in \"The Untouchables,\" Costner is a master of understatement who saves his passion for the final summation in court. It's hard to keep a dry eye watching him go.After, you can shake your head all you want. I surely do. But \"JFK\" has left a mark on the American consciousness that feels well-earned when watching it. By enshrining skepticism as not only patriotic but a citizen's duty, the film successfully pushes a less comfortable view of what life is really all about that has become its most lasting legacy, and does so in a way that makes three and a half hours feel like a handful of minutes. Truly epic, however mistaken.",

Though it reminds a bit of 'All the presidents men', it doesn't have its subtlety. It all starts after the assassination of John F. Kennedy and the conspiracies surrounding the investigation. Jim Garrison (Kevin Costner) a DA of New Orleans is convinced that there is a lot more to what the officials are willing to share and after finding a lot of loop holes in the Warren Commissions report, starts an unauthorized investigation with a small team from his office. He starts putting together facts, speculates certain conspiracy theories and the case starts consuming him. The fear, humiliation, object of losing his family doesn't stop him from going further. The amount of information, fact or fiction fed to the audience in extraordinary and since it is a little speculative and involves one of the most popular conspiracy theories, there is a better chance the audience gets sucked into it. Screenplay doesn't allow a single dull moment and every actor gives a one up performance scene after scene. The look of the period and a clever mix of real and shot footage helps too. One problem here is that, it does not just present the important facts and let the viewer decide, it thinks for the viewer too. Thus dumbing down and ending up one dimensional.

All I really wanted to point out is that 'JFK' is loosely based on the opinions of Jim Garrison, which are already in great doubt. According to the facts reported in the book 'American Grotesque' by James Kirkwood who covered the Shaw trial, the very short version of this story is that Jim Garrison had a vendetta against Clay Shaw ever since Shaw (a real Southern gentleman) had once reproved Jim Garrison for slapping his wife in public in a New Orleans restaurant. Clay Shaw was the ultimate victim of Garrison's persecution, which was partly motivated by Mr. Shaw's presumed sexual orientation and Mr. Garrison's very real homophobia.

After initial doubts about the official conclusions on the incident, New Orleans DA Jim Garrison opens up an investigation into the assassination. He uncovers clues to a conspiracy that seems to come from the very top but witnesses are hard to come by and the further through the looking glass he goes the more danger he puts himself and his family in.Watching an Oliver Stone film can be a wearying experience at times. Often the effect of his films can be like have him standing in front of you shouting for a couple of hours, however here his style is perfectly set with a script that, whether you believe it or not, pulls you along at a terrible pace.  As a piece of fact this film is bogus and it is up to each viewer to decide how much of it they want to accept or dismiss, but if you based your opinions on this film alone then you are too easily led.  What it does do though is present a vast number of questions for you to take away, and it does that very well.  The story relies heavily on theory, suggestion and characters who are combination of many, many small sources (combined for obvious reasons in the context of story telling).It is a problem that this is presented as fact but I can forgive Stone that as he delivers it in such a thrilling manner.  The story rarely lets the pace drop and the `facts' come thick and fast as we go deeper into Stone's `truth'.  It is a breath taking ride and one that benefits from great direction, fantastic editing and a great mix of footage and stock.  In the middle of this is a near-faultless performance from Kevin Costner.  As I write this it is the accepted norm to hate him and every film with him in it - I don't entirely know why, but regardless he is great here.  The perfect example of what he brings to the film is in the 20-minute courtroom scene where he is mesmerising.  Hate him or not, it is impossible not to acknowledge his contribution to this film being so gripping.Costner is supported by a great cast who do well regardless of their characters.  Tommy Lee Jones and Joe Pesci have the least palatable characters in the film but they deliver them very well.  Oldman plays his patsy very well and Garrison's team includes performances from Rooker and Sanders that help the tension and pace.  Bacon is as good as ever, as is Sutherland and they stop you thinking that their characters are fictional. Turns from Matthau, Lemmon D'Onofrio, Vince, Candy and Knight are also great value.  There isn't really a weak link in the film - each performance seems to add urgency to the film.Overall, this film will put many off as it really appeals to those who are open to ideas or love conspiracy theories.  If you aren't one of these then the film may just irritate you but, whether you accept it as fact or not (I don't) it is still very interesting and is presented with such wonderful style and vigour by Stone and made all the better thanks to a series of good performances led by a real killer from Costner.",

I would encourage anyone who believes that the character Kevin Costner portrayed bore any philosophical or intellectual similarity to Jim Garrison should read a biography of Garrison some time. he knew he had no case, he knew his \"star witness\" was perjuring himself. but the call to glory was too great for Garrison to let those \"little inconveniences\" get in his way. The real life Jim Garrison ultimately lost his case against Clay Shaw and Stone loses his case as well by attempting to glue together a variety of conspiracy theories, many of which had been debunked long before the release of the film in 1991. The problem, however, is that those theories are presented in \"JFK\" as historical verities, and large numbers of viewers haven't the historical grounding in the facts of the assassination and the scores of investigations conducted since to know where Stone is taking \"artistic license\" and the actual facts of the case. The result is that actual people end up being smeared by innuendo and \"factual evidence\" long since discredited.",

            "content": "JFK is entertaining and Costner and others do a fine job of acting. Oliver Stone did everything right here, except for the fact that the story and script are flawed. There have been countless conspiracy theories developed and presented about JFK's assassination over the last 40 years. A lot of these theories are interesting, but are not supported by facts or evidence. For instance, the theory that Lyndon Johnson invited Kennedy to Dallas so that he could have him killed and control the investigation and then assume power. This is an interesting idea, and seemed to gain some momentum due to the botched and covert autopsy of JFK. However, this theory is ludicrous. The theories put forth in this movie are not accurate or supportable by the facts either. The bottom line is that all of the evidence points to a lone gunman, and that lone gunman was Lee Harvey Oswald. His fingerprints were on the rifle found in the School Book Depository. The slugs removed from Kennedy and Connelly ballistically match the rifle found in the School Book Depository. The magic bullet theory is bogus. It has been proved that a single shot could have entered JFK through the base of his neck, exited, and then gone into Connelly's leg. This bullet did not have to take any magic turns or twists to do so, as the story in this movie suggests. Also, it has been proved that a high powered rifle bullet that enters a human head will cause the head/body to recoil towards the direction that the bullet came from. This was always my biggest hangup with the assassination. It appeared to me that the fatal head shot must have come from the front of JFK, as he recoiled backwards. This seemed to support the 2nd gunman on the grassy noll or in the storm sewer or wherever. Anyway, that is my 2 cents on the matter. This movie contains some good acting and scenery, but the story is just not accurate at all.",

            "content": "I think JFK by Oliver Stone is my favorite film of all time...period. I have finally made that decision. I base that on content and the sheer amount of times I could sit through it and it's as powerful each and every time. Although I also might say I am quite biased towards the film having been a Kennedy fanatic and researcher since my early teens. I love Kennedy and the whole mystery and intrigue surrounding his death on November 22nd, 1963. And no film captivates, captures and defines that assassination like Oliver Stone's brilliant film. While being fiction and dealing with a real life situation he makes such a controversial, detailed, full of depth film that it you could literally get something different from every single time you watch it and I have each time. The film should have swept the Oscar's and should be consider THE MOST controversial film because I believe it's the only thing that comes close to bringing out the truth behind the Assassination (that's not up for debate...I'm simply reviewing the film.) Kevin Costner...some love him, some hate him...I have heard people describe Costner as drab, boring, unemotional, but I have never agreed. I love Costner's films and performances. I think he is an incredible talent of embodying the characters he portrays. He makes them real, he makes the every day guy no matter what the character is. He can be powerful, emotional, subtle, weak, misunderstood, ambitious, evil...I think he's a very diverse actor with underrated ability. I think his performance in this film as Jim Garrison is brilliant. There isn't a time yet in watching this film that I am not so incredibly moved as tears well up in Costner's eyes as he's giving his closing speech to the jury (rumoredly this was not planned but Costner felt the impact of his speech.) Costner captures the era and the important of Garrison's investigation and perfectly shows how this case completely consumed Garrison to the very end. The cast in this film is extensive, impressive and incredible. To name any one person and not another in this film seems almost unfair besides Costner as he is the main focus. Tommy Lee Jones is usually second to be headlined being he was nominated for his performance as Clay Shaw/Bertrand, the man accused of conspiracy in the President's murder and the only man ever to be brought to trial for such. Jones is brilliant, he's always brilliant, Tommy Lee Jones is one of the greatest actors of all time and this role is brilliant but it's a very, very small role. Cameo might even describe it but still he got his nominated as supporting actor and he is a big screen presence and him and Costner share some intense dialog. Gary Oldman is PHENOMENAL as Lee Harvey Oswald. The man is just brilliant in flash backs and recreations of actual news events. The voice, the look, everything about him is nailed and he has a very subtle brilliance and insanity to him and his look. Oldman should have gotten an Oscar hands down. Joe Pesci is also very good (although mostly typical Pesci as CIA contact David Ferrie.) He certainly nails the physical appearance and his performance is noteworthy and riveting. He definitely adds pizazz and excitement to the film with this high strung over the top personality. Kevin Bacon, Michael Rooker, Jack Lemmon, Laurie Metcalf, Sissy Spacek (in a notable role as Costner's estranged and upset wife,) John Candy, Jay O. Sanders, Walter Matthau, Donald Sutherland, Edward Asner, and Wayne Knight are the bulk of the really notable performances in this film. All of them give so, so incredibly much to this film and make it come alive. Some of them have brilliant, detailed absolutely riveting monologues of information that any other time would come across as boring drivel and yet you watch and listen in awe as they list out the evidence. Bravo to each and every one of these actors because they made the most brilliant film ever made.Oliver Stone is no stranger to controversy. He's a brilliant, no holds barred director who makes jarring and stirring films. I haven't liked all his films but I can't deny his directorial brilliance and this is chief proof of that. He took an age old debate, something that has been rehashed to death and created an intriguing study. The film has less of a story and more of laying out facts in front of you for three hours and he does it with absolute ease and makes it compelling and interesting to everyone...researchers, fanatics, and just the average movie goer. So many powerful speeches, and moments in this film will just leave you stunned and wanting to watch the whole thing again because there is just SO much to take in. Whether you believe the evidence or not it's just as compelling to watch Stone direct a brilliant cast into a controversial film. This is without a doubt one of the top ten films you absolutely cannot live without seeing. It's important both as a film and to real life. For me it's also my number 1 film of all time. Consider that the best of the best. As I stated I am biased given my love for the subject but the film is still BRILLIANT!! Capturing the sixties, the assassination, the trial, the witnesses, the cover up...it's all done with such impressive style. 10/10",

Excellent casting and all the hallmarks that make an outstanding film are on display. Some of the most memorable scenes in film history compel the viewer here: Joe Pesci throwing a fit and confessing everything he knows as he sees the end draw near; Kevin Bacon as a homosexual convict who helps out with the investigation as he's \"got nothing to lose\"; Gary Oldman's intermittent scenes as the tragic Lee Harvey Oswald; Donald Sutherland as the military insider who illuminates Garrison on what goes on in the higher ranks of power; and Kevin Costner's moving courtroom speech at the end.

His resultant film, which sometimes feels very artificial somehow, is basically an excuse for him to fit together every conspiracy theory and idea surrounding the shooting and put them into one unwieldy, ultra-lengthy movie.JFK is a film that works on details and there are plenty of them here, most coming in during a couple of bum-numbing monologues by Kevin Costner and Donald Sutherland. None of it is particularly cinematic, and you wonder if a documentary might have got Stone's points across in a more sensible way, but somehow it all works and gels together. Costner has never been better than when he plays it straight, and his obsessive investigator brings to mind Jake Gyllenhaal's equally obsessed reporter in another true story, ZODIAC.One thing that I found rather amusing is Stone's casting of famous faces in small roles, some of them blink-and-you'll-miss-'em. Gary Oldman is barely here, and there are even briefer turns from the likes of Walter Matthau, Jack Lemmon, John Candy, and Kevin Bacon. Michael Rooker and Tommy Lee Jones both have meatier roles before they became familiar faces, both are cast against type and both are effective with it.",

Kevin Costner (one of the most boring actors in the world) does his usual cardboard impression (remember his take on the very flawed Eliot Ness in 'The Untouchables'?) of the 'valiant' Jim Garrison.In truth, Garrison was a couple beers short of a six-pack. It is fairly amusing that the Hollywood left decries the John Wayne cowboy and Indian movies, and then proceeds to rewrite history with its stirring 'docudramas'. Never mind the facts, just shoot the movie. Hollywood's love letter to Erin Brockovich overstated her role in the PG and E mess. In 'JFK', Oliver Stone points his finger at just about everybody in regards to assassination of Kennedy. I went out of the theater feeling culpable myself!Which is not to say that 'JFK' is not entertaining. The story is easily one of the greatest 'mysteries' of our time, and Stone's film engaged me despite all of its half-truths. The big problem is that a whole generation of moviegoers who saw this film no doubt accept Stone's version as some sort of historical document. This film should come with the horror show admonition: 'It's only a movie'.Costner seems to have taken over Robert Redford's mantle: always play the hero. His 'Eliot Ness' in 'The Untouchables' is so noble and good it's enough to make one wretch. Again, never mind the facts, that the real Eliot Ness had his share of problems and peccadilloes. The movie is only interesting because of the Sean Connery character (no doubt made up of whole cloth).Then again, I have had problem with 'docudramas' ever since the putrid 'The Greek Tycoon'. It's obvious what they are doing with these films, and it's obviously just 'entertainment' but unfortunately, these films leave lasting impressions in one's mind about real people and real history and the end result is the proliferation of lies.Hollywood seems to be getting desperate. The recent news is that Jane Fonda will portray Nancy Reagan in an upcoming film. What Hollywood doesn't seem to understand is that not too many people are watching anymore. Meryl Streep as Margaret Thatcher? Julianne Moore as Sarah Palin? I'm not even angry anymore with the Hollywood left. I just ignore them.'JFK' is a well-crafted movie, but I would not want to sit through it again. I'm one of those nuts that actually believes that the born loser Lee Harvey Oswald took aim at Kennedy from a bookstore depository window. And that he pretty much acted on his own.Call me naive. The Kennedy assassination was the mother of all conspiracy theories, and she has begotten many moronic children since then. I don't buy into many of them.",

Stone buys into the theories of the two least credible conspiracists, the egotistical Jim Garrison and the starry eyed Jim Marrs. There's no actor better suited to play Garrison than Kevin Costner, the man whose head seems to expand every time he's in front of a camera. Garrison also reflects the inflated ego of Stone himself, who seems to believe every half baked idea proposed in On the Trail of the Assassins. Also on display is Stone's usual penchant for homophobia, as his limpwristed villain Clay Shaw minces across the screen. (Apparently it wasn't enough that this utterly innocent man had already suffered character assassination in Garrison's book.)The lowest blow of all, of course, was the casting of Jim Garrison himself as Chief Justice Earl Warren. To impugn Warren's honesty--and his importance as one of the great liberal jurists of this century--is bad enough, but to have a charlatan who questioned the man's character play him is truly despicable. Terrrific photography and outstanding bit parts by Gary Oldman (a memorable Lee Harvey Oswald), Donald Sutherland, and the always reliable Michael Rooker make JFK a must see. It's on a par with Triumph of the Will or Olympiad 1936: truly one of the great propaganda pieces of the twentieth century.",

            "content": "This Oliver Stone classic was a lengthy depiction of one of the most controversial presidents in U.S. history, John F. Kennedy. Kennedy was the consummate politician who garnered an unprecedented charisma with the American people by implementing lofty ideology with pragmatic political procedures!! His wife, Jacqeline, was a regal artifact of fashion and glamor, and this couple of President and First Lady which was labeled as \"Camelot\", easily elevated into the limelight of American culture! The Kennedys were American icons who invoked a dogged tenacity for social changes, and dirges of moral outrage, which titillated minorities and under privileged Americans!! On November 22nd, 1963, when John F. Kennedy was assassinated, it sparked a national uproar with the public perception of nationwide politics!!Such a pejorative pique mandated the launching of the investigative documents by the Warren Commission known as the Warren Report. Now enters Jim Garrison, (Played by Kevin Costner) who became engrossed in the factual details involving JFK's death. It was Garrison's ardent admiration of Kennedy that made his prescient curiosity an obsession. It was not just his responsibilities as a district attorney which nurtured his persistence, it was also for his own edification that Jim Garrison wanted to unearth facts about Kennedy's assassination. This entourage of interrogations was all in the hopes that his resolution to this issue would enhance his conception of the American system of democracy!! Garrison embarked on a series of inquiries concerning JFK's assassination which were of his own volition!! The Warren Report was an edict by the Johnson Administration as a way of putting a bureaucratic style explanation on the aggregate calamity concerning JFK's murder!! Such desultory data enticed the subornation of perjury by numerous public officials!! This virulent abuse of due process was tantamount to parading around a flagrant dismissal of democratic justice which was pertinent to the wishes of the American people altogether!! The initiative to challenge the findings of the Warren Commission was motivated by the fact that subsequent reports contained indiscretions to the Warren Commission's findings! Amidst the myriad of miscalculations in the Warren report was the principle bone of contention that more than one bullet was fired. The Communist insurgent who became the guinea pig for this debacle, Lee Harvey Oswald, ultimately became a target himself, and was assassinated by Jack Ruby! This string of heinous murders involving Kennedy and Lee Harvey Oswald, culminating with the \"magic bullet theory\" became a cogent revelation to the American people that the Kennedy assassination was indeed a conspiracy! In view of this whole incident, Dallas became the most politically scrutinized city in the entire world for over two years! The film, \"JFK\" brandishes all of these occurrences as stark revelations to the American public. Such an illustration was realistic because that is what these precarious occurrences were!! Many nuances to the assassination of John F. Kennedy became an outlet for depraved intrigue. The film \"JFK\" illustrates how the south took a lethal and flippant path of trepidation to Kennedy's killing!! The film \"JFK\" introduced the viewing audience to the debauched proclivities of many sordid reprobates in Dallas and New Orleans!! Such dubious walks of life demonstrated a social callousness which brought on an onslaught of purulent jeremiads as to why the prevailing political spectrum was so convoluted during this era!! The nefarious characters involved in the whole Kennedy conspiracy were societal outcasts. A copious quantity of them evoked such an ideological ambiguity to their feelings that even the cadence to their voices were extremely dehumanizing!! The film \"JFK\" is tremendously bolstered by incredible acting performances by an enormous number of accomplished actors and actresses. In addition to Kevin Costner and Sissy Spacek, other famous stars were: Donald Sutherland, Jack Lemon, Tommie Lee Jones, Kevin Bacon, Ed Asner, Walter Mathiau, and many others!! Oliver Stone does a tremendous job at directing this film, as he encompasses a disconcerting aspect of democracy into the entire genre of this movie! I enjoyed this flick more when I saw it a second time. This movie possesses a non-acknowledgeable realism that satiated my ghoulish perception of the whole Kennedy affair, and how it revolutionized American News coverage!! I have been to Dallas many times, and I can empathize with the attitudes that Oliver Stone was trying to expedite with this film. I was dining at Morton's Steakhouse in Dallas, which is right next to the book depository where Kennedy was shot. When I pointed out to a parking valet that this is where John F Kennedy was assassinated, he replied \"Who's John F Kennedy?\" Historical events reflect our lives accordingly! The film, \"JFK\" effectively portrays the assassination of John F. Kennedy as a tragic escapade which restructured America's political priorities!! I recommend seeing this film, it is up there with the better American films ever made!! One of the best films of the 1990's!!! Definitely!!",

But for the record I DO believe that there was a cover-up involving the assassination, many Europeans claim Americans are just \"afraid\" to admit the truth but that's not it -- the fact is that the theory of Oswald acting alone is almost unbelievably insane. First of all the whole thing stunk of conspiracy, there's a reason that even the most skeptical people in the world believe this was all a cover-up. I've seen countless documentaries from both sides about this with an open mind and I've always found the evidence on the cover-up side far more hefty.There's the physical limitations for example. Stone might insert some lies but the truth is no person, Schwarzenegger or a meek little accountant, could EVER fire three shots in the time range that Oswald did. Stone says it's six seconds. It's actually eight. I saw a UK documentary trying to \"prove\" it was possibly by showing an old man firing three quick shots in 4.3 (I believe) seconds.Yeah, that's easy. I can throw three stones in four seconds if I had to. But if I had to try and hit a moving target from a faraway distance from a high level partially hidden behind a tree branch, I don't think I could do it. Do YOU? Then there's the fact that Oswald would have to literally rush all over the place as fast as Superman to be able to do the things they claim he did in the amount of time they claim he did.Oh, and let's not forget the fact that JFK is shot and the bullet clearly enters from the FRONT, not from behind. \"But bodies can fly forward after being shot from behind,\" someone said.Yeah, IF you're shot in the lower section of the body -- NOT the head, which -- and any doctor/scientist/whatever will tell you this -- snaps backward or forward depending on the motion of the impact.Then there's the footage which shows crowds of people instinctively looking towards the grassy knoll. Oh, and the shots came solely from the book depository? And people are looking in the opposite direction because of \"echoes\" (as some people say)? And a number of witnesses saw men fleeing the scene from the direction of the grassy knoll?This is just the beginning. No, Stone's film isn't flawless but it isn't TOTALLY lies -- a lot of it is truth, and this is coming from the guy who disliked BORN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY because of Stone's manipulating dishonesties.See this movie. Great performances, great direction, and a fair amount of history, even if it's the most flawed aspect of the story.I recommend downloading a guide to the film after seeing it, marking down the lies and then checking out all the truths left over. You'll be stunned, and then maybe you can draw your own conclusions.As it is, this is a very good film about a very shameful event that I honestly believe was a total cover-up.",

What a bunch of malarkey! Where did they meet to plan it all? The Astrodome? For those who think the head shot to Kennedy came from somewhere other than the rear, you should closely examine frame 313 of the Zapruder film. Not only does Kennedy's head move 3 or 4 inches forward from frame 312, the blood and brain tissue splatter is up and towards the front indicating a shot from the rear. The Marie Muchmore photo from another angle shows the exact same thing. The whole \"back and to the left\" stuff is a canard dreamed up by conspiracy buffs. It proves nothing.

            "content": "Will we ever solve the mysteries of the JFK assassination to everyone's satisfaction? No, I don't think so. LBJ's Warren Commission (WC), with cheer-leading from the mainstream press, tried to sell the public on the Oswald-as-lone-gunman idea. After a brief, national acceptance, the public began to question the WC conclusions. Ever since, the public's collective belief that Oswald acted alone, as measured by opinion polls, has been trending steadily downward.The general impression is that the WC did not set out to find the truth. Instead, they set out to build a case that Oswald acted alone, a man who had long since been silenced by Jack Ruby. The WC built their lone-gunman case by cherry-picking those bits of information that would fit their predetermined conclusions. But an excess of bizarre coincidences, torturous logic, and massive inconsistencies of every sort in every facet of this multifaceted case overwhelm officialdom's weak arguments, and make the mainstream press look sheepishly beholden to Washington insiders.The script's arguments for a conspiracy are compelling. Unfortunately, Stone's script tells the story from Jim Garrison's POV. Garrison's case against Clay Shaw was tenuous, at best. Result: officialdom and the press ... pounce. That Shaw may not have had a proved link to the assassination, however, does not in any way, plug up the massive holes in the conclusions of the Warren Commission. So a conspiracy is still a possibility, sans Garrison's theories. As a result, we're back where we started, with a silly lone-gunman theory, and some vague \"conspiracy\". What a mess!As cinema, Stone's film is brilliant. The plot is gripping, riveting, mesmerizing. With an all-star cast, there's not a weak link in the bunch. Lighting is stylized and at times 1940's noirish. The dignified and profound musical score by John Williams enhances a tone of mystery and intrigue.Editing is terrific. An enormous amount of information is telegraphed in the well-over three-hour production, information that could not have been included without split second cuts. As a result, the film's pace oscillates nicely between casual and rapid-fire.A message film that persuasively demolishes the WC conclusions yet suffers from a too-literal belief in the Jim Garrison narrative, leaves us with a lot to think about. To a person with an open mind, the \"mystery wrapped in a riddle inside an enigma\", as David Ferrie called it, is just as deep, just as profound now as it was fifty years ago. It probably always will remain such ... the stuff of legend.",

The Film won two Oscars in Academy Award (1992), one in editing (Joe Hutshing and Pietro Scalia) and one in best cinematography(Robert Richardson). This Is a mind blowing historic thriller film which you will want to watch it again and again after seen it in first time. Some scenes in this movies are so interesting and amazingly filmed that created goosebumps every time i watch it, specially the assassination scene [2:54:32 to 3:07:30] in 3h 21m Director's Cut. The main key points to watch JFK are:1. Cinematography: Robert Richardson is the cinematographer of JFK [1991]. The excellent art of photography and camera-work made this movie watchable again and again.2. Editing: The merging of various shots and soundtracks at the same time is the key point of this film that makes it more interesting after every scene.3. Soundtrack: The assassination scene demo at the beginning started with a goose bumping soundtrack that actually makes feel the conspiracy work. It is a great thing.4. Acting: Costner, Oldman, Pesci, Jones, bacon and Sutherland's's great acting lift up the movie to a great height.If you didn't watch it, PLEASE go... take a shower and watch it. I promise you will never be disappointed if you have interest in a thriller movie. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this movie. 10/10 (Please watch it in 201m Director's Cut on Blu Ray quality)",

I guess at that age I probably thought it was fun to believe in the fantasy of it and didn't particularly care if it was remotely close to being historically accurate. Plus, It was highly entertaining and had an interesting narrative structure. I liked how it was edited; the flashbacks with it's mixture of real and fake stock footage was slick. Stone knows how to package a compelling movie. It's still entertaining today. I esp. Love the John Candy scene.However, in light of the crazy conspiracies that seem to easily take hold in politics these days, I can't help feel that this movie and others like it can do real harm. They should be held to a higher standard beyond just being entertaining. If someone wants to produce a movie about a politically sensitive historical event or subject, then it's their duty to portray the relevant facts accurately. I don't expect every detail to be true. I realize even a historical movie's gotta have some entertainment value, but this movie goes way over the limit.There are a lot of bogus \"documentaries\" on the JFK assassination out there that this movie lends credence to. Most of the producers of these already have their mind made up about this or that version and ignore any evidence to the contrary. Or like Hollywood, they're just trying to make money off of the people's appetite for conspiracies.By all means, if you haven't seen the movie, watch it for the sheer entertainment of it, but then do your brain a favor and watch a well-researched unbiased documentary before making up your mind about whether Oswald acted alone or not.There was one episode that Nova put out a while back that explained and demonstrated experimentally how Oswald alone could make those shots and how two bullets could cause all the wounds.

            "content": "\"What is Past is Prologue\"\u0085 I just got over another viewing of Oliver Stone's JFK, this time the Directors cut, which runs for around 3 hrs 20 mins. As always, I was not bored for a single second of this high octane, virtually paranoia driven dialog. And I got reminded again why it is one of my favorite movies. I've always been a fan of the political thrillers with espionage thrown in, and JFK is undoubtedly one of the best (if not the best) of these. This is Oliver Stone at his best (which is telling, because there have been a lot of instances, especially in recent times, when it seems he has lost it). His Vietnam trilogy not withstanding.Based on the true life memoirs of Jim Garrison, who was, as per the movie, the only person to bring a trial in the Kennedy assassination, this movie holds you from the first scene till the end. Unless of course, you're the kind who rates a movie's greatness based on the special effects. In which case, I would suggest you go for the Transformers sequel, as most of the world seems to be.Kevin Costner plays Jim Garrison, the New Orleans DA, who (after 3 years) discovers that things were just not right with the investigation and findings of the Warren commission regarding the murder of John F. Kennedy. Together with his office, a small yet dedicated bunch, he sets out to investigate. Against all odds and a labyrinth of characters, threats, murders and political intrigue, he manages to bring forth the case to trial. Regardless of the outcome of the trial, the final monologue by Costner has to be seen to be believed. And felt. No matter how many times I see this, it always brings a lump to my throat, as Costner elaborates on just why this is so important. Reminds you that Costner is capable of being there with the very best, despite some of the crap he dishes out at times.As for the actual case, was there conspiracy involving the CIA, the govt, the FBI, and the anti-Cuban and anti-communist forces? Or is Oliver Stone just a paranoid genius, as many say? Well, I don't know, but the power of the movie can be gaged from the fact that it turned me, a completely disinterested person, into a believer.",

If you want to go on being sucked in by all the conspiracy hucksters who are cheating a lot of people out of their money, then that's your choice.

For those people this movie is boring. For those who appreciate a good mystery like myself the value of describing the participants in the cover up and the shoddy police work that occurred does a great service in showing us a real clear picture of 60's Texas. The drawback which is a feature of Stone's work is the preaching of the protagonist. Aside from that small aspect the film stands on its own as a great thriller. People are free to make up their mind as to whether or not JFK was indeed killed by an inside agent or a mercenary hired Oswald to take the hit. As an intellectual movie that serves to inform the public of the misdeeds of public officials i would say Oliver Stone has provided a valuable contribution to American democracy.",

            "content": "Absorbing thriller, written and directed by Oliver Stone, about the conspiracy behind the assassination of one of the most beloved American Presidents.\nBased on the books by Jim Garrison (the real character played by Kevin Costner in the film) and Jim Marrs, \"JFK\" establishes the theory that Lee Harvey Oswald never acted alone.The screenplay may be conjectural, and was accused of being one more \"conspiracy theory\" by the well-known controversial director from \"Salvador\" ('86) & \"Platoon\" ('86), but besides what it dares to be, thruth or not, it's an entertaining and engaging piece of great filmmaking, from the intense & frenetic editing by Joe Hutshing & Pietro Scalia (both fairly awarded with Academy awards) to the cinematography, shot almost documentary style, by Robert Richardson (also Oscar winner) and the precise direction of Stone with the 'maestro' John Williams once again providing an unforgettable original score.The cast is fabulous and probably the best ensemble cast of 1991, led by a sober Kevin Costner, when he was at his peak in Hollywood (he started to shoot \"JFK\" after he won 2 Oscars for his pet project, the epic western, \"Dances with Wolves\"), as Jim Garrison, the District Attorney of Orleans Parish, Louisiana who starts a new Kennedy assassination investigation after the 'holes' on the outcome of the Warren Commission, with Sissy Spacek playing his devoted wife, Liz and a bunch of great character actors playing Garrison's legal team: Laurie Metcalf, Jay O. Sanders, Michael Rooker, Wayne Knight & Gary Grubbs.\nBut it's in the supporting roles and the non-credited cameo and / or extended cameo appearances that \"JFK\" shines:Tommy Lee Jones (the only member of the cast nominated for an Oscar) is splendid as the quirky Clay Shaw (alias, Clay Bertrand), Garrison's prime suspect, dominating every scene he's in, with Kevin Bacon & Joe Pesci, all playing against type as homossexuals, in a geniously & daring decision of casting.\nBacon is effective and convincing, Pesci goes a little over-the-top in some scenes, sometimes looks like he was still playing Leo Getz in \"Lethal Weapon II\", but still delivers without dragging the movie down.Hollywood legendary actors and the all time screen partners, \"the odd couple\": Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau, are great in their cameos, even if this time they don't share scenes.Gary Oldman's metamorphosis into Lee Harvey Oswald is astonishingly 'chamaleonic' as the great method actor he is, and he deserved to be Oscar nominated as much as Tommy Lee Jones, but his performance is shorter on screen time and less 'showy', hence the snub...Donald Sutherland as \"X\" could have made this kind of sinister part even in his sleep, and once again he does it very well showing what a pro he is.The late great John Candy, in a rare appearance out of the comedy films, is fantastic as the dandy / flamboyant lawyer, Dean Andrews. His witty speech delivery is a riot to follow.\nBill Murray's older sibling, Brian Doyle-Murray plays Jack Ruby, the mafia man who shot Oswald.Jim Garrison himself makes a cameo as Earl Warren, the head of the Warren Commission and Martin Sheen, who played Bobby Kennedy in the TV movie, \"The Missiles of October\" ('78) and JFK himself in the miniseries, \"Kennedy\" ('83), offers the intro narration of the facts that led to the Kennedy's assassination.The \"Director's Cut\" is way better than the theatrical release, showing some pertinent extended scenes and added a bunch of new segments / characters that were left out in the cutting room floor like the Lolita Davidovich's interrogation sequence; Lee Harvey Oswald's impostor played by Stone's regular, Frank Whaley and John Larroquette, as a TV talkshow host, where Garrison was a guest.Nominated for 8 Oscars, but winning just 2, \"JFK\" is one of the best movies of 1991 and if it wasn't for the sleeper hit, \"The Silence of the Lambs\" and all the bandwagon around the Hannibal Lecter character, it could have won more relevant Oscars such as Best Pic and Best Director, at least...I give it a solid 9 !!!",

Stone is a skillful director and this is a well made film with an excellent editing job from Joe Hutching and Pietro Scalia who had been veterans of other Oliver Stone films including Talk Radio, Born on the 4th of July and Wall Street as they edited down what must have been hours of film shot for this movie blended with actual archive news footage and the performances of the films many actors. Robert Richardson does a masterful job with the cinematography as well. This film is adapted by Stone and screenwriter Zachary Taylor from the books Crossfire: The Plot That Killed Kennedy by Jim Marrs and On the Trail of the Assassins by former New Orlenas D.A. Jim Garrison, calls for a large cast and gives them plenty to do. Garrison was a controversial figure in life and his book was largely hailed as ridiculous. Garrison's book proved he had no credibility as an expert on the Kennedy Assaination. He had a small role in the film as Chief Justice Eral Warren and has since passed away. Jim Marrs has decided to move on to the equally lucrative flying saucer market with his equally absurd book Alien Agenda. Stone likely has toyed with the idea of an Alien conspiracy movie but in the meantime he's working on a World Trade Center film. JFK deservedly won two Oscars for it's cinematography and editing and received another six Academy Award nominations for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Supporting Actor for Tommy Lee Jones, Best Sound, Best Music Score and Best Screenplay. It is a well written screenplay but it's too bad that for many film goers the film is viewed as historical fact rather than melodramatic, dramatized, politicized fiction blended with an actual historical event and a subsequent trial involving Garrison. For all the good work that went into this film it results in a wasted effort and opportunity.

JFK is a vehicle of pure propaganda, promoting Jim Garrison's flawed and poorly developed theories of a conspiracy to kill the president.  Stone would have better served the viewing public by taking the time to develop his own theories rather than depending on the reactionary witch-hunt that Garrison perpetrated.  In the world of Garrison there is a rifle-wielding assassin over every grassy knoll.  I'm not suggesting that there is no evidence of a conspiracy to kill the president; I'm saying that Garrison's research into JFK's assassination was sloppy, lazy, and relied too much on conjecture... just like the investigation of the Warren Commission.2.  Stone's direction on the cinematography is horrendous.  It's the equivalent of giving a 3 year old a camera and letting him film the movie. Stone's style is more subdued in this movie than in U-Turn or Natural Born Killers, but it's still annoying as hell.  I would blame cinematographer Robert Richardson, but he has shown the ability to do reasonable cinematography in \"Snow Falling on Cedars\" and \"Wag the Dog\".  Stone is the one responsible for the epileptic camera style.All in all, JFK is a substandard \"historical\" movie.  Stone sank even lower on Nixon four years later.  3/10.",

The court case is extremely riveting to watch - I don't think I even breathed during the final monologue.

This really didn't feel 205 minutes at all (yes I watched it over two nights, but it still went very quickly) and every scene felt necessary to the overall story. I like how we get to see Garrison's home life fall apart, as he sacrifices spending time with his family to get to the bottom of the assassination. The only thing I'd say is that the makeup is hilariously bad - Joe Pesci's eyebrows look ridiculous. But even that isn't enough to stop me from calling this the masterpiece that it is.

But that's only part of it. There are so many angles, connections, motives.... At age 35, I know without any doubt that President Kennedy was murdered by agents of the United States government, either directly or indirectly. If it was that bad back then, how bad can it be today? The coverup would almost be farcical if it wasn't so deadly serious.But as Mr. X says, \"Do your own thinkin.'\" That's what is brilliant about the film. It asks us to think. To read.

            "content": "Perhaps the world's greatest conspiracy theory?\nMost certainly the world's greatest conspiracy theory movie.\nJFK is top shelf Oliver Stone cinema, displaying his quintessential duality: a love of American patriotism, entangled in the shadow of money, power, and politics. JFK is perhaps Stone's magnum opus if not for Platoon or Born on the 4th of July. This film is absolutely littered with impressive performances and cameos, but the true star here is in the direction and editing, accomplished so skillfully as to serve as a masterclass in the ultimate political thriller. An invitation to fall down the rabbit hole... that is the mystery surrounding the assassination of John F. Kennedy. And for many, myself included, this mystery is a primer into the vast underworld sprawl of horrifying conspiracy theories, but for most, it is simply an unforgettable wound on our collective American consciousness, a beloved president snuffed out in broad daylight. Ask anyone alive from that time and they will tell you exactly where they were on November 22nd, 1963, when they heard the news. A moment seared into their minds. A day later, the alleged \"lone\" assassin, Lee Harvey Oswald, was the first man ever shot dead on live television, and we've been living in an endless echo of televised violence ever since.JFK is the true story of District Attorney Jim Garrison (played by peak 90s era Kevin Costner) attempting to crack the conspiracy surrounding the Kennedy assassination with his sensational trial that tore the official Warren Commission report to shreds. Garrison was able to shine a light on what otherwise may have been swept under the rug of time, as a mystery that will forever captivate us, a moment that will forever haunt us. 8/10",

            "review_title": "Flawed but intriguing rumination on political events",
            "content": "No one could ever expect a cinematic representation of historical events to be completely objective - film is an indisputably subjective medium, and the 'voice' of the director and producers are bound to always shine through. But objectivity is one thing, and Oliver Stone is its polar opposite. Instead of Stone's powerhouse film-making style and fierce political convictions adding substance and energy to JFK, his take on the infamous assassination and its aftermath, it is Stone's self-righteous and self-indulgent hammering of the material that inhibit the film from being the intelligent and compelling political investigation piece it could have been. As it is, while JFK could be considered a solid thesis on Stone's perspective on the events, as a film it struggles to hold up amidst the torrent of its own flaws. Stone may never have had the pretense of disguising his perception of the events of the JFK assassination and the alleged ensuing conspiracy as cold hard fact, but he certainly seems determined to beat his audience over the head with his side of the story to the point of bewildered acceptance. Stone's incredibly forceful portrayal of his own perspective, pitching his film directly to heartfelt American sentiment (even going so far as to have Costner directly address the camera when speaking of American liberty) has the final outcome emerge as just a shade away from propaganda. Stone's work tends to attract a \"love it or hate it\" reaction, but with a film this shamelessly self-congratulating and painfully biased, it is distinctly hard to love it, plaudits or not. Apart from Stone's own stance on the material, speaking strictly in film-making terms, JFK also finds itself lacking. Excruciatingly long and unreasonably \"talky\" (especially near the film's climax, where Kevin Costner talks for literally half an hour straight... no joke) and making use of an abundance of unreasonably clich\u00e9d patriotic sequences enough to make one's stomach queasy, Stone's film is far too self-indulgent to make its proper effect. Seldom arises the complaint that a director needs to simplify their work, but given the relatively simple plot ensuing, Stone sure manages to complicate the hell out of it, clarified with a series of incredibly contrived play-by-plays by Garrison and his team. While it is abundantly clear that Stone has done his research on the case, and it is easy to get swept up in the story to a degree, one can't help but wish that he had not found it necessary to include every last scrap of information regarding it - as such, the film feels like it is overflowing at the seams with factual information, often thrust so rapid fire into the audience's face that they have no time to process or internalize it. It is a shame indeed that the content of the film is so disappointingly brought to life, as JFK's technical work is laudable indeed, making use of terrific cinematography and editing (although the initially effective montage sequences, complimented with real historical footage do grow tiresome after being steadily overused as the film progresses) even if the normally reliable John Williams' score overloads on patriotic musical clich\u00e9s to a nauseating extent. The astonishing array of talented actors substantially raise the quality of the film as a whole. While Kevin Costner as patriotic American everyman DA Jim Garrison is bland at best, painfully trite at worst and unquestionably given far too much screen time, the wonderful supporting cast are more than enough to carry the dead weight of the film's lead. Tommy Lee Jones, in a distinctly different role from his usual casting is electrifying as ominous influential businessman Clay Shaw, with a cold menace simmering beneath his character's flamboyant exterior. Gary Oldman of course effortlessly steals the show as alleged assassin Lee Harvey Oswald - seen mostly in flashbacks, Oldman's meticulous dedication in fully inhabiting his characters is used to chilling and compelling effect. Backed by dynamic performances from Joe Pesci, Donald Sutherland, Kevin Bacon, Jack Lemmon, John Candy and Walter Matthau, all superb when given their moment to shine, the film's supporting cast raises the bar in terms of quality considerably. Unfortunately, Sissy Spacek is wasted in a banal subplot as Garrison's wife, adding a nauseatingly by the numbers \"obsession endangers family life\" theme to an already overlong film. As Stone dollops on the sap and Spacek overacts to her heart's content, backed up by absurdly untalented child actors as their children, the family sequences are among the film's most painful and unnecessary. Keeping in mind that appreciation of Oliver Stone's films does tend to be just as subjective as his own cinematic stance, it becomes difficult to dispute JFK being far too overlong, overstuffed with dialogue and bombarded by offensively clich\u00e9d sequences to be anywhere near as effective as it ought to have been. While intriguing in its presentation of a distinctly one sided rumination on the events following the assassination and complimented with brilliant technical work and impressive performances from its supporting cast, Stone's distinctive slant is what drags the film down from being the taut political work it could have been, resulting in a fact bloated, lopsided and self-indulgent portrayal of American history.-5/10",

He eventually indicts businessman Clay Shaw(played by Tommy Lee Jones) as a co-conspirator, though is unable to obtain a conviction, even as he fears his own life is in danger, and meets with a mysterious \"Mr. X\"(played by Donald Sutherland) who knows all about it... Divisive film splits viewer into either believer or skeptic about whether Oswald acted alone or not. Garrison leaves no doubt about his opinion, but regardless, this film is remarkably compelling and brilliantly edited for maximum impact. Over three-hour long director's cut moves at a breathless pace, and film itself is riveting, though viewers who reject conspiracy can't get past the perceived distortions of fact.

I love a good conspiracy flick when it has a shred of imagination and intelligence. But Stone has so many people involved the JFK assassination that the only person I'm sure wasn't involved in this massive conspiracy/coverup was me. How could so many people be involved in JFK's murder, but absolutely no one ever came forward to cash in on the hysteria in some way or another? Like I said, preposterous. I watched this movie hoping to see something that I hadn't thought of before. Instead I got a story in which Stone apparently went to a 3rd grade class and told them to make up as many wild hypotheses as they could about the 36th president's death. The only saving grace was Walter Matthau and John Candy who are always terrific when presented with dramatic roles. I think that this movie has ruined Stone's and Kevin Costner's careers.

Three hours is a burden on the rear end no matter how good the film, but this one manages to hold attention throughout. The Kennedy assassination continues to fascinate, I think, because of the many threads running through it that point in several different directions.The movie itself makes a strong case for a government-led conspiracy. A brief review, however, is hardly the place to argue the merits of Garrison's case or conspiracy in general. Nonetheless, the movie succeeds in bringing to popular attention a number of holes in the Warren Commission's lone assassin theory. Crucially, however, it's well to keep in mind that filmmaking is an art and by its nature art deals with images. Now, images can be a reflection of reality, and in that sense function as an expression of truth. But imagery, of course, is not reality itself. As a result, art as a source of truth about the world, has an inbuilt limitation.I mention this caveat only as a general caution about movies in general, and not to discredit this film in particular. All in all, I think the movie represents pretty powerfully many of the key facts of key eyewitnesses involved in the most intriguing murder case of the century.

            "content": "I'm aware in modern times conspiracy theories have become detrimental in discovering the actual truth (largely thanks to the internet) but I can't deny that I just love this sort of stuff. JFK requires your utmost attention and at a runtime of three hours, it feels like the movie leaves no stone upturned (pardon the pun) in its examination and deconstruction of the Kennedy assassination. Admittedly the first time I watched JFK I didn't understand much of what is discussed in the film. It's a lot to digest in a single viewing but there are more intriguing theories here than an entire season of Ancient Aliens (minus the bad haircuts and awkward line delivery); but I can happily watch JFK multiple times to further understand it and eat up every single word of dialogue. I doubt we will ever need another film made about the Kennedy assassination; what highly talented filmmaker could be more passionate about the subject matter? I also highly recommend watching the director's cut for even more conspiracy goodness to evoke the paranoia in you.JFK is one of those movies which makes you most appreciate the art of editing, incorporating many layers of time and reels of stock footage; no scene during the movie's three hours is edited in a standard fashion. The editing help make the film's exposition exciting; a character may be describing an event as the scene cuts to just that in an obscured or dreamlike manner. The Mr. X sequence with Donald Sutherland is a perfect example of how to pull of engrossing exposition; plus is there a more classic cold war, spy movie type scene than meeting a suited man in the park to receive classified information. Likewise, John Williams' theme for JFK evokes my inner patriotic American, even if I'm not American. The militaristic and at other times conspiratorial nature of the score helps make the movie as compelling as it is. The black & white scenes such as those featuring the military feel reminiscent of Seven Days In May with shades throughout of the John Frankenheimer style. I'm sure Stone must have also taken some pointers from the first movie about the Kennedy assassination, 1973's Executive Action.JFK continues the tradition of films such as The Longest Day in which a large ensemble cast of familiar faces and great screen presences to help guide us through the story. It's amazing seeing different generations of actors doing some of the best work their careers and utilizing their screen personas to full effect even if many of them are only on screen for short spaces of time. Some of the figures in the story strike me as too bizarre to have been real-life people, especially David Ferrie and Claw Shaw.I've always been in defense of Kevin Costner against criticisms of being a dull actor. Granted his career did go downhill in mid 90's and has never fully recovered but in his heyday of the late 1980's/early 90's he was such a hot streak of films. Casting him in the role of Jim Garrison couldn't be more perfect as Costner is much like a modern-day classic movie actor in the vein of everymen like James Stewart, Henry Fonda or Gary Cooper. He's been most commonly compared to Cooper (the courtroom section of the film is reminiscent of Cooper's role in The Fountainhead) although with his southern demeanor I would compare him to being a modern-day Henry Fonda. I would defy anyone to call Costner a bad actor after watching the film's courtroom scene. Talking almost non-stop for 40 minutes and never losing my attention while exuding a stern, emotional and towards the end of the speech, a fragile voice; with his final conclusion bringing a tear to my eye.I find Jim Garrison's family life interesting itself, mostly from the relationship with his wife. What does he see in her? She does not support his endeavors, despite his noble cause and unlike her husband, she is susceptible to believing what the media tells her. Here is a man who spends the movie questioning and fighting the system yet has a wife with a conformist personality. I can't say for certain what they were like in real life but the in film I grew to dislike her character.JFK draws no conclusions, it doesn't prove who assassinated Kennedy and allows the viewer to make up their own mind. Stone may be often criticized for his use of a dramatist's license but as I say with many films based on historical events; this can make for a more compelling story. Even if there are untruths present, the film can act as a gateway to wanting to discover the real story. The movie did leave me a feeling of (good) anger and is one of the films I can credit with helping to influence the way I think.\"Dedicated to the young in whose the spirit the search for truth marches on.\"",

It is pure speculation. We may never know the whole truth about what happened in Dallas, Texas on November 22nd, 1963. Personally, I think the Warren Commission is true for two reasons: (1) The government couldn't do something like an assassination that neatly and cleanly. They would find a way to screw it up, because you have too many people in the government with their own agendas going. (2) Jack Ruby in the Mafia? NOT BLOODY DAMN LIKELY. Ruby was a hothead. Hardly the type who would work for the Mafia. He was the type of person the Mafia would love to make an example of. Craves too much attention, talks too much.My evaluation? Interesting.

            "content": "JFK is a political thriller film directed by Oliver Stone that gives up an interesting account on why President John F. Kennedy was assassination in Dallas, TX in Nov. 22, 1963. While, the events leading up to the true real life event is still a mystery and the facts gather up on the case wouldn't be disclose until 2017 and 2029. Oliver Stone gives us his take on what happen, why and how the government might be covering it up in the eyes of former New Orleans district attorney Jim Garrison (Kevin Costner). From all the assassination conspiracy theories out there ranging from Mafia connections to Cuba exiles, Oliver Stone picked up one that is a bit outlandish to base his movie around. Oliver Stone largely based his movie on New Orleans DA Jim Garrison's book \"On the trail of the Assassins\". Jim Garrison's story first off, wasn't a real good choice for a movie. The movie does take a big dramatic license in this story. Stone's depictions of Garrison is that of a fearless seeker of truth who seeking revenge out on New Orleans resident Clay Shaw (Tommy Lee Jones) who Garrison charged with conspiring with Lee Harvey Oswald (Gary Oldman) to assassinate Kennedy. In reality, Garrison was a paranoid, irrational bully who persecuted Shaw in conspiracy so vase it's hard to believe. While other critics might see this as all a misrepresentation of the truth, in my opinion, I really have doubts that this conspiracy theory really happen, but it might had. I'm more open to seeing this movie, than a lot of people, but still can't comprehend the uneven 'facts' the movie is projecting. It didn't help that years later, science would prove most of these claims to be unrealistic. The state-of-the-art forensic and computer analysis of the assassination since 1991, clearly shows that Oswald might had acted alone. All the findings have been consistent with the autopsy findings and demonstrate that both hits- the Kennedy-Connally first shot, and the fatal head wound third shot were fired from the 6th floor window of the Texas Book Depository, not from the picket fence or grassy knoll. The first shot passed through the president and then the governor in a relatively straight line, not the zigzag claimed by the movie Garrison. It's hard to think that Oswald was part of a conspiracy as he was known before the event as a loose-cannon. Oswald was originally trying to kill a general that day, not the president. The film says he was poor marksman, but in real life, he was quite good in his markings. About, Jack Ruby's action were a bit driven by his passion for the president. He did it for revenge. It's hard to think a strip club owner Ruby (Brian Doyle Murray) was part of a conspiracy even if he was part of the Mafia. In the film he's depicted surreptitiously planting the 'magic bullet' on a hospital gurney. The biggest out there claim the film has is the film's implication that President Lyndon B. Johnson was part of a coup d'\u00e9tat to kill Kennedy. Ouch. The idea of that is preposterous in 1991 as it is today, as Lyndon pretty much had no reason to kill Kennedy and Stone knew it. The movie explains Kennedy was assassinated because his foreign policy would have meant diminished profit for the military-industrial complex, and enraged high-ranking military officials who viewed such diplomacy as weakness. This is hardly the case, as Kennedy was indeed one of the men that help the build-up of the military during the Cold War and help put the space race into play that made more profit than ever before. I had study the Warren Commission, and the House Select Committee on Assassinations to the best of my ability, and I just can't find myself, putting Clay Shaw with John F. Kennedy together. The movie also takes some information accounts from Crossfire: The Plot That Killed Kennedy by Jim Marrs as a counter-myth to the Warren Commission's fictional myth. What the movie does so well, is mixing the real life footage with that of the fictionist story as it looks like a veneer of documentary verisimilitude. No wonder, why the film won best editing and cinematography at the Academy Awards. Before the age of the internet, this was the first time, I have ever saw the brutal Zapruder footage. It was really was intense. It's really hard to tell, what is real and what isn't when watching this film. The acting in this cast was really good. The length of the movie is pretty hard to get through if not a history buff. Its 3 hours long, and most of the movie is talking. . It's even worst in the Director's Cut version as there is nearly 54 minutes worth of deleted and expanded scenes. It was a bit too long and excessively detailed. It could be more concise. Overall: a lot of people still believe that JFK die in a conspiracy theory matter. So this movie will continue to find an audience wanting to know more about the event.",

I have not read any material on Holocaust denial, nor have I read deSade's 'Justine', nor the Nazi Racial Purity laws either, but that does not prevent historically informed and morally centered persons from making judgments on those. The febrile fantasies of Jim Garrison, a sadly deluded and pitiable figure, have been rejected by the overwhelming weight of respectable reportorial research; his delusions are accepted only by those unfortunates like Oliver Stone whose minds, having wandered too long in the jungles of left-wing paranoia, are now hopelessly lost in the fever swamps of conspiratorial hysteria.A schizophrenic cannot be faulted, I suppose, for viewing his world as fact; it is, after all, the only reality he knows. But Stone, as a skilled film maker, can most definitely be faulted for making a film which interweaves historical film footage and documented fact with fictional material. The result - as Stone certainly knows - will be accepted by 85% of the American booboisie, to use Mencken's phrase, as a documentary. Thus will a great proportion of those who view this film come to believe, despite a shred of supporting evidence, that Lyndon Johnson, the CIA, and the military were complicit in the Kennedy assassination. To thus propogate such a monstrous historical falsity is to commit a perfidy of Brobdingnagian proportions.Stone is to be reviled for making this film, a fitting companion piece to 'Natural Born Killers' for the Movie Hall of Shame.",

It's SOOO an Oliver Stone movie, which means subtlety is in about as much supply as adults in Congress, but the subject matter is so fascinating that even Stone can't ruin it. And it's compelling too -- I don't know how much of this movie is fact and how much conjecture, but based on just the facts we for sure do know, it's almost objectively obvious that Kennedy was assassinated by more than one person. And the movie feels eerily relevant right now, with its claim that the Kennedy assassination was actually a soft government coup while an alarmingly large population of current-day Americans support a coup of their own.Mostly, I was struck by how a movie like this would never get made today. No way would you get this many big movie stars together in one place outside of a Marvel movie, and no way would a modern-day movie audience have the attention span to absorb a three and a half hour movie in one sitting. And there's a big old fashioned movie quality about this one that at the time I probably would have resisted, with its big themes and its obvious heroes and villains and its naive belief in truth and justice that I now got a kind of nostalgic pleasure out of because you don't really find them anymore in movies made for adults.\"JFK\" was the talk of the town when it was released and inspired a hilarious \"Seinfeld\" sketch, but it went up against \"The Silence of the Lambs,\" another pop culture juggernaut, at the 1991 Academy Awards, and it didn't have a prayer. It did win Oscars for its cinematography and film editing, and received additional nominations for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Supporting Actor (Tommy Lee Jones), Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Original Score, and Best Sound.Oh, and the less said about its treatment of the LGBTQ+ community the better. That is one way in which this movie has definitely not aged well.Grade: A.",

            "review_title": "Technically Masterful Manipulation of Historical Fiction",
            "content": "The most important thing to remember about Oliver Stone's JFK is that it's a work of \"What If?\" type speculative fiction based on a historical event. The film also has a thesis -- that JFK was murdered by a conspiracy hatched within the government -- and uses all of Oliver Stone's cinematic skill to manipulate it's audience into agreeing with his conclusions. Is that wrong? No, but it might be irresponsible considering the extreme nature of some of Stone's conclusions. Most notably the idea that Kennedy was killed in a coup-de-tat takeover led by Lyndon Johnson. Oh, really? He may have been, who knows. Like many other humans I am fascinated by the story of the Kennedy assassination and would love to get to the bottom of it, have spent my fair share of time reading both online & off since a young age about the history of the event augmented by various conspiracy and anti-conspiracy theories, and have managed to keep an open mind on the subject. Like a vast number of Americans I believe that Lee Oswald did not act alone in murdering John Kennedy, which in itself implies a belief that there probably was a conspiracy: The literal meaning of the term is that more than one person is involved. Lee Oswald is a fascinating & frightening figure from history mostly because of what a complete enigma he was in real life. I am of the opinion that he probably did shoot Kennedy from the TSBD window and was subsequently silenced by Jack Ruby (who died the day before my birthday, a fact that has always made my hair stand on end) so that the details of the plot would die with him.Beyond that who knows, or rather we will have to wait until at least 2017 -- just 10 years from now, actually -- to find out what more information there may be socked away somewhere, though if you ask me it won't end up solving a damn thing. Like Joe Pesci's David Ferrie says in a totally fictional scene that was created by Oliver Stone from whole cloth, \"It's a mystery wrapped up in a riddle hidden inside of an enigma. Even the shooters don't know who killed him -- don't you get it, man?\" That might be the most telling line in the whole film.And what a film it is. As a Syracuse University student studying video, film and media studies in the arts at the time of it's release I marveled at Oliver Stone and his cinematographers work, blending different movie stocks with television clips of historical films and present day recreations. The manipulation of reality is quite stunning, and so well done that there are times when one isn't entirely sure of what they are seeing or what it all means (which is exactly in step with Stone's comment that reading the Warren Commission reports was akin to \"drowning\" in information). But what concerns me this day as a post-9/11 viewer of the film, is how much are audiences aware of the extent to which the film blurs the line between history and fiction? It's a movie, with all of the implications of such a term. JFK is an entertainment, not a documentary, using a historical subject as a departure point for it's undeniably entertaining & involving plot line. My concern is that there are people whom I know personally that are convinced that JFK is in reality showing what really happened, by whom and why. It is exactly what they wanted to see, an their inability to distance themselves from the subject matter is exactly what Oliver Stone had in mind, and that is what I mean by \"irresponsible\" rather than his toying with factual data. The movie should almost be shown with an accompanying disclaimer saying \"The facts and events being depicted are a fictional re-creation and should not be seen as the only possible conclusion of the events being depicted: Independent thinking is advised.\" But it's still a great movie, one of the best contemporary detective stories to find it's way into the cinema, and if nothing else spurred a public re-interest in the subject that led to an amendment of the date when the sealed records of the event would be opened to the public. I honestly don't believe we will ever know exactly what happened and for that matter Stone's conclusions are as valid as anybody else's, and he did make a marvelous, ingenious movie about the subject that I would encourage anyone with an interest in it to see, especially to experience Stone's masterful manipulation of the different media techniques he uses. Just remember though, that when all is said and done it is a manipulation itself, like JAWS or STAR WARS, designed to influence the viewer and entertain them, and while it's departure point is a chapter from history the end result is primarily a work of speculative fiction.5/10, which is the grade I usually assign to work that is immune to criticism but technically brilliant. You can't evaluate the movie without dealing with it's politics, which sort of stacks the deck unfairly for those who happen to agree with the conclusions made. Therefore I am only grading the movie on it's technical accomplishment, which is exactly 1/2 of the loaf, or 5 out of ten.",

In the wake of the fiftieth anniversary of the assassination, Oliver Stone's claim that the whole event was deliberately engineered by an unholy alliance of the government, the CIA, FBI and other institutions, cannot be readily dismissed. In terms of filmmaking, JFK is cleverly structured as a quest-narrative, with Jim Garrison (Kevin Costner) gradually discovering more and more details about the assassination, and the various cover-ups that followed, while being continually frustrated in his task by obstructive institutions and/or individuals. It is a testament to his tenacity that he does not give up. In the final sequence he offers a tour de force in court as he presents his evidence at the trial of Clay Shaw (Tommy Lee Jones), whom he suspects of being a CIA agent. We already know the outcome of the trial, but Garrison's case is convincing nonetheless. Director Oliver Stone skillfully blends archive footage, black-and-white re-enactments of important events and color film to create a narrative which, although over two and a half hours in length, never fails to hold our attention. He is helped out by a clutch of excellent performances, notably from Costner (easily his finest hour in the cinema), Jones, Joe Pesci, Sissy Spacek and - in cameo roles - Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau.

I have read neither Garrissons nor Prouty\u00b4s books, but it\u00b4s an amazing amount of facts that are squeezed into these 3 short hours.The momentum of this movie is outstanding. Dramaturgically it's one of the best movies I have ever seen, much due to the amazing editing by Academy Award winners Joe Hutshing and Pietro Scalia. The structure of timelayers feels almost like a cubist painting by Picasso where you\u00b4re able to see every dimension at the same time.Another well deserved Oscar went to one of my favourite cinematographers of all time, Bob Richardson. Similar to Natural Born Killers, another Stone-Richardson collaboration among many, he plays with various filmstocks and formats, fooling your eye to the extent that the re-enactment of JFK\u00b4s murder feels almost documentary. The overhead lighting at Antoine's Restaurant, the shifts and fades when Garrison is reading the Warren Report, the use of light hot-spots giving you that white \"fuzz\".... The list goes on and on.The cast is flawless. This is really an ensemble movie although Costner, who\u00b4s never been better before or since, is the major star. The movie benefits from not being packed with A-list stars, which I believe would have reduced the sense of \"reality\". It feels as if Oldman was born to play Lee Harvey Oswald. Pesci delivers, as always. I get just as frustrated with Rooker's character every time I see the movie, a perfect casting.I was not surprised when this movie did not win the Academy Award for Best Movie, since it\u00b4s far to politically incorrect for Hollywood's taste.

            "content": "No, not the film. What is astonishing is the number of people who have the garbled notion that this film somehow presented a \"true\" account of the Kennedy Assassination. Stone takes a little from many of the hodge-podge of conspiracy theories out there and smashes them together into a tedious glop of nothing that an unbelievable number of people who have reviewed this movie to date take to be accurate. Stone's work does a disservice to those people who have spent years earnestly trying to piece together the events of Dallas. Diligent investigators of alternatives to the explanation embodied in the Warren Report have long ago discarded much of the Garrison \"evidence.\" Like Garrison, Stone casts a pall over all of the \"conspiracy theories\" with his plodding melange of discredited evidence and bogus witnesses. Like Garrison, Stone wants the glory of being THE GUY who solved the mystery. The problem is, his haphazard lashing together of the plausible alternative explanations of the killing with pieces of discredited nonsense only makes it easier for the Gerald Posner's of the world to discredit any and all alternative explanations. Stone (and Garrison) made links that careful alternative researchers have never made. In real life, Jim Garrison knew that his primary witness was perjuring himself regarding the \"sinister\" aspects of Clay Shaw's movements and alleged connections to Oswald, but Garrison went ahead with the evidence anyway. Stone only compounds the error. But from reading the reviews, it's obvious that as long as Stone plays into the mythology that JFK was a \"liberal hero\" who would never have made the errors LBJ did with regard to Viet Nam, Stone just has to be telling the truth -- regardless of what the historical records and JFK's own White House tapes reveal. It's equally obvious that for people who find ANY conspiracy theory easier to swallow than the \"lone nut\" theory, Stone is preaching to the choir. Trouble is, for serious researchers, he set the cause of alternative explanations of the assassination back to about 1968, because now those sincere researchers have to undo all the false connections to discredited theories that Stone made in this film. Posner and his ilk leaped at the chance to reconnect all the looniness of Garrison that careful alternative researchers had put to bed years ago. Even now, serious researchers still struggle with the misconceptions and misrepresentations that Garrison and Stone cobbled together in each man's quest for personal glory.As a film, JFK does have a few worthwhile elements. Some of the performances are quite good, as to be expected from the stellar cast that Stone assembled. And on many levels, the film excited historical inquiry, which is an inquiry that is seldom a bad thing for any culture. It is ironic, though, that so many who would fault the Warren Commission (only a small fraction of whom have ever attempted to read even the summary sections for themselves) will grasp at straws every bit as ludicrous as the \"single bullet\" theory simply because those theories fit a preconceived notion that everything done in government is conspiratorial. Even so, portraying Garrison as some heroic crusader would be laughable if he hadn't spent so much of his life ruining the lives of people -- not just in the Clay Shaw matter, but throughout his career as a DA in New Orleans. Stone did not set out to make a documentary, of course, he set out to entertain and to provoke. Unfortunately, it becomes clear in reading the reviews here that there are many, many people incapable of making that distinction.",

            "content": "Oliver Stone's wildly-speculative conspiracy theory epic 'JFK (1991)' opens with a montage of archival footage depicting the presidency of John F. Kennedy, 35th President of the United States, up until 12:30PM on Friday, November 22, 1963, in Dallas, Texas. However, even before this historical prologue has come to an end, Stone has already introduced his own dramatisation \u2013 a beaten prostitute, dumped on the side of a road, pleads that Kennedy's life is in danger. Her agonised cries play over familiar documentary footage of the Presidential motorcade. Already, Stone is defiantly blending fact and fiction, speculation and dramatisation. On its initial release, the film stirred enormous controversy due to its flagrant disregard for historical fact, but that's not what 'JFK' is all about. Oliver Stone may (or may not) genuinely believe all of Jim Garrison's conspiracy theories \u2013 which implicate everybody up to former President Lyndon B. Johnson \u2013 but his film nevertheless offers a tantalising \"what if?\" scenario, an unsettling portrait of the fallibility of \"history\" itself.Having undertaken some light research, I don't feel that Garrison's claims hold much water. However, that doesn't detract from the film's brilliance. Crucial is Stone's more generalised vibe of government mistrust, the acknowledgement that political institutions are at least conceptually capable of such a wide-ranging operation to hoodwink the American public. 'JFK' also paints a gripping picture of its protagonist, torn between its admiration for a man willing to contest the sacred cow of US government, and its pity for one so hopelessly obsessed with conspiracy that it consumes his life, family and livelihood. Kevin Costner plays Garrison as righteous and stubbornly idealistic, not dissimilar to his Eliot Ness in De Palma's 'The Untouchables (1987).' The only difference is that Garrison is chasing a criminal far more transparent than Al Capone \u2013 indeed, a criminal who may not exist at all. Costner is supported by an exceedingly impressive supporting cast, which includes Jack Lemmon, Kevin Bacon, Donald Sutherland, Joe Pesci, Michael Rooker, Tommy Lee Jones and Gary Oldman.With the Director's Cut clocking in at 206 minutes, 'JFK' is an epic piece of work. However, the film is so dazzlingly well-constructed that watching it becomes less of a choice than a compulsion. Stone frenziedly throws together seemingly-unrelated puzzle-pieces, systematically peeling back layer after layer of conspiracy until all that remains is what Jim Garrison believes to be the naked truth. Beneath the sordid details, Stone speculates on the nature of history itself. Archive footage blends seamlessly with dramatisation \u2013 but what is recorded history but a re-enactment submitted by the winners? Not even the witnesses to Kennedy's assassination, clouded by subjective perception, can know for sure what exactly took place on that dark day in Dallas. Perhaps Zapruder's 486 frames of grainy hand-held footage (combined with that of Nix and Muchmore) represents the only objective record of the event \u2013 but Antonioni's 'Blowup (1966)' showed that even photographic documentation is unreliable through the inherent bias of the viewer. In short, nobody knows what really happened that day. 'JFK' is Oliver Stone creating his own history \u2013 or merely correcting it.",

It's a visually striking, documentary like movie with heart-throbbing pace, and bravura acting with story based on nothing but hard facts. It was striking that polls conducted from 1966 on show that as many as 80% of the American public hold beliefs contrary to the findings of the Warren commission. And how could anybody believe the report that invented a \"magic bullet\" theory which supposed to explain how a mixed up character like Lee Harvey Oswald, could have managed to shoot both the president and governor Connally six times, including a fatal frontal shot to John F. Kennedy's head, clearly visible in Zapruder film, firing only three times in 5.6 seconds from up behind the motorcade. The facts of the case show that there had to be another gunman, and if so than we have a conspiracy, and everything that happened later both to principal characters, witnesses and shift in foreign and domestic American politics, only give proof to that conclusion. Oliver Stone waste no time in presenting the case. I've never seen a movie 197 minutes long, that doesn't let your mind wonder for a second. People who testify to various aspects of the assassination are moving in front of your eyes like passing trains and every one of them puts another piece in never completed puzzle of conspiracy behind the Kennedy assassination. This film, along with \"Executive action\", filmed only 10 years after, in 1973, show that the plot to kill John Kennedy is worked out and organized in a way that there's no doubt that it leads to the highest ranking government officials and all the industrial and banking tycoons that had everything to loose with JFK's policy of non involvement, racial equality and d\u00e9tente with the USSR. Later assassinations of Martin Luther King, and Robert Kennedy, show that this pattern was used in a same manner, to eliminate most dangerous political threats to the \"big money\" and conservative politics. Like Donald Sutherland's \"X\" has said in the movie \"Who benefited? Who has the power to cover it up?\", these are the questions Stone's film is trying and in my opinion succeeding in giving good answers to. More than recommended, a must see.",

Some have argued that this is okay because Stone is after a \"larger truth\" or because he is only creating a work of fiction and we should grant him some artistic license. Artistic license is fine up to a point, but artistic license is not without its limits. This is a film about truth. In the closing quote over the end credits, Stone tells us how we need to seek after the truth. Yet, Stone who meticulously researched so many aspects of this story, must have known that the \"facts\" he was presented were false and deliberately false.A talented director can make a great propaganda film, but in the end it is still propaganda. For Stone then to get on his soapbox and imply that he is the one seeking after the truth while he drags the truth through the gutter only cheapens this film. Like sausages you may enjoy this film as long as you don't look too closely into how it was made.4/10",

            "content": "And not the facts, you'll love this film.  Stone borrows allegations from several prominent theorists and presents them as if they are unimpeachably true.  He also makes up things of his own and throws them in, and you don't know who made up what.  The problem, to me, is that this film is presented as a historical movie.  You expect some errors and dramatic license in those, and those do exist.  But Stone takes the time (3 hours) and style to make JFK seem like a carefully reconstructed docudrama, which it's not.  The \"100 Errors in JFK\" page aside, there are numerous errors in logic made by Stone, and the fictions stand next to the facts.That's my big problem with the film: not that it pushes theories that are totally false, which it does, but that it relies on the ignorance of its audience to get by.  If conspiracy theories weren't so much more popular than the truth, I think a lot of  people would have been unable to stomach the way Stone attacks dead people who are innocent but unable to defend themselves, like Clay Shaw and David Ferrie.  I found myself disgusted by the way they were treated in the film.  They're not fictional characters, they were real people, and Stone is making a buck off the fact that millions of people have been fooled into thinking they murdered John F. Kennedy. Most of that fooling was done by Jim Garrison and his whacko crusade, and by guys like Fletcher Prouty, who were heavily involved with the film. Garrison isn't a hero, and he doesn't deserve the treatment he gets either. I wish I could evaluate the film more on its own merits- it's dramatic, if overlong.  I enjoyed Donald Sutherland's scenes despite my disagreement with their point.  As a film, it's a mixed bag, with some strong points and some weak ones.  As history, it's worse than bad, it's outright dishonest.",

            "content": "Greetings again from the darkness. Fifty years to the day after the tragic assassination of President Kennedy seems like the best time for me to finally write something about Oliver Stone's controversial 1991 film. As a Dallas resident, the hallmark event has never been far removed, either mentally or geographically. I periodically see movies at the Texas Theatre where Oswald was captured. It's impossible to drive downtown and not regularly pass the Texas School Book Depository and Dealey Plaza. The reminders are always present and maybe that's a good thing.When this movie was released, it shook the dust off the story and brought much attention back to the crime that had once seemed so quickly solved. The conspiracy theorists embraced Mr. Stone's work and even those who knew little of the Warren Report were swept up in the details and accusations. It was so easily accepted as an investigative presentation, and it was a way for the people to finally get what they wanted ... the answer to what happened and why.Viewing the film this week again for the first time since 1991, it's understandable why so many were swept up in the frenzy. This is an expert presentation of a staggering number of theories and details and characters. With a run time well over three hours, the only opportunities for an exhale come during the somewhat lame interactions between New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison (Kevin Costner) and his wife (Sissy Spacek). Othewise, it's a very well written parade of movie stars that is exceptionally photographed and expertly edited. Newsreel footage, reenactments, and dramatizations of events successfully create a mind puzzle. The film grabs you and does not let go ... and this is 22 years after release and 50 years after the assassination.Now don't mistake that praise for believability. While Stone's approach has been attacked from all sides, he did publish an annotated script \"proving\" his details. Still, his blending of theories is staggering: the military, the CIA, the FBI, LBJ, the Mafia, the pro- and anti-Castro types, the Russians, and even a likely corrupt businessman. The latter is Clay Shaw, played with evil enjoyment by Tommy Lee Jones in a role worthy of a movie unto itself.In Stone's version, Garrison is the voice of truth. He's the guy that doesn't buy off on the Warren Report. In fact, this movie version of Garrison represents us as the viewer ... the citizens who want to believe our government, but are too rational to accept things spoon fed to us. This isn't so much a courtroom drama or investigative report, it's more like a data dump. Stone is delivering all of the little doubts in one fell swoop. In other words, with all of these possibilities and unexplained events, how could it not be a conspiracy? Was it a coup d'etat with LBJ waiting in the wings? That makes sense if you believe defense contractors were unwilling to sit quietly as JFK pulled out of Vietnam. Was Oswald a patsy as he claimed? That argument can certainly be supported. More than one gunman? 5.6 seconds, a tree in the eye line, and smoke from the grassy knoll can lead to that conclusion. The movie serves as our emotional outburst at not knowing why this happened and who was responsible. We like our mysteries solved and this one apparently never will be.Roger Ebert once said that facts are for print and emotions are for film. Oliver Stone seems to excel at the latter. He gives us permission to be paranoid. He takes extreme dramatic license with two extended soliloquies: Donald Sutherland as \"X\" (Fletcher Prouty) and Kevin Costner as Garrison in the courtroom. Neither of these events are probable, in fact the courtroom scene is borne from numerous Garrison speeches, quotes and book passages over the years.This 50th anniversary has brought at least three new JFK inspired films: Parkland, Killing Kennedy, and Letters To Jackie. Three very different approaches to the man and the event that changed the world ... it changed our perceptions and our expectations. Oliver Stone's film gave us permission to do so out loud.",

Read Gerald Posner's _Case Closed_ for the (probable) truth of the matter, but as a film, you may never see anything more dynamic and manipulative.\"Like 'Birth of a Nation' (1915), this is history 'written with lightning,' and as Wilson intended, that can be taken as either a positive comment or a negative one. Like Griffith's racist tirade, 'JFK' is full of misconstructed and ill-conceived ideas, and tells its warped story in a way many another filmmaker would envy. Stone is controversial -- as Griffith was -- and for good cause. But he's a dynamic, original talent. All his films -- 'The Hand' excluded -- bear witness to this. 'JFK' may be his piece de resistance.\" -- 2002In the six years since I wrote the above comments, I have done more reading on the assassination of John Kennedy. Of course, in assessing a film it must be remembered that even the most documentary-like of documentaries is a fictional construction. In other words, the truth of what the film is depicting should not be brought in to the discussion. For example, you can't fault 'Pearl Harbor' (or 'Tora Tora Tora,' for that matter) for getting the history wrong, because it is only an entertainment, and cannot ever hope to emulate the reality of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. Writers and directors make choices about what they present us, even if it's only one take rather than another. Furthermore, feature films are, on some level, an art form, even the really bad ones like 'Pearl Harbor.' That being said, the truth of what happened in Dallas just after noon on November 22, 1963 should not, by rights, be allowed to influence one's perception of a feature film. But because 'JFK' was and remains so popular, the reality of the case should be mentioned in any responsible discussion of the film. From the beginning, there have been people who believe there was some sort of conspiracy involved in the murder of JFK. The simple fact is, there was not. Read Gerald Posner's 1993 _Case Closed_ for a relatively easy restatement of that, with convincing details... or if you're ambitious, and can stand his sarcasm and condescension, read Vincent Bugliosi's recent _Reclaiming History_. Bugliosi has a substantial chapter about this film that refutes the crap Stone presents as fact. Everyone one who believes in this movie's conclusions should read this chapter, if not the entire 1,600 page book. Frighteningly, 'JFK' had a 'study guide' prepared for its use in classrooms. The fact that Stone is glorifying a DA who not only abused his power in an effort to get and remain in the public eye, but was also possibly insane, should preclude this film being used in anything other than a film theory class. It is NOT history (although it's probably a good version of how Jim Garrison himself might have remembered his 'crusade' against Clay Shaw), it is a tour de force of the filmmaker's art. Even the acting is good... one just wishes an 'A-list' director would film the JFK assassination without the conspiracy crap to both muddy the waters and confound the viewer.Conspiracies are fun to believe in, but they're not a part of what really happened that day. I have downgraded my rating of 'JFK'. Despite its technical mastery, the way this film has warped the public's perception of JFK, Jim Garrison, Lee Harvey Oswald and Clay Shaw, I cannot honor this film with a high rating, any more than I can honor Leni Riefenstahl's Nazi propaganda piece 'Triumph of the Will'. The shear evil of the latter film knocks at least three points off it. 'JFK' loses two points and now gets a '4'. 2 February 2008",

            "content": "Some people contend that Oliver Stone's movie \"suggested\" that the government was behind the Kennedy assassination, but I wish to assert that it proved that the government was behind it, as were the Mafia and the Cuban exiles. Kevin Costner plays New Orleans DA Jim Garrison, who sought to expose the conspiracy: the generals were angry at Kennedy for trying to get out of Vietnam, the Cuban exiles blamed JFK for being \"soft\" on Castro (which he really wasn't), and after the assassination, everyone who should have investigated was sent out of the country.There's another interesting part here. Recently, Cuban exile Luis Posada Carriles was arrested for illegally entering the United States. A cop during Batista's reign, he fled to the US and was trained at Ft. Benning, Georgia. In 1976, he blew up the airplane carrying Cuba's LaCrosse team, killing everyone on board. He never repented. In 1997, he set off several bombs in Havana hotels, killing an Italian tourist, and then in 2000 was arrested after he tried to assassinate Castro while the Cuban leader was making a speech in Panama. Acquitted by Panama's outgoing president in 2004, he made his way to the US. Now that he's been arrested, reports have been coming out about him. One was titled \"Who has what to hide about Luis Posada Carriles?\" It says that he may have been in Dealey Plaza on November 22, 1963, and that George H.W. Bush may have also been there.I don't know for certain that Posada was there, but it begs the question: if more information about the Kennedy assassination comes out, what are we going to learn about whom? Now that most Americans believe that Lee Harvey Oswald didn't act alone, what else is out there? Even the \"official\" story about Oswald is sketchy. He supposedly defected to the Soviet Union, but he'd never had any pro-Communist sympathies during his youth. Apparently, around the time when he \"defected\", U2 spy planes began flying missions over the USSR. One was shot down on May Day, 1960, forcing a cancellation of a summit between Eisenhower and Khrushchev. According to what I've read, it sounds like the CIA deliberately sent the plane over there in order to cripple possibilities that Cold War tensions would ease. But just how does this relate to Oswald and the assassination? Who all was involved? As it is, it sounds like some Nazis were also involved.I feel that I should also discuss John Kennedy himself. He has been known as progressive, but if one looks at his record, one becomes cynical. He made a conscious effort to overthrow Castro, even approving Operation Mongoose to destabilize Cuba. He increased the number of US troops in South Vietnam. Known as involved in the Civil Rights Movement, in reality he tried to stop the March on Washington, and even sent LBJ to Norway that day, believing him to be \"too pro-civil rights\" (which Johnson wasn't). Probably most perfidious of all, when a pro-democracy movement arose in Guatemala against the terrorist regime installed by the CIA, Kennedy made sure to crush the movement. So why did certain elements want to eliminate him? Because he wasn't an extremist. He didn't want to use US troops to invade Cuba (and so the CIA embarrassed him into taking the blame for the Bay of Pigs debacle), and he was planning to remove US troops from Vietnam by 1965. This is why they decided to get rid of him. It seems that the same sentiments existed in the Soviet bureaucracy: less than a year after the Kennedy assassination, Soviet hardliners overthrew Khrushchev, probably the most moderate Soviet leader until Gorbachev.If we continue investigating this, who knows what we'll discover. But the overall point is that \"JFK\" proved (not implied) that there was a conspiracy.",

            "content": "The questions that everyone raises about Oliver Stone's JFK is whether the choice to make the controversial District Attorney Jim Garrison the protagonist/hero of the piece. A cursory glance at even the Wikipedia article about Garrison shows a career full of controversy, his investigation of the Kennedy assassination only the most known.Kevin Costner plays Garrison who is presented as Mr. Average Man of the new South going through at this time the catharsis of the social change the Civil Rights Era wrought. A couple names known to him surface in reports about the assassination and Garrison starts his own probe. It brings him the most controversy in a controversial career and nearly wrecks his domestic situation as wife Sissy Spacek threatens to leave and take the kids.The most flamboyant performance in the film is that of Joe Pesci as David Faerie who was the linchpin of Garrison's case. He was the link to the late Lee Harvey Oswald and the collection of folks that Garrison eventually indicted. Remember all the action in the film ended in 1969 a few months before the Stonewall Rebellion. We're introduced in this case to a bunch of gay conservatives, in fact they're downright reactionary. Faerie is a pilot and part of the underground gay culture that New Orleans had. Today it's a lot more open I assure you. Today this bunch would be Log Cabin Republicans.The group is headed by Tommy Lee Jones playing Clay Shaw who since just about everyone in the Sixties was in the closet, Jones ruled the gay closet in New Orleans at the time. Unlike Faerie or Kevin Bacon who plays a favorite boy toy of the clique and who get busted in bar raids regularly, Jones is rich enough to be above all that. I'm surprised he didn't retain Roy Cohn as an attorney although he probably figured a New York Jew wouldn't go over big in a New Orleans court.At the time Oliver Stone got pilloried for delving on the gay aspect of the conspirators. That was an error, these guys were what they were. Whether Garrison was really on to something is a whole other matter which we may never know until everything about the Kennedy assassination is declassified.Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau are in this and it is on the list of their collaborative work although they have no scenes together. Matthau has a scene on an airplane with Costner and Matthau plays Senator Russell B. Long of Louisiana, son of a man who was assassinated himself. He's most skeptical about the Warren Report. Lemmon plays a gumshoe operative working for Edward Asner playing Guy Bannister who was linked to Shaw. He was a nasty, brutal, reactionary drunk and gets into it with Lemmon on the day of the assassination in flashback. Lemmon gives Costner some leads in the right direction. JFK is a film that provides a view of the Kennedy assassination, but good as it is should be taken with a grain of salt.",

            "content": "I think JFK as a film succeeds on multiple levels. It manages to inform and educate without ever feeling like a lecture; it manages to entertain and engross without ever feeling like it's trying too hard to either offend you or maintain your interest with cheap gimmicks; it manages to create enough doubt and give you enough material to make up your own mind without ever feeling like it's insulting or patronising you. I very recently saw the recent acclaimed film The Queen which revolved around the death of a global icon, Lady Diana, but where that one was more about reaction, JFK is more about action.The reason I found JFK to be better than The Queen is because it tells you of the assassination and then jumps forward three years, showing you how one man came to work out a possible conspiracy theory. Likewise with any subject; create a theory, a hypothesis and research your area of study. It can be science (Newton \u0096 Gravity), mathematics (John Nash); hell even film/cinema (Mulvey \u0096 The Gaze) but Jim Garrison (Costner) comes up with and works out a theory that Kennedy was perhaps killed in ways different to what we would all believe and that Oswald (Oldman) is not as guilty as you would think. This is the basis for the film and it works an absolute delight. Yes, the film's narrative is a little confusing and difficult to follow but keep reminding yourself that this is a theory one man is trying to crack; a sort of 'who dun it' in the vast world of 1960's America but the detective is one mere man with some researchers to back him up.Comparing the film to another 21st Century detective tale is perhaps a little silly to do if I was comparing them in terms of quality but JFK very much reminded me of recent effort Zodiac; one man tries to find the truth behind a major event that remains unexplained but whilst Robert Graysmith was a comic book artist, Garrison is a man of the law anyway and we accept that he is up to the challenge. But JFK is arguably better because there is no definitive point of view. Witnesses and people who might know something give their own accounts through their own flashbacks; this is JFK acknowledging that its hero cannot know of other peoples flashbacks if he was not present at the time and thus; gives us impressive and dramatic black and white scenes revolving around either the death or events taking place somewhere else with someone else. Some examples here include Jack's (Lemmon) memory of being pistol whipped; Willie's (Bacon) memory of the gang talking about how great it would be if Kennedy died and Clay's (Lee Jones) memories of a homosexual romp at his house \u0096 the genius here is that each flashback may be the truth, it may be a lie or it may be mere memory catching up with its harbinger.Make no mistake that the film is political. This is a brave film from Oliver Stone and one that I'm sure opened the eyes of the people watching it; not just at what it was saying but perhaps made them question the assassination altogether. Getting back to The Queen; when Diana did die, the country was in morning and I can imagine a similar reaction to Kennedy in 60s America but how stupid, perhaps embarrassed, would those people have felt if they'd realised it was all a lie and that the government had her killed due to insider reasons? After the reaction and the funeral (which is in the top 5 most watched televised items in Britain's history) and everything else; how perhaps anticlimactic would it be if we all learnt she was deliberately murdered; indeed an inquest happening round about now might just un-turn some facts no one wants to know. But this is the film JFK at its core; one man who wants everyone to build up the courage to perhaps realise the inevitable: their country's government has been lying and what was once an event that brought the nation together; now motivates the people to turn away from the state.JFK would have us believe a group of homosexuals set up a complex idea that killed Kennedy, for the first half. But the checkpoint arrives in the form of 'X' (Sutherland) who gives Garrison clues and information just when everything seems lost. After the press publicise Garrison's attempts, Jim is embarrassed and lost but it works FOR him as the papers are how 'X' discovers Jim to be so close. His monologue, maybe one of the longest if not memorable from 1990s cinema; sways not only Jim's view but ours: maybe this group are not so guilty and the government are up to no good. The fact 'X' thinks that the government thought that he was so good at cracking these things, he was shipped to the middle of snowy nowhere, could be an ego trip on X's behalf but it could be the disturbing truth; we might never know. JFK basically tells us one thing for the first half, telling us the argument's one side before flipping the proverbial pancake and letting the other half simmer whilst the one in focus now has its very own moment. JFK is almost a guerrilla film: its use of politics, its fast edits of real footage; perhaps subliminally blinding us with placards of 'Hooray for JFK' and its strong feeling of realism as it dawns on you that you are not watching fiction is eerie as it is brilliant. Apart from the genius of the depth; the film is still well acted with a sprinkling of stars, great dialogue and impressive cinematography. The argument Garrison delivers in the courtroom is fascinating as it is brilliantly executed, twinned with Oswald's 'real' actions \u0096 a film that will captivate and spellbound, at least until 2039.",

            "content": "\"JFK\" opens with a clip of President Eisenhower delivering his famous farewell speech where he warns the American people about the pervasive power of the military industrial complex.  Director Oliver Stone treats it as an omen of things to come.I'd seen this film when it was released theatrically and just the other day I rented the directors cut on video, and there's no other way to regard this film than as a masterpiece of American cinema.  No other event in recent history has impacted our lives more than the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.  Oliver Stone presents his theory about the events surrounding that November day, basing it all on verifiable facts that are meticulously presented throughout the film.  What he's saying is that a coup d'etat probably took place against the President of the United States and that it was carried out by people within our government who considered Kennedy a communist sympathizer and traitor.  The huge defense contracts that were contingent on our government pursuing a pro-war policy in Vietnam also were a factor in his assassination.I'm not an expert on these matters.  I lived through the Sixties and vividly recall the day Kennedy was shot.  I also remember the aftershocks when Martin Luther King and Bobby Kennedy were assassinated in 1968.  Those were strange times and the American people weren't sophisticated enough to understand everything that was bubbling beneath the surface.  Oliver Stone has obviously researched this subject thoroughly, and I find his explanations very plausible.Perhaps the best argument for a coup having occurred takes place when Donald Sutherland's character, a mysterious black ops ex-military man, explains it all to Jim Garrison during a walk around the Reflecting Pool in Washington. It's a terrific scene and one that made the hair on the back of my neck stand up.  This character puts everything into context, the history of the CIA from the end of World War II through the Cold War, and when he's done, you can't help but feel some people in our government had Kennedy killed.The acting in this film is terrific.  Kevin Costner plays Jim Garrison, the New Orleans attorney investigating the assassination, very well.  His closing argument in the trial of Clay Shaw where he presents all the evidence of a conspiracy to the jury is a classic scene. \nBesides Donald Sutherland, several other great actors take turns playing bit parts:  Walter Mathau plays a cynical Sen. Long, Ed Asner plays an ex-FBI agent turned rabid rightwinger with chilling accuracy, Jack Lemmon plays a drunken hanger-on, Gary Oldman is good as Lee Harvey Oswald.  There are many others but I can only name a few.The blending of dramatic action and real news clips taken at the time is superb.  Oliver Stone builds his story scene by scene, revelation by revelation, until the dramatic ending where Garrison makes his case to the jury.  Only the most stubborn, ignorant viewer could disagree with his conclusion that a coup d'etat took place that day.  The idea that Oswald acted alone is just plain ludicrous.Kennedy's assassination is the greatest mystery of our time.  Will we ever learn the truth or has it been buried forever?  I'd like to believe we're strong enough as a nation to survive the shock of knowing what really happened, but I have my doubts whether the government will ever release the files locked up.Until then, this movie will have to stand as the defining explanation of what happened November 22nd, 1963.",

            "content": "JFK is one of the greatest films ever made,an excellent,powerful and unforgettable masterpiece that combines amazing direction,a terrific all-star cast,a wonderful script and a brilliant and intense film score. All of those elements make JFK a classic political Thriller/Mystery,an outstanding piece of cinema and Oliver Stone at his best.Based on the books On The Trail Of The Assassins by Jim Garrison and Crossfire:The Plot That Killed Kennedy,JFK tells the story of Jim Garrison(Kevin Costner),a New Orleans District Attorney who is investigating the Assassination of President John F. Kennedy that happened on November 22,1963. While some think it was just Lee Harvey Oswald(Gary Oldman)alone that did the shooting,Garrison thinks that there was others involved and that there was a conspiracy to kill Kennedy and Jim Garrison is investigating the events that lead up to the assassination.Released in 1991,JFK is an amazing film that was controversial even before was released into movie theaters and is still one of the most controversial films of all time because some critics and the media felt that director Oliver Stone was taking liberties with historical facts and events. Whether anyone will see the film as fact or fiction,JFK is a brilliant film on every level,a thought-provoking masterpiece that punches you in the face right from the beginning grabbing you by the throat and never letting viewers go until the very end and is a movie that is an assault on the senses and the mind. JFK is also an intense Mystery-Thriller and one of the best Mystery-Thrillers ever made that is filled with intensity and with white hot suspense with questions about the John F. Kennedy Assassination,a tragic event that changed America in 1963. The beauty of JFK is that Kennedy's death is seen as an unsolved mystery not about who killed President Kennedy,but why was Kennedy killed,who really benefited,who has the power to cover it up? Was the Kennedy Assassination a conspiracy? Did Lee Harvey Oswald act alone or were there others? Were the United States Federal Government,FBI,CIA and Mob involved? The movie in a frightening way asks these questions but instead of answering them JFK lets viewers answer these questions themselves and the movie messes with you not just physically but mentally as well because the whole entire film is like a giant puzzle or riddle and we as the viewer are trying to put pieces together. JFK is an epic film in the truest sense with a running time of 3 hrs and 9 minutes but it is the fastest three and a half hours you will ever watch and you are never bored or tired. What I love about JFK is the non linear style the film has using flashbacks with some of the characters telling different stories with multiple camera styles to keep the story moving and going nonstop. The screenplay by Zachary Skyler and Oliver Stone is fantastic and powerful with Skyler and Stone giving the movie dialog and scenes that are dramatic and tight and at times feels like a Shakespearean tragedy. The main character Jim Garrison is not only the hero of JFK but he also represents the audience because like Jim Garrison we are investigating why John F. Kennedy was killed and who was behind the assassination and as Garrison goes in deep into the investigation Garrison begins to lose his idealism and the way he used to feel about the law and government before the assassination opening his eyes and realizing white is black and black is white. Although Garrison investigating the case is affecting his personal life with his family,he still loves his family and wants to protect them while still wanting to solve the John F. Kennedy killing never wanting to stop no matter what. Jim Garrison is a fascinating and memorable character and we root for Garrison all the way for wanting to find out the truth. The ending is amazing because even though it is a conclusion It feels like the investigation into John F. Kennedy assassination will go on forever and it will either be solved or remained unsolved with the real truth still being out there. A terrific ending.The whole cast is amazing. Kevin Costner is excellent and gives the best performance of his career as Jim Garrison,with Costner bringing power,depth and heroic quality to the role. Tommy Lee Jones is terrific as Clay Shaw,a New Orleans business man implicated in the assassination. Gary Oldman is wonderful as Lee Harvey Oswald,the killer and assassin of John F. Kennedy. Joe Pesci is fiery and memorable as David Ferrie,a friend of Clay Shaw's. Kevin Bacon shines as Willie O'Keefe,a male prostitute and friend of David's. Donald Sutherland is fantastic as Mr. X,a former colonial giving Garrison information. Sissy Spacek is great as Liz Garrison,Jim's wife. Jack Lemmon(Jack Martin),Ed Asner(Guy Bannister),Michael Rooker(Bill),Jay O. Sanders(Lou),Laurie Metcalf(Susie),John Candy(Dean Andrews Jr),Walter Matthau(Russell B. Long),Brian Doyle-Murray(Jack Ruby),Wayne Knight(Numa),Beata Pozniak(Marina Oswald),Sally Kirkland(Rose Cheramie)and Vincent D'Onofrio(Bill Newman,eyewitness)give great performances as well.The direction by Oliver Stone is brilliant and stylish,with Stone always moving the camera showing close-ups,visual stunning shots that use Black and white to great effect and give the film a documentary feel keep the movie going at a quick pace. Wonderful direction,Stone.The score by John Williams is outstanding,powerful and intense,with Williams' score being epic,heroic and suspenseful matching the film's tone to perfection. A terrific score by Williams and one of his best.In final word,if you love Oliver Stone,Political Thrillers,Mysteries or films in general,I highly suggest you see JFK,one of the greatest films ever made and an excellent,unforgettable Masterpiece of cinema that you can watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",

Using the real-life theories of Jim Garrison (played winningly here by Kevin Costner) the movie delves into all sorts of conspiracy theories involving multiple gunmen, duped decoys, split identities, and government cover-ups.Taken as a whole the film is watchable and pervasive, sowing serious doubts on the 'lone gunman' explanation of the murder.  Lee Harvey Oswald (another memorable performance from Gary Oldman) is seen as a patsy who died for the will of a much higher power; his murder so soon after that of Kennedy smacks of fanaticism and a need for the real killers to sell him out as the sacrificial lamb.  This is where Garrison's story is coming from.In the cast we find Tommy Lee Jones, Kevin Bacon, Jack Lemmon, Donald Sutherland (in an electrifying and impenetrable cameo), and Sissy Spacek all contributing to a tightly written drama of disparate theories that don't quite come together.  As entertainment, all this works fine.  As an attempt to rewrite history, it is perhaps too unwieldy to be of any real use.",

Not according to Mr. Jim Garrison (the DA). In the extensive investigation he starts, he comes up with several alternative theories about a conspiracy against Kennedy. In Garrison's opinion, Oswald was just a decoy for the operation. Personally, I'm no expert about the Kennedy murder at all. But these alternative theories makes this movie too speculative. An attempt to link the American weapons industry to the assassination seems ridiculous to me. It's even implied that Lyndon B. Johnson was involved. Get a grip, people. Another downside in this movie is that it lasts too long, more than three hours. The about 30 minutes long speech from Garrison in the court at the end should at least have been cut down by half.",

There are many great actors here including Kevin Costner, Gary Oldman, Edward Asner, Sissy Spacek, and so on. I cannot single anyone out because everyone was so good.When this movie came out in 1991, it received plenty of criticism.

It's safe to assume that Stone expected this to function as a valve that would give voice to decades of pent-up frustration with an inept, at worst shady, bureaucracy and government, even a half-paranoid, jagged voice.But important just the same, first because it taps into a national narrative a part of which you have privately seen unfold, possibly puzzled over the many implications and what your own level of involvement should be, but more in how it suggests that even such a massive narrative seen from so many ends is actually being engineered somewhere, which is a fundamental asset of film noir. We all live in a noir world, small and tossed about by forces beyond comprehension or so abstract as to be completely removed from reality. The idea is that somewhere must be locked away a set of answers that explain this hidden fabric of things, ideally a list of names.Of course if this conspiracy is true that is devastating for obvious reasons. And if it's not we should feel at least anger about the secrecy, omission and just plain ineptitude involved.But the point is one way or the other, we do live in that noirish world as we understand it to work and have been co-conspirators in the enigmatic fabrication. We have poked holes in the fabric of things. The damage is irreversible and starts here for the generation that is still responsible for a lot of our storytelling.This is the gist of the film, the effort to assemble truth from disjointed life creating disjointed truths that further disjoint life. It's purely a Wellesian construct adopted from Kane but even more visual at this point. All sorts of movies unravel at every intersection. Some are testimonies, others memories, still others reports and counter-reports. Photos are animated for us. Zapruder's film. Stone's re-enactment of it but as actual footage. TV screens playing bits that we need to see.And all that conflated and re-assembled into a trial. Stone's lofty intention is that this would be the trial that never happened, with us in the role of jury. But of course only some of what we've seen can be true at any given time, so at least some of what we've experienced as real from our end is not. Part of the film is lying.This is a powerful conception that I don't think Stone ever came close to again. It aligns every small individual search for meaning in images with a massive effort to understand collective soul.It makes a lot of sense that Stone appropriates visual grammar to express this from the enemy side of Eisenstein and Soviet montage. Those were always about a struggle and present action, never a thought. Stone presumes to inherit the agitprop experiment. We are meant to leave the trial animated to take action, probe and question.But he falters at the last moment with his cloying courtroom sermon. It is evident here that Stone believes himself to be another Jim Garrison fighting to unveil evil. He feels so strongly about the subject matter, so emotionally, the maker slips out among the film. The spell is broken. We get to note that it was all put together solely for our verdict.",

Different strokes, after all.What I just can't get my head around are the reasons people give for why they believe JFK is a masterpiece...First of all, I keep hearing people say that JFK is a masterful organization of complex information. It seemed to me that Stone just threw together every conceivable disjointed theory - in no particular order or organization - and doesn't even tell us which one is the right one. I mean, at the end of the movie, I couldn't even say who I thought I was SUPPOSED to believe actually killed JFK. Was it LBJ? The mafia? The Dallas police force?... Joe Pesci? Second of all, people who never believed that anyone besides Lee Harvey Oswald killed JFK say that - after seeing this movie - they are now ardent believers that there actually was a conspiracy. Well, in my book, the movie pretty much demonstrated that all the conspiracy theories are the result of a lot of people looking very hard for evidence to support their theories - and eventually finding this \"evidence\" in everyday events and coincidences. From a statistical point of view, the Bermuda Triangle has no greater incidence of lost ships and planes than any other area of the ocean. It's just that - once people started looking in that particular area - the Triangle began to seem like the disappearance capital of the world.In the case of JFK, it seemed that Stone proved by example that - if you look hard enough - you can come up with evidence to support the theory that Santa Clause was behind JFK's assassination.It seems to me that - after watching JFK, you either have to come to the conclusion that a) everyone in the known universe (except, of course, Lee Harvey Oswald) was in on the assassination, or b) that pretty much all of the conspiracy theories are the result of overactive imaginations.The only points I give to JFK are for effort and for an impressive cast.I give it 3 out of 10.",

It was of all things the Clay Shaw, Tommy Lee Jones, trial that Stone used in his movie \"JFK\" to totally disprove the by now in the garbage can, in that almost no one believes it anymore, Warren Commission Report on the assassination. In that the Clay Shaw trial was the first and only trial that involved the JFK assassination with Shaw, a successful New Orleanes businessman,being charged with being, a planner not shooter, behind it.The movie succeeds in disproving the Warren Commission but falls somewhat flat on its face in trying to connect a number of US Government agencies, like the CIA, the Mafia anti-Castro Cubans as well as Vice President Johnson as being somehow behind JFK's assassination. It was like Stone trowing a plate of spaghetti on the wall and see what would stick. Still Stone does a masterful job in waking the public up to the discrepancies as well as out right lies that they've been fed over the years by major members of the US media that Lee Harvey Oswald, Gary Oldman, was the lone nut assassin or the assassin at all. It's three years after JFK was killed that New Orleans D.A Jim Garrison, Kevin Costner, decided to reopen the case in that Oswald originally was in the city, as a Marxist Communist activist, the summer before JFK was murdered. Oswald was also closely associated with a number of people who wanted President Kennedy dead and made no bone in hiding their dislike of him.As Garrison uncovers evidence that shows Oswlald was not what the media as well as the FBI and Warren Commission made him out to be key witnesses to what happened that fateful afternoon in Dallas Texas, November 22 1963, start to either clam up disappeared or meet an unexpected end in life. One of them is the wacko David Ferrie, Joe Pesci, who was in the same US civil air patrol unit with Oswald back in the mid 1950's when Oswald was still in his teens. Ferrie made an unexpected trip to Dallas to go duck hunting with a number of his friends the day that JFK was shot and left the very same evening! Was it to shoot JFK not ducks that Ferrie & Co were really interested in? It was through Ferrie as well as convicted male hooker Willie O'Keefe, Kevin Bacon, that eventually lead to Shaw in his being suspected of having foreknowledge to the JFK assassination. In that all three, Ferrie O'Keefe & Shaw, had a mutual acquaintance with non other then Lee Harvey Oswald! JFK's convicted in absentia assassin, since he was deceased and couldn't defend himself, by the Warren Commission!As interesting as the movie is it's the last 15 or 20 minutes that really hit home and make an impression on the audience when D.A Jim Garrison makes his final summation to the jury. It's then that all the BS half truths lies shyster talk and inconsistencies in what happened on November 22, 1963 becomes apparent to those of us watching the film as well as those in the courtroom. Even though Garrison doesn't end up convicting Clay Shaw in his part in the JFK assassination he does in fact prove that we've, the American public, had been had or conned into believing what the US Government and Warren Commission told us the truth about the \"facts\" in the JFK assassination without as much as bothering to check any of the facts or evidence out! Which in fact D.A Jim Garrison not only did but in his Don Quixote like determination attempted to, against overwhelming odds,and proved to the jury! Who despite finding Shaw innocent agreed that a conspiracy was involved in the assassination of JFK. P.S It was ironic as well as a stroke of genius for Stone to cast the real Jim Garrison in the film as non other as Chief Justice Earl Warren who comes across as if he's either brain dead or suffering from the advance stages of Alzhimer Disease in his robotic and zombie like performance. It was Warren and his Warren Commission that Jim Garrison was out to prove was either totally inept or criminally irresponsible in covering up the true facts behind the JFK assassination!",

Google \"One Hundred Errors of Fact and Judgment in Oliver Stone's JFK\". Jim Garrison was a despicable person who \"violated every prosecutorial rule in the book\". Several important members of his staff resigned in disgust when they saw that Garrison was pursuing an innocent man by having his staff bribe, intimidate, and even hypnotize witnesses in the Clay Shaw case. Garrison's unprofessional antics were so notorious in New Orleans at the time that when David Chandler, a Life magazine reporter from New Orleans who wrote a series of articles in April and September of 1967 about organized crime in Louisiana containing unflattering references to Garrison (which Garrison called lies), he was subpoenaed by Garrison before the Shaw grand jury to testify on what he had written, the federal district court in New Orleans, on March 11, 1968, enjoined Garrison from enforcing his subpoena. The court said that \"Garrison has stated his lack of regard for the truthfulness of the very testimony being sought...Chandler's fear of prospective prosecution for perjury...is well founded.\"William Gurvich was asked by Garrison to lead the investigation of Shaw, which Gurvich did. Though one of Garrison's strongest supporters at the start of the investigation, Gurvich became disillusioned when he saw there was no real evidence against Shaw. Gurvich went in front of the Orleans Parish grand jury on June 28, urging it not to indict Shaw (which it ultimately did), and spoke of Garrison's unconscionable investigation, which included putting pressure on a well-known New Orleans burglar to break into Shaw's home and place something there. The burglar, John Cancler (\"John the Baptist\"), told a national NBC audience on June 19 that while incarcerated in the Parish prison, a DA investigator asked him to \"do a job for us.\" The investigator drove him to a home in the 1300 block of Dauphine Street. \"What am I supposed to take out of the house?\" he asked. \"Nothing,\" he was told. He was supposed to put something in the house. \"What was it all about?\" he asked. When he was told it had something to do with the assassination of President Kennedy, he became frightened and declined.Yet Stone portrayed Garrison as an honest and completely responsible public servant, a heroic All-American figure.Most despicable of all, Stone piles on lie after lie in an attempt to establish Oswald's innocence, portraying him as a right wing American patriot and hero who tried to stop the assassination (Oswald was a committed Marxist who despised this country) instead of what he really was-the murderer of John F Kennedy.What is especially galling is that Stone KNEW he was filling the movie with lies (so does ANYONE who looks into the facts), yet he ends the film with these words on the screen: \"Dedicated to the Young in Whose Spirit the Truth Marches On.\" In the January 1992 edition of Premiere magazine, he said that he used his movie \"as a forum for presenting all the evidence in the JFK case across the board.\" Another lie, Mr. Stone. You used the film as a forum to SUPPRESS evidence across the board. People called you out on it so much that you were forced to refer to your film as your own \"myth\" (YOUR word).I cannot accept that facts don't matter and that all facts are equally important. And when a filmmaker invents or ignores facts to support a thesis, he crosses the line.One more thing: Conspiracy zealots like Stone are immune to facts and logic, which means they can NEVER acknowledge that they are wrong no matter how much evidence is against them. I'm reminded of a joke (appropriate, since its such a silly movie): A group of conspiracy zealots die and confront God in the afterlife: \"Once and for all, who killed Kennedy!?\" God says, \"Oswald did, and he acted alone\". The zealots mumble to themselves \"My God, the conspiracy is bigger than we thought!\"",

The use of multiple types of film also emphasizes its difference, something Oliver Stone couldn't have done five years before with Platoon.Now comes the nuts and bolts of the film.  I will but blunt when I say this next part, but I am NOT watching this film for a history lesson!  If I want a history lesson, I'll contract one of Michael Moore's quack faux-documentaries (shame on you, Mr. Moore!) and take notes.  Otherwise, Oliver Stone creates an incredible film here that would have been stronger...if it were the truth.Kevin Costner has obviously fallen in the public light since this film and his acting is lower grade than in The Untouchables.  Nonetheless, he portrays Jim Garrison with an almost quiet insanity.  Somewhere behind those glasses is a fierce animal waiting for the strike.  The remainder of the cast is not given enough to do other than be names we memorize and then forget.

The Quaker woman called and set up an appointment for Oswald to be interviewed for the job.

We start wars to sell bombs.It was unfortunate that Stone's film came up against The Silence of the Lambs, which cleared the table at the Academy Awards.

I don't know how much of Oliver Stone's film is provable fact, how much of it is loony conjecture, or how much he just plain made up (he says none, but others have denied that). What I do know is that the film, even though it runs at 3 and a half hours, is engaging, exciting, gripping and suspenseful. I'm not a big fan of movies that follow investigations, but it's great here. And I especially hate courtroom dramas, but the final sequences of the movie represent an extremely tight tour-de-force. The film is at its best when it's exploring the mystery, and, confoundingly, at its very worst when it takes time to develop its characters. There are two scenes particularly when Jim Garrison's wife (played by Sissy Spacek at her very worst) accosts him for not spending enough time with his family. I'm thinking, \"HELLO! Most important investigation in American history going on here!\" I think his kids would forgive him in the future for being a bit inattentive at the time. The second of these scenes, where Costner explains to his kids that he won't be leaving their mommy, almost had me throwing stuff at the screen it was so sappy. Kevin Costner isn't very interesting, and, besides, from what I've read Stone really softened the character of Jim Garrison, so any character development on that front is dishonest. Most of the best acting comes from the massive supporting cast, where almost anybody is liable to show up. I was quite happy when John Larroquette showed up, and even happier when Donald Sutherland appeared. And Brian Doyle Murray as Jack Ruby? Awesome. My favorite performance by far was Kevin Bacon. I always feel bad for the guy, because he's spent such a long career acting in middling roles. He really is a fine actor, which he gets to prove every so often.

'JFK' is a hard-hitting film, that examines the events leading to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy and the alleged subsequent cover-up, through the eyes of former New Orleans district attorney Jim Garrison.'JFK' is a film that is very interesting to watch. And at the same, too tragic to sit-through. The aftermath of the assassination gets disturbing after a point. However, Jim Garrison's battle to win the right, is one cinematic experience!Oliver Stone diminishes his inhibitions here. He makes a film as a long as a day, and goes in detailed information. His direction is stunning and is beautifully lensed by Cinematographer Robert Richardson.John Williams's Music gets into the skin of the film. Tommy Lee Jones steals the show with a terrific performance. He plays the smiling bad guy with ease. Kevin Costner performs exceedingly well as Jim Garrison. Gary Oldman is first-rate. Kevin Bacon is top-notch. Others lend Remarkable support.On the whole, 'JFK' is a film that blows your mind, takes away time from your day and plays with it's viewer. Masterful, indeed!",

The cast, led by Kevin Costner and the Oscar-nominated Tommy Lee Jones is second-to-none, and Stone's direction is just as powerful as his previous work in \"Platoon\" and \"Born on the Fourth of July\".  The film deals with Stone's conspiracy theory that President Kennedy's assassination was part of a powerful cover-up that went through the highest places in our government. Is Stone's reasoning warranted?  I am not sure.  The JFK case has been a major mystery ever sense it occurred some 37 years ago.  Perhaps it was just a simple assassination by Lee Harvey Oswald, but the increasing speculation and paranoia makes even the most skeptical theorists stand up and take notice to this story.  \"JFK\", if nothing else, is one of those films that will make you think even if the thoughts are those of the film-maker.  5 stars out of 5.",

In the late 1970s as a foolish young adult, I grasped at the conspiracy theories. But over the decades, those conspiracies have almost entirely been disregarded. Watch Frontline's (PBS) two hour \"Who Was Lee Harvey Oswald,\" and you'll see a meticulously told recitation of the facts of the case and how Oswald's life leads directly to his assassination of Kennedy. There is no question that Oswald fired the shots that killed Kennedy. The only lingering questions are, did he have co-conspirators, and why did Jack Ruby kill Oswald? Ruby may have killed Oswald as a mafia coverup, or just because he was enraged by Oswald. We'll never know. Frontline paints Oswald as an obsessive loner which comes as no surprise. The fact that the Communists didn't want anything to do with Oswald, an avowed Marxist, makes it unlikely he was acting at either Moscow's or Havana's behest. Conspiracy theorists want nothing more than to believe a great, young president couldn't have been brought down by one, lone, deranged wingnut, but that is where the overwhelming preponderance of evidence points. When you consider the real evidence as a whole, that conclusion is self evident.",

The movie begins with the assasination of JFK at Dallas in November 22 1963 and then tends to be a story on Garrison's search for a truth. It is also among Stone's most controversial film and had been heavily criticised for being a mixture of truth and fiction and the guns were out before it hit the box office.\nIt could have wisely been a two and a half hour film instead of the three hours and twenty minutes as Oliver Stone attempts at everything to do with JFK and all those conspiracy theories added to the movie together with some use of strong language. We expect Hollywood to take liberties... writes John McAdams in his website JFK but there are loads of historic mistakes in movies and Stone's film is without exception and it deliberately misleads a generation of people whom weren't around and it insights on Stone's agenda to change the face of history.\nJonathan Margolis reacted that Jim Garrison was a bizarre DA from New Orleans whom said that the assassination of JFK was a result of a CIA cover-up he managed to put a hapless man on trial. Garrison having no case lost in court. On the other hand, the film may be well made but inaccurate in terms with history and it's far too long while Kevin Costner did not make much film success after this one.",

            "content": "This movie is way too long. I have several problems with Oliver Stone's JFK, but most of them can be boiled down to that simple sentence. I don't have qualms with films that run over 150 minutes, but they have to earn those extensive running times. This one does quite the opposite of that, meandering on needlessly at times and including whole sections that do nothing but fill space and drag the film down.The whole thing screams for a stronger editor, which is ironic because the individual scenes are edited so well, the flashbacks using precise and dramatic cuts to amp up the intensity. I wish that the dialogue hadn't been so drowned out by the musical score during the flashback sequences, but the precision with the editing in them is truly astonishing. The film as a whole was a mixed bag for me, with moments of brilliance clashing with ones that that were direly inconsequential. Stone's focus on the actual case is remarkable, intense high stake interviews under the powerful and long-lasting themes, but the rest of the film runs so flat.We follow District Attorney Jim Garrison (Kevin Costner) on his investigation into the murder of John F. Kennedy, but there's also way too much time spent on the pedestrian and dreadfully overbearing home life with his wife, played by Sissy Spacek, and children. Oliver Stone has never been good with creating human characters and the domestic side of this film is perfect proof of that, with gratingly awful and overly theatrical verbal arguments where Spacek hams it up in the worst fashion and Costner is hilariously dull in contrast. It's so awkward watching them work together because they have no chemistry as actors and the relationship is so poorly written.The other supporting characters, though, are the exact opposite; very well written and impeccably acted by the long list of quality actors in the cast. Ed Asner, Jack Lemmon, Michael Rooker, Kevin Bacon, Donald Sutherland and the Oscar-nominated Tommy Lee Jones are just a handful of the strong men who deliver phenomenal work here. Though everyone in the supporting ensemble manages to impress, there were two actors who really stood out to me; Gary Oldman and Joe Pesci.Oldman further cements his chameleon status, using no makeup or changes to his general appearance but being completely unrecognizable under the skin of Lee Harvey Oswald, a performance so intriguing and calculated that I was always desperate to see more of him. The film presents Oswald as an enigma and Oldman, who is seen only through flashbacks, captures the essence of the character perfectly. You can always see the mind running in the eyes of this man, but the audience is never sure what he's actually thinking. We never know where he stands and that's what makes the mystery that much more fascinating. Oldman delivers an Oswald who is as much of an enigma as the assassination itself.Pesci, on the other hand, is an actor that I have always loathed and was very surprised to find impressive here. I didn't think much of him at first, but there's one scene where he blew me away. His character, a weaselly rat who seems to be trying to play both sides, eventually becomes bogged down on all sides of the war for the truth and is paranoid that at every corner lies his own grim fate. We come to a scene at a motel, which is 5-10 minutes of Pesci just flooring the other characters (and the audience) with his desperation, paranoia and overwhelming fear. It's a devastating and utterly intriguing scene that was able to bring sympathy out of me for a character that I loathed prior to it.That's a great scene, but ultimately it's extraneous to the film at large, and there are a lot of scenes that fit into that category. It seems like Stone wanted to create a paranoia with all of the great staple scenes, but also wanted to create a film to make the case for the conspiracy theory and decided to just cram them together, and a lot of it comes out feeling like there are two separate films going on. There's a scene where Garrison's character goes to Washington D.C. to meet with the mysterious X, who goes on this tangent of informing Garrison of the dirty deeds of the government. Of course he's an informant so he never names names or gives Garrison anything that he can actually use. It's a brilliantly constructed Deep Throat scene, with high intensity and a great performance from Donald Sutherland as X, but it's about ten minutes along and ultimately adds absolutely nothing to the picture.Just in watching the film there was at least an hour of footage that I saw that could have easily been cut with no harm to the overall picture. There are some great scenes, but it seems like Stone couldn't decide whether he wanted to make a conspiracy thriller or a film to shove the JFK theory down the throats of the audience. It's unfortunate because there's a lot of potential here, but when we live in a time where there's a film like David Fincher's Zodiac that absolutely perfects what Stone is trying to do here, this one just pales in comparison. I don't think this is a film that is going to make a believer out of anyone who didn't already believe in some form of conspiracy in regards to the JFK assassination and ultimately that's all that it feels like it's trying to do, but there's still a fair amount of quality stuff within it. Just not nearly enough for the running time.",

He is the brains behind films like Platoon, Born On The Fourth Of July, Natural Born Killers, Nixon, Wall Street, and JFK. He seldom fails, and apart from making the dismal Alexander a few years back, Stone is still one of America's most daring and influential filmmakers.JFK is the best picture Stone has ever made. There's little reason to believe he will ever surpass what he has accomplished for JFK. The film runs for more than three hours, and with the overwhelming amount of content and the humongous scope of the plot, it's unbelievable that Stone managed to complete the production of the film within two years. He expertly explains and explores the conspiracies that surround the assassination of President Kennedy back in the 1960s through spellbinding color and black-and-white images, and the recreation of the chain of sequences that lead to the assassination and its convoluted aftermath.Was he murdered by the lone shooter Lee Harvey Oswald? Or were there others involved? Did the US military, FBI, CIA conspire to kill their own President? What about the 'magic bullet' theory? Where's the Zapruder film kept? Was there a massive cover-up by the highest authorities of the American government, including its judiciary system? These are all aptly discussed in the film, providing crucial insights, and occasionally leaving more questions unanswered, challenging viewers to think and respond.Effective individual performances from A-listers like Kevin Costner, Tommy Lee Jones, Joe Pesci, Gary Oldman, Kevin Bacon, and Donald Sutherland combine flawlessly, resulting in one of the most extensive and well-assembled cast in the history of cinema. JFK won only two Oscars for best cinematography and film editing in a year dominated by Jonathan Demme's Silence Of The Lambs, a meager return for one of the best films of the century. The Academy owes Oliver Stone another best picture and director award.After critiquing hundreds of films over the last couple of years, JFK still remains rooted in the second spot of my Personal Top 100, only bettered by Steven Spielberg's Schindler's List. It is, in my opinion, the best edited film of all-time. The manner in which Oliver Stone filmed JFK through the use of disturbing flashback images, rapid-fire editing, and intertwining it with suspenseful pulsating rhythms by composer John Williams, and knowing it's all based on a terribly true event makes it one of the most chilling movie experiences ever. For students of film, JFK is a valuable source. For the rest of us, JFK is one of the greatest films we will ever see.SCORE: 10/10 (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved!",

The question was asked of young and old alike, 'Where were you when you heard, They Just Shot President Kennedy?' There are many theories concerning the assassination of so beloved a popular president, but none that has truly satisfied the listening public. In this film called \" J. F. K \" director Oliver Stone attempts to explain the reason for Kennedy's death and the cover up which followed. With the use of great actors such as Kevin Costner, Jack Lemmon, Walter Mathau, Ed Asner, Joe Pesi, Tommy Lee Jones and a dozen others, Stone's monumental task is seen for what it is, A Classic Work of Art. It's true, the American public will never uncover the truth behind the actual killing, but this film does allow for a better understanding of who might have profited from the great man's death. Audiences across the nation are given the hidden agenda and the men responsible for their cowardly deed. This three hour movie explains in meticulous detail of how the assassination was carried out and how The Warren Report botched the investigation. There are many reasons why we will never know, but one thing remains true, those presidents who are not as popular or loved by the public as President Kennedy, need never fear the magic bullet.

I feel like i'm reading a book instead of watching a movie.One major problem is Stone's inconsistency with the truth. There was one shooter, not three. Stone changed it around just to make it more interesting. Also, some characters are falsely portrayed.

            "content": "The most famous conspiracy of all time gets the big-screen treatment and boy, what a treatment it is. Famed and controversial filmmaker Oliver Stone appeared to be in way over his head with \"JFK,\" pouring what probably amounts to decades of investigation and research into three-plus hours of screen time, enough to convince even the most stringent of government sympathizers that Lee Harvey Oswald could not have possibly assassinated President John F. Kennedy.Even if you're not a fan of historical conspiracy, if you appreciate film you'll be blown away by the technical precision of Stone's effort. The conspiracy itself does guide much of the film's run time (that's not to detract from its powerful ideological arguments between characters), so it can be weighty for those who don't enjoy the learning aspect. However, the masterful blend of contemporary scenes and archive footage give \"JFK\" an unparalleled documentary-like feel.The use of various cameras, lenses and film stock makes a lot of the film's footage appear to be archive footage, so naturally it's hard to distinguish fact from fiction, but the result is more fascinating than confusing. Whole sections of the film belong to two monologues: Jim Garrison's (Kevin Costner) closing argument to the jury at the film's end and the mysterious source \"X\" (Donald Sutherland) explaining to Garrison how the Department of Defense, FBI and CIA all could have collaborated to carry out the assassination. Without mixing in compelling visuals, these scenes would consist only of talking heads. Not only do these visuals work, but they also make sense. It's no wonder cinematography and editing were the two victories \"JFK\" scored at the Academy Awards.Although Stone's focus is the material itself, the characters are still compelling. The story centers around New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison, who three years after the assassination has an epiphany and opens the first investigation of the president's murder, finding it impossible to believe that Oswald (Gary Oldman) alone could have fired three shots from the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository and been successful.The film delves a bit into Garrison's family life, which shows how his \"obsession\" with the case has hurt his family and upset his wife. Sounds pretty typical, but the writing from Stone and Zachary Sklar creates such deep empathy that you understand exactly where each character comes from. The same happens in the other dramatic scenes between Garrison and the people he questions or Garrison and members of his investigative team that begin to question the whole thing. Costner is downright believable and you're with him and behind him every step of the way.The rest of the cast is flooring. There are a number of cameos and small parts filmed by huge names. There's everyone from the tandem of Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon (not together however) to Tommy Lee Jones, Joe Pesci, Kevin Bacon and Sissy Spacek to John Candy. When you watch a film that has so many excellent faces appear for brief minutes, you get the sense that the film is important. Any script that draws in that many names must be special and \"JFK\" is. The film occasionally loses itself in all the conspiracy exposition, but anyone who finds it interesting will discover the seemingly insurmountable run time much easier to handle than expected. The choice, however, makes \"JFK\" a non-traditional film. It's a unique breed of historical fiction, a textbook in story form. But to top it all off, it speaks profoundly about themes regarding people and their government, the fear-power dynamic and of course fighting for the fundamental right to truth.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com",

I have followed the investigations of Mr Howard Donahue, a very respectable and totally sincere man of outstanding abilities, and his credentials as an expert in ballistics and weapons etc are in my opinion, second to none, and after reading the book by Bonnar Menninger \"Mortal Error\", it is quite obvious that his conclusions are fact not fiction as in this film.There are very many things stated in the film that are factually incorrect, especially the point that garrison makes about the possibility of Oswald not able to get off the shots in time, which Mr Donahue proved is possible and actually beats that time! yet in the film it states that no one was able to do this! it seems that the film JFK is in itself a cover-up! and make Garrison out to be a hero when in effect he was only partially right and could not explain the bullets path with acurracy even though Mr Donahue showed how the \"magic bullet\" did in fact do the damage to JFK and Gov Conelly.",

Oliver Stone's JFK movie (assessed apart from it's scandal-rich premiere) is a lousy, scatterbrained, corny, half-baked movie. It's made ineptly and it's composed of the flimsiest string of three lonely conceits. 1) A very crappy star turn by Costner, again playing Mr. Morality 2) One or two sequences that clearly received more of Stone's attention (they actually build - Fletcher Prouty) and 3) An all star cast. The script may offer the wobbliest plot ever filmed; a single-minded crusader doesn't have a prayer of winning his laughably assembled conspiracy case; also... he has the defacto \"whiny wife\" (Spacek). Stone hopes to provide enough surface activity that you won't notice he has no guiding concept, that the all-star cast is actually undermining the movie and the damned thing is going nowhere. Despite earnestness and good intentions, it has no momentum, no ending and precious little intelligence. An overwrought score beats you over the head in an effort to inject some intensity.The climactic court case is just absurd (and belabored). It feels like Stone needed both a dramatic climax and a morality showdown, and manufactured this weak, weak case to those ends. The case is composed of barely-connected, legally ridiculous courtroom moments; Garrison badgers people whose connection to Clay Shaw is indecipherable until his final 20 words attempt a weak link. If the case actually went as depicted, it's no surprise Garrison lost, because he speechifies about everything except how Clay Shaw is related to the killing.In casting every role large, Stone bowdlerizes the assassination by advancing a solution that looks trifling compared to the scale of the machinations and his production. In the end JFK's assassination is pinned on some utterly nonthreatening gay bogeyman (an idea that has no place to go) for god knows what reason ...how very small.In need of passion, the movie pours on the straw-man antics; there's a zero-sum game fight every twenty minutes. Ridiculous lines like \"Let justice rain till the heavens fall\" and \"We're through the looking-glass now, people...\" intended to make major dramatic moments are just bad dramatics. Not helping any of this, are some very poor, over-the-top southern accents. Everyone from the south doesn't talk with a full-on, corn-pone accent, but tell a star his character is from the south and it's vocal amateur hour. Metcalf is quite bad. Costner sounds like Elmer Fudd, despite the fact that Jim Garrison himself has a cameo in the damned movie, and has NO regional accent whatsoever. (?!)The controversy that surrounded the movies opening reflects a legitimate failing of the movie. You would have to be a JFK assassination scholar to detect and determine what elements are factual, and what has been completely manufactured by Stone for the movie. It's all presented as fact. The best that can be said of the movie is, thank God Stone got access to the Zapruder film so that it could be disseminated at a massive, irretrievable scale; placing it in front of incorruptible audience-eyes that won't forget what they've seen. The horror of the 26 second Zapruder film is indelible.",

What's better is that the movie nicely sets a warning to the date when the secret should be shed clear. The acting overall is a nice one. Kevin Costner didn't overdo his parts, nicely controlling his character's emotions. Tommy Lee Jones, Kevin Bacon, Gary Oldman and Michael Rokker nicely gave lives to their characters.",

            "content": "It's late 2012 and with that there is a certain kind of luxury one has when reviewing a film that when released seemed largely sensational, perhaps even an extreme weaving of more fiction than fact.As the years passed from 1963 to this depiction of Clay Shaw's trial (in 1969) it still was an accepted fact that Lee Harvey Oswald was the lone assailant of President John F. Kennedy, thus the hard-to-swallow claim the accused was part of a larger conspiracy birthed in the blackest operations of the U.S. government by certain benefactors. However, by the late eighties their was a definite turn of the tide with a large number of Americans finding the \"lone assassin\" with the \"magic bullet\" theory patently ludicrous. Enter Oliver Stone, a man impassioned by another man's lone crusade for the truth regarding one of America's darkest hours (The Civil War being the darkest and this being next along with 911). This picture was a tremendous gamble which shows the director's own brand of courageous patriotism.The above said, this is a film first about Jim Garrison, the fearless D.A. of New Orleans Louisiana. Garrison was to possessed to the point of obsession which cost him dearly personally. He ended up almost wrecking his family life for years and even depleting his own personal savings in his single-minded pursuit for justice to be served in what he believed was the highest act of treason: the conspiracy to kill J.F.K.. Stone goes about giving us Jim Garrison in a very realistic, if sympathetic way. One can not fault this because now, over 40-years removed from Garrison's prosecution of Clay Shaw, the mountain of known evidence is more vindicating related to Garrison than ever. It will likely continue to be more so even as those directly involved are largely deceased.The story of Jim Garrison is fascinating. Garrison had the back-bone to do what no one else either would or could. Kevin Costner gives a superlative performance all-around in his depiction of an lowly local elected official attempting to take on the world's greatest concentration of power. It is only due to his extremely high-profile that he likely survived and the danger of his possible assassination builds throughout the film as M.L.K. and R.F.K. are also murdered. Stone has reverence for the quest and takes it seriously. Though the movie is long, and some would say slow, I find it fastidious in detail and never boring. In other words it is truly moving that a man \"without a dog in the hunt\" would hang himself so far over the line in his quest for the unthinkable. The viewer both roots for Garrison and cringes at how he is kept from securing valuable documents as well as many witnesses (like the obviously knowledgeable \"Mr. X\"). One must feel pain for Garrison as even the trial's supposedly neutral judge is openly hostile (what a waste of humanity whoever this low-life of an empowered official was in real life).This movie is exactly what President Eisenhower warned Americans of so take it that way and do a comprehensive research of your own. You will end up validating so much of what the movie presents that you will be much more open to the larger picture of what both Garrison and Stone extrapolated. No, it may not be 100 accurate, but if it isn't the errors are forgivable with obstruction at the highest level preventing a clearer picture. That is the power of this movie because it literally forces the viewer to think and pushes one toward more investigation (it actually did force the government to release a quantity of previously sequestered, yet still highly vetted, information as well as calling out the Warren Commission Report as fiction). It is a wake-up call because we still are largely victims of government by the few in this post 911 world.I applaud Oliver Stone for bringing Jim Garrison's story so effectively to the masses. I am glad that not only was it surprisingly successful upon release, but that it has continued to be seen by millions more each year some twenty plus years later. Two things should be mandatory for all U.S. citizens: read The Constitution and see this movie, 'nuff said!",

            "content": "Even after more than 15 years, Oliver Stone's \"JFK\" remains a stunning masterpiece of storytelling. Mixing reality and fiction, color and black & white snippets beyond the point of information overload, it's the precursor of ultra-rapid cut political thrillers like the \"Bourne Identity\". It is also a statement on the power of movies. Largely modeled after the book \"On the Trail of the Assassins\" by Jim Garrison, the New Orleans prosecutor who provides the heroic figure for \"JFK\" and has become famous as the only one who ever brought the Kennedy assassination to trial, it promotes the idea that the JFK case - maybe along with the assassinations of Robert Kennedy and even Martin Luther King - is really solved, if you watch/read the two in sequence. The book got a major interest boost from the film.According to various evaluations I found on the net, a majority of Americans actually take most of \"JFK's\" assertions as facts, while of course expecting small artistic liberties. I did so myself, having read Garrison's book. One cannot help but wonder, if these \"facts\" are true, why are they not investigated? There are entire websites devoted to \"debunking\" conspiracy \"myths\", but their common mistake is usually to make the reader angry or flatly refuse to acknowledge the validity of questions. On the other hand, would the alleged dark government forces really use such a bunch of losers for the hit of the century? Since Jim Garrison's book is the source of most of \"JFK's\" claims, its credibility rests on Garrison's shoulders. The movie's hero is accused of pressurizing and even drugging witnesses, persecuting people for their homosexuality, wasting taxpayer's money etc. All of these claims seem ridiculous and are either attributed to a hostile press, a tired wife, a public won over by the Warren Report or government pressure... Garrison really had to fight all the demons of hell at once to get the truth out! Except that it wasn't really that way. Google up \"The Assassination Goes Hollywood!\" for a step-by-step debunking of \"JFK\" that doesn't make you mad at first glance. Delve deeper and the picture of Jim Garrison - and his times - changes entirely.One of the movie's most subtle, but most basic distortions is the claim that everybody believed in the Oswald \"myth\" from the start, at the latest after the Warren Report. In reality, conspiracy \"myths\" sprang to life almost instantly, and a large majority of the public was not satisfied with the official explanations, just like today. Garrison wasn't the only one \"investigating\" and speculating, not even the most vocal. Public pressure eventually forced a commission to re-investigate the facts.Numerous books have been written on the Garrison trial: \"False Witness\" by Patricia Lambert and \"American Grotesque\" by James Kirkwood, among others. \"Garrison has made a comeback that would have made Richard Nixon proud\", writes a commentator. They all conclude that Garrison whitewashed his investigation and misrepresented important details of the trial (errors that were faithfully repeated - and artfully inflated - by Oliver Stone). Garrison tried for years and failed, not because of a small missing piece of evidence for a \"guilty\" verdict, but because in reality, the jurors thought he had no case - absolutely nothing to credibly back up even the smallest of his claims, which had grown ever more sensational over time. The press, who would have loved anything spectacular, had abandoned him before the trial was over. Serious reporters and conspiracy buffs alike didn't take him seriously anymore. It took \"JFK\" to resurrect him.There remains the issue of - the real - Clay Shaw, who looks guilty as hell on screen. The movie states before the end credits roll that CIA director Richard Helms later admitted that Shaw had worked for the CIA. That's not true. All Shaw was ever \"convicted\" of was being homosexual, which was confirmed by some of his acquaintances, and that he owned some sadomasochistic equipment. Count the number of homosexual suspects in the movie, and the claim that Garrison believed in a \"gay plot\" looks less incredible. Whatever Garrison may have thought, Shaw's forced \"coming out\" cost him dearly in social status. Shaw (and Ferry) are dead now. Is it true that in the United States, the laws of defamation apply only to the living? Memory is fleeting, film is forever.On the whole, all of \"JFK's\" central claims turn out to be pure myths, yet there is hope that some day one version of what really took place will be generally accepted, and it will be the right one. The merit of any controversial film is that it encourages discussion - and maybe research on the part of the viewer. There is nothing wrong with purely enjoying a good movie, as long as it's taken with a grain of salt.",

Because here we are given quite the opposite picture. Oswald is assisted by everyone: the Mafia, the CIA, the military, Cuba and even President Johnson.And if you're someone who plays Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon, you want to have this film under your belt: an ensemble cast of Kevin Costner, Gary Oldman, Tommy Lee Jones, Joe Pesci, Sissy Spacek, John Candy and many more.While I don't think the picture presented in this film is true, it was a great movie nonetheless. Costner brings in the performance of his career, providing a character with passion and courage and one of the best monologues I have ever heard. Pesci is a little wired, but it fits his character. Bacon is great as usual. Oldman could easily be mistaken for the real Lee Harvey Oswald. And Jones? One weird individual, though I think this is what the real Clay Shaw was like as I understand it.You will have to pay close attention or take notes to fully understand what is going on, since even though you get three hours the complexities fly at you all the time and you're left thinking either this is the biggest cover-up ever, or the main character (Jim Garrison) is completely stark raving mad.But I was kept in suspense all the way through, because I tried to keep an open mind and I didn't know how the real story ended up... so it was almost all new to me.

            "content": "Oliver Stone's interpretation of the Kennedy assassination can be found in his film JFK, a remarkable, energetic movie that may be, from a purely intellectual standpoint, total nonsense, but this in no way diminishes its stature as a film. Perhaps the best way to deal with Oliver Stone is to see him as a mad artist type. History of full of such men,--Edgar Allan Poe, Wagner, Van Gogh, Jackson Pollock, Ezra Pound--and there's no reason why the movies can't have their fair share of them as well. Once one accepts Stone as insane his vision becomes acceptable, brilliant, even comforting in a way. If we can accept Wagner seeing Jews conspiring to destroy art, why can't we accept Stone finding the CIA, with or without the help of the Mafia and the FBI, undermining the inegrity of the Republic at every turn? Wagner saw his Ring cycle as among others things a political statement. We see it as a work of art. Wagner thought of himself as a philosopher and a critic, while we see him as a composer. Stone views himself as a man with a mission. With the help of his idol, Jim Garrison, he wants to set the record straight on who was really responsible for the death of President Kennedy. Those who criticize the film JFK on the grounds that Stone has played fast and loose with the truth or that Garrison was a showman have I believe missed the beauty of this astonishing and intricately woven film, which is simply magnificent, epic in scope, committed to ideals (whether one agrees with the film on the particulars is another matter) and a shining example of the best that can be done in movies in our time. The problem with Oliver Stone is that while his sensibility is purely aesthetic, his intellect tends to drift in a political, New Leftist and paranoid direction. In this respect JFK is two movies, the poltical movie everyone argues about, and the aesthetic movie that everyone enjoys and then gets angry with himself for having liked so much, which then in turn leads to more controversy, which never seems to end. My praise is for the aesthetic JFK, the great and moving story of the death of a president and of the various controversies surrounding the circumstances of his death and those who may or may not be responsible for it. The issue of whether Oswald acted alone, had accomplices, or was merely a patsy, has yet to be resolved. JFK is something to be experienced, not debated. The acting is something to see. It's as if the various stars who appear in the film, often in nearly cameo roles, felt priveleged to be asked to be in this movie at all. As a result John Candy, Kevin Bacon, Jack Lemmon, Donald Sutherland and Walter Matthau are as good as they've ever been. In a larger role, Gary Oldman is so believable as Lee Oswald it's almost frightening. Joe Pesci is hilarious, pathetic and surprisingly convincing as David Ferrie. Tommy Lee Jones is a campy Clay Shaw, and while he is decent in the role I wish he had toned down his somewhat supercilious irony. Kevin Costner at first seems a little too simple to be Jim Garrison, but he emphasizes the heroic rather than analytical side of the man, and this is after all a movie. There's a Gary Cooper little boy lost quality to Costner that works well here, and his obvious fondness for the role and his ease in playing it is in the end a winning quality. Music is well-utilized throughout the film, as is Stone's fondness for offbeat camera angles and an editing style that seems designed to maximize the viewer's sense of dread. Essentially JFK is film noir, done in a contemporary style, on the grandest scale imaginable. It's enough to make Fritz Lang applaud from the grave.",

            "content": "Conspiracy theories get a workout in Oliver Stone's JFK--he has hit upon every conceivable theory, every point and counterpoint to be made and has produced an absorbing, involving, and ultimately entertaining film that makes you think about which theory you believe is the likeliest. And he has a cast that brings every important character to life, even though the physical resemblances are not always there. KEVIN COSTNER, for example, is excellent as the doggedly determined D.A. Jim Garrison (but looks nothing like the real Jim Garrison) who will leave no stone unturned in his effort to find the truth behind the killing of JFK--even if it means ignoring his wife and family while he pursues justice. Costner uses his Honest Abe image to give the sort of heartfelt, man-of-integrity intensity that James Stewart and Henry Fonda might have given in their day. He is made to seem like a towering figure of integrity in the script Stone has written from Jim Garrison's point of view--almost like Atticus Finch resurrected, especially in his closing courtroom speech. Was the real Jim Garrison really this noble?As a note of irony, Stone has the real Jim Garrison playing Earl Warren and defending the Warren Commission Report with a straight face.Other roles are played with equal validity by Tommy Lee Jones (as Clay Shaw), Kevin Bacon, Sissy Spacek, Ed Asner (infuriating as Guy Bannister), and Joe Pesci as David Ferrie. Pesci is a bit over the top as David Ferrie (and gets on the nerves) but that's the way the role was written and directed.But the most remarkable moments in the film are provided by the exchange of information between Kevin Costner and Donald Sutherland as the extent of the conspiracy is revealed to come from higher places in the government. Sutherland gives an imposing performance, quietly restrained but chilling as he delivers his insider information.Special mention must go to Gary Oldman as Lee Harvey Oswald. His face, voice and gestures are strikingly similar and blend well with actual footage of Oswald intermittently seen.Altogether a very competent piece of filmmaking which fulfills its purpose by making the viewer think about what might actually have happened on that awful day in Dallas when the age of innocence officially ended in American politics. Whether it's the Mafia, Castro's Cubans, the FBI, the CIA or LBJ and the Pentagon (with the help of the Warren Commission), it's all there for you to sort out and ponder--perhaps until 2029 when some new suppressed evidence will eventually be released.",

The film opens with narration by Martin Sheen about the life of President John Fitzgerald Kennedy, leading from 1961 till November 22nd 1963 when he was shockingly shot and killed. The story, made up from both fact and opinion, sees District Attorney Jim Garrison (Golden Globe nominated Kevin Costner) return after three years since the incident to find who was responsible in as many fields of the murder as possible. He interviews all people who were connected to the key suspect, also murdered, Lee Harvey Oswald (Gary Oldman), including David Ferrie (Joe Pesci), Jack Martin (Jack Lemmon), Senator Long (Walter Matthau), Dean Andrews (John Candy), Willie O'Keefe (Kevin Bacon) and X (Donald Sutherland). All these witnesses lead Garrison to charging Clay Shaw (Oscar and BAFTA nominated Tommy Lee Jones) with strong connection to the assassination, and he is preparing to have a hopeful conclusion made in a trial. This investigation is putting strain on Garrison's relationship with wife Liz (Sissy Spacek) and their kids, but he is determined to have justice brought to America with his passion for the terrible event. In the end, Shaw was found not guilty, and according to the end text, Garrison continued to try and find the truth, and apparently true facts of Kennedy's assassination will be revealed by the year 2027. Also starring Jay O. Sanders as Lou Ivon, Michael Rooker as Bill Broussard, Laurie Metcalf as Susie Cox, Gary Grubbs as Al Oser, Edward Asner as Guy Bannister, Brian Doyle-Murray as Jack Ruby, Sally Kirkland as Rose Cheramie, Beata Pozniak as Marina Oswald, Vincent D'Onofrio as Bill Newman, the real Jim Garrison as Earl Warren, Wayne Knight as Numa Bertel, Tony Plana as Carlos Bringuier, Dale Dye as General Y and Bob Gunton as TV Newsman #3. It is unknown of course whether Oswald acted alone or as part of a team, but this film does make a very plausible account of events. With a fantastic cast list, terrific use of archive footage, not just of Kennedy, but also some Fidel Castro, Martin Luther King and Malcolm X, this is a magnificent political thriller that I would definitely recommend. It won the Oscars for Best Cinematography and Best Film Editing, and it was nominated for Best Music for John Williams, Best Sound, Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium for Stone and Zachary Sklar and Best Picture, it won the BAFTAs for Best Editing and Best Sound, and it was nominated for Best Adapted Screenplay, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama and Best Screenplay.

            "content": "I rated \"JFK\" a \"3\" because it is technically an engrossing, suspenseful, well put-together piece of film-making. Terrific recreations (especially Dealey Plaza), excellent acting, great music score. Builds incredible tension, which is an especially difficult undertaking in a movie about a well-known and highly publicized historical event (and one that everyone knows the outcome of). I have to give Oliver Stone credit as a movie-maker. And I guarantee you won't fall asleep watching \"JFK\". That's the good news.The bad news is -- \"JFK\" is completely biased and fictional as a piece of history. Period. It presents the JFK killing as certain conspiracy buffs (whom Oliver Stone used as technical advisors) would LIKE us to believe happened, in order to sell more of their books. As a movie that purports to be a \"documentary\" on the subject, \"JFK\" is abysmal and wouldn't even rate a \"1\".Essentially what Oliver Stone does is take EVERY conspiracy theory ever put forward since the assassination itself, and thrown it into his plot. The average movie-goer, unacquainted with all the \"in's and out's\" of the JFK assassination, won't know this and will tend to take everything Stone says as gospel. I myself didn't know much about the Kennedy killing when I first saw this movie in the theaters. Stone seemingly presents a mountain of \"evidence\" to prove his thesis, and to the uninitiated it's all rather compelling. However, after taking the time to read several books on the subject, I realized just how much a piece of fiction Stone's screenplay really is. I was amazed that some of the \"conspiracy\" proof that Stone uses has been so long and so effectively refuted that even the most dedicated buffs don't hold with them anymore! Stone throws much junk \"evidence\" into the mix that, in some cases, hasn't been taken seriously by ANYONE in almost 30 years.Even more disturbing is Stone's need to create, out of whole-cloth, certain sub-plots, scenes, and characters that never existed! Kevin Bacon's \"Willie O'Keefe\" immediately comes to mind -- there was no such person, nor anyone even remotely resembling him in real-life. Donald Sutherland's \"Colonel X\" is only vaguely based on a nut-case ex-officer named Prouty who liked to make himself big by claiming \"special knowledge\" of the assassination. And yet most of what comes out of \"Colonel X's\" mouth can't even be attributed to Prouty -- just the fertile mind of Oliver Stone! Stone created numerous scenes to suit his plot -- including virtually every scene with Joe Pesci's character, and many with Tommy Lee Jones' \"Clay Shaw\" character. No basis for any of it -- just made for a more compelling storyline. Same with many of Lee Harvey Oswald's scenes (chillingly performed by Gary Oldman, by the way). All this, while adding to the entertainment factor of \"JFK\", does nothing to bolster it's authenticity. Stone of course defended such make-believe with the time-honored claim of \"artistic license\". Yes, Hollywood has taken many liberties over the years with real events and people -- but Oliver Stone takes this to an ENTIRELY new level.While Kevin Costner may be a compelling actor, Stone's idea of making his character, real-life New Orleans D.A. Jim Garrison, a \"folk hero\" is absurd to the point of being laughable. Jim Garrison was a corrupt, despicable character who routinely abused the power of his office to promote himself in a way that makes D.A. Mike Nyfong of the Duke \"rape\" case look like a saint by comparison! Again, Stone counts on the public not knowing the incredibly shady aspects of Garrison's \"investigation\" (if you can even call it that), and his witch-hunt against a man he knew, long before the trial even began, to be innocent.The other \"hero\" of Oliver Stone's piece is, not surprisingly, Lee Harvey Oswald himself. Stone not only clears Oswald of ever being a \"real\" Communist, but also absolves Oswald of any responsibility in the killing, and THEN starts presenting the idea that he actually tried to warn the FBI of the plot, but was ignored because the FBI (among many, many organizations) was in on it. In fact, it's hard to find anyone OTHER than Oswald who Stone believes WASN'T in on the plot or the subsequent cover-up. VP Lyndon Johnson, the CIA, the FBI, the Secret Service, military intelligence, the Mafia, the Anti-Castro Cubans, the Dallas Police Dept, Jack Ruby, the Warren Commission...in Oliver Stone's twisted fantasy-world, they're ALL in on it!And Stone's \"ultimate truth\" -- that Kennedy was assassinated cause he wanted to pull out of Vietnam -- simply isn't backed-up by any facts. It was JFK who increased our military commitment in Vietnam by three-fold, to over 18,000 troops, by 1963. Stone would have us believe that JFK suddenly had a \"change of heart\" and wanted, but never got around to, pulling out of Vietnam. That JFK, already sensitive to the charge of being \"soft on Communism\", would do this with re-election looming in 1964 is EXTREMELY improbable. Stone's citation of a particular \"National Security Action Memo\" JFK signed as the first step in the pull-out is, like so much else in \"JFK\", a complete fabrication.It would take far too many pages to refute every factual error Stone makes in his movie; suffice to say that the over-all effect is stupifying. If one wants to really get the \"low down\" on the Kennedy killing, I would suggest Gerald Posner's monumental work \"Case Closed\". Posner, who for years was a leading conspiracy theorist himself, finally \"saw the light\" and is now dedicated to debunking such fantasies. He succeeds in \"blowing out of the water\" EVERY piece of \"evidence\" Stone presents, and gives a compelling picture of the REAL Jim Garrison, who's about as far from Kevin Costner's heroic portrayal as you can get. \"JFK\" is slick entertainment, but forget it as a factual account of a historic event.",

I don't know for sure how much of it is based on facts, but from what I understand, it's most of it, if not all of it. The film is packed with great actors, however many of them have very minor roles in the film. Regardless, every single performance is great, there wasn't any point where I thought that any of the actors did anything less than a great job portraying their respective characters. The film is well-edited, telling a lot of the story through flashbacks, and even giving us a visual of things that \"supposedly\" happened, but quite apparently never took place. All in all, this is a great film, but it could, and should, have been a perfect one. The problem with the film lies wholly in the pacing; in the first thirty minutes, it pretty much tells you the part of the story that everybody knows; the assassination itself, Lee Harvey Oswald's arrest and the killing of Oswald. After that, the plot starts to revolve around an investigation that simply takes far too long, and it only takes so long because it's filled with, well, filler. Had it been more to the point, instead of showing scene after scene of questioning, most of them nearly the same, it would have been much easier to follow the film's plot; I'm not saying that it's simple, in fact, it's anything but simple, but it was made out to be far more complicated than it had to be. I think there was about half an hour, maybe 45 minutes of the film where I didn't pay attention, simply because virtually nothing at all happened in the film. I don't have anything against three-hour films, I've seen several that I enjoyed regardless of length(Dances with wolves, Scarface(the Al Pacino version) etc.), but those did a good job of keeping me interested in the story, and the story constantly develops in them(especially Scarface), whereas in this one, it almost stands still, while we listen to one lying witness after the other, every single lie in details, instead of just a few lines to demonstrate that this character is lying. I just think there was far too much material, however true it may be, that belongs in a director's cut or a documentary than a regular feature film. It could easily have been cut down at least half an hour. For a political film, this is very good. In fact, for a film by any standard, it is very good. It's just too bad it isn't as great as it could have been, had it been paced better. Unless you have an enormous amount of interest in the subject matter, and an equal amount of patience, you probably won't be able to sit through this. I recommend it to pretty much anyone who's interested in knowing more about the Kennedy assassination, and who has the patience that is required. 8/10",

The movie makes the point that the truth will not be known until the Warren Commission's papers come out, yet the movie repeatedly refers to altered documents and testimony within those reports (how does anybody know that, anyway?).  What truth will come out of doctored history?And here we come to the main thing that's wrong with JFK--its undying belief in its own \"truthfulness,\" despite the fact that it is a movie--a total fabrication, no matter how accurate its sources are.  Maybe I'm a bit more sensitive than I should be about the subject of truth and memory, having taken classes in Creative Non-fiction and Memoirs and discussed quite often in various classes the accuracy of memory and point of view (check out Robin Hemley's memoir, \"Nola,\" or David Eggers' \"A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius\"), but I think Stone and Garrison weren't shining enough skepticism on eyewitness testimony and the memories, which would have given the movie true didactic balance.  After all, if Stone wants us to examine our \"rulers\" more closely, then shouldn't we examine everything more closely?On a personal note, the dedication at the end irks me.  For one thing, Oliver Stone is older than my father.  But more importantly, he links youth to change as if every young person has exactly the same opinion and are by their very nature slowly progressing to some better state of who knows what. I'm sorry, but I know a lot of young people who fear change just as much as the old crones Stone seems so deadset against, and I know a lot of swinging people older than Stone that are even more about changing the world than the young people around me.  Those kinds of broad statements marr what could have been the greater truthfulness of JFK--not what really happened to the president, but what it was really like to live during those events.I don't know what happened to Kennedy, and nobody will ever be satisfied with the truth if it ever comes out (despite what Stone says, the media feeds off conspiracy theories and unexplained events--there are still reports of Elvis sightings and UFOs).  What I do know I think I know is that John F. Kennedy was not the saint the Hippies and (oh god!) the MEDIA make him out to be.  The constant Julius Caesar/Brutus/Judas references were tiresome to me, and I thought I'd laugh my ass off when Kevin Costner told us to \"remember our fallen king.\"  Seems to me Oliver Stone bought into the media perception of JFK.",

Kennedy may very well have been one of this country's greatest presidents, but as Donald Sutherland's character states, \"all of that vanished on that day back in 1963.\"Oliver Stone is undoubtedly one of the bravest filmakers of the last 25 years and seemed to have reached the height of his controversy with 1991's \"JFK\".  As you know, the story basically follows New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison's (Kevin Costner in an Oscar-worthy performance) investigation into the Kennedy assassination.  He risked his life and his career in pursuit of one thing: the truth.  With that said, why is the government so keen to keep the public from viewing records that could possibly offer some insight to the assassination?  I have never read any of the books that inspired \"JFK\" (though I plan to soon), but the Abraham Zapruder film should be enough to prove to any free-thinking person that Lee Harvey Oswald COULD NOT have done the shooting.  The physics of the \"Magic Bullet Theory\" should also put a lot of doubt into the Warren Commission's claim of a lone assassin. \nOliver Stone is one of today's truly great filmakers and I respect his views (mostly) but this one hits the nail on the head.",

More or less. Very funny. Ya gotta like that really AWFUL Tonight Show set from '68 and the Ed McMahon stand in too. Fun stuff. Other deleted scenes he puts in, a 50-50 mix of good, bad:The whole 'Mob guys surrounding Costner in the John w/ the police's silent help' scene, w/ a panicked Bill Broussard in tow-doesn't quite fit. How much did Broussard know about this? You really don't quite see why if someone wanted to shoot at Garrison(a big 6-4 type guy) why they didn't just up and do so. This was odd. I didn't quite buy Broussard coming back and being remorseful about leaving the investigation either. Rooker is quite a good actor-here, it was his worst scene.They show Sissy Spacek still living with Costner right before RFK is shot, in the orig. you don't see this at all-instead you see him coming home and making a sandwich in the kitchen, implying that she has moved out already. Interesting.I liked the added dialogue in the 6th floor, discussing the parade route change, Cabell, Bissell, Dulles, etc. But Stone was right to yank it, as it's just one more layer of names, faces, events, connections piled ontop of an already tangled miasma of names already.There was also the short Lou Grant/Jack Lemmon discussing the leaflets scene. That was funny but not terribly relevant.I liked seeing the appearence of Tommy Lee and Oswald at the voter registration  rally. It does add to the litany of mutual appearences the two men made.And did you like seeing Frank Whaley as the fake Oswald, running around w/ the car and talking about shooting JFK at the rife range?  Interesting to see young Moonlight Graham from 'Field of Dreams' turning up in another Costner film, albeit in a much different role.Kudos for adding 'George Moehrenschmildt' too.

So he blithely bought the rights to another hokum conspiracy tome, and then disregarded everything it said. This film is based on commonly held mistaken beliefs and ridiculously inane conspiratorial delusions. My favorite instance of this nonsense is Walter Matthau's knowingly smug remark that Oswald couldn't hit the side of barn while firing a rifle in the Marine Corps. The records clearly show he was a very good shot (not that he had to be in order to hit a target at less than 100 yards with a scope!!!!) and I can personally verify that no Marine recruit ever gets out of basic training without showing a fair degree of marksmanship. The other outstanding fraud is when Costner claims that the Zapruder film shows Kennedy's head moving back at impact of the third bullet, when in fact it clearly displays a sudden, short, forward movement at impact, followed by a large backward jerk because of the sudden straightening of the JFK's body due to massive muscle contraction (which of necessity jerked his head up and back). The movie totally ignores the physical evidence and dispenses pure fraud. Everyone who deals in such matters knows that a bullet has no ability to force the human body to make drastic reactionary movements. A bullet drills a nice neat hole thru the human body but it only weighs around an ounce and cannot displace a 20 pound human head. Newton knew that 350 years ago - Stone is clueless about laws of motion and inertia. The JFK assassination is about as completely understood as any important crime can be. There simply are no mysteries about the case.Reality is not Hollywood's strong point. Nor is accurate history, even in the best of cases. Oliver Stone has produced a piece of unmitigated historical and logical nonsense that serious students of the JFK assassination can only laugh at, make fun of, and wonder why our country has so many gullible and illogical moviegoers. Fortunately for Oliver Stone, all those slandered folks who would normally sue him for every cent he's got, are dead and buried. He knew he couldn't prove anything his movie said. Costner should be ashamed for being part of this travesty. And Matthau as well. My opinion of their ethics put them on my \"Never watch\" list of actors.",

He can call it a fictional movie if he likes, however he uses historical characters and an historic event and attempts to portray them as truth. Nowhere does he say, \"I made most of this movie up.\" He states that he takes some artistic license with the facts, however that is simply not allowed in this type of movie.This movie is based loosely on a book by Jim Garrison. That could be another reason to play with the facts, however Stone is required as a historian to verify facts. He doesn't.Stone obviously did a lot of research making this film. How, then, does he get the time to shoot wrong? The span of time between shots can easily be ascertained by the Zapruder film, yet Stone gets this wrong. Why? It doesn't fit with his theory. Stone then conveniently ignores the seating arrangements in the president's limo. Connolly was sitting inboard and lower than Kennedy, and therefore the bullet didn't go \"back and to the left.\" It went in a straight line until hitting Connolly's rib, which deflected it.There are far too many flaws to point out here. Why was Oswald handing out fliers in the area? He worked a block away. Who is Willie O'Keefe? Nobody. Yet he is presented as a historical figure. Oswald was picked up at the Texas Theater for killing police officer J.D. Tippit; not for killing Kennedy. Stone reports that this is not true, yet it has been proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that Oswald killed him.I could go on and on. This movie doesn't just play with the facts. It makes them up.",

An all-star cast, wonderful direction, top notch screenplay and suspenceful score. Of course, as 'history' we all know JFK is quite seriously flawed, but does that really matter? it's only a movie after all. Personally, I loved it. I've read the long and eloquent reviews of others and there's no point just repeating what other folks have already said, so here's my 'take' on the murder of President Kennedy. MY theory is that Lee Harvey Oswald was suffering from undiagnosed Aspergers Syndrome; a minor form of Autism. Look it up on the internet (if you're interested). It's the only thing - for me - that explains his character. Oswald was a highly intelligent man, but without focus. His (self taught) Russian was not only fluent but perfect. He joined the US Marine Corps, but was attracted to Communism and he was active in both the pro and anti castro movements. I think Oswald was involved in the murder (somehow) but my conclusion is he wasn't the only shooter and probably not a shooter at all. I think there WAS a conspiracy and shadowy people far more streetwise than Oswald easily picked him out as a tailor-made fall guy. Just a few hours before his death JFK said: \"We're heading into nut country today\". Dallas was a 'hostile' city, so how come his security was so lax? And despite the movie's many inaccuracies it did get one vital thing right. \"Back and to the left. Back and to the left\". The final shot which killed the President could never have been fired from behind the car. The anti conspiracy theorists always put forward the notion that (if it was a conspiracy) someone would've eventually confessed. I'd say, confessed to what? This movie presents the conspiracy as maddeningly 'vague' and I think that's bang on the nail. Each person involved would've only known as much as they needed to. No one person could ever prove anything. I was born 2 months after event, but my parents both told me they wept when they heard President Kennedy had been killed, just like many millions of people. despite his well documented sexual flaws I think JFK was a great man who could've given so much to the world. This movie is wonderful entertainment, but it also makes a viewer think too. All in all, excellent.",

Some of the scenes are ridiculous, or just plain stupid. There are shots of Costner (as Jim Garrison) sitting at the dinner table, spoon feeding the family dog. Bedroom shots of Costner and Sissy Spacek passionately kissing in bed, then discussing Oswald's marine career.  There is a unnecessary scene with Joe Pecsi, Kevin Bacon and Tommy Lee Jones. They are having gay romp, which absolutely detracts from the movie. There were so many other ideas they could have incorporated. I thought the scenes which dealt with the events in Dealey Plaza were compelling. It showed different views, angles and eyewitness accounts. I felt Oliver Stone was fair in his attempt to give different viewpoints and opinions. It was when the film diverted to events outside of Dealy Plaza that Oliver Stone failed. Since I now own this movie on video, I have the benefit of fast forwarding PAST THE FLUFF to the good stuff. The autposy scenes have a authentic look to them and are compelling to watch. Some of the scenes are shot very fast, and you have to be a historian to know which were the actual photographs from that day, and which were re-shot for the movie. In the final analysis, I believe Oswald acted alone. And I believe this movie could have been alot better if they had not tried to introduce unrelated items into it. Introduce new evidence, yes.

What he also ignores is the fact that Kennedy only pulled a small number of troops out in 1963, in order to scare the scare Ngo Dinh Diem out of his own repression, and not because he wanted to turn the region over to the reds. Like most presidents during the cold war, he knew that North Vietnam wasn't only a threat to the south, but to Laos & Cambodia as well.

After all, the film weighs in at about 3hrs and concerns a man I had never had much interest in. The impressive cast list almost swayed me numerous times, but I still deferred...Then we were required to watch the opening segment as part of filmic analysis in a Media Studies class. Often, this provided an excuse to turn the brain off for a few minutes and look at the pretty pictures. I was unable to do that with \"JFK\". It got me uncomfortably but fascinatingly close to the action, something that Oliver Stone seems to have a knack for doing, judging by his previous movies that I've seen. I then borrowed the movie off my uncle, and now own a copy. The film makes the things you may have seen or heard previously about the assassination a thousand times more interesting. If you're in the fortunate position of ALREADY finding this stuff interesting, so much the better.When I read the reviews posted on this site for various films, I do not immediately take them for the gospel truth. I like to judge things for myself. At the same time, I'm interested in other people's opinions, whether they align with or contradict my own. Surely the intelligent will realise that this is merely Oliver Stone's OPINION about what happened on that fateful day. He may be right, he may not, but the fact that some of it may be pure conjecture doesn't make it any less entertaining a film to watch.Standouts in the cast are Lee Jones and Oldman. Lee Jones in particular delivers a performance that is at once delightfully camp, yet also eerily sinister. Oldman is as good as ever. The man cannot deliver a bad performance, even in horrid films (Romeo is Bleeding)The music score is terrific at helping to convey the sense of being on the verge of a momentous breakthrough. It's also gratifying to see that Stone devotes a fair amount of time to documenting how the case affects Garrison's relationship with his family, rather than simply sticking to the bare bones of the investigation. True, it would have been a shorter film, but also much less interesting.Stone is at his best when he has definite targets to aim for through his work. Where \"Platoon\" failed for me was that it conveyed the message that war is hell, but did so in a vague, lazy way. \"Salvador\", by contrast, took you right into the heart of the conflict and never let you forget the futility of it all. \"JFK\", I'm pleased to say, is closer in spirit to the latter because it stirs the emotions through the passion of the director. It made me care about an event I previously regarded as unimportant, because now I see the value of fighting for the truth to be revealed, whether it be Stone's version or otherwise.",

            "content": "November 22, 1963 was one of the darkest days in American history. It was the day President John F. Kennedy was shot dead riding in his limousine through the city of Dallas, Texas. With today being the 50th anniversary of the assassination, I have decided to review Oliver Stone's controversial film about not only that day in Dallas, but all of the controversy and conspiracy theories that have surrounded it from moment one. JFK is actually a movie about New Orleans D.A. Jim Garrison (played by Kevin Costner) who takes it upon himself to bring to trial the people he believes conspired to murder the president. He and his staff do not believe that Lee Harvey Oswald (played eerily similar to his historical counterpart by Gary Oldman) simply acted alone, and as it turns out everyone he talks to has a theory about what the really happened, but every time they try to formally question them the \"witnesses to conspiracy\" end up changing their view or end up dead. Garrison does bring a man he believes was directly involved, Clay Shaw (played by Tommy Lee Jones) to trial and tries to prove that it was all a big lie and a conspiracy exists. The acting is full of very recognizable stars in good roles, even though some are only there ever so briefly that it works against itself, or some historically inaccurate. Costner gives a heroic portrayal of Jim Garrison, whom I think represents Stone's view of the assassination, even though most people know that his real investigation was questionable in his grounds of prosecution, and that he was extremely obsessive about a conspiracy theory. The supporting cast is great and they are great actors, but some completely disappear even though they are all supposed to be involved. The screenplay, written by Oliver Stone and co-writer Zachary Sklar, is something of which I consider to be a brilliant mystery (something that works unbelievably well even though it really shouldn't) My major problem with the story is that both writers try to cram in way too many conspiracy theories. I myself do not believe most of these theories presented, especially when there is incontrovertible evidence against the theories Stone crams in. For example, modern computer animation by animator Dale Myers, ballistics experts, and even the evidence found in the Book Depository have proved the \"multiple bullet theory\" to be false. However, with these falsehoods in mind, the film does raise some eyebrows about some inconsistencies with the investigation. I hate to say, but some (a very small amount) of these theories could hold water, but we would have to fully research these ideas and think formulate our own opinions. Like I said at the beginning of the review, this movie has been called one of (some call it the most) controversial films of all time. Many critics and people who were there believe that this movie is very manipulative and completely full of falsehoods and not one shred of truth. I think that people have blindly seen this movie without educating themselves about either the theories or what happened during the actual assassination. Instead of blindly believing everything the movie throws at us, we really have to look into it and study it for ourselves.But the way the film is executed and filmed is what makes this a classic, and one of the reasons why it appears on my all time favorite films list. The cinematography is so amazing and beautiful that sometimes you question whether or not it's real (another reason why it seems manipulative) Director of Photography Robert Richardson uses the same kind of film stock and cameras that existed in 1963 and before to frame the story in the best way possible. And then there's the editing, which best sums up the feelings of the assassination, which is truly chaotic. The editing is so great in that it forces us to look at all the details and try to keep up with what's going on. Joe Hutshing and Pietro Scalia did a fantastic job with it and kind of set a standard for kinetic editing that hasn't really been matched in recent years. It also makes sense that both these areas won Academy Awards.Oliver Stone considers this film to be greatest personal achievement. I, in all honesty, would have to agree with his sentiment. Many think that Stone has tried to manipulate people to match his now ultra-radical views, but he does what a director should be allowed to do. I think what Stone is trying to do is present his anger and confusion about someone who represented the hopes and dreams (his dreams as well) of America being madly gunned down like that, in a way that is more personal and daring than directors and producers were willing to go at that time. Every director should have a view of things and an opinion to present, not to follow the norm or keep quiet.This film is amazing to watch and is one of those rarities for me in Hollywood, a film to challenge us, make us think, and research about what is presented to us. Some have and will continue to blindly accept what they see in this film and others as fact, which can be dangerous, but still, we have people who are smart enough to know what is true and what is \"Hollywood.\" For many people, the movie JFK truly represents the lack of closure and anger we still feel for what happened 50 years ago today.",

            "content": "November 22nd, 1963, Dallas, a day that will live in history, a day in which Camelot ended. John F. Kennedy was assassinated by supposed lone gunmen and nut Lee Harvey Oswald. As the country mourns its fallen president, and as the the power structure of the country begins to rapidly change, one man, District Attorney Jim Garrison begins to unravel a mystery and conspiracy that points to the highest echelons of power within the United States government.A gripping story shrouded in fact and fiction, takes its viewer on a journey into 1960's America, where not all the questions are or can be answered but one feels while watching this that their is indeed more to the official story that was fed to the people of the world. A fantastic crime thriller, with memorable performances by its ensemble cast. Stone manages to recreate the feeling of uncertainty and fear as the world believes in its leaders and where one man questions not only the official response but the very fabric of the power structure of this country. While watching this film one may feel the pressure and tension increasing as was intended by Stone and company. Masterfully scored by legendary composer John Williams adds to the dramatic feeling of lost honor and shadowy intentions that perhaps our countries leaders at the time conveyed. Though historically skewed in certain areas it still reaches and makes its point, that whatever happened in that fateful day and time afterward wasn't as it seemed. Critically acclaimed for a reason, this is one of Stone's finest works and is not a only a must watch for any film goer but any history buff as well.",

            "review_title": "As fact, this movie is a disaster, as fiction, it's mediocre.",
            "content": "When this movie first came out, I was very skeptical--Oliver Stone has a penchant for making absurd movies with extreme messages and hit or miss stylization. \"Born on the Fourth\" of July\" was utter garbage and \"Salvador\" was ugly when it wasn't being patently ridiculous. I ended up not seeing JFK because of the reviews. I'd gotten enough info on it to realize that it was going to be something from Oliver Stone's vivid fantasy life and I wanted no part of that. Since that time Olive Stone has become something of a laughing stock and subject of ridicule when it comes to his silly conspiracy theories. So, when JFK came on cable the other day, I decided to see what it was all about. If you take the basic premise as fiction, which it clearly is, the core of the movie becomes pretty interesting: A secret cabal of anti-communists in the Federal government wants to involve the U.S. in Vietnam and feel JFK is weak, since he was so lacking in resolve during the Bay of Pigs. In fact it's somewhat similar to \"Seven Days in May\" in that respect. Taken as a basic fictional political thriller, the movie is still pretty mediocre--Jim Garrison's character is not sympathetic at all--he's self righteous and condescending, and why he's doing any of this as a New Orleans District Attorney is somewhat mystifying. The real flaw is that it's bloated and ponderous, it's complexity is mostly a plus, but it gets boring after a while. But even fictional movies must hang together. The movie never really deals with the fact that it was JFK who put the first combat troops into Vietnam and was busy escalating the conflict when he was assassinated--not trying to extract us as the movie represents. In addition, the whole \"back and to the left\" concept is iffy--bullets usually go in to a person causing a small hole and exit causing a big hole. The Garrison character posited the last bullet came from the front, whereas the Zapruder film shown in the movie showed a bullet exiting Kennedy's head in the front. Still, minor points aside, if you watch this movie looking for history--you're bound to be disappointed, there's too much outright fiction intermingled with the legitimate questions raised. For those who think a conspiracy was involved in the assassination this doesn't provide an explanation that hangs together.",

I then just last week purchased it and popped it into my DVD player last night. All I can say is that instead of interesting - it was fascinating! Nothing truly is white and black over here as we re-visit the faithful day when the President of the US was assassinated , I remember my father talking about the day vividly and the way he told my brothers and I about it. Truly my father never really believed all of the evidence , and after watching this Oliver Stone movie I truly believe that there has been a fabrication of the truth and that in Nov 22 , 1963 the Predident of the United States Of America was assassinated and America it-self underwent an invisible coup'd'ete. The most worrying thing about it is that in the year 2008, we get to see factors similar to this all round the world which show America's dominance and foot hold in trying to play the policeman of the world. The film paves the way the in a do-cu-drama style way and then paves the way forward for the trial that took place with the stunning of most visuals and set ups so no one is confused and Oliver Stone does this in such an easy way for us to follow. The script is sharp and tight so there is no silliness floating around but then also the acting from everyone and I MEAN EVERYONE WAS BRILLIANT! , throughout the entire movie there is a certain feeling of dread and one does realise that it is a mouse fighting a gorilla. I really am not sure how accurate it is but it seems that Oliver Stone has conducted his research on it! The film might also be long but try to see it as a case study that way your attention will be a lot focused. To conclude JFK is highly bold and provocative film making that probably would not be allowed to have been made today giving the highly politically charged and sensitive times we are living in today. It has to be observed on its on basis and probably requires us to go away and make up our own minds but one thing is for certain , we all smell conspiracy and I am just how the US will cover up Iraq which to most of us is the new Vietnam , this movie cannot be overlooked!JFK : 8.4 OUT OF 10THE STORY THAT WON'T GO AWAY...",

            "content": "Before getting into the body of this work, let me warn the reader that all that follows is just one person's evaluation of Oliver Stone's JFK. It is just opinion, which you may find agreement, or you may reject. Likewise, Mr. Stone should have had the honesty to provide a disclaimer warning the viewer to beware of suppositions, conjecture and fantasizing.Like any Catholic, American schoolboy of Irish descent, at 14 years of age in 1960, I was very proud to see the Gentleman from Massachusetts, Senator John F. Kennedy win the Democrat Party's nomination and subsequent election to the Office of President. Little did we know that it would be just a little more than 3 years later that we would bear witness to his murder.And even though in the interim between the 2 events, I found myself steadily changing my Political Sympathies. My born and bred Democrat leanings gave way to a solid belief and active Conservative Political participation. That is to whatever small participation allowed to by a guy my age. I would be 18 at the time of the 1964 Presidential Election, at a period of time when one had to be 21 in order to vote.Anyway, even though this young Irish-German, Catholic lad was now a supporter of Senator Barry M. Goldwater(R., AZ) for the Chief Executive job, I. like most Americans, felt as if some one had kicked the living guts right out of me when President Kennedy was murdered. The events of that fateful day and the days following, left America with such a feeling of Personal as well as National tragedy, loss and grief. It was as if a member of one's own family was suddenly, and without any logical reason,taken from life on Planet Earth.This is a feeling that is quite prevalent across the board for all living and old enough to remember those days.Unlike a lot of people of my own Conservative Political persuasion, I do reject the finding of the Warren Commission. Whereas I do not buy the notion that Lee Harvey Oswald was the assassin of President Kennedy, and did so by himself. There is just too much that does not compute! It made no sense then, it makes no sense now! In the years since that time in \"Camelot\", I've spent most of my adult life as 'the Man', 'the Heat', 'the Fuzz', well you get it, I was a Chicago Cop for nearly 35 years, having experience in assignment=ts to the Patrol Division, the Traffic Division, the Youth Division and finally the Detective Division. This surely acted to heighten my sense of suspicion and cynicism about current events, the media covering them and how some special interests can and do slant a story to read as they want it. (Honest Injun! Don't be Shocked, Please!!) Now in spite of all of this disbelief in the findings of the Warren Commission and discounting all the other writings that have sprouted up like mushrooms after a thunderstorm, I must register a negative opinion of JFK and will be happy to give my reasons as to just why.First of all, let's start off by saying, without reservation, that JFK is a tremendous example of the exposition of the Cinematic Arts & Sciences at their very zenith of their powers. The photography, the editing, the use of nonsequitors is all so very well done as to draw the viewer into the story right from the very start. Cutting quickly between scenes and overlapping dialog adds to the certain feeling of \"reality\". Furthering this realism is the use of certain scenes which quickly follow a revelation or supposition* of a behind the scenes happening. These 'follow-up', supporting scenes, are often filmed in a diminished color, or a B & W with a dark-shadowed background. The dialog is spoken in short, fast-paced little clips in voices impersonating a well-known person involved in the whole mess.(e.g. Lyndon Johnson) This is then blurred with overlapping dialog from the previous ex positional scene. All tension is heightened by using abrupt, shrill and louder musical queues.The result is very effective as a dramatic tool, but can be very deceiving to the senses, unconsciously gaining influence on the very last part of one's thought process to fall to sensory stimulation and mood manipulation, your logic. In a real sense, a story like this actually mesmerizes the viewer. That is it has a hypnotic effect.As a work of monumental effort and mammoth efforts in the story telling tradition of the cinema, this certainly deserving of an A or even an A+ grade.But we find that there is just too much of a recurring use of innuendo, supposition, conjecture and embellishment of occurrences following the assassination. The Film Maker, Extremist Left Wing Liberal Democrat, Director Oliver Stone, bends the truth just once too often and a little too much. For these reasons, this writer cannot and will not, endorse this movie. The sum of all the contrived scenes, stacked on on top another equals just a dishonest instrument of influence.And here in Chicago, and just about anywhere else, that means it's a F*cking lie! We surely could not endorse that! Could you?",

            "content": "No one is saying that this film is exactly what happened on Nov. 22nd 1963. Nobody is saying that this is the solution to the great mystery, but what Stone is saying is that this is one possible alternative to one of the grossest lies ever told to the American people and the rest of the world. People that attack this film and dismiss it for being propoganda are missing the point.  If this is propoganda, then what the hell is the Warren Report that says that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone?  A comic strip?Forget politics for just one second and just look at the beauty of this film.  Because that is one thing that is lost in all the politics of this film, we forget what a truly incredible work of art this is.  You will never find a film that is better acted, better photographed, better directed or edited than this.  You can't.  This film is perfection on every level that is film.  Now you can believe what you want to believe, but what you can't deny is how the film makes you feel.  And for me, it made me mad that a crime like this could be committed.  Is there really anyone out there that really thinks that LHO could really fire off three shots that quickly, 5.6 seconds with the acuracy that he did?  Does anyone not find it strange that the final head shot caused his head to go back and to the left, not down and to the right ( which would happen if he was shot from the book depository )? We all know the inconsistencies with the case that are quite factual, the ones that are not embellished by Stone.  Kennedy's brain did disappear, the limo was ordered clean so that evidence was impossible to come by.  The parade route was changed, the protective bubble was removed, a proper sweep of the area was not conducted.  People's testimonies were altered on FBI reports, David Ferry lied to Garrison, the Warren report was run by guys that Kennedy had once fired, suspicious deaths of people that testified in the Warren Report happened frequently, and the magic bullet theory is impossible.  Seven wounds, one bullet, that is quite impossible.  So if you take into account all that is irrefutable about the case and the movie, why do so many people get mad when an alternative theory is presented.  Surely no one really buys into the Warren Report.  Do they?  How about Oswald being shot by David Ferry?  Too many strange things surrounding this case for it to be closed as easily as it was.  So now Stone comes along and has a different theory, a brave one, and people critisize him for it.  Well at least he and Garrison were willing to look in other corners for the truth. Someone had to try.To talk of the film in parts is futile because there is not one part of this film that lacks.  The ensemble cast from Costner as Garrison, to John Candy as Dino, to Joe Pesci as a overly hyper David Ferry to Kevin Bacon as a Willy O' Keefe who thinks that Mr. Garrison is a good looking man, down to Michael Rooker, Wayne Knight, Sissy Spacek, Tommy Lee Jones, Jack Lemon, Walter Mathau, Donald Sutherland and Gary Oldman, every performance in here is remarkable.  They make you feel like you know these characters.  What Oliver Stone has done here is make one of the greatest if not the greatest motion picture I have ever seen.  I still believe that Jaws is the best ever, but JFK is a close second.  Except for it's politics, this film is not open for discussion in terms of how good a MOVIE it is.  Strictly on a film level, the film is flawless.Finally, there is one shot in this film that I think is the greatest shot ever in the history of the movies.  At the very end of Garrison's speech, he says the words \" It's up to you.\"  And as he does, the camera gets level with his eyes, so that he is now speaking with every person that watched this film.  And it is up to us to make the decision.  Are we going to swallow all that we have been fed by the government over the years, or are we going to accept the fact that there is more to the story that what the Warren Report says there is?  Maybe not Stone's version, but something.  At least give Stone credit, he is the only one really brave enough to tackle something like this and live to tell about it.  I'd love to see more films like this that question our government.  Because they make you think.  And that is always a good thing.Oliver Stone has made an incredible film and it is one that should be watched at least once by everyone, especially by young people that don't know much about the case or the assassination.  I was 19 when this film came out.  I saw it and it changed my life.  It made me open my eyes to lies and deceit that our government is capable of doing.  And that is not reserved to the American government, it could be the Canadian, Australian, German whatever.  It is important to question the official version of what is fed to us.  And if you dig a little deeper, you will see there is always an alternative to what they want you to believe.  This film opened my eyes to that.  And I am a better person because of it.",

Based on a book by New Orleans DA Jim Garrison and thousands of documents, personal accounts, videos, and theories from the rigorous investigation conducted, which faced continuous difficulty. Whether it was stories not adding up, evidence out of reach, outside pressure or even difficulty in the family, Jim Garrison's relentless, and at times even obsessive, look into what happened on 11-22-1963, why it happened, and what exactly led up to it happening is a fascinating look into the JFK mystery.Obviously it has it's biases, but if Jim Garrison or Oliver Stone were unbiased, then Garrison would not have conducted his investigation and Stone would have not made this film, so labeling them as biased is merely stating the obvious. In this case, bias is what gives the story direction, which ultimately leads to the point of the view that the film expresses.It is a long journey - nearly 3 and half hours - which is basically constant dialog, but the direction and editing make it riveting by actually showing what the characters are talking about. Whether it is speculation, interpretation of evidence, or just what happened that fateful day in November of 1963 really gets the viewer into the mental playing field and makes the film's point of view that much stronger.Pretty much geared for conspiracy theorist, but this is, nonetheless, a fascinating examination of an important and influential moment in history. 8/10Rated R for profanity and some violent content",

            "content": "JFK is a film about the assassination of John F. Kennedy and it's aftermath. The film follows Jim Garrison (Kevin Costner), a New Orleans District Attorney, who believed that the assassination was not invested properly and that Lee Harvey Oswald was not working alone. Garrison starts he investigations after the Warren Commission publishes its report and starts to investigate a number of people, questions people from prisoners and witnesses and test the theories behind the assassination. Garrison also meets up and gets information from a mysterious military figure (Donald Sutherland). Garrison ends up getting the police to arrest a local man, Clay Shaw (Tommy Lee Jones), and puts him on trial for conspiracy to murder. He was the only man ever be trialled for the Kennedy assassination.The film was well researched and written. It looks at the theories and try to prove or debunk them. The story was told in flashbacks which was fitting and told Oliver Stone uses a number of film devises such as real news footage, black-and-white films, a washed-out colour look and normal film. The film has some good acting performances, it was Kevin Costner's best and this is his best film. There also a good large cast, from Tommy Lee Jones to Gary Oldman to Joe Pesci. The film also has a narrated beginning showing the history of the events and subtly sets out Stone's theory.This film however is not history, but a mix of historical fact and fiction. The theory in this film was that the American Government and Military, including Lyndon B. Johnson, ordered the assassination of Kennedy because they thought he was weak against Communism and wanted to withdraw troops from Vietnam before the war could escalate. This theory is too far fetched and most historians, including American and Cold War specialists at my university believed that American would have gone into Vietnam no matter who was President, Kennedy or Johnson. The film also makes out that Lee Harvey Oswald was a sleeper agent being trained by the American military and was faking being a Marxist and pro-Castro figure.I believe the lone nut theory, that Lee Harvey Oswald was just working on his own. The wouldn't of been involvement of anyone else, not the US government, the Russians, Cubans, Mafia, etc. A general problem of society is that there are always going to be people who believe conspiracy theories. This has happened time and again. This has happened with Jack the Ripper, Princess Diana and 9/11 and people will swear until they are blue in the face that there was a conspiracy despite the evidence proving against.As long as you look as this film as a work of fiction then it is entertaining. If you look at it as proving a conspiracy then you are an idiot.",

            "content": "It was with 1991's JFK that director Oliver Stone began to show us his true directing style.  Whereas Platoon and even Born on the 4th of July were mainstream-by-the-unwritten-rules kind of filmmaking, JFK began to show both a directing and editing style that would become his benchmark years later. With dramatic moments intercut with images such as racehorse hoofs churning up dirt or close-ups of coffee swilling in a cup, Stone began offering films that were a jolt to the senses. \t JFK was also the first of the Presidential entries into his filmography (Nixon and the executive produced The Day Reagan Was Shot), and follows the investigation of New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison and the suspicious circumstances  surrounding the assassination of John F. Kennedy in Dallas, Texas 1963.Garrison is played by Kevin Costner, a year removed from his breakout directorial debut, Dances With Wolves, and follows the DA as he re-opens the case questioning the findings of the Warren Commission three years later. Leading a team that includes actors Laurie Metcalf, Michael Rooker, Wayne Knight and Jay O. Sanders, Garrison tracks down old eye-witnesses and follows leads left behind by the F.B.I., in hopes of finding the conspiracy that he feels so passionately has been covered up.  Along his odyssey, Garrison meets various degrees of opposition and soon fears for the safety of his team and family in hopes of uncovering the truth. \nJFK was filmed at the height of Stone's popularity and that can be seen on how many famous faces lined up for a role \u0096 no matter how small or trivial \u0096 in this 3 hour epic.  Just glancing at the cast listing and you will see names like Kevin Bacon, Ed Asner, Gary Oldman, Jack Lemmon, John Candy, Donald Sutherland and Tommy Lee Jones just to name a handful.  They are paraded out in rapid fire style and range from quick cameos to larger plot point characters.  Stone does well to manage the various egos that were involved and keep the story on track, undistracted from the ever present star power.The screenplay for JFK was taken from various sources including Crossfire: The Plot That Killed Kennedy by Jim Marrs and On The Trail Of The Assassins by Jim Garrison.  Coupled with various liberties by screenwriters Oliver Stone and Zachery Sklar, the film ventures down various possibilities as to the mastermind behind the plot including the C.I.A., Cubans & even the Vice President.  With all the assumptions and suggestions put forth by the director, Stone achieves the goal of leaving the audience with a notion that there were too many possibilities as to believe that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone and was nothing more than the \u0091patsy' he professed. \nThe courtroom scenes near the conclusion of the film are riveting entertainment and offer edge of your seat conclusions as the facts pour into the audiences lap for interpretation.  Stone flashes between actual footage and court scene descriptions to fill the final 45 minutes with a recap of the information obtained by their various sources.  Not until A Few Good Men did a courtroom scene offer such drama and tension.JFK was also a political statement for Stone.  Vocal through the late 80's and early 90's on the government and the U.S. involvement in Vietnam, you can tell by watching JFK that Stone would believe anything but the fact the government's findings may be correct.  This however does not take away from the impact of JFK, but does lead to some interesting discussion at the end of the film.   Labeled by many as one of the best films of the 1990's, JFK is a treat for film goers, conspiracy theorists and even \u0096 to some extent \u0096 historians, and should not be missed.  Being nominated for 8 Academy Awards and winning two is a testament to this masterpiece.",

            "content": "Two aspects of this movie earn respect as cinema: the first is the way Stone manages stock footage - this is masterfully edited and composed. The second is the way it is structured around memories. The entire movie hinges on how Stone imagines his Garrison imagining the recollections of all his 'witnesses' (really just an amalgam of all the conspiracy buffs' theories). At key points, the stock footage and the cinematic 'memories' are sequenced together, producing a \"Citizen Kane\" effect. And so I rank this on the 'watchable' end of my rating scale.Stone stated in interviews that his goal was to assemble all of the major conspiracy theories into one movie -- and the result is this elephantine mess, as corpulent as Candy's hipster lawyer. The smart thing to do would have been to focus on one character - Oswald, for example. Oldman handled him especially well - and use the visual storytelling described above to flesh that out...too bad.It didn't take long for this to be relegated to mere entertainment. Only the most hardened conspiracy nut takes this at face value. I won't go through a list of points that I can refute (yawn). But I can advise you to watch \"Unsolved History: JFK - Beyond The Magic Bullet\". You may find this useful as an empirical debunking of the 'magic bullet' business that props up this movie and the theories that surround the most studied assassination in history.So what else 'keeps this story from going away'? Mostly, I think it's the war baby and boomer generations' wounded pride -- they can't accept that the Kennedy lion could have been killed by a gnat. I know this is one of Stone's motivating factors.Unfortunately, this is the same guy who slobbers all over that murderous despot Castro. Stone's narrative is the same in every movie -- 'regular' Americans love their country, but it's been hijacked by business greedheads and fascists. It's sad. Sad because so many people take this seriously, in order to fill their emptiness. I had the bilious displeasure of watching \"Loose Change 2nd Ed.\", a sign of yet another brewing cultural war. I'm afraid that within three decades we'll be seeing narrative movies by A-list directors about Sept. 11, 2001 that demand responses to 'unanswered questions'.On the lighter side, this was nicely deflated in Seinfeld's \"The Boyfriend (1)\" episode. That's one magic loogie!",

            "content": "I first saw \"JFK\" in Germany, with the same German actor who dubbed Costner in \"Dances with Wolves\" dubbing him here as Jim Garrison. All of the New Orleans accents were obviously lost, along with half of the flavorings that Stone used to make the incredible amount of information go smoothly into the ears of an American audience. Just the same, I was hooked by this film and recognized it as one of the most important films ever made, along with its flaws, not to mention a great way for Americans to finally see in detail the Zapruder film.In my travels throughout Germany, I ended up in Berlin as a doctoral student and to my surprise, discovered that my Berlin school had a John F. Kennedy Library, where I spent much of my free time. With great German efficiency, this library had a pristine copy of the Warren Commission transcripts displayed in a prominent place and I proceeded to read carefully the first four or five volumes, while scanning the rest. It was an ironic backdrop to read the transcripts here because I know our American press has taken great pains to downplay the Kennedy Presidency, even attacking Kennedy's character. I don't think most Americans are aware of how much West Berliners loved Kennedy, dare I say even more than their own German leaders. Kennedy, after all, saved West Berlin on more than one occasion.In light of Oliver Stone's film, one sees clearly even more bizarre things about the Kennedy assassination as depicted in the Warren Commission transcripts. No, even if you were taken by it, Stone's version of events should never be taken as anybody's final word about the assassination--it is a Hollywood film. Tom Wicker's claim that it is propaganda does not do it justice either. Propaganda is deliberately and consciously misleading an audience in an attempt to beguile them toward a political end. How could anyone think that Stone's beliefs weren't genuine? But the film is flawed. It's hard to believe Stone read the Warren Commission transcripts. If he had, some more details might have proved valuable to his essay. For example, I was absolutely floored when I read Oswald's mother's sprawling testimony in which she states that she believed that her son was an agent for the United States and was recruited when he joined the Civil Air Patrol, although she couldn't say how and didn't name David Ferrie (he is mentioned only superficially in the transcripts). She goes on to explain that there was another picture of Oswald with his rifle raised above his head, but that she and Marina burned it in their hotel room the night of the assassination (which would tend to disprove the theory that those photos were faked). Critics of the conspiracy theories also can't believe that a great American like Earl Warren would have participated in a cover up. The truth is, many of the Warren Commission members didn't show up regularly to the hearings and when Warren was absent, Alan Dulles (the ex-CIA Director that Kennedy fired) ran the investigation--an important detail that is too often overlooked. Details of how President Johnson, the Warren Commission, and even the 1977 HRSC investigation was manipulated via a sophisticated method of kibbitzing can be found in the new book by Jim DiEugenio and Lisa Pease (\"The Assassinations,\" Feral House, 2003).Besides the information from the Warren Commission transcripts, Stone could have taken more time to explain specifically and precisely how the Bay of Pigs fiasco provided the means and motive for the assassination. It was only in Stone's movie about Nixon that the secret team of Cubans (named by Stone as \"Track One\"; perhaps the same group known as \"Operation 40,\" which was probably designed to be a post-Castro Cuban intelligence organization) came to light. Americans should always remember that Eisenhower passed the planning of the Bay of Pigs invasion to his Vice-President, Richard Nixon, thinking that Nixon would win the Presidency in 1960. Important details of Nixon's plan (i.e., Operation 40 or Track One) were withheld from Kennedy. This wasn't simply an inept operation; it was the crux of the Kennedy Presidency: \"who's in charge here?\" Stone also tries to downplay the incident with Sylvia Odio as a staged event, when in actuality, this could be a big piece to the puzzle. Oddly enough Stone shows the Gary Oldman Oswald talking to Odio and the fake Frank Whaley Oswald later with the same Cubans, calling Odio from a phone booth. Odio swears she recognized the real Oswald with these Cubans visiting her house.As entertainment, the success of this movie is off the charts. Unfortunately, it doesn't entirely succeed what it sets out to do: reverse the course of history like no other film has ever done. Stone has put a dent in the American dialog about the assassination of JFK, but unfortunately he can't put the matter to rest. A few years ago, when Governor Jesse Ventura stated that he believed the military industrial complex conspired to kill Kennedy, TV journalists Chris Matthews and Matt Lauer both rolled their eyes and publicly crucified him. Matthews even gives us the tired old adage (source unknown) that people who believe in a Kennedy assassination conspiracy were \"educated on a bar stool\" (a variation of which is used in Clint Eastwood's 1993 \"In the Line of Fire\"--perhaps a cryptic rebuttal to Stone). Had Stone's film succeeded in what it set out to do, all of us would be able to state the assassination of John F. Kennedy was, as Rudolf Augstein has said, the most important political assassination since Julius Caesar and anyone who believes American democracy is important would recognize Kennedy as a President of the same stature as Abraham Lincoln, not because of his abilities, but because he stepped into his job at a crucial test of Democracy--did he really fail?",

Recreated scenes are interwoven with archival film footage so seamlessly that only historical scholars can detect where Dallas ends and Hollywood begins. But for the well read scholar that line is very clear. I enjoy the movie itself. It is a bit long and would bore those without a fairly elaborate background with the details of the assassination and the various plots that have been hatched.Second: Concerning the historical accuracy of the film. There is none. The only accurate facts are that Kennedy was assassinated, Oswald was shot, and the nation mourned. Everything else is suspect. There is not time here to dissect the film to the degree I would like, besides several websites have already done that much better than I could. The premise of several different gunmen firing up to six or more shots it totally unsubstantiated with ANY credible evidence. The allegations that Kennedy planned to pull out of Vietnam are not accepted by ANY respected historian in the United States. The theory that Oswald and Ruby were involved together is laughable since no evidence exists to support this fanciful theory.In short, the movie should have been named, \"Dallas in Wonderland\", but Oliver's twist is fun to rip apart.",

            "content": "JFK (1991) -My frames of reference for the events of November the 22nd 1963 are limited to what I've seen on TV Shows like 'Quantum Leap' (1989-94), 'Red Dwarf' (1988-) and 'Doctor Who' (2005-). I'm not an American and I wasn't even born until many years later, so all I really knew about those events was that the shooter was alleged to be a guy called Lee Harvey Oswald and there was a conspiracy theory that there was another man behind the grassy knoll. Either that or it was blamed on Marge Simpson in one episode of that I think?It's not part of my specific history as a Brit and as someone born in the 80's and has never really been of much interest to me, but I have to say that I found the unfolded history portrayed in this film an intriguing tale with far more detail than I had expected.I did put off watching it, because I didn't think that I would like it and because it is an exercise in endurance at just over 3 hours long, but I think that, due to the subject matter, it might be a bit too ironic to omit anything.But really, it wasn't dull at all, even though it was long. It wouldn't have served its own purpose to edit it down further and would have been too crammed if anything else had been included. I'm sure that there was probably a lot more that Oliver Stone, as the director, wanted to include, but just couldn't fit in.There seems to be a need across IMDB, either from the synopsis' or the reviewers, to explain that the story is based in fact and held together with a fictitious element. How much is fictitious is certainly something that I don't know and probably won't check up on, but nevertheless the tale is informative and entertaining. There is a lot put forward to consider and therefore I find it hard to believe that very much of it was fabricated.It could perhaps be a bit much to take on board if you weren't in the right frame of mind when watching it, because there is so much detail and it's not a film to watch in the background or to relax to. Nor is it one to watch every week, because you love it so much, as it has a certain draining quality to it, being a lot to take in.I liked the way that it used mixed media to move the story along and underscored conversations with real video footage, as well as re-creations of TV news reels, photographs and more. It almost made it feel documentary like.The film is powerfully produced and I could feel the loss of the title character from the first moment. That beginning resonated with me in a similar way to how I felt on the days that Princess Diana died and the events of 9/11, which I suppose are my own closest comparisons.What was put before me and the way it was edited and directed made me feel hollow inside and as if I had just lost someone well known to me, not someone that has been gone for nearly 60 years already that had never knowingly effected my life. This production did their part very well to deliver what the whole nation of America must surely have been feeling back on that day in 1963.It is suggested that President Kennedy had big plans for the future of the USA and that he would have brought about a more peaceful, diverse and integrated country, including an end to the Vietnam War. If this is true, and I personally would like to believe it is so, I hate to think of how much his continued time in office would have changed the future that we are living in now. There is a parallel universe somewhere that is living this version of events and I think that that whole world is probably a better place for that doppelg\u00e4nger's continued Presidency, but sadly we will never know.It's scary to think how much power these governments have and how there is sometimes no accountability, because of their ability to cover things up. These are the people that we have voted for and put in to these positions of power, but if they are corrupt, they should be made accountable for their actions.It seems that even 60 years later things have not moved on, as the US, UK and Russia, to name a few, still appear to have liars and thieves in places of high office and the process to judge them is tied up in red tape and bureaucracy.I'm afraid I'm on a real rant with this one, but this is how the film made me feel and I don't tend to discuss politics that often, this is why.It aggravates me so much and as I watched Mr Costner, in his role of Jim Garrison, deliver his damning evidence in the court scene toward the end of the film, it really riled me that common sense cannot prevail.It was also hard to see some of the things that his character showed, the video footage and other elements were quite disturbing and I can imagine that many Americans, supporters of John F. Kennedy and those that had actually voted for him, may have found some of it distasteful. I know that I still find it hard to hear people making jokes about Princess Diana and the events of the Two Towers, so I can understand that with some things it is always too soon.What's shown here seems to be the real grit and dirt of the bloody event.I wonder what we will learn in 2038, when the statute of limitations requires that they legally release the information that was held back from Garrison's investigation.I actually found it odd whenever anyone called him Mr Garrison, because all I could think of was the weird teacher with the puppet on his hand from 'South Park' (1997-). I wonder if that was something done deliberately on Trey Parker and Matt Stone's part to show their opinions on the real man's involvement in this case, perhaps implying that he was a puppet, but it's probably just a coincidence?It's also hard to trust a word that Donald Sutherland's character says, because of the other somewhat duplicitous and sly roles he's known for. Even his character in 'M*A*S*H' (1970) was known to be a sneaky trickster.Was the overall film Oscar worthy? Maybe for Direction and Editing, but no one else stood out otherwise. Kevin was fine and those playing his supporting staff, not many of them major celebrities normally, all did their jobs well too, but it was the telling of the story that was the winner for me.714.88/1000.",

And as I said with another historic movie, facts are the bricks for getting into the events. Conclusions, hypothesis, commentaries are maybe useful but they can't replace the facts. This method is rewarding concerning this dramatic event of our previous century because it shocked a world while just a handful was present on this famous Dealey Plaza, November 1963. Above all, a movie make you see things as they were, thus you just call for your best judgment. So, let's take a look at what happened:1) The supposed lone gunman (HLO) fired at the most difficult time to aim: when the presidential car moved away and not while it was right in front of him. Strange? 2) The place of the shooting is the best for a trap: you see the famous grassy knoll and just behind a huge parking and nothing else except railroads. Coincidence? 3) The definitive visual proof: the Zapruder movie: if JFK fell left and behind with the head gunshot, thus that means that someone behind him and at his right, as HLO, could have been the killer. Nonsense!That's why I just loved this movie because it's like living this dreadful day right from where it happened. So when you heard a past (awful) president, involved in the Agency and making dollars with blood, saying \"it's a crap\", well, you know that the movie kicked where it hurts!While watching it, I read the 1968 book \"The Plot\" which amazed me because I think it's the quickest book to reach the same conspiracy conclusion. Together, they make me understand the motive for the killing: JFK was a pacifist and as he would have been surely reelected for a second and finale mandate, he would have then his hands free to do what he wanted. And peace wasn't what the military-industrial complex wanted, as warned by his predecessor Eisenhower, himself coming from this corporation.So, this movie is a powerful testimony for truth and in addition, a truly artistic masterpiece: the editing, the cinematography with fictional shooting and real footage makes a nearly virtual experience. It's not only talks because for each opinion, you see immediately the actual and real proof. We must thank Stone for his great cast and his attention to profile it as the real people. I have never been a great fan of Costner but for a actor labeled \"action\", he was just amazing portraying the attorney. He delivers a great incarnation of courage and dedication. If you add a great score from one of the best, John Williams, you got the ultimate movie of 1991: a story that you can't forget told by excellent artists!

Costner, efficient, as real life Attorney, Jim Garrison, builds up a team of investigators.

I've always been interested in history and that murder is of course an important event in the twentieth century.It seems to me that Oliver Stone has made his trademark of making movies about historically important people or events and conspiracy theories. His latest movie of that kind was \"Alexander\", but he also made movies about Nixon and John F. Kennedy and produced many others. I've always been an admirer of his work. I liked \"The People vs. Larry Flynt\", I appreciated \"Nixon\" and \"Natural Born Killers\" and saw many others like \"Platoon\" and \"Born on the Fourth of July\". But J.F.K may well be the best movie he has made so far.It gives a good idea of everything that happened the 22nd November, 1963. It is a mixture of actual facts and speculations, but it is all done in such a way that it is very believable. Of course, there isn't any proof of what is sometimes said, but this isn't a documentary either, it's a movie, so there doesn't always have to be proof of all that is stated.It's a movie that is full of drama and suspense, but it is a lot more than some cheap entertainment. It gives us the story of New Orleans District Attorney, Jim Garrison (Kevin Costner), who re-opens the files on the investigation and takes a critical look at the facts given by the F.B.I. Because of the fact that he keeps asking questions and keeps poking his nose where it shouldn't be, the people who had something to do with the murder get anxious. His own life and that of his family is at risk, but he keeps looking for the truth and finally finds a trail...Normally I'm not a fan of movies that mix facts and fiction, but when it is done in such a way as it was done in this movie, than I can only admire the good work. It's very clear that everything that is stated in the movie may not be certain, but that it's all very plausible. The people who wrote this story didn't just want to make some easy entertainment, they tried to give their vision on the truth.

There are plenty of conspiracy theories about JFK out there but I'm not really interested in them. This film informs, but it also expects too much from the viewer. I can remember reading about the now famous speech given by JFK in Germany where he accidentally called himself a cocktail-when what he really meant was to compliment Germany by saying today he was a German-by way of identifying himself as a citizen of Berlin. As a compliment to Berliner's. And to all German's. What he had technically had said was: 'I'm your not secret undercover German President of the USA.' That's a much more strange verbal concoction than accidentally called himself a \"cocktail.\" Nobody ever talks about that. He could have just said 'I thank you all for being so welcoming to me on my trip to Germany.' I think it was a long succession of verbal gaffs like \"the Berliner bit\" that ultimately caused the assassination of JFK. In terms of conspiracy theories I don't know if saying a thing was probably caused by something actually qualifies as a conspiracy theory since I have no theory as to what that idea might entail. Specifically. The film JFK doesn't add to anything in terms of the story of what happened to JFK. We know he was shot & killed. We know they figured out who shot & killed him not long after he was shot & killed. We also know the guy that shot & killed him was himself shot & killed not long after he was taken in by the authorities. End of story. Knew all that stuff ages before the JFK movie came out.

First thing to note is that, despite its long running time, JFK is a very involving and intriguing film (moreso as Garrison starts to delve deeper and begins to learn the sheer number of people who may be linked to the assassination). Everyone has their own idea of what really happened on that fateful day and JFK does really only point everything here in one direction (meaning it will disappoint those who are looking for any kind of balance or don't believe that there was any kind of conspiracy). For me though, I've always believed that Kennedy's assassination was never quite as it seemed and have always looked at the 'bigger picture.'One thing that I did really like about JFK is how focused it was; it's wordy and long, but it's all done with a sense of purpose and every bit of dialogue is effectively used to complete the puzzle. There is some melodrama in the film (as is the case with most dramas), but here it is only really used to show how Garrison's obsession with uncovering the truth about JFK's assassination is having a detrimental impact on his marriage (thankfully Stone doesn't overuse this element and merely adopts it to show how his inability to switch off is affecting his home life).JFK also boasts a lot of high-profile talented actors on-board; Kevin Costner is not one of my favourite actors often lacking charisma, but he is OK here. Joe Pesci and Tommy Lee Jones are both better although they look quite ridiculous (moreso in Pesci's case). Walter Matthau, Jack Lemmon, John Candy & Kevin Bacon also show up in supporting roles adding a little bit of class to JFK.JFK won't be to everyone's taste (particuarly to those looking for a balanced account), but personally I found it thought-provoking, intriguing and eye-opening.",

This is one of them.I've heard that when Oliver Stone originally planned to tell the story that on the day of Kennedy's assassination, American people witnessed a coup d\u00e9tente in the country that transfered the power from the president to powers that's yet to come out into the limelight. But he was asked not to do that. Whether this is true or not, the conversation between Doanld Sutherland and Kevin Cosner 2 hours into the movie touches on this subject.It's a fact that over 70% of the American public believes that there was a conspiracy behind Kennedy's assassination, and this movie addresses the doubt that many of us has in very good detail. Even my friend who used to be in the military said that Kennedy's reaction in his limousine was that of someone clearly shot from the front - not from the back. With so many witness and evidence contradicting the official findings, no wonder so much doubt still lingers after all these years.This is one of the most intriguing movie in American cinema, about one of the most intriguing story in American history.

            "content": "What a sad commentary on the world in which we live, that such a progressive, highly public figure and advocate for peace and racial harmony, is cut down in the prime of his life. Just another example of the flagrant travesty of justice and morality. I was but a youngster on the day of President Kennedy's assassination, but it is still a very raw, horrendously sad subject in my mind, even to this date. The fact that President Kennedy had personally known the horrors associated with war and vowed to avoid it at all costs, only exacerbates the heinous act itself and substantiates the need for the full disclosure of facts and further investigation into the possibility of some clandestine conspiracy and treasonable act. That such an egregious, cowardly act could have been perpetrated on this progressive human rights advocate, great man and political figure, only makes one shudder in disbelief. Just as the age-old saying predicts in the trenches: \"There are no atheists in foxholes\", Mr. Kennedy knew, firsthand, that the color of someone's skin is of no importance, especially when life and liberty are on the line and that the mere concept of war is, plain and simple, an aberration.It further staggers the imagination that there could be even the possibility of some government cover-up against releasing the files associated with that tragic event and day. Just the notion of a conspiracy sends cold chills down one's spine, as it is an indictment on the most basic of moral values and democracy itself. To blatantly discard or detract from the intrinsic value found in the physical evidence of this case, reeks of a conspiracy in its own right. We all know that war is the biggest business of all where the rich only get richer and the good inevitably die young. Somehow I'm a bit surprised that a filmmaker was able to address this issue with relative impunity for broaching a subject of such delicate and potentially incriminating nature, although perhaps enough time has passed in history to relegate this event to the rhetorical or even dismiss it as simply artistic hyperbole and superficial speculation for the sake of the entertainment value alone. Unless, that is, the powers of corruption and darkness continue to run so deep as to infest and permeate the entire fabric of both the political and judicial machines. In any event, this film definitely strikes a chord of suspicion and is fodder for a complete and final investigation, if for nothing else, for history's sake. I salute Mr. Stone for this excellent dramatic achievement. It most certainly begs the question of just how safe are we from ourselves and if \"Big Brother\" could be a festering, insidious reality or a portent of things yet to come? Julius Caesar must be turning in his grave. Excellent film!!",

            "content": "Combining a conspiracy theory of the Kennedy assassination with real film footage and stellar cast, Oliver Stone has fashioned a highly entertaining movie in JFK. In his overall work, Stone has drawn on events from American history that are touchstones for the post-1945 generation and this is certainly one, as was apparent in the 50th anniversary of John F. Kennedy's assassination in 2013. Theuse of the Zapruder film and other film recordings are part of the retelling of this event and have long contributed to the public's unease over the conclusions of the Warren Commission Report that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone in the assassination of the President. So once again, the visual evidence forms part of the movie. The cast is excellent in a drama that gives a fictionalized account of what happened to JFK. Whether or not it represents historical truth is not the point of the movie. Stone is telling a story that shows a certain point of view to an audience that lived through the assassination and craves for some meaning in a tragic event.The idea that the CIA, the Pentagon, Lyndon Johnson, and a group of conspirators based in New Orleans managed to change the course of history will catch the attention of Americans who remember the event because it was so traumatic. Oliver Stone's success in levering the events of his time into entertainment is his stock in trade and no more on display than here. The acting of Joe Pesci as David Ferrie and Tommy Lee Jones as Clay Shaw were particularly notable, not to mention the mystery man played by Donald Sutherland. The behind the scenes stories of characters associated with the story lures us into the ongoing temptation of wanting to believe that there is an explanation to bring closure to a loss that haunts many of us, not just Americans. Stone's movie brings it all back and again stirs up the doubts that linger in the public's mind.",

And I have to agree with Roger Ebert's conclusions about this film.  It is not history, but a powerful movie about the emotions of the time, which is just as important as the actual fact that JFK was killed.  Garrison's character is the collective 1960s American who was optimistic about the direction in which the country was being led and when JFK died, that vision vanished as well.  The sense of loss and frustration is what Stone captured to perfection.I was pleasantly surprised at Costner's performance.

It was on for just over 3 hours... but it really did feel like it was longer.The movie is about the assassination of the former president John F. Kennedy. What I really liked about this film was the fact that they used real footage of JFK. There were no actors playing him, it was actually him. He got shot right at the beginning of the movie, and then the rest of the movie was about District Attorney Jim Garrison, who believes that Lee Harvey Oswald was used as a patsy and Kennedy was shot by someone else. It then turns into a court drama.I did like it, and it was very interesting, but it just seemed to be a very slow going movie.There were some fantastic performances though. The cast list was amazing in this movie. Kevin Costner, Tommy Lee Jones, Gary Oldman, Joe Pesci, Kevin Bacon, Jack Lemmon, Sissy Spacek, Walter Matthau, Donald Sutherland, John Candy, Michael Rooker & Wayne Knight.The film was made by Oliver Stone. The man is a legend and knows how to make a great film.The make-up was not so good... Joe Pesci looked terrible. He was wearing a really bad wig and huge fake eyebrows. But later in the film, you see they are supposed to be bad. Tommy Lee Jones' wig though was hilarious. I couldn't help but laugh when I first saw him. I wasn't expecting John Candy to be in it... I was pleasantly surprised. He was a great actor and he made so many classic movies. He is still missed now.I didn't know much about the JFK assassination when I watched this. I obviously knew about the conspiracy behind it all and the grassy knoll. But I didn't know much details. This really interested me in the movie and made me want to look into it a bit more.

Needless to say, the acting is in good hands, though Jones was the only one recognized with an Oscar nomination.Stone's direction is fluid and the film's masterful editing deservedly took home an Oscar (as did the cinematography). The John Williams score was Oscar-nominated and, while it's no match for his best work, it is indispensable in setting the film's tone.Lastly, I should point out that it was the director's cut that I saw and from what I know of the additions made it seems that the original cut may be even tighter on the whole. Either way, \"JFK\" is a fine film and not just for conspiracy theorists.",

            "content": "This film was a great example of what or how the government can use lethal force to kill with extreme prejudice. John F. Kennedy, the greatest president who sought to pull out troops from Vietnam had been gunned down in Texas on Nov 22, 1963. Mainly because of the war mongering generals being upset that their own interests within Vietnam was to establish grounds to test many kinds of new military devices in war. But to do that, they needed a ruse in which to launch their plot, hence the Gulf of Tonken incident. For which even to this day, most military personnel that were at ton-ken, said nothing happened. Not one fire shot, or any weapons discharged to start the war. Now since Kennedy was adamant about pulling out his men, the join chiefs who were involved went to extremes in keeping the gulf open to opportunities. So, in assassinating the president, and having Johnson sworn in soon after the Vietnam war began in full force. Yet behind the lines at home, Jim Garrison (Kevin Costner) found enough evidence to bring a certain man to justice by investigating the backgrounds of key individuals in order to show the people a conspiracy of killing the president. Now with his team are Bill Brousard (Micheal Rooker) who at the time was a kind of liaison to the district attorney's office by day, and an FBI agent by night. Through him, his defences had been brought to light because of Garrison's accusations against some key players. However, because of Jim's intellect and instinct found out that Bill was not all that he seemed to be and tried to either kill Garrison, or slow him down long enough to allow the FBI to work up some new evidence in favour of Clay Shaw (Tommy Lee Jones). Now with all of this working against Garrison and his team, Jim, must present evidence to the court of why or how Shaw was involved in killing Kennedy. But to throw a bone in further and to mix up the truth, another of Shaw's men David Ferrie (Joe Pesci) had been cast in as a kind of psychopath, a kind of Castro extremist who was a wing nut by all standards. I thought through the court room scene was the best I have ever witnessed. Oliver stone brought us something for which all people can actually scrutinize and say, Why would someone kill a good man? Why go to the trouble of murdering a president just because the US wanted peace? It was the people this film was directed to, not the government, not the joint chiefs, nor the patsy's. It was the people alone. A great example of casting if I ever saw one, Walter Mathau, Jack Lemmon, John Candy, Donald Sutherland who played a remarkable role as the colonel who retired his position because of high ranking mistakes from the Washington government to protect the president. His key role was astounding in his explanations to why he was transferred to the south pole, or how he figured out in such little time of what was going on in the capital. Ingredients such as this gave this movie an aspiring awe of scope, detail, marvellous acting, and impact scenes for which will give me either simple dreams, or utter nightmares. Our governments cannot be trusted any longer, the machine is too equipped for the people to stop on their own let alone storming the castle. But as history provides us many facts, that a country was built by the people, not the politicians. If there will be a time for the house of cards to tumble, it is going to be sooner than we anticipate. And when it happens, a new era will begin in the human race. To what, we don't know. Excellent film, recommended to all over the age of fourteen.",

            "review_title": "As a film, OK. As serious analysis a tad dodgy. Always remember that this is fiction",
            "content": "There's the truth about why John Kennedy was assassinated and by whom and then there's Oliver Stone's epic JFK. It is generally, although not universally, accepted that Lee Harvey Oswald was indeed a 'patsy' and set up to take the wrap, and that the Warren Commission and its report were a rather hamfisted whitewash. But that is about all we can safely allow ourselves to believe to know, and everything else is still as clear as mud. The problem with Stone's JFK is that it is first and foremost a fiction, with fictional elements which, although intended to demonstrate a higher 'dramatic' truth, are still made up, invented, constructed. For all I know the thesis of the film is wholly accurate (although one website in particular has dedicated itself to debunking much of Stone's film). On the other hand it might well be wholly inaccurate, and it doesn't seem that we will be able to know definitively one way or the other any time soon. But when considering Stone's film JFK, the one thing we must never forget is that it is a fiction and furthermore, given the nature of Hollywood filmmaking, one produced for commercial gain. So, for example, it includes several wholly fictional characters, of which the gay hustler Willie O'Keeffe and the assistant DA Bill Bruissard are just two and severa wholly fictional scenes.Yet many people \u2013 in fact, a great many people \u2013 will have walked out of the cinema after watching JFK believing that the Kennedy murder mystery has finally been solved, that the conspiracy was, in the words of the film's DA Jim Garrison, nothing less than a coup d'etat backed by the military industrial complex of the US which saw Kennedy as bad for business. According to Stone's film that coup d'etat and the assassination conspiracy were achieved with the backing of the CIA, the FBI and Dallas' police department. And, what is even more alarming is that, given the potency of film, Stone's \u2013 fictional - account might well in time become the accepted and definitive account. But I'll repeat: we have no way of knowing how much or how little of it is true or even close to true.By chance I have been reading another analysis of the assassination by the British writer Anthony Summers (and was thus already familiar with many of the names of the whole affair's protagonists). Summer's book is not a work of fiction but attempts to sift through the confusion of fact and evidence surrounding Oswald. Although Summers is at pains to avoid being seen to 'solve the case' and states that his objective is simply to lay out the evidence as we know it, his book does suggest strongly that there was Mafia involvement in Kennedy's murder and, even more so that, of anti-Castro Cuban exiles. In this writer's view, assassination by Cuban exiles with the assistance of the Mafia (who hated Kennedy and his brother Robert) and rather a lot of rogue elements in the CIA and FBI, strikes me as being a great deal more plausible than the man being bumped of by his own side, not least of whom was the man who succeeded Kennedy as president (and who apparently reversed Kennedy's policy to pull out of Vietnam and instead escalated US involvement in the conflict. Yet that, very plausible and well-documented aspect of the assassination is not even hinted at in Stone's film. There is not a whisper of Cuban exiles, despite Oswald's well-known dealings with them. Summers agrees that there was a great deal of very odd CIA, FBI and Dallas police department behaviour, but does not suggest that this was official policy (rather, he believes that official stubbornness which covered up a great deal of odd behaviour by the security forces stemmed from a proud esprit de corps, my side right or wrong) at no point does anything he writes suggest that a coup d'etat lay at the core of the assassination.That, on the other hand, lies at the heart of Stone's film, and the meeting between Garrison and the mysterious Mr X (a disillusioned high-up soldier who claimed he ran a black ops unit) is pivotal. So what is it? Who's right? Your guess is as good as mine. But don't take Stone's film as the gospel truth. If you decide to see it (by now most probably in DVD) always bear in mind that this is a fictional work of art, and that Stone is on record as having his own agenda.But what of JFK as a film? Well, if it is possible to divorce the 'film' from its contentious subject matter \u2013 which is, of course, almost impossible \u2013 then JFK should get very good marks indeed. It is well-shot, well-acted, well-edited and well-imagined. Had it dealt with some other assassination, and one which was not as central to a sensitive American psyche, it would be top-notch. As it is \u0085 well until and when JFK can be views with a little more objectivity, it is almost impossible to judge.Remember: this is a fictional piece of art. It isn't The Truth, irrespective of how close or how far from The Truth it actually might be.",

This movie is based on a real story: the assassination of the President John F. Kennedy in 22nd November 1963. It shows us the events that have lead to this tragedy and the conspiracy to murder the President.This movie is very realistic not only because it is based on a true story but also because it uses real images of the President's assassination captured in that fatal day.This film is recommendable for those who want to know more things about the President's assassination, a mystery which still wasn't 100% solved even nowadays.Surprisingly the actors John Candy and Walter Matthau appear in this movie. I can't remember about Walt, but John Candy's role was minor. Now about Kevin Costner, he's very good in this role (Jim Garrison). This is, without a doubt, one of his best performances ever - if not his best.What I liked most about this film is its realism and the way how the controversial director Oliver Stone recreates this tragic story, as well as Kevin Costner's performance.

In 1961 usa supported Bay of Pigs Invasion of cuba (so jfk supported also) but castro and cuba defeated them. That is why it is said cia wanted JFK dead.Good to see kevin coster and kevin bacon. They are really young. Also i know some actors. Liz garrison is from bloodline series, some from alias, Wayne knight from jurassic park.Some citizens are happy about JFK's death, some are sad. Interesting.I think it was quite different days. A president could travel in a car which was not protected or armored. So defendless. MAybe he did not care about threads.It was interesting, the suspect spoke to the journalists and the cops let it. Even, he said \"cops hit me\" and wanted a lawyer. It is really interesting.3 years past but jim just realized something is not right. And started investigation. Without any fear.

Modern ages.Cia, fbi all are trying to hide. Killing the last witnesses.That 'x' tells about how cia worked worldwide. France, nazis, italy, iran. How usa overthrown the governments. Except cuba :)I dont like or dislike JFK, i appreciate some of his works (preventing wars, supporting blacks) but i am really sad to realize how security, cia or whatever left him so vulnerable -also i think his wife who was scared in the video- and prepared his death.And 'X' gives nice advices. \"Only chance is to come up with a case\", \"make arrests\"... What a historical moment and advice for usa history. It would be better for jim if his wife was more supportive. She did not believe in him even.

            "content": "As a dazzling display of film-making skill, you'd be hard pressed to find anything quite as efficient as Oliver Stone's JFK. As a document of history, the film falls far short. Using an array of film-making tricks and techniques Stone has created a long but engrossing tale, juggling dozens of remarkable characters and intertwining multiple stories and theories. The regrettable part is that in the end -- like in reality -- you don't know who or what to believe, which would be fine if that was Stone's conclusion. But in mixing reality and fantasy, archival footage and new footage, together to make them indistinguishable, Stone aims at presenting a solution to this great American mystery. Even granting the need for dramatic license, the film has serious issues when it comes to integrity. Just as you can't be just a little bit pregnant, you can't add just a little bit of fiction into fact and claim historical truth.The irony is that the very paranoia that fuels the film and inspired Stone to fully invest his talent is also the element that robs the film of credibility.Though Stone hedges his bets a bit by framing much of the story as supposition and presents reenactments of events that may or may not have really happened, the final conclusion that the audience is left with is that President Kennedy was the victim of a vast conspiracy consisting of the CIA, the Mafia, Fidel Castro, LBJ, an oddball band of communist sympathizers and a few odds and ends homosexuals, whose motives are never made clear. Just about everybody is culpable, except possibly Lee Harvey Oswald. By the time Stone's protagonist, the discredited and otherwise long-forgotten New Orleans prosecutor, Jim Garrison, gets Clay Shaw, a gay New Orleans business man, to trial on charges of conspiracy, the film itself seems to have lost all reason. Only the momentum of Stone's storytelling justifies the otherwise inexplicable trail that leads to Shaw.But, boy what storytelling it is. Cleverly using a cast of name actors -- a move that, no doubt, help get the film financed -- Stone gives identities to a huge collection of characters who might otherwise confuse the audience. This also gives credibility to his illusion of historical authenticity. Using the infamous Zapruder film as a centerpiece to his recreation of the assassination, the film takes on the air of a documentary.But it isn't a documentary. Much of his depiction of \"facts\" is discredited theory, crackpot ideas and plain old everyday paranoia. For all of its brilliance, JFK never ties things together into a believable whole. One is apt to leave the film convinced of a conspiracy, but without any real evidence to back up the suspicions.An added irritation provided by Stone's view is that President John Kennedy is ultimately trivialized by the entire enterprise. Despite the title, Kennedy is almost a nonentity in the film. Though Stone suggests that it was Kennedy's supposed intent to pull out of the war in Vietnam that was the motive for his assassination, that all seems like a wild guess on Stone's part rather than an accepted fact. And Kennedy himself, no matter what his worth was as a world leader, a charismatic politician, a pop icon, a family man or a human being, is reduced to being little more than a human target in Stone's little world. I think Kennedy deserves better.",

I do believe that just like this excellent film says there were perhaps other people and things that caused the killing of JFK. I consider myself a very well read historian (especially WWII) and of all of the big events that have happened in history, I am most unsure about the ACTUAL truth about JFK. Just as Oliver Stone says in this overlong film, he has some pretty ridiculous & extremely far-fetched ideas, but he also has some excellent points & just how bad the investigation was & how quickly just 1 man was blamed for the death of the president. It seems very unlikely that Lee Harvey Oswald was solely responsible. It probably isn't true that Cuba had so much involvement into what happened, but it is very interesting that Oswald himself was killed by Jack Ruby before he could speak everything that he might have known. If you are a conspiracy nut and believe everything is a conspiracy well I guess you have to have something to live for & I'm sure you will think that Stone has everything correct in this mostly fictional but very well written and thought out movie. So enjoy this for what it is, but please form your own opinion & actually study the facts. I have a feeling that what had happened had a lot to do w/ JFK's ideas & his dealings with the fiasco that was the bay of pigs & the whole situation with the U.S.S.R & the failed plot to kill Castro & overthrow communism everywhere we felt threatened.",

            "review_title": "Intelligent Summary of WC Critics",
            "content": "Over the years, Americans eventually stopped taking the Warren Commission (and its lone nut theory) too seriously. Magic bullets, eyewitness testimony, and the implausibility of Oswald's ability to fire the shots created reasonable doubt in a skeptical public. These days, people seem more cynical and disillusioned than ever. In general, the 60s were a rough time and America has never really recovered its pre-assassination innocence.Oliver Stone's \"JFK\" reasonably captures the gist of the public's doubt (especially after the 1976 House Select Committee investigation). From the questionable rifle itself (with its uncalibrated scope), to many witnesses having heard shots from the grassy knoll, to the odd behavior of the secret service after the shooting - everything that led critics to doubt the Warren Commission's findings is here in splendid cinematic form.But beyond that, the creators of this fine movie clearly did their homework. New Orleans was a hub of activity just prior to the shooting. Lee was connected to mob boss Marcelo and much of the illicit activity going on in the area. Clearly, he was posing as a pro Cuban communist. But beyond that, there appeared to be a larger axis of some sort. Lee was somehow connected to the CIA, FBI, the mob, and local gun runners. Brilliant David Ferrie and his various associates were certainly involved in some kind of biological weapons program (including Judyth Baker).The creators even competently laid out the overall conspiracy (as far as most investigators have understood it). LBJ was likely a sociopathic maniac who wanted power at all costs, likely an organizer of some sort. It's plausible that he quietly gathered his Texas cronies, CIA elements, FBI and secret service details, and certain mob ties to set up the plot. Sam Giancana, New Orleans mob boss Marcelo, and both Hoover and Alan Dulles were likely in on it, as well. Then you have William Harvey and James Angleton - some of the CIA guys implicated by Howard Hunt.Perhaps the only missing detail here would be Oswald's double agent history (and his supposed romance with Judyth Baker). Presumably, Oswald was part of an abort team that was attempting to stop the assassination. It is said that Oswald had already successfully offered intel about a prior hit attempt in Chicago weeks before Dallas. He was also likely pretending to be part of the plot in order to gain information about it, while really working for proper elements of the CIA. In all likelihood, LHO was possibly a hero attempting to save JFK's life (rather than a nut who ended it).Overall, we may never know. But Lee was certainly not as ignorant as he appeared to be those few days in custody. He knew about the plot (to a degree). He knew they were trying to kill the president. He may even have known some of the hit men. He knew his life was in danger and that the plotters might pin the entire thing on him. I mean, do two officers randomly honk in front of your home (apparently tipping you off) if you aren't aware of something more? Many clues indicate that Oswald was a double agent of some sort (most importantly the second identity he had in his wallet at the time - \"Alek Hiddell\").So, despite leaving out some of the extra detail surrounding Oswald's likely role in all of this (as many now understand it), Oliver Stone's \"JFK\" is exceptional and superb. Nearly every plausible detail and critical issue with the WC is here. We get a really good idea as to what occurred that day in Dallas, even if we may never know the full truth. Black ops, professional hit men, secret service cover up, gathered interests, CIA involvement, you name it.For anyone wanting a very general layout of much of the background info critics have parsed from this incredibly entangled web of secrecy and clandestine scheming, \"JFK\" delivers a very coherent and professional overview of much of the assassination picture, as critics of the WC have come to understand it. And while it is ultimately fictional and generally speculative, the conjecture here is highly plausible and based on a wealth of serious circumstantial evidence that just cannot be ignored. The American public deserved every second of this illuminating movie.",

Of course, if you attempt to take it as history, you run up against what another great writer/director, James Cameron, said: \"Oliver Stone has an interesting philosophy. His view is that history is so f...ed up, it's a consensus hallucination. So he will create an equal but opposite untruth to try to counteract the untruth that we live with. It's a BS theory.\"",

            "content": "One of the most important films. Many will disagree with that, but it's not a statement just about the film itself, it's also about the fact that Oliver Stone had the balls to make this interesting political masterpiece. Anyone with half of a brain knows that the Warren Report was the biggest joke on the American public ever conceived, and Stone decided to rock the house with his theory about the Kennedy assassination. Is all of it true? Of course not, but that is entirely irrelevant. Do you think the magic bullet theory was true? Case closed. Time and time again, the US government has tried to fool us into believing their ridiculous theory to try and cover up the lies...and considering most people truly are stupid, it has worked. Why do you think that the full details are still not to be released for many years? Could it be that by that time, everyone guilty will be dead or the fact that we as a nation won't care as much anymore because it'll be old news? Gee, I wonder. The simple fact that someone put forth a theory about the JFK incident on film for the public to see is extremely important because it made people think, and still does. The people that bash this film because it's \"propaganda\" have entirely missed the point and are the same ones so easily fooled by the government. Beyond that, JFK is an excellent film is all respects. It's about the investigation and the one and only court case that was brought to raise questions about the Warren Report to display the government for what it is, liars and murderers, by New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison. Filled with an excellent cast and directed superbly, JFK raises many questions and still provides classic entertainment. A bit long for some, but most likely for those with a closed mind or those that are afraid to believe anything other than what the government tells us. baaa-baaaa. Carry on sheep people. \"Here's Love Connection, watch this and get fat and stupid, by the way, keep drinking beer you f***ing morons!\" If you know where that came from then you know where I'm coming from. R.I.P.Forgive me for the comparison, but it is much like Dr. Strangelove in that it's not just a film, but one with a political statement. Of course, Dr. Strangelove is a better film and has much more of an important statement, but still, they're similar in that respect. As mentioned previously, the cast is simply excellent and particularly Costner, Pesci and Oldman. Kevin Bacon and Tommy Lee Jones' characters are also humorous and depicted with skill. The cinematography is also something to be admired, and we get a good glimpse of this in the opening sequence. I especially enjoy how all of the scenes are put together, giving us something new at every clip and something different to consider.All in all, a very important film that's worthy of much more recognition, the lack of which is probably due to the ignorant American masses that swallowed the Warren Report in the first place.Incredible and extremely ballsy.",

This is a prime example of a biopic that devises its own criteria for TRUTH and REALITY (2001 has A BEAUTIFUL MIND) but succeeds wildly in its own extravagance.  Today in mid-April 2002 I happened on its re-broadcast on a local TV affiliate and was startled how the sanitized dialogue segments seemed kind of like a badly dubbed Chinese kung fu extravaganza.  The film's power in images is still highly recommendable; go see it on DVD if you're over 18 and fully ready for the script's adult profanities.  It really shouldn't be broadcast without some sort of WARNING label that it is only skewing toward the TRUTH as we mortals can know it.

It should rank with 1984, Brave New world, and Animal Farm as the classics which will stand the test of time, forever. As for the film itself, Stone's work is a masterpiece, there's not a single character out-of-place anywhere in the course of its length.

            "content": "The assassination of President John F. Kennedy in Dallas on November 22, 1963 probably ranks as the darkest day in American 20th century history. What makes it particularly sad is that nowhere near all the details about his murder have ever been released to the public.Before Oliver Stone ever came out with \"JFK\" the movie, few people believed the Warren Commission's claim that Lee Harvey Oswald acted killed Kennedy on his own volition.  There was also a good case to be made that Oswald was nothing more than a patsy in a very devious conspiracy, and that he didn't even do it.  Note that all of this was BEFORE the release of \"JFK.\"  The firestorm of controversy the film created only served to add to the debate.Stone's epic, 205-minute movie, which details the efforts of New Orleans DA Jim Garrison (Kevin Costner) to unravel at least a part of the conspiracy by trying to tie in local business magnate Clay Shaw (Tommy Lee Jones) to it, levels some pretty heavy judgments against those who would cling to the Oswald-did-it-alone-theory.  Not all of the theories that Stone espouses here are believable, but a number of scenarios are raised that could very easily have happened in reality.  Was JFK's murder possibly even an elaborate coup d'etat, a theory raised by Mr. X (Donald Sutherland)?  Was Kennedy actually trying to end the Cold War while in office, putting the military/industrial complex in fear for its very existence?  Would he have halted America's involvement in Vietnam?All the questions and theories get a thorough going-over.  Nobody's going to mistake \"JFK\" for a documentary, to be sure.  And certainly there will always be apologists for the Warren Commission, like Gerald Posner, even as its theories have credibility holes big enough to drive a truck through. But in the end, \"JFK\" is riveting filmmaking pure and simple, well worthy of the Oscars it got for cinematography and editing.  And get a load of the people Stone put into his film: Jack Lemmon, John Candy, Sissy Spacek, Sally Kirkland, Walter Matthau, Kevin Bacon, Ed Asner.With all of this, Stone, like Stanley Kubrick, made a film that started people talking...and one that they're STILL talking about after ten years.

Does Oliver Stone hope that everyone will fall for his version? I doubt it. Does he want people to question things? Yes. He wants you to question the events you heard the first time, whether it was on the news, in a history book, or from word of mouth. And yes, even his own accounting of it. The fact that so many people reacted to it means that there is something more to it than a paragraph in a history book. Was it communists? Was it the mob? CIA? FBI? Even LBJ?!? I don't know.

A reason for me to watch \"J.F.K.\" again - which I have seen a several times before. The 22nd November 1963 was possibly the darkest day in the history of the USA. President John F. Kennedy was killed on his visit in Dallas. Lyndon B. Johnson became the new president on the same day. The Warren Commission was instructed to investigate the case. Their version: it was the act of one single man - Lee Harvey Oswald. Jim Garrison (believable: Kevin Costner), district attorney in New Orleans doesn\u00b4t believe that official theory and decides to reopen the case. Oliver Stones history lesson shows a lot of facts, but it\u00b4s hard to treat them completely. I try to mention some important things that moved me. The first thing was the \"Magic bullet\"-theory. The traces on J.F.K.\u00b4s head showed three bullet-holes. The shots must have hit him from different directions. The explanation of the Warren Commission: it must have been ONE and the same bullet that hit him several times. Unbelievable. Did they think people are so stupid to believe this?Another fact that shocked me was how they falsified the testimonies of the witnesses and destroyed important evidences.  I have read about an inquiry from 1967 which said that 60% didn\u00b4t believe in the correctness of the Warren-report; 44% believed that it was conspiracy. Reasons that make you doubt the credibility of a democratic government. If John F. Kennedy had survived, there would have been no war in Vietnam. He had to die just because he tried to change something...Though its running time of 3 hours, \"J.F.K.\" keeps you at the edge of your seat - especially during the courtroom scene.

            "content": "First of all this is a good movie; very absorbing and an excellent cast. But I am disturbed because of some viewers reaction to the film, not the actual content.  This film and Garrison's views and morals have been questioned from all corners including some of the most outspoken Conspiracy theorists. The film gives time to every hair-brained theory ever dreamed up and everyone (except Garrison) is implicated, (including the Judge, the Jury, LBJ, The Press and even Garrison's own staff).   It covers and glorifies Garrisons persecution of Clay Shaw (who was a real person and was ruined by Garrison) which still today is looked upon with shame in Southern Politics and Law practises. Some of the Assistant DA's on Garrison's staff were so sickened by these events (and others) that they quit law and have since written books to at least try and re-dress the story. So you see, to watch this film and come away with a sense of \"Gee  ain't Jim Garrison great?\" is truly hienous.  Oliver Stone has often commented on the Press's ability to put their own spin on things, but he must have known when researching and making the film that a lot of the \"Evidence\" is so obviously fabricated.  The fact that he has used this to spin  what is a real and very important story in the syle of a documentary is offensive to me. That's what's scary; a film that can make a guilty man innocent, an innocent man guilty and glorify the man responsible in such a convincing way.",

While many important film either fail in one way or another either as a statement or as a piece of fiction this one excels in all facets. Whether or not you agree with Oliver Stone's theories based on the findings of Jim Marrs and Jim Garrison this film should present enough evidence such that one would be left in doubt as to what happened that day in Dallas. The complex web of conspiracy in this film also goes to prove why some people have been so willing to disbelieve conspiracy for so many years: it was just easier that way. As a drama it also works tremendously well the cutting and inserting of images which Stone used for the first time in his film has not been as effectively used by him since. John Williams's score is emotionally stirring and acts as a call to action. All the acting in this film is stupendous and further adds to the overwhelming impact that this film has. No matter what the next major political subject matter any filmmaker decides to tackle it'll be hard to match 'JFK.'",

            "content": "Most of what I had to say about this film has already been captured in other users' comments, some of which are excellent reviews. JFK struck me as being mostly about the virtues of truth, courage, and justice - about how precious truth is and how easy it is for people to cower away from it. Some of the dialogue was spectacular: 1. When Garrison is arguing against the theory that JFK was assassinated by the maffia; 2. When he battles with his wife over the importance of his work in order to make the country a better place in which his children can grow up; and 3. His presentation during the trial. When he kept running the tape over and over showing the president's head exploding, I broke down and cried. I couldn't believe that such an event could have been allowed to occur and how the investigation by the officials of one of the cruelest murders in history could have been so sloppily done.Oliver Stone has been criticized for making an over-statement and for weaving fiction into the facts. I found the film \"In the Name of the Father\" as an appropriate example, unlike JFK, of \"overstatement\" - of how pedantic \"shoving it down your throat\" style weakens rather than strengthens the film's message. The fact that one of the most respected and loved world leaders in history was assassinated and no-one knows by whom and why makes it impossible to over-state the drama. I thought that Stone's \"weaving in fiction\" is poor criticism. In order to make the film interesting, you could not have the camera following Garrison's reading documents. Instead, you must have dialogue. So, Garrison meets the mysterious Mr. X played by Canadian actor Donald Sutherland. It is acceptable, to me, to have the methods in which facts were discovered fictitious as long as the facts themselves are real. And this is what Stone did.The performances, direction, and editing of this spectacle were first rate and made the film intense to the fullest degree. I also liked the fact that the film focused on the greater issues, touching on other assassinations of the time - Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr.. Finally, the fact that the film featured an all-star cast soothed my heart. It was kind of like Hollywood was saying that this atrocity was such a disgrace, \"we're getting our best people to make it known to the world\". \"JFK\" is the second greatest movie ever made (right behind \"Lorenzo's Oil\").

            "content": "Contrary to popular opinion, the problem with Oliver Stone's lengthy tale of the most controversial assassination of the 20th century isn't the fact that he says \"everyone did it\". Frankly, I wouldn't have cared if he implicated Canada, Orochi cultists, or space aliens...*because that's what the story of the assassination is about.* Suspicion. Uncertainty. Paranoia. The idea that it really could've been anyone, anywhere. The powerful, overwhelming belief in a conspiracy, and, just as important, why so many people *wanted* to believe. This would've been a great movie, probably one of the pivotal films of our time, if Stone did nothing more than explore this angle and give ideas...not facts, just ideas...on what the potential conspirators' motives would've been. Why would organized crime put a hit on him? Would Cuba dare perform an act of war on American soil? How could a sitting vice president possibly pull this off and not get caught?Instead, Stone committed a cardinal sin...he let his ego get in the way. He was thoroughly convinced that there was ONE possibility and constructs the entire movie around it, effectively rendering about the first 80% of the movie meaningless. And I really didn't like how the protagonist lawyer quickly became the sole focus in a movie that all but begs for multiple voices and perspectives. The trial of Clay Bertram was such a reach that it was virtually anticlimactic (and I considered this the most interesting part of the movie), and the final verdict will come as no surprise at all.I want a ballsy antihero, I'll watch an Arnold Schwarzenegger movie. JFK should've been *about* JFK. That it wasn't was what where it came up unforgivably short.",

The film actually raises a lot of valid questions, even though there are also factual errors. It should not be entirely regarded as a documentary when its also made to entertain and to exagerate and create fiction to make a point.In general people are not easily persuaded to believe their government would be capable of such horrific acts and consequently are then dismissed as nut cases. That's of course exactly the point to label anyone questioning the official narrative when you have something to hide. I think JFK succeeds in displaying that particular side of the JFK narrative, regardless if the facts presented are actually factual.Anyone should be well aware when your government tries to shut down a narrative, that means someone is on to something that is an inconvenience.Well done movie and definitely worth a watch!",

Which is pretty much 60% of it? At least? And you don't have to look far. But anyway onto the movie...This is really a master work in every way. The directing, the acting, the writing, the plot, the music, the editing, the music, the cast... Everything is top notch. And this bad boy moves. There's never a dull moment in these three hours. It hits the ground running and never stops. The plot just keeps unfolding. And the quick editing helps things overlap so there's nothing hanging in the air. And there's never any suspense or action. The plot and the way it's done is just very exciting.The end speech is really good. And it's very powerful when Costner looks in the camera and says, \"It's up to you.\" Very effective. The style is really cool because it's used to an effect. A lot of the times the style takes over the movie. But it's used to great advantage here.Stone is very good at not appearing one-sided. He of course wants you to come out of this movie thinking what he believes. But he also puts in enough of the other side to not look like he's got an agenda. I don't know if that's his purpose but it works. Stone is a smart guy. I may not agree with him on a lot of things. But he has a good head on his shoulders and he comes at every situation with his own thoughts. He may see them differently than a lot of us but he does his work and knows his stuff. Even if he believes in lies and lies himself. Haha.I feel like this movie is kinda forgotten about today. I guess a good number of people believe it or are angry about it. Which is fair. Since this is responsible for making the conspiracy mainstream. It worked on me as a teenager. But of course I grew older and was capable of making my own choices. And the internet helps. I sure as hell wasn't going to go to a library to fact check this movie.I guess to Stone's credit, if it was intentional, it never says \"based on a true story.\" But I guess he believes every word of it. One thing I realized about conspiracy theories is that people who believe in them believe in more then one. It's like religion where there isn't proof there is faith. And what I always think of is actually from this movie. When the guy says something like, you think all of those different agencies could keep this secret? It's basic but it's very real. It's easy to look at the things that don't make sense. But people usually focus on that instead of what does make sense.",

            "content": "I had never given much thought to the assassination of John F. Kennedy. I am not nor ever have been any kind of conspiracy theorist, though that's not to say that I'm not a skeptic either. I was skeptical of the \"official story\" in the assassination. I suspected there was some kind of conspiracy involved and that Lee Harvey Oswald didn't act alone, but never gave the matter much thought nor did I ever actually go back and look at any of the evidence in the matter.Oliver Stone is different, though. For him, the world shook when shots rang out in Dealey Plaza in Dallas, Texas, on November 22, 1963, and left the youthful, handsome, and charismatic President of the United States dead, the Governor of Texas severely wounded, and the nation in shock. The Warren Commission's official story of what happened that day really bothered Stone. It was a story he found hurried, inadequate, flawed, and highly suspect, like the Commission was desperate to make the facts fit a preconceived notion of one assassin and three shots. It bothered him enough that he made a movie offering, in his words, \"my counter-fiction to the Warren Commission's fiction.\" \"JFK\" isn't supposed to be the definitive end-all explanation of what happened that fateful day but rather is supposed to get us thinking about it again, a task that it achieves with sheer brilliance.Oliver Stone presents us with a unique set of characters: the straight-faced New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison (Kevin Costner), the flamboyant low-life David Ferrie (Joe Pesci), a loudmouth male prostitute (Kevin Bacon), the snobbish businessman Clay Shaw (Tommy Lee Jones), the \"Deep Throat\"-like mystery informant known only as X (Donald Sutherland), and the mysterious Lee Harvey Oswald (Gary Oldman). Except for Bacon and Sutherland's characters, who are composite figures, all the others are based on real people. What Stone is doing, though, is not retelling the story of how Jim Garrison brought forth the only prosecution in the JFK assassination. Even while this movie was in production, Stone was being criticized for making a movie for the purpose of \"vindicating\" the real-life Garrison, who many see as being interested only in his own glory. Stone, however, is not trying to vindicate anybody here. What Stone has done is use the real-life story of Jim Garrison as a jumping-off point to present his case, which is why Stone makes use of information (such as the whereabouts of Oswald right before the assassination) that Garrison did not have in 1969. Stone wants to cast suspicion on the Warren Commission's findings and uses Garrison as his medium to do just that.In that sense, this movie is not really advocating any one theory but rather rejecting the Warren Commission's theory. People have criticized the final theory that Stone puts forth, but in doing so, they have achieved his goal, which is to get the dialogue going again on the JFK assassination. What he presents is not necessarily fact but is rather \"counter-fiction.\" The first half of the film feels very much like a conspiracy theory, where I sat wondering how much of what I was being shown was true. In the scene where Garrison meets with X, where X talks about the question of *why* Kennedy was killed, the reasons put forth bring the conspiracy to the highest levels of the government and somehow manage to sound both outrageous and plausible at the same time. Throughout the movie, Stone uses a variety of film types and both color and black-and-white to present flashbacks and hypothetical scenarios so realistic that they achieve their goal of feeling like they are actual events.The end result is a movie that offers not *the* answer but *an* answer, an answer that rejects the Warren Commission's theory of a lone assassin, with evidence to support it. Now, tons of movies have been made and tons of books have been written offering various answers. But what makes Oliver Stone's \"JFK\" so unique is its storytelling. \"JFK\" is thrilling and mysterious, grabbing us by the collar and leading us step-by-step through the eyes of Jim Garrison through one of the greatest unsolved crimes of the 20th century. At the climax, Stone uses the power of film to its fullest potential, using his own color and black-and-white footage, created with a variety of film types, alongside archived footage (especially the famous Zapruder film) to show his heart-pounding recreation of the assassination, with John William's exhilarating soundtrack playing in the background. It is quite simply one of the the most exciting and heart-pounding scenes I have ever seen in any movie. \"JFK\" won Oscars for Best Cinematography and Best Film Editing and this one scene was enough to win both of those awards. It is a scene that is undoubtedly used in film schools to demonstrate a masterpiece of cinematography and editing.After watching \"JFK,\" I still can't say that I know what happened at Dealey Plaza on November 22, 1963. Did Oswald act alone? Was there a conspiracy? If so, who was involved? How many shots rang out? Was Oswald merely, as he claimed, a \"patsy\"? \"JFK\" asks these questions and wants us to ask them. It wants us to, if not reject, then at least *question* the official account and after watching it, it's impossible not to.",

Kevin Costner is very much on form and so is his support cast most notably, for me at least, Gary Oldman as Lee Harvey Oswald who really excels at showing the different aspects of the character as the film develops.With the director's cut coming in at 3 hrs 18 mins, it may be slightly too long, but with a powerful story line this is not noticed as much as one might expect. Another frequent criticism is that the theories brought forward in the film are unfeasible, however they did not diminish the viewing experience for me and the twist scene, including Donald Sutherland(Yay!) was particularly strong.Perhaps what is most noticeable and memorable is the use of old footage of events and black and white flash backs, both used to great effect throughout the film. As the film draws to a close with Costner's searing monologue, chances are you'll find yourself believing in all that he says.A great movie, worth seeing again and again.

The current (2013) fashion and mania and center stage status of comic book, superhero \"action\" movies packed with special effects and computer generated images (CGI's!) is all about the LACK of good screen writing available to the movie industry, which serves a huge and profitable market (aka the world wide audience reading and willing to pay big money for the distraction from their awful lives provided by a good, entertaining movie), and substitutes video game type psychedelica (both visual and audio images and sounds) to dazzle without the need for mental logic or coherent ideas.Well......good screenplays are hard to come by, always were.The \"JFK\" (1991) screenplay resulted in a wonderful, magnetic, riveting movie packed with long, long, long compelling monologues delivered by wonderful, verbally capable actors (Kevin Costner, Donald Sutherland, others) which \"action heroes\" of fame and note (e.g. Clint Eastwood, bless him) could never have, and will never deliver.Clint, even in his 80's, can jump out of windows and slug bad guys, but he can't provide articulate, sustained intelligent long, long monologues filled with polysyllabic words and complex but logical ideas which go on and and on and on..and keep us all on the edge of our seats, and make us grateful we were lucky enough to see a great movie with almost NO \"action\" and visual crutches the \"no ideas\" \"silent super hero\" movies based on Marvel Comics types shove at us in current times (2013).Only well educated and articulate actors can \"talk the talk\" and present long, intelligent arguments, and \"JFK\" (1991) does that well, to it's credit.For those who don't know, \"JFK\" (1991) is a Kennedy assassination conspiracy movie based on Jim Garrison's assertions, legal actions, and book with help from yet another Kennedy assassination conspiracy book..What the brilliant Oliver Stone and his co-authors have done is simple and wonderful.They have taken a \"single issue\" argument and \"cause\" well known to the public and famous everywhere, and made a movie consisting of long, long monologues presenting in logical and articulate detail various related arguments in such zealous detail, any lawyer advocate of ability would be dazzled.And dazzled we, the audience, are....by this movie and it's simple device......logical long monologues presented by well equipped (for monologues) actors which are implicitly dramatic and appealing.\"Single issue\" causes (such as the Kennedy assassination conspiracy arguments) are dramatic and satisfying.They provide the audience with a good time for the same reason a good football game provides good times to onlookers.Logic, oddly, has very little to do with it all.\"Single issue\" causes not seriously challenged or contradicted (the case in \"JFK\" 1991) SEEM logical and deliver a delicious satisfaction to the audience.This has nothing to do with whether or not the \"cause\" presented is worthy or whether the conclusions advocated are accurate and true.It's all about the psychological satisfaction of hearing a good one sided case well presented which we've all heard about before, and can never know about completely....nobody can for most famous \"single issue\" causes of fame.And there are many, many, MANY \"single issue causes\" of fame over history which could ALSO be presented in movie form using the techniques of screen writing used in \"JFK\" (1991), which would make incredibly successful and satisfying movies (again, let us emphasize that logic has little to do with emotional and mental satisfaction...a good \"single issue\" movie filled with monologues must avoid on-screen challenges to the case it presents....the fact it's one sided is what will make it a successful movie!Richard Hofstader's brilliant book titled \"The Paranoid Style In American Politics\" (1952 Harvard U. Press) discusses the fame and success of single issue causes. Hofstadter states, rightly, that single cause writing (which the \"JFK\" 1991 screenplay definitely is) is successful due to \"the fierce logic of the one-idea mind, the firm conviction that complex social issues can be unraveled to the last point, that social problems can really be solved, and solved by simple means.\" The back up materials which can feed a movie screenplay of the \"JFK\" (1991) type are copious and available almost in tidal wave proportions.What is Hollywood waiting for? It's time for more \"single issue causes\" movies with many long, long monologues delivered by good actors......The movie makers will get rich, and the lucky audiences will be endlessly satisfied!.------------ Tex (David) Allen is a retired SAG-AFTRA movie actor who taught movie history 5 years in Baltimore MD USA area colleges from 2004-2009.",

Connally said he heard 4-5 shots, and that he heard them from ahead of the car, from the Grassy Knoll area.He also said he did not believe that that Oswald was guilty but rather was a patsy set up by other conspirators who killed JFK.JFK, as a film, is brilliant, and along with my personal experience, is persuasive on the facts.A great film.

American Shadow President Jack Kennedy was introduced to me as Executive Officer Kennedy of the US Navy. I knew from my Honors BA in History that Executive Officer is another name for the President. I said to Jack \"Its an Honor to meet you Sir\" and he smiled at me.In the fall of 2005 British Intelligence briefed me that there would be a silent spring in 2006 hinting that drastic steps would be taken to stop Global Warming involving the deaths of Billions. As the American Shadow Vice President I did not sign this plan involving the deaths of billions and that may have pleased JFK. The Permanent Members of the United Nations Security Council all voted for the plan that the creators of Humans ordered. It is probable that no one on Earth can stop the plan now that is set to begin during the total eclipse of the sun that is happening on March 29 Eastern Standard time although it will not be visible in North America. I still advise Americans, the British and Canadians to buy several years worth of food and water and to buy surgical masks or any white masks that you can get. There are apparently 4 plagues/ super flus being released. It may take several months before any one notices the outbreaks so do not label me a crackpot when everything still looks fine the day after the Solar Eclipse.

            "content": "One of my favorite real mystery thrillers about who actually shot President John F. Kennedy. Oliver Stone directed this wonderfully crafted and creative look about the long list of suspects involved on that day back in November of 1963. Kevin Costner plays real life district attorney Jim Garrison who heads his own investigation into finding what the reason was for murdering the great President and who really did it, was it really Lee Harvey Oswald?, or was it the mafia, CIA, Russians, Cubans or our own US Government? We might never know, but as American people, we demand the truth. Gary Oldman plays Lee Harvey Oswald excellently, it's almost as if the real Oswald was 'resurrected' sort of speak, I was amazed on how much similarity there was between Oldman and Oswald. Tommy Lee Jones (who recieved a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination) plays the New Orleans openly gay albino Clay Shaw who is also accused of ploting to kill Kennedy while Joe Pesci turns in a fine role as the crazy David Ferrie who also seems to be involved. The film includes an all-star cast including Sissy Spacek, Laurie Metcalf, Michael Rooker, Wayne Knight, Pruitt Taylor Vince, Jay O. Sanders and Vincent D'Onofrio as well as surprising and effective five to ten minute cameos by Kevin Bacon, John Candy, Edward Asner, Sally Kirkland, Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau, Donald Sutherland and Brian Doyle Murray who also turns in an excellent role as night club owner Jack Ruby, the notorious man who eventually murdered Oswald. Although I wasn't alive when Kennedy was shot, I enjoyed the film because it gives people who weren't around hope and dignity to find the truth. As a result of this film, Congress passed documents that such case files as the assasination of JFK could be avialible to the American public in the year 2029. Every time I watch this film, I can see the heartbreak and tragedy of the American people who watched a great leader like JFK being shot, but maybe one day, the real truth will be out and I think that is something that JFK would want the American people to know.",

And most importantly of all, Stone captures that period of time so well. He captures Dallas in all its corrupt mid-60s glory. He captures the atmosphere of criminal-ridden New Orleans. He captures the urgency of the 60s, and the craziness that era produced. But what he does best is present a film that is at once a fascinating mystery and a terrifying \"what-if\" tale. I would even go so far as to say that this is the pinnacle achievement in modern \"noir\" films - featuring a dogged investigator, his harried staff, and a group of shadowy criminals.

We have Donald Sutherland as X, Tommy Lee Jones as Clay Shaw, Joe Pesci (in a frightening wig) and my personal favourite Gary Oldman as Lee Harvey Oswald (fantastic performance). Every one is working at their best, and that includes Stone, he was clearly very passionate about putting his views forward to the public, and he argues a very persuasive case.

People really can't keep their mouths shut for 10 minutes; but we are to believe that all these people were involved, and all of them kept quiet, all these years. Kevin Costner turns in one of his dull as watching paint dry performances. Sissy Spacek gives the only believable performance, and her character is totally useless.

They all feel the need to state that they personally do not believe there was a conspiracy. A sympathy shared by the rest of the country apparently, since no new investigations have occurred since Jim garrison lost his case against clay shaw. From what I understand, president Kennedy was a good man, one of the few US-presidents who tried to do right by his people. And yet, decades after he was murdered under circumstances that a four-year-old would have found suspicious, they still favor ignorance over common sense. This man may have forfeited his life to help his fellow Americans, who apparently didn't care enough to dig deeper. See no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil.

            "content": "I was fourteen or fifteen when I first saw JFK, and its passion gave me a passion not just for the assassination conspiracy but for history in general.  I'm now writing my dissertation on Kennedy as part of my history degree and there was an irony in seeing the film again - the film that had got me interested in the first place - because I couldn't help finding fault with some of its conclusions.JFK argues that Kennedy was killed because he had wanted to pull America out of Vietnam and ease relations with the Soviet Union, something that the military-industrial complex simply wouldn't allow.  It was this idea that I had problems with because it was Kennedy who had sent over 15,000 American troops to Vietnam, and who may have provoked the Cuban Missile Crisis because of overt and covert moves against Castro.  I was worried that this would ruin the movie, but historians argue so endlessly and I've changed my own mind so often that I just ignored the would-be niggles.  Besides, if the facts don't necessarily support this idea of Kennedy now, it was undoubtedly the perception at the time so may well have been the motive behind the assassination.There are further problems that pedantic historians have complained about; a number of composite or fictional characters, genuine testimony transplanted to fictional locations, and the use of both real and recreated archive footage combine to undermine its credibility.  These, too, can be forgiven because JFK has a responsibility not just to provide facts, but to provide a coherent narrative, and it would have been impossible to have uncovered every word that was spoken during the Garrison investigation or kept them in their original context.  A degree of manipulation and invention was necessary.  Without these compromises, JFK would have lost much of its atmosphere and been a far weaker film, so I was happy to let them pass.Even with these criticisms, JFK remains a masterpiece, by far the best film from occasional genius Oliver Stone.  I can't think of any movie that has the same sense of urgency, of outrage and passion, and such determination to convince.  Adapted from two books, the screenplay is perfect and is testament to Stone's skill that he could take the masses of evidence and turn it into a coherent script, with co-writer Zachary Sklar.  Following District Attorney Jim Garrison, the only man to ever bring a suspect to trial in the murder of the President, the film is utterly convincing in its criticisms of the Warren Commission Report and in its presentation of the conspiracy behind the assassination.It boasts perhaps the greatest ever ensemble cast, including Kevin Costner, Tommy Lee Jones, Kevin Bacon, Joe Pesci, Walter Matthau, Sissy Spacek, Laurie Metcalf, Ed Asner, Jack Lemmon, Gary Oldman, Brian Doyle-Murray, Wayne Knight, John Candy, Donald Sutherland, Bob Gunton and Jim Garrison himself.  The last name, in the role of Earl Warren, should prove that, contrary to popular belief, Stone has a fine understanding of irony.  The weakest link in the stunning cast is Costner, but he gives his best performance in the lead role and manages to avoid his wooden delivery for most of the mammoth running time.  Even when he stumbles, he carries the movie perfectly.His performance is certainly enough to make the final forty-five minute courtroom scene the greatest and most electrifying I've ever seen.  We are bombarded with evidence of the conspiracy, of the Warren Commission cover-up, of the convenient deaths of witnesses and critics, and are shown the notorious `magic bullet' theory and the terrible footage taken by Abraham Zapruder.Within his air of excitement at revealing the conspiracy and his determination to find his truth, Stone never forgets the truth that everyone can agree on; that Kennedy was not just a President, but a man, who was murdered as his wife sat next to him.  Whether you believe the Kennedy legacy or not, it is a hard heart that doesn't break to see the final bullet strike him, to see his wife reach out across the boot of the car to rescue the debris, and to see his young son salute his father's coffin as it passes.  The respectful tone that is taken throughout is perfect.Historians should be grateful to Oliver Stone for bringing history to a wider audience, one that a documentary simply would not have reached.  Its flaws are necessary to this end, and when Stone himself talks of his film in terms of a counter-myth, you realise he was not merely in search of the truth, but in search of other people who seek the same; this should be the only starting point.  JFK is a film that should make you angry and make you ask more.  For me, at least, it did both.",

It covers a single tragedy effecting the United States that is only surpassed by the events on 9/11/2001. I am surprised when this movie is compared to \"Nixon\", because this movie is far and away superior to Mr. Stone's \"Nixon\" in every area.I was only a fifth grader when this event took place, but became more interested as I learned about the lack of integrity in government and the media in reporting history, as well as, the plans JFK had to reform the corruption in the \"intelligence\" agencies, while restoring integrity to the United States in many areas. I may not agree with JFK's view of the United Nations, but find I do agree or at least understand his decision making based on what was known at the time, and believe his decisions were made in the best interest of the citizens as opposed to the crony capitalists who replaced him, and created our current morally and financially bankrupt state run by banks and global elitists.Unfortunately, studying the JFK assassination beyond this movie leads you down an unending \"rabbit hole\" of new evidence that confirms a conspiracy, but never provides a clear picture of everything that happened regarding the actual assassination details. There are numerous possibilities for sniper sites, exotic technical details, and unexplained significant details. This makes focusing on the only trial of the assassination conspirators pure genius.The story's focus is on Jim Garrison, New Orleans District Attorney, and his legitimate concern and investigation of the assassination conspirators who had recently resided in New Orleans. It also shows that he completely underestimated the power and resources of those opposing his investigation.He first believes that the Warren Commission and FBI will do an adequate job of investigating the assassination, but finds that the results were either a cover-up or completely incompetent. He begins his investigation three years late due to his trust in the federal agencies based on his experience as a former FBI agent and military officer. He also tries to maintain a low profile until the investigation is completed, and does not question Jack Ruby (Rubinstein) before Ruby takes his information to the grave.It is a story of a heroic effort to find and face the truth, and to prosecute the guilty while being undermined at every step by the media and federal government. Once Mr. Garrison questions Clay Shaw and finds that he is also \"Clay Bertrand\", both elimination of witnesses and a multi-media campaign kick off to derail his investigation and case against Clay Shaw (the only local conspirator left alive).Jim Garrison received little cooperation from the feds, but was able to obtain a near original version of the Zapruder film from Time-Life, and present a case that exposed a conspiracy, even if he could not convict Clay Shaw. Shaw was dead by 1974. One point that was not covered was why the Texas Attorney General or Dallas District Attorney had not done a better job of investigating the assassinations of JFK and Oswald. It is now known that Shaw was a OSI and CIA operative and that the Zapruder film has been altered within a few days of being purchased by Time-Life, a CIA contractor. It is also interesting to note that there is no evidence that Lee Harvey Oswald even touched any rifle on Nov. 22, 1963, so explaining how he was even suspected for the assassination and who provided the police a description are still a mysteries.Although the movie does not cover all the reasons that President Kennedy was gunned down, it does present most related to his clash with the CIA and the military industrial complex. It also presents a clearer picture of what actually is known about what happened at Dealey Plaza in Dallas including the crowd reaction toward the fence on the \"grassy knoll\", and the complete removal of all the usual and expected protection by the Secret Service and the undercover military units that would have reduced the chance of assassination by rifle shot to near zero.The fact that the movie resulted in more records being released and declassified is a tribute to the impact of this \"must see\" project. The DVD extras are also valuable presentations.",

            "content": "The best thing about \"JFK\" is that, in spite of containing a ton of information, unfolding at a fairly slow pace, and being very long (the director's cut is 206 minutes), it still manages to be amazingly entertaining throughout. I don't know why - it could be because it is such a universal subject for Americans, but it could also be because its such a well-made film. Of course, it's probably a little bit of both.\nThe cinematography, editing (Academy Award winners in those categories), direction, pacing, writing, acting, music, everything just weaves together so beautifully in this movie. Everything present within \"JFK\" has meaning, and, thus, its entertaining to watch the entire thing, because you see and hear new things with just about every shot. It all builds up to the last courtroom scene, which is one of the finest bits of movie making I've ever seen. Ultimately, this final scene shows how important the movie is: Oliver Stone is trying to say that Kennedy's assassination (and subsequent cover-up) meant a lot more than the President's death. He also handled these parts so well that it didn't sound preachy or heavy-handed, it just sounds like the genuine truth.Put simply, this is an exhilarating movie. It's also a film that could make a person think about things they probably didn't spend much time on before. For that reason, \"JFK\" is highly recommended.",

            "content": "Saw this film last week and was very impressed with it.From Costner's performance as Jim Garrison to a stellar supporting cast of such greats as Tommy Lee Jones, Joe Pesci, Kevin Bacon, Gary Oldman, Donald Sutherland, Ed Asner, Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau, John Candy (in a rare serious role), Sissy Spacek, etc. All brilliant stuff!! I know Oliver Stone can be a controversial figure but I just think this film ran like a well-oiled machine. It was super-long and yet I didn't feel bored or tired. It sucked me right in. From Robert Richardson's cinematography (which won an Oscar) to the brilliant editing (also won an Oscar) it ran like clockwork. I love the documentary style of filming that Stone employed here. You have clear cinematography interspersed with grainy cinematography, you've got real live footage mixed in with the actors, you've got flashbacks and present day, you've got newspaper clippings and slow-motion shots. Heck, you've got every single film technique employed here and it all works! Plus you've got multiple stories running simultaneously. Love this stuff! You feel like you're right there in the thick of things.Plus this film points out what many people suspected for years and still do - that the JFK assassination was indeed a conspiracy and not the work of some lone gunman. Heck, my parents always maintained it was Krushchev. Others say it was Castro or the mob. Stone (or at least the Jim Garrison character that Costner plays) says it was our own government and the war-profiteering big shots in Washington (perhaps even LBJ himself). JFK was going to end the Vietnam War. So he had to be killed. Same with RFK. Obviously the conspiracies differ - but one thing that most seem to agree on is that it was not the work of a lone gunman named Lee Harvey Oswald. A conspiracy did exist. The Warren Commission Report was indeed very sketchy, to say the least. I'm inclined to believe this as well.When it comes to Stone's films I thought PLATOON was merely okay. Nothing special. Same thing with WALL STREET. I found W. somewhat amusing - probably because of its satirical approach. Josh Brolin was pretty good as Dubya but Dick Dreyfuss was a real hoot as Dick Cheney! Alexander was crap! But JFK is the first Stone film that I'd say was really very good. I am now looking forward to NIXON with Anthony Hopkins. Stone describes JFK as a labor of love (and it shows in the execution) and calls it his GODFATHER. He says NIXON is his GODFATHER II. So I'm looking forward to it. Might need to check out SALVADOR at some point too.By the way, the version I saw was JFK: THE DIRECTOR'S CUT. Haven't seen any other versions so I don't know what the differences are.P.S. I forgot to mention the score by John Williams. Amazing piece!! Very atmospheric and effective - both the main theme and the conspiratorial theme.",

            "content": "Oliver Stone's 'JFK' is quite simply put, a spectacular film. It is a film about one of the most enigmatic mysteries in American history, and is about courage, honor, and the American government. 'JFK' is a superbly well made picture, with powerful direction, top notch acting, and great visuals. On the fateful day of November 22, 1963 president John F. Kennedy is shot in his motorcade and dies of the wounds half an hour later. One of the many viewers of the news is Jim Garrison (Kevin Costner), a D.A. for New Orleans. Upon hearing it, he is saddened.. he is a patriot and was an admirer of Kennedy. At first, he starts out by checking an anonymous tip, a strange man named David Ferrie (Joe Pesci) who is later discovered to have a much bigger role in the assassination then appears. After disbelieving Ferrie's alibi of what he was doing in Dallas on the day, he sends him to the FBI who release him without finding anything suspicious. But it is not until three years later when Garrison gets much deeper into the case, noticing some odd and embarrassing things about the Warren Report on the trial involving the case. He takes one of his employees, the trustworthy Lou Ivon, with him on a tour, pointing out odds and ends about Kennedy being shot from the book suppository by the obscure Lee Harvey Oswald (Gary Oldman). This starts off Garrison's initial doubts which increase as he investigates more and more into the case. Along with him for the investigation is the short tempered and tough Bill Broussard (Michael Rooker), the informative Suize Cox (Laurie Metcalf) and the hard working Al Oser (Gary Grubbs) and Numa Bertel (Wayne Knight). During his investigation, Garrison meets several strange characters.. a wild homosexual prostitute Willie O' Keefe (Kevin Bacon), the cunning Clay Shaw/ Bertrand (Tommy Lee Jones), a paranoid man named Jack Martin (Jack Lemmon), and a stranger, \"X\" (Donald Sutherland), who gives Garrison just the right motivation and strength to carry on Also watch out for smaller roles from people such as Ed Asner, Vincent D'Onofrio, and Walter Matthau. Also adding to Garrison's troubles is his skeptical wife, Liz (Sissy Spacek), who just wants him to take care of his family rather than lose himself in a case that happened three years ago. The chemistry between the actors is kinetic and downright superb, Costner's interactions with characters like Ferrie and O' Keefe work out exceptionally, and there are plenty of quotable moments of dialogue to go along with these scenes. Oliver Stone has always been a great director of actors, and this film is no exception. Each actor sinks into their role, especially Gary Oldman as Lee Harvey Oswald, he looks incredibly like the man. Joe Pesci is scene stealing as the jumpy and constantly paranoid David Ferrie, and gives a great energetic performance, most notably during a scene between him, Garrison, Ivon, and Broussard in which he gives a sharp and twisted monologue. The performances are also emotional as well, watch Garrison as he gives his case to the jury at the end of the film, his voice gets more and more emotional. These characters aren't just built from the actors though, and the screenplay by Oliver Stone and Zachary Sklar deserves heavy mention. Stone isn't just a director, he has numerous screenplay credits to himself as well ('Scarface', 'Evita'), and writing is something he's definitely talented at. Him and Sklar not only provide intense scenes filled with suspense and emotion, but also just gripping dialogue. Whether it be Garrison giving his thoughts on the depth of the case, or X giving valuable support to the investigator, the lines are just right, and the film also manages to be quite quotable. But these two stand out elements aren't the only good things to say about 'JFK'. The film is fantastic to look at. The cinematography by frequent Stone collaborator Robert Richardson ('Casino', 'Kill Bill') is dazzling (not to mention Oscar winning), the intense brightness he constantly uses works out great, as does the periodic flashbacks to black and white. Also very much worthy of mention is the (Oscar winning) editing by Joe Hutshing ('Born on the Fourth of July', 'Broken Arrow') and Pietro Scalia ('Good Will Hunting', 'Black Hawk Down'). The flashbacks are timed perfectly, and each piece fits just right, whether it be showing what Oswald was allegedly doing as Garrison narrates his case or the interactions of Clay Shaw and David Ferrie. The pacing is spot on, while the film has a high running time, it never gets drudging and never loses its energy. One of the best movie composers around, John Williams, gives an emotional and haunting score to the film, and it only adds more power to the scenes. And, it is impossible not to mention the unforgettable direction of Oliver Stone. He's quite possibly the greatest living director, and this film is proof enough. The story of 'JFK' could be told like a History channel documentary, but it is not. Instead, these historical events are made gripping and interesting, all by Stone's eye. He's been called heavy handed before, but without his hard edged punch, the film wouldn't be half as interesting. He directs with intellect yet a genuine passion, balancing out what's needed just right. I take no trouble in saying that 'JFK' is definitely one of the best three directed films ever. But is this tale of Jim Garrison merely entertaining? Most definitely not. It is an eye opener first and foremost, and rouses emotions from the viewer. It is a gripping morality tale.. one of courage and honor, and one of a man who would never give up no matter what the odds, and in the end his struggle proved well worth it. One should not take everything in 'JFK' for granted. While the film definitely uses quite a bit of facts, it still is only one view of the events. Some have said Oliver Stone is trying to shove his opinion down our throats. This isn't true, Stone is throwing out a question, a question that shouldn't have been forgotten, and he is giving his answers. But don't take just his. As Jim Garrison turns and  says as he speaks to the camera in one of the most memorable scenes in film history ... Its up to you.",

However, when considering the magnitude of cover-ups, lies, related killings and the subsequent coup, what could be less rational than believing the corporate media's presentation of the 'single bullet' theory? Actually, I did see the magic bullet theory in action once. It was during an episode of one of the Looney Tunes cartoons. The bullet, which had a mustache and a hat, stopped completely in mid-air, looked around for the new direction of the intended target, made a right-angle turn, then continued in pursuit at full speed. While that did not necessarily vindicate Arlen Specter and the Warren Commission, it provided a humorous look at their incredible insult to the intelligence of the American people.

I know it's a little strange on 4th of July to watch this film about the corruption of the government, but this is a must see for any generation.This is absolutely a legit film, it's 3 hours long, but I never can get my eyes off of it. It's so well-directed, from the intro to the finale, just perfect. It starts with introducing John F Kennedy and the events that has happened up to the day he's getting shot, like Argo that gives a summary of the Persian history, then killing of the president and its investigation by Jim Garrison and his team, which it all leads up to revealing big controversy theories about the president's death . Oliver Stone has done such a wonderful job here; it's so obvious how much efforts he has put to tell this story accurately and truthfully. The chaos among the people, the chaos at the shooting scene, recreating the shooting scene, the flashbacks, all these are being shown so perfectly and the evidence of his hard work - I was reading that they spent $70,000 at that time just to recreate the JFK's office precisely, which only has 8seconds in the whole movie. Another great aspect of the film is whenever there's flashbacks to the shooting day, the flashbacks aren't repetitive footages, and flashbacks of the other characters are believable, in my opinion it comes from the great cast who all bring great performances, the cinematography, the editing, and even the dark dramatic soundtrack, when these flashback come on the screen, you feel being there. The screenplay has great, strong dialogues, in fact this film is filled with a lot of dialogues and narration, but these are interesting dialogues that you don't want to miss, a lot of information and materials are being exchanged among characters, and I mean a lot. I seriously don't need to mention anything about the cast, the list says it all and none of them disappoints. I should mention that Kevin Costner has such a critical role here because you need to be convinced he's doing all these investigation for his country and future generation, and I'm not a big fan of his, but he seriously has nailed it here, I really like his performance here when his character is facing the frustration and difficulties and risking everything to reveal the truth to everyone.This is one of my favorite films of all time, I give it 10/10, and happy 4th of July.",

            "content": "When Oliver Stone sat down to write and direct this picture, given that 95% of the data contained within was available in numerous books since the '60s and '70s, he must have expected the typically dismissive reaction those paperback treatises had largely received.Instead, all Hell broke loose.Not since the jaw-droppingly racist epic THE BIRTH OF A NATION seventy-six years earlier had a movie received such a startlingly prickly response or would become such a controversy.Based rather loosely on New Orleans district attorney Jim Garrison's prosecution of local businessman Clay Shaw regarding Shaw's alleged complicity in setting up Lee Harvey Oswald in the 1963 JFK assassination (\"loosely\" because the investigation and trial is used as a format for presenting data uncovered in some cases by other investigators and at a later date) the picture is a mesmerizingly rich montage of fact and educated theory, Stone's quick-cuts editing style then highly unusual (though now used incessantly in movies about absolutely nothing) and evocative. He does an impressive job of communicating a massive amount of information to the audience in only about three hours. But it's exactly Stone's cinematic skill which caused \"JFK\" to explode into reviled critical consciousness in a manner all those assassination books never would, could or did.Any honest student of the assassination won't be stunned by the content. But the media and governmental over-reactive upsurge against the movie was almost more damning that the movie itself.Even today, nearly two decades after the film was released, it's astounding how infamous it remains. Also astounding is how the LoneNut/Oswald-did-it mindset continues to hold on. If one checks out the numerous assassination Internet websites, for example, they are nearly all stalwart defenders of the Warren Commission, some surfacely affecting objectivity, some rabidly direct --- they are essentially the cyber version of Gerald Posner's 1993 \"Case Closed\", once called \"the most dishonest book ever written\" and a literary response to Stone's movie. \"Case Closed\" (and those websites) clearly know the data: they go into great, intricate detail in an effort to meticulously deconstruct all of the pro-conspiracy material.... only they deconstruct falsely. As anyone who knows the material will quickly realize. But, to the uninitiated, such sites' endless, 24/7 \"debunking\" (a favorite phrase by the fervent and on-message-beyond-belief LoneNut bloggers who haunt the Internet) of the conspiracy can appear quite convincing, just as these more casual audiences are so easily fooled by the authoritative yet selectively sloppy Untruths of Peter Jennings' 40th Anniversary Special for ABC in 2003 or (that other Stone's) \"Oswald's Ghost.\" The eternal rationalizations, the endless manipulations from the pro-Warren Commission crowd. The unending assertions of, \"Oh, I use to be a conspiracy believer, too, until I learned that.... ,\" and the ubiquitous world-weary faux tones of, \"Let's just finally get this behind us, people. If you would read the superb and painstaking investigation by ...... then, you would know that this was all concretely disproved years ago when.....\" On and on and on.Apparently, the only massive conspiracy this seething, vitriolic army of LoneNutters finds credible is that countless otherwise unconnected witnesses --- even those first-hand witnesses from Dealey Plaza! --- all somehow colluded in their shameless efforts to clear Oswald, frame the CIA, or just to frame faceless gunman in the trees behind the picket fence. All for money or attention or to achieve some other unspecified spineless agendum.At this late date, however, with nearly all of the conspirators presumably long gone (and ~75% of the American public still convinced of the conspiracy, as they have been since the '60s) why is maintaining The Lie so important in some corners? As clearly it is. It has, after all, been nearly half a century since Kennedy died on the streets of Dallas.Perhaps because the dynamic behind the assassination of the 35th president (or the dynamic behind misrepresenting it) is still essentially in place. 'The Secret State' is an awfully mysterious phrase, but it simply reflects large corporate business interests and those interests' determined defense of their rights to circumvent our democratic processes at every possible turn... Up until the recent near-Depressional economic downturn, the national news media (generally in bed with the same corporations) wouldn't even fleetingly address arguably the most pressing issue of our time: corporate corruption and Big Business's stranglehold on all levels of our government. And even now, such coverage is superficial and grudging at best.So when famed Watergate burglar E Howard Hunt's 2004 handwritten and audio-taped confession of personal and CIA/LBJ involvement in JFK's murder can't even receive coverage in the national media decades after the event, where are we still? It seems there is no pro-conspiracy revelation, no matter how dramatic and credible, which can receive coverage. And no anti-conspiracy evidence, no matter how flimsy and contrived, which can't.Many detractors have sneered that it's dreadful that millions of youngsters perceive the JFK assassination thru the \"distorted lens\" of Oliver Stone. But I say, \"Thank goodness for Oliver.\"",

It seems clear that Oliver Stone wanted to sell a story about \"backyard of US politics\", after the famous \"Gladio scandal\" came out in Italy in 1990. The audience was ready for it!Let's remember the facts: John Fitzgerald Kennedy had serious diseases, he never stood up on his feet without medicines, he was in an affair with Marilyn Monroe, he did not have a good relationship with his wife. In the special \"freedom\" atmosphere of 1960s, Kennedy was shown as a \"dynamic president\" and \"a great husband\", but no, it was just a media illusion. Sadly, Kennedy was not even an \"anti-war politician\". The honest historians write what's happened in 1960s: The Vietnam War was initiated by Kennedy administration. But in \"JFK\" movie, it is said that Kennedy was murdered because he did not want to enter Vietnam. Another fact is that Cuba was attacked and blockaded by Kennedy administration. Kennedy did nothing good for Cuba. Bertrand Russell, who was not a communist/Marxist/Bolshevik, by having a neutral perspective about US-Soviet conflicts, said that Kennedy was \"a crazy politician who loves war\". The same Russell thanked Soviet Union on behalf of humanity for its prudent approach to the Cuban crisis. But in \"JFK\" movie, it is said that everyone says lies to Kennedy about Cuba and Kennedy is actually a peaceful man, \"the true guilties\" are CIA and The Mafia.\"JFK\" movie, is a show with tricks, trying to show Kennedy a \"peaceful politician\" and claming that he died for democracy and people's freedom. In the final court scene, Oliver Stone shows us African-Americans with their tearful eyes, claming that \"peaceful\" Kennedy was their \"friend\". That's called \"histrionics\".But what makes this movie great? If you completely forget about the historical facts and watch this \"alternative story\", you'll see that Oliver Stone really manages to tell it so believable. It has an absolutely terrific editing, shot-on-set videos intertwined with real footages from 1963. Stone creates a tense atmosphere throughout the film. This \"alternative story\" never goes wrong even in a single scene. It flows fluently and confidently for three hours. Those are a matter of talent. Every director cannot make that. The film has a great cast, too. Even without criticising Kennedys, it is still interesting to see \"backyard of US politics\".This movie is a \"must-see\", but it should not be considered as \"reality\". In 2023, next year, when the files will be opened to the public, we hope to learn why Kennedy was murdered.",

For those of us who lived through those times, the movie also vividly captures the prevailing mood, including rabid anti-communists who thought JFK was a sellout to the reds and were glad he was shot. Having Garrison as a passive TV viewer while three assassinations took place--JFK, Dr. King, and RFK--was a vivid reminder to me of the bad old days.There were also two really wonderful performances--Joe Pesci as David Ferrie and Tommy Lee Jones as Clay Shaw--and good work too by Kevin Bacon. I found Kevin Costner to be wooden in the lead performance. Sissy Spacek had a thankless role as Garrison's wife, causing the film to stop dead while they had marital arguments.The big problem with the movie is the proliferation of conspirators. They keep piling up as the movie moves along, until, during Garrison's summation, I understood the judge's reaction--slumping in his chair and rolling his eyes. Everyone, it seems, was suspect--the CIA, the FBI, the military, war profiteeers, the Mafia, anti-Castro activists, the media, possibly even LBJ.Some conspiracy. Where did all these people hold their meetings? Why wasn't I invited? Seems like everyone else in America was.But the assassination of JFK is nothing to joke about. At the time, one of the most painful facts about the event for many of us was that our president, and a fine man he was, could be taken down by a lone-wolf creep like Oswald. It would have been such a relief if we could have believed in some vast conspiracy instead. At least the killing would have made some sense.",

As a Canadian, I witness right-wing US political shenanigans like the recent Presidential election, and it's the same old stuff. It's been said that a country incapable of scandal is like a body incapable of pain, or a mind incapable of guilt.

It is not at all clear he succeeds, though, even though his film is great entertainment and a viable \"counter myth.

The past, the present and even the future are there, in slow motion, in home video, in black and white, in color and in any other disposition.The script is a collection of all and every single conspiracy theory ever proposed on the subject. There are countless people telling their story, and there are countless versions of the same truth - or lie. The viewer is walked through a whole exposition of different angles, different bits and pieces and different people. No one is left aside, be it an outstanding member of society or not.The acting talent assembled for this movie is just incredible. Kevin Costner, Jay Sanders, Gary Oldman, Michael Rooker, Laurie Metcalf, Joe Pesci, Tommy Lee Jones, Kevin Bacon, and the list goes on and on. But above all - the biggest actor - is the TV.JFK. Big. 20/10.",

            "content": "As much as I could gather, according to Oliver Stone in this movie, the assassination of JFK (as well as RFK and MLK) seems to have been carried out by a conspiratorial network consisting of people drawn from:a) disgruntled right-wing extremists in this country; b) fanatical Cuban nationalist mercenaries; c) the FBI; d) the CIA; e) the Dallas police department; f) the more secret echelons of the conventional military; g) members of Kennedy's cabinet, including then Vice President Lyndon Johnson; h) organized crime; and i) Big Business.The reasons for the assassination include (but aren't limited to):a) punishment for Kennedy's backing out during the Bay of Pigs; b) Kennedy being soft overall on Communism, and c) being too tough on organized crime; d) his perceived desire to ratchet down the cold war, including e) his plan to end US involvement in Viet Nam, which would in turn f) deprive the military of a much desired war and concomitant inflated military budget, which would then in turn g) deprive Big Business of lucrative military contracts.Lee Harvey Oswald is portrayed as a CIA operative who was only peripherally involved in the plot, but was then used by the masterminds as the \"patsy.\" Oswald was particularly attractive for this role because, as part of earlier operations, he had developed a pro-Communist persona that had allowed him to infiltrate and spy on left-leaning groups. Among his assignments was even a fake defection to the Soviet Union. After the assassination, Oswald himself was assassinated before he could talk. Thus the murder of the president could be publicly attributed to the lone action of a pinko wing-nut, the dual results being the elimination of a pesky, non-ball-playing head of state and further fanning up of the flames of furor against the Evil Empire and its world-wide pawns.Was there a conspiracy? We are left with no doubt that Oliver Stone thinks so. If there was a conspiracy, is this version correct? Again, we must conclude that Oliver Stone thinks it is. At one point in the movie, Kevin Costner even says (parapharsed) that \"What we do here now is only the beginning. It may be 25 or 30 years before someone finally finds the real truth.\" I'm sure it's entirely coincidental that that time frame would take us right up to 1991, when this movie came out.He's casting a pretty wide and implausible net here. It is implausible, if for no other reason, just because there's no way you could get all of these disparate people to work together, even if they were united in mutual hatred of Kenedey's guts. Petty personality differences and territorial squabbles would inequitably doom any such ambitious effort. Not just in the JKF assassination, but in general, humanity is saved from these kind of large scale conspiracies by its own inborn vainglorious proclivities.",

            "content": "In 1991, Oliver Stone directed a movie that would center around one of the biggest events in American History, the assignation of President John F. Kennedy. With this film, Stone brought up the question of was there a conspiracy. Through out the film, he lends us ideas about a conspiracy and who may be behind the conspiracy, but he never gives us an answer. Why? Probably because Oliver Stone himself doesn't know the answer. In fact, I feel he is not making this film to tell us who is behind the assignation but instead to show that there was indeed a conspiracy behind the assignation and the American public is not in on any of the facts behind the assignation. JFK is about Jim Garrison, a New Orleans District attorney played by Kevin Costner in one of his most outstanding roles, and his quest to prove the Warren Commission wrong. The film begins with a brief history of John F Kennedy from his election victory up until his assignation on November 22, 1963. From then on, we the viewers watch as Jim Garrison begins to unravel the events of that day and watch him and his team searching for proof that Lee Harvey Oswald was not a lone gunman.      The film is over 3 hours long and in its run Oliver Stone introduces us to many characters and fills us with tons of information. And while we are accepting all this information we are able to follow along without missing a step of Garrison's trail. In the final climax of the film we see Garrison take local respected businessman, Clay Shaw played by Tommy Lee Jones, to trial. Shaw had been linked to several of the people behind the `conspiracy' through various witnesses. Shaw denied ever being part of the CIA however, in 1979, 10 years after the trial, the CIA admitted that Shaw was apart of the CIA. Of course, this came 5 years after Shaw's death. From these facts we can believe that Garrison was on the right trail and that the assignation was indeed, a conspiracy. JFK does bring up some valid points and all though some of the history may have been twisted for the film, it all works because it doesn't take away any of the questions the film asks. Was There a Conspiracy? The biggest piece of evidence that questions the Warren Commissions decision that Oswald was the only assassin was the home movie from Abraham Zapruder. This home movie clearly questions the lone gunman theory as we can clearly see that Kennedy was shot in the head from a front angle which would negate that Oswald was the only assassin being that Oswald was behind Kennedy in the schoolbook depository. Back and to the left, back and to the left, back and to the left Garrison repeats in the courtroom painting a picture that shows that if there was more than one gunman than there has to be a conspiracy. The film also states that in 1979, the U.S. Senate select committee found that the Kennedy assignation was probably a conspiracy however as of 1991, there has never been an investigation. Does JFK succeed in proving there may have been a conspiracy? Yes. Does JFK give us all the answers to the assignation? No. JFK does give us the idea that we may never get the real truth behind the assignation, just the truth the government wants us to have.",

Can you handle the truth? The truth is much simpler.Four days in Dallas. Two whack jobs with guns. Three dead bodies: The President, The Policeman, and The Assassin. No conspiracy. Just madness. Ain't that America.JFK Assassinated\n11-22-1963\nin Dallas, TX\nby LHO.\nOne man.\nOne rifle.\nThree shots.\nEleven seconds.\nOswald acted alone.\nRuby acted alone.\nNo conspiracy.\nRIP JFKHistory will not been kind to Oliver Stone's JFK. Since the film focuses on too many conspiracies, and overlooks the real facts about the assassination it's hard to know where to begin. But hey, he did get the date right.For the record: The only shooter was Lee Harvey Oswald. One man. One rifle. Three shots. Eleven seconds.The biggest breakthrough in the JFK Assassination came from Max Holland and Johann Rush. By taking a fresh look at the Zapruder film, the most watched piece of film in history. For 44 years, everybody thought it was a time clock of the shooting. It turns out it was, and it wasn't.Zapruder's 26-second movie has two distinct parts. Approximately seven seconds after he started filming from the north side of Elm Street, Zapruder stopped his Bell & Howell Zoomatic at frame 132 because only Dallas police motorcycles were driving by. He did not restart his camera until the president's limousine was clearly in view. Consequently, Z 133 is the first frame to actually show the president's Lincoln - a frame exposed several seconds after the car had made the sharp turn onto Elm Street from Houston Street.Zapruder's film did capture the assassination, just not all of it. He missed Oswald's first shot. And Oswald missed his first shot too.First Shot: The first shot was obstructed by traffic light pole and glanced off. This explains how Oswald missed not only JFK, but the entire limousine. This location is also 70 feet before Zapruder restarted filming. And where many ear witnesses said they heard the first shot. (105 feet distance to JFK). Oswald then had to wait (briefly) for the Lincoln to clear the oak tree before firing the second shot. This accounts for the overwhelming testimony by witnesses as to the shot pattern: One...pause...Two...Three. Also, it matches the distribution of the three cartridges on the 6th Floor.Second Shot: The second shot went through President Kennedy and Governor Connally. It was on a straight line. It was a jacketed bullet. This was no magic bullet, only tragic. (190 feet distance to JFK)Third Shot: The third shot was fatal.\n(265 feet distance to JFK).This means Oswald didn't fire three shots in 6 seconds. He fired three shots in 11.2 seconds.\nWith intervals of around 6.3 seconds and 4.9 seconds between the shots. Because the Lincoln was moving away from Oswald in a straight line, he was almost shooting at a stationary target. Like all Marines, Oswald was trained and tested in shooting. In December 1956, he scored 212, which was slightly above the requirements for the designation of sharpshooter. In May 1959 he scored 191, which reduced his rating to marksman. Still more than capable.This long overdue discovery changes nothing from one perspective (Oswald still did it) it also changes everything, if only because it disrupts the state of mind of everyone who has ever been transfixed by the Zapruder film. The film, we realize, does not depict an assassination about to commence. It shows one that had already started.Just gimme some truth, sang John Lennon. If you want some truth about the assassination, skip JFK and go rewatch the Zapruder film, with the knowledge that it is in two-parts. It still has the power to jolt and revolt you. And it's all too real.",

            "content": "I hadn't yet been born when John F. Kennedy was shot and killed in Dallas. I cannot put the actual event into an emotional context in my life. Further to that, I am Canadian, and could theoretically distance myself from such an ugly piece of American history. Yet I cannot help but be emotionally affected by this film.The unraveling conspiracy in \"JFK\" is told with such conviction, it's hard to believe that it's only a culmination of theories and accounts rather than the truth as is known in history books. The length of the film in its DVD format is 206 minutes, a veritable film marathon. Yet with it's richness in information, theories and background, and absolutely beautiful photography by Robert Richardson, the time never passes slowly. And despite having watched it at least twice, I can safely say that the mind boggling conspiracies and facts they throw at you could keep it fresh for a third viewing in the future.The emotional impact of the 8mm Zapruder film which recorded the assassination, is staggering and awe inspiring. The feeling that the American government plotted the death of their own president, illustrates in many ways time and again, as one of the smaller characters reflects, that if they can kill the president, they can kill anyone. They can kill you or I without batting an eye.I can however, despite the seriousness of the subject matter, share a rather amusing anecdote about my first viewing of this film. I hadn't seen it in theaters, and so I rented it on VHS. My mother wanted to watch it with me, and knowing that it was over three hours long, she was eager to begin, complaining that she didn't want to be up until midnight watching it. Popping the microwave popcorn, she warned me she was starting without me if I didn't hurry. When I came in the room it had already begun. \"Jeez, Mom! What'd I miss?\", \"Nothing, quiet!\" We watched the film together, at times my mother would comment on things that she recalled, and I'd have the occasion to ask her to be quiet. Half an hour went by, with not so much as one credit having shown on the screen, I remarked on it, and my mother concurred that it was odd, but confirmed that I truly hadn't missed anything walking into the film late.Soon we came to the speech given by Kevin Costner as Jim Garrison in the court room, charging Tommy Lee Jones as Clay Shaw as a conspirator, which is a scene that is quite emotionally stirring and powerful. I thought it was incredible. I had noticed that we'd barely crossed the half way mark of the three hour adventure, and remarked, \"Wow, you know, you could end the film right there, that was pretty powerful.\" \"Yes, it was,\" my mother agreed. Shortly following that scene came the epilogue statements and end credits. Finally it dawned on me. \"Mom! You put the SECOND tape in FIRST!\" She laughed immediately. We both did, but I was pretty upset knowing now that I'd have to start tape one and follow it up with tape two again. She got her wish, she wasn't up until midnight, not feeling the slightest bit compelled to watch the first tape, proclaiming, \"I lived it, I don't need to see it again, good night dear.\" Well Mom, you should watch the first part anyway, whether you lived it or not, because it's pretty darn intriguing. Unfortunately, the DVD isn't Mom-proof either, as it is double-sided.",

One of my top ten films, I have watched it dozens of times, and I always find something new to ponder over.Visually and thematically, this is Stone's most ambitious movie, and we will probably never see its kind again: an epic story that forces the people that watch it to consider the possibilities of the director's argument. I have never met someone who has seen JFK and not had an opinion about it, one way or the other. The impact that this movie had before and after its release can still be seen today. Just Google \"Oliver Stone JFK\" and take a look at what various \"experts\" have to say about it! My only true gripe with JFK is the way that Stone chose to display what he considers the evidence. He took all the theories, fed them through a spaghetti maker, and looped the pieces back together to try to make a visually stunning statement. The end result is indeed beautiful to look at, but it leaves those who don't know a thing about the JFK assassination feeling overwhelmed. For example, two characters in the film (played by Kevin Bacon and Donald Sutherland) were actually composites made up of different people at some point mired in the real Garrison investigation. In real life, there was no X (Sutherland), and there was no Willie O'Keefe (Bacon). Also, the movie is edited to a manic pace, leaving uninformed viewers confused at the landslide of theories that come tumbling their way. I feel that Stone did a great disservice to the true evidence by presenting the movie in such a way.I am a firm believer that there was no magic bullet, Oswald was framed, and that there was a grand conspiracy to kill Kennedy. It seems to me that those who criticize the movie (especially some of the reviews I've seen on IMDb) have failed to grasp the facts of the case, and honestly, anyone who gets all their information about the JFK assassination from distorted and incomplete manuals such as the Warren Report or books such as Case Closed (by Gerald Posner, a obfuscating hack who has been proved wrong numerous times) will never understand the facts anyway. It's too bad that the movie does not show the theories in a more cohesive format.That said, JFK is one of the most powerful movies ever made. Everything about it is intense, from the acting (especially Kevin Costner and Joe Pesci, who should've gotten an Academy award nomination for his portrayal of David Ferrie) to the editing, lighting, colors, and pacing. I can only hope that one day Oliver Stone decides to start making daring, controversial movies again!",

            "content": "I don't know how much Oliver Stone believed what he showed in this film, but from his claims it's quite a bit. Yet, to me, that's really beside the point, especially since no one with any self respect should ever take any single source as gospel. This film is great because it's not just ABOUT a conspiracy, but it's about why conspiracy's are so fascinating, and why people like to believe in them. The simple answer is they make great stories. I mean, pretend for a second that JFK was a fictional film... exact same film, except nothing was based on actual people. It'd be rightly seen as a brilliant thriller full of plot twist after plot twist.There's also a lot of black humor in the film I think people miss as they huff and puff about this and that. Personally, do I believe JFK's death was done by the US government as an internal coup from one ideology to another to help jumpstart the Vietnam war and also help line the pockets of companies that build military equipment? No... but it makes a great story. And I find it easier to watch this kinda story, too, when the \"official\" story makes no sense. Obviously something was going on. The most reasonable \"theories\" usually deal with some mob connections and a small but powerful group of people behind the assassination. Not a massive governmental conspiracy, but also not just one lone guy. But JFK goes beyond that as a film, and it really represents to me WHY conspiracy theories are so attractive (and why, when things don't add up, we automatically start connecting the dots in the most extreme ways. Foul play may be involved, but not to the level we sometimes wish it was involved).There's one other film that does this.... Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut. Another film where people try to claim it's outing the Illuminati or whatever, but that's really not the point of the film at all. In Eyes Wide Shut, we see a man who has lost the passion for life because there is no conflict in his life, so he goes looking for it. It parallels human's need for excitement and challenge with the same needs in marriage and sex, but JFK and EWS go together for me as two sides of the same coin. Different tones and structure, but both are about - beyond everything else - why the idea of conspiracies are attractive, and ultimately, why storytelling can be such a powerful force. Because after all, in the end all a conspiracy theory is is, well, a tall tale.",

Making a good movie, you need to have good acting, good directing and a good plot. Having a controversial topic doesn't make you anything special. However, since everybody was praising this movie, I decided to give it a try. But, I have to admit and I slept during watching it for its.On another lovely morning, I got up at 5:00 a.m. in the morning, everything was still dark, I couldn't see anything. Since I already got up, I had no intention of falling asleep again, and I didn't know how to cook then. Inn order to kill my time, I took out the DVD of Jfk and inserted it into the DVD player. When I finished watching it, it was already eight o'clock in the morning, and sun had already come out. I sat there, stunned by the movie's delicacy and genius.How wrong I was. I thought this was just going to be another simple-minded movie about another theory on the Kennedy's assassination. But this had every single element a good movie required, no more, no less. Why it didn't win the Best PIcture of 1991 is beyond me, I was still touched by Jim Garrison's pursuit of the \"truth\"(at least the truth he believed in). The society lacks this kind of people. Searching the minority truth may occurred to somebody, but nobody dared to do that because their actions were always referred as \"fanatical\", \"useless\" and \"brainless\". Well, JIm Garrison defeated these accusations with great courage and steadfast dedication. The 40 minutes in the court was one of the most precious scenes ever filmed in movie history. This movie lasted for three hours, the shortest time in my life, personally. I've never seen any movie that divided three hours so neatly. Schindler's list had some redundant scenes, Dances With Wolves had some major plot holes, Tiatnic was too sappy, The Deer Hunter had a really need-to-cut marriage scene, and ONce upon a time was just plain boring. However, I can't even find a single flaw of pacing in three hours, not even one. THree hours of JIm Garrison's investigation seemed unilateral, but it never bored me. Instead, it gave me new insights into history, inspired me to seek the truth I believed in. In short, I have to quote;\" This is the shortest there hours I've ever spent in my life. \"The actors were perfect. Kevin Costner never gave such a blistering performance ever since. Kevin Babon, Gary Oldamn and Joe Pesci were also very well-done. And we could forget the most memorable performance from Tommy Jones(Oscar-deserved). The cinematography was top-notch. And Oliver Stone immersed himself in directing, and his direction was much more better in this than in Platoon IMHO. This is Stone's best movie since Platoon. How come this never didn't win the Best Musical Score in Oscar. The score boiled my blood, it made me revere Jim Garrison's eagerness in pursuing his truth. Lovely score.The ending was one of the best endings I've ever seen. usually, I can have a definite feeling for the ending, but this one was surely the exception. THe ending kept me stunned in be-wilderness. I didn't know how to feel about the ending. IT was both uplifting and depressing. First, I was sad about (Possible Spoilers) JIm Garrison losing the case, and then I saw his outline walking towards the sunset as a symbol of the pursuit of truth, and then the lovely score began, I was stunned. I turned off the TV and had my breakfast without a word. I noticed how bad a government could be if it doesn't put people ahead of politics. Now, I've watched JFK at least six times. Each time, 205 minutes flies away, but they were never wasted. Ecah time, I learned more and more about the movie, and more and more about the Pursuit OF THE TRUTH.This is truly a GREAT movie, strongly recommend. My vote: 10/10.",

The construction and presentation are flawless. The problems with it are in the details. When I first saw this movie, like many others, I bought everything presented hook, like and sinker. I didn't really research the subject, read anything or watch documentaries on the assassination. For years I walked around bubble-headed believing the theories in the movie. Well, I now put that down to being young and stupid. I just want to say that if you are interested in the assassination, don't stop with researching the information by simply watching JFK.After seeing documentaries and doing a little reading, I discovered that this movie contains outright lies. Even conspiracy theories should be based on available facts. This movie bases theories on theories. For instance, the \"magic bullet theory\" is an idea that is based on recreating the shooting of JFK and Connelly but it is based on positioning the two incorrectly in the vehicle. When recreating the shooting by positioning them correctly, there is not a \"magic\" zigzagging bullet. It went straight through the both of them. The movie claims that Oswald couldn't have acquired the shots that killed Kennedy, but in seeing documentaries that recreate the shots and the injuries sustained, it has been proved that he could very easily have succeeded even with the cumbersome weapon he chose. The movie not only makes up information, it even makes up people who didn't exist to tell it. The woman lawyer who is shown working on Jim Garrison's staff did not exist and was created to give Garrison the image of being progressive in hiring a female lawyer when his entire staff was actually male. If you are going to present conspiracy theories, at least stick to the way events actually happened. In watching a documentary about Lyndon Johnson, I discovered that there is no way he was involved. After the shooting, he was just as discombobulated, grieving and upset about it as everyone else and was desperately trying very hard to handle the situation in a way that the broken American public could feel secure. He may have screwed up in various ways as president (Vietnam comes to mind) but did not kill Kennedy. It's ridiculous.Another thing I came to realize is that even if there is a possibility of a conspiracy, the chance that all of these people and factions that the movie claims is responsible are working in tandem is as far fetched as it can get. I went from believing every line of this movie, to simply believing that maybe one of these factions were involved and finally (after doing much more research on the subject) came to believe that Oswald alone killed JFK. I can see that I'm not the only one that has made this mistake as there are many people writing reviews and talking on the board as if this is the \"bible\" of conspiracy theories and somehow proves those theories when on closer inspection it is a house of cards. \"The problem that I and most historians would have with Oliver Stone, is not his talent--he's a wonderful filmmaker--but that he's used this to put certain myths into the American bloodstream that abide to this day.\" Michael Beschloss, ABC News Consultant. Yes this movie is brilliantly put together but it is inundated with lies.Whatever you believe, please do not use this movie as the only yardstick in determining the truth for yourself.",

            "review_title": "Excellent Example of Editing",
            "content": "The main reason JFK is considered such an excellent film is the creative use of editing by the film's director and behind the scene's co-editor Oliver Stone. The main editors on the film are Joe Hutshing and Pietro Scalia. Of course Hutshing worked with Stone before, notably on \"Born on the Forth of July\" - another editor's movie. Scalia was a new choice for Stone and chosen no doubt for his technical aptitude for editing and being new Stone could easily be Scalia's puppet-master and pull the strings.The film in some ways is a throwback to the great epic films that use to come from the studios in the golden age of Hollywood. Stating the obvious, it is based on true-life events of New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison and the death of President Kennedy and the only trial resulting from the crime. Some might argue that it's documentary-like presentation is at times too much information and slows down the film. For film aficionados this may be the reason the film is such a draw for them. Certainly a better film than it's rival for the Oscar nod and winner in 1991 \"The Silence of the Lambs.\"With an all-star cast, from beginning to end the film never stalls and speeds along like a roller-coaster ride. If there is an argument to be made for where the film might slow it would be the trial scenes. Don't mention the trial excerpts to any JFK conspiracy for they will tell you that the trial scenes are not transcript favorable. There is a lot of artistic license taken and watching this portion of the movie over and over you may be numbed into believing a test after the film may be forthcoming. Decidedly this is an excellent film with fantastic acting, the direction is expertly applied and the editing is the star of the film. Considered one of Stone's best work, this film is one for the annals of movie making legends. If the digits rules allowed it, the award would be more than two thumbs up.",

I got sick every time they actually showed the bullit hitting Kennedy, just as sick as the time that CNN kept showing the planes hitting the twin towers.

When you've got Oliver Stone directing and Kevin Costner playing the lead role back in the early 90s at least before their careers were almost over, you can't go wrong. J.F.K. completely cover the whole J.F.K. assassination and conspiracy cover-up, which was all based on a true story. Kevin Costner couldn't have done a better role as Jim Garrison. This movie brought a whole new meaning to the mystery genre. It proved that, not only does it not have to be solved or have a happy ending, but that stories amazing as this one can be based on a true story and have proof that it all happened. Jim Garrison proved, in this movie and in real life, that there was a huge scandal/conspiracy cover-up behind this action that shocked our country. I believe it to be 100% true, too. There is so much evidence supporting these conspiracy theories, which prove it to be true. Well, I'm sorry if that review wasn't all that good. I'm only 15. And that's it for now.

With excellent performances from the entire cast, this movie combines the thoughts and theories of Jim Garrison and those presented in Jim Marrs' book.Still this is basically Oliver Stone's own ideas as to what happened that day in Dallas and in the period leading up to it. Most people know Stone for his passion for the Vietnam War and even in this film we get a sub plot about this subject. But above all, this is a movie about a lost innocence. The political innocence and a hope for a better future both on political and racial issues. It's the story of a country with big problems and a refusal to deal with these.One could argue that the JFK we are presented to is far to perfect considering the knowledge we have today. But he shall not be seen as a person but as the personification of new dreams for America. In this light the assassination was a terrible thing and as I see it that is what this film is all about. And of cause one man's quest for the truth. Jim Garrison, who is brilliantly portrayed by Costner. And it is a nice touch to have Garrison himself appear as Earl Warren.The film is a must for everyone fascinated by the myth known as JFK and for those who like movies with a message.",

Actually, any historian will tell you that if half of what someone says can be proved false that ought to tell you something about how one should regard the other half.  Because when it comes to the techniques that Stone uses, the factual record exposes him, not the Warren Commission as the real liar.We start with Jim Garrison, who in real life was nothing like Kevin Costner and whose vicious vendetta against an innocent man, Clay Shaw makes even the rational believers of a conspiracy shun him to this day.  Viewers of \"JFK\" may also be interested to know that the real life \"Colonel X\" is a man named L. Fletcher Prouty, who in real life is associated with Lyndon LaRouche's kook organizations.  Then there is the fact that Stone deliberately ignores the existence of ten eyewitnesses who saw Oswald kill Police Officer Tippit, and how Stone also made up a star witness (Kevin Bacon) who never existed because Garrison's real-life star witness Perry Russo (who ironically has a cameo in the film) was exposed as a crackpot.  And the list is endless.Finally, let's consider the laughable premise Stone puts forth. That a \"right wing conspiracy\" murdered a fiscally conservative centrist Democrat who was a dogged advocate of the Cold War just to make Lyndon Johnson, the man who gave us the Great Society and the Civil Rights Act president? Stone is so out of touch with the political situation as it existed in 1963 that it's frightening to think that people would use his film as an introductary primer for recent history.About the only redeeming feature of this movie is John Williams' score (which I often have fun with by making up pro-Warren Commission lyrics to the title melody)",

Whatever specific theory you believe (unless you believe the ridiculous Warren Commission report), the bottom line always comes down to the same conclusion....murder for money and power.The movie is flawlessly done. Brilliantly written, compellingly directed, well acted, unbelievably well done editing. This is Stone's greatest film and one of the greatest movies EVER made in any country at any time.

This needs to be mandatory viewing in every high school and extremely mandatory for anyone seeking a career in filmmaking of any department.From the opening montages presenting the back story in a rapid fire manner, JFK doesn't waste a second. And yet, somehow manages to take it's time to play out in an easily understandable, yet highly intelligible fashion. The pacing is benchmark quality for cinema, maybe the best pacing in a movie since Raging Bull.The performances are all finely tuned. It's very hard to believe that only Tommy Lee Jones was nominated for an Academy Award in an acting category for the film. Kevin Costner turns in what is most likely his best screen performance as a man obsessed with the past, so much so that it is tearing his family apart. Joe Pesci SHOULD have been nominated for best supporting actor with Jones, he's just that electric in the short screen time he has. The late great John Candy turns up for a brief cameo that could of been played off as laughable, but he comes across in a serious way. Movie icons Walter Mathieu and Jack Lemmon were great additions that only help to make the film reach immortal status. And not forgetting Donald Sutherland, 'X,' who provides Jim Garrison (Costner)with a pivotal back story told masterfully. Kevin Bacon shows up to as a male prostitute, a man who has been deep inside the mysterious world due to his nature. The only major female role is Garrison's wife, played by Sissy Spacek, as a woman on the brink of losing due to her husband's constant absence.I don't know any other way of convincing you to see this gem. The black and white photography stands next to Schindler's List and Raging Bull. The script is top of the line quality, as is the cinematography.

The idea that there was more than one individual involved in the assassination of President Kennedy doesn't seem that far off the mark after viewing Stone's three hour plus masterpiece. Kevin Costner brilliantly plays District Attorney Jim Garrison, the only man in history to bring someone to trial for the murder of President Kennedy. The rest of the cast is great, I especially loved Joe Pesci and John Candy - two very different roles than what they were used to. What you may not read on the trivia section for JFK is that Martin Sheen did the voiceover narration for the film, he played President Kennedy in the TV series \"Kennedy\" and in THE DEAD ZONE he plays a politician that faces an assassination attempt. JFK took two Academy Awards for best cinematography and best editing. These two awards were well deserved as Stone is now notorious for editing black & white sequences with color sequences which blend together beautifully. This film will always be a milestone, in my opinion, in risk-taking cinema. Whether you believe it or not, you have to give the man credit for going against the common ideology and making a bold statement that we don't have to believe everything we hear and we don't have to swallow everything whole, that it is good to question things no matter how tragic they are. \"Let the truth be told though the heavens fall.\"",

I'm no conspiracy buff, but even if I were, I believe the one rather shakily outlined here would still be too absurd for me: it seems to be an agglomeration of most of the various conspiracy theories associated with the assassination of JFK, finished off with some shiny new rococo bits dug from Stone's subconscious, and all of it pretty much requiring the participation or knowledge of something like 30% of the western hemisphere. I'm frankly annoyed by Stone's portrayal of Kennedy as revolutionary cut down before he could perform the great acts he was destined for -- Kennedy was a shallow, self-serving little fellow who had few scruples and way too many issues.As if all that weren't enough, I don't like its portrayal of gay men, it has what must be filmdom's longest monologue, and at something like 3 hours, it's way over my usual tolerance.So I should hate it, yes? But somehow, despite all of the above, the damn film **works**.The acting is tremendous (Donald Sutherland plus Kevin Bacon *plus* Joe Pesci PLUS Tommy Lee Jones ... need I go on?). Even Costner, who normally leaves me lukewarm, is great. Intentionally or not, there's a perfect creepy undercurrent to his \"hero's\" obsessive pursuit (somehow quietly emphasized by those damn upright, uptight hornrimmed glasses of his).Yes, the plot is ludicrous, but Stone's passionate insistence that *something* was going on leaks through every frame, compelling the viewer to follow the plot's leaps and twists with the drugged sense of inevitability usually experience in dream logic.That monologue? Done by an actor I don't care for, expounding a theory I don't buy -- and I was flipping spellbound. The film is just... excellent.

In 2038 the national archives have to open the files of the JFK Assassination but until then the U.S.A has to be ready to discover the truth because if it is not, we even might never see those important proofs; they will go missing.I admire Oliver Stone for his commitment to produce a film about what still is a \"conspiracy\". Doubting the official story with solid counter facts is the best wake up call to the people of the world, to stop thinking about our Governments as Guardians of social values, democracy and liberty. They are not, and realizing that fact is shocking and hard to believe, harder to prove.I want somebody to produce a decent movie about 9/11, not in Michael Moore style, but in Oliver Stone JFK style, and if it has to be in the year 2039, so 20 years after the actual incident (JFK is released 28 Years after the events of the Kennedy Assassination). Someone has to dare.Too bad it can't be Oliver Stone again, who has already made his early statement with his apparently neutral, but not so neutral \"WTC\" movie, which did not question any of the 9/11 facts. Watch \"Loose change SE\" for a start if you're interested in what the U.S Government is capable of. It will shock you just like this movie might have shocked you, too.P.S. From a cinematic and rhetorical point of view this movie is very very enjoyable, really sucks you in, that's what I personally love about it.P.P.S Many people do not agree with my opinion, review, which again proves that this topic is still up-to-date and debatable.",

            "content": "\"JFK\" has been controversial from the moment of its inception. Its director, Oliver Stone, has been reviled as a revisionist and heralded as a visionary.\nThe film \"JFK\" seeks to vindicate Jim Garrison, the former DA of New Orleans, who wholeheartedly believed a conspiracy existed to kill President Kennedy, and to shut up anyone who came too close to \"the truth\".If we could slake off all these years since 1963, or even 1991, we would see how drastically the average person's view has changed. The vast majority now believe that Kennedy's killing was the result of a conspiracy. Many think Oswald was framed, and some even think there were two or more guys answering to the name of Oswald.\"JFK\" has taken on an aura of \"fact\" to so many that passions can be aroused if one voices a dissenting opinion in the wrong company. Not a lot of films have had the kind of impact. On the bonus side, the film JFK helped to get documents released which would have been kept from the public for 75 years after the assassination. These documents, a veritable mountain of them, are available to the public in varying degrees.In 1991 things seemed more black and white. Did I believe in a conspiracy then? It is hard to recall. Do I believe in one now? Yes. I believe that a conspiracy exists, on the Internet, in books and in the media, to present such an information overload that \"we\" allow the \"experts\" to feed us their Cliff Notes version of the 1963 events. They eat, digest, and we swallow.The web's minutia of everything Kennedy is mind boggling. Every point has a counterpoint. Every truth has a lie. Every ass gets to bray, and we are left to sort it out. You must make up your own mind on this movie and on the events that spawned it. For my part, the jury is still out. I tend to follow Occam's Razor, but research for this review has left me battered and reeling, and just as confused as anybody.",

So finally, last night, I got around to watching it. Let's just say I was more than impressed with the final product. It really made me wish I would have picked it up before a whole month had passed by.       I agree with Ebert who said it is \"One of the best films of the 90's\". I'm going to have to say that it is one of the best films of all time. I don't think there was a dull moment in this film.       The acting is the film is also something to be proud of. Kevin Costner finally gives a performance of more than three or less facial expressions. Though, when he is arguing with his wife, he didn't really seem to mad during his little speech about truth to her. The supporting cast is something to marvel in. Believe me when I say that this is the easiest movie to get to when playing \"6 degree's of Kevin Bacon\". There are stars up the wooza in this film.       The film is a little over three hours long. This might turn some people off, but believe me, I wasn't bored for a second.       Oliver Stone rightfully won the oscar for best editing. I have never seen such editing done on a film. Stone would later use it on some of his other films. But believe me, it actually feels needed in this film. The rest of his films didn't need that kind of fast editing throughout. I did enjoy \"Natural Born Killers\", but he got a little out of hand with the editing.       Overall, this is a wonderful film that all film lovers should be required to watch.

This movie was like time traveling, Stone gets a lot of the period details right, I read the actor who played Oswald studied films and tapes of Oswald speaking to capture Oswald's speech patterns. That said, the movie is basically a paean to Jim Garrison and his conspiracy theories-which were repudiated the jurors who found Clay Shaw not guilty.

            "content": "JFK is based on two books \u2013 On the Trail of the Assassins by Jim Garrison and Crossfire: The Plot that Killed Kennedy by Jim Marrs. JFK sets the scene by showing an historical account of Kennedy's Presidency, from the Bay of Pigs invasion, through to the Cuban missile crisis and finally Kennedy's assassination. The film then covers the background leading to the assassination including the planning of a second Cuban invasion by a group of ex-Cubans, Lee Harvey Oswald and his defection to Russia and return to the USA and his relationship to the ex-Cubans and Guy Bannister \u2013 ex FBI agent and investigator. The film then follows Jim Garrison (Kevin Costner), the New Orleans District Attorney who in 1966 disagreed with the Warren Commission's finding of a lone assassin, and re-opens the Kennedy assassination and attempts to convict Clay Shaw (Tommy Lee Jones) of involvement. The film shows Garrison's attempts to reconstruct the assassination, his interviews with witnesses and his personal life. Garrison also has a meeting with a Government official (Mr X) who explains the big picture of a conspiracy to assassinate Kennedy and encourages Garrison to keep digging. Garrison uses the trial, via his summing up speech, as a vehicle to attack the findings of the Warren Commission, alleging a cover-up, including asserting that there were multiple gunmen and alleging a conspiracy of the military-industrial complex.As a film, I found it too long, a little slow initially and the use of quick cuts and low camera angles, a little excessive. The film is notable for attracting a star studded cast, including several cameo appearances. Interestingly of all the A-list actor appearances, all but Gary Oldman are Democrat leaning.However what cannot be overlooked is the film's statement, which is remarkable. The film attracted a lot of controversy, interestingly including from the press. The Warren Commission did make a lot of errors and while the film is an interpretation of the available facts and reasonable assumptions, with some modification for storytelling effect, it seems the true story may never be told. The film is perfectly valid in attempting to highlight the inconsistencies of the official account of Kennedy's assassination with assumptions/facts.We now know that the CIA at the time was involved in destabilising a number of other countries leadership in the name of the cold war. Kennedy did try and remove covert activities from the CIA and transfer them to the US military. There were also many suspicious deaths of witnesses of the Kennedy assassination, probably to prevent Garrison's use in his court case. And there also was the assassination of Bobby Kennedy after he nominated for President and outlined that he would follow in his brother's footsteps.On the balance of probabilities, it is very likely that there was a cover-up of Kennedy's assassination. To this day, the true killers have not been brought to justice. Does it matter. America won the Cold War, and even Democrat Presidents now endorse the tactics of the CIA and the Pentagon (eg the drone killings and the recent revelations by Edward Snowden about the US spying on its own citizens and other countries \u2013 both presided over by Obama). So perhaps Kennedy was naive and was wrong to try and tame the CIA. It is in the least, an unfortunate episode in US national and political affairs.",

I'd have to say that the conspiracy theories in this flick, (like in Conspiracy theory w/ Mel Gibson) ranges anywhere from the ridiculous to the convincing. Which of them could be the most likely I'm convinced of one myself, and I'll share that later on.\nBeing a native Texan, and having seen that warehouse where Oswald allegedly shot Kennedy, straight through the back, and in the head, I am not convinced that he could've done so in the amount of time, they said he did. However, I do believe that someone was hiding behind the fence on the grassy knowel on the other side of the same warehouse, and killed the president. Since there were all sorts of reports by bystanders who were told to shut up about by police shortly after. As far as the conspiracy theory I'm convinced of, if any, is the one where the film suggests in a conversation between Costner and Sutherland about Jackie Kennedy having Jack killed for banging Marilyn Monroe, and then having her offed. Of course, I can't prove a thing, but remember this, she's the one who'd everybody least suspect. In these scenarios, it is most typically the one people would least suspect, and I can say that most wouldn't be surprised if it turned out that Johnson had him killed over the allegation that he was going to have America disarmed during his office, or some lunatic like Oswald acting on his own, or that the mob was mad about something, and the mob theory sounds far-fetched, because even though they are the mob, they wouldn't have enough power to assisanate the world's powerful and important man - the US president.",

Initially I was struck by it's power to persuade, I finished watching it and felt convinced President Kennedy's death was the result of a massive plot involving everyone and anyone. This I think is a testament to the quality of the film and the way in which Oliver Stone throws a mountain of evidence up into the air and then with some of the best editing I've ever seen constructs a case implicating the US government, the Cubans, the Mafia and various others in a conspiracy. Even if you don't agree with Stone I think you still have to admire the way he presents his case.Of course this was before I began to study US history in particular, the Civil Rights Movement from Lincoln to the 1980s and Cold War between 1945 and 1975. As you can probably guess I realised Stone hadn't been entirely honest in his historical interpretations in JFK. I went on to realise that the reasons Stone puts forward as to why Kennedy was shot were not entirely accurate.Meanwhile before I saw JFK I knew very little of the various theories that abound about what happened on Dealey Plaza in November 1963. Since then though I've read quite a lot about the assassination although I'm by no means as knowledgeable as the residents of the message boards for this film. However although I'm now sceptical regarding of Stone's version of events I still have his film to thank for encouraging me to look deeper into the case and, as is stated by X in the film, to make my own conclusions.Also, despite the fact that I reckon JFK probably wasn't the victim of a conspiracy, I still think that JFK works superbly as political thriller of epic proportions (and I just love the way Hollywood legends stroll in and out of small roles). What's more although events on Dealey Plaza may not have played out as described in JFK the film still manages to convince me that a scenario could play out in such a fashion.Finally whatever you think about the death of Presindent Kennedy you really need to see JFK if only because it's three hours of simply breathtaking entertainment",

His argument seemed to leave no question as to whether there was a conspiracy in the assassination of JFK. \nThen, I did some research.  I read about Clay Shaw, Guy Banister, and Fletcher Prouty (Mr. X).  A lot of what Stone presents as fact is completely false.  The address on Oswald's pamphlets did lead to an address adjacent to Guy Banister's detective agency, but the entrance listed did not lead into Guy Banister's office, they are completely different offices, completely unconnected.  Thus the connection between Banister and Oswald is not valid. Also, Kevin Bacon's character was not a real person but combination of three different personalities, and this character never had any evidence which linked Oswald, Ferrie, or Clay Shaw.  These inaccuracies are pretty significant when we relate them to Garrison's case.We all have heard about the Grassy Knoll, and the \"puff of smoke\" that was seen from it.  Stone recreated this shot and we see the smoke rising from the rifle, the smoke that Lee Bowers claims to have seen from his train tower.  However, automatic rifles do not give off smoke, that is fact.  This is another significant discrepancy in the investigation.I do not support the single bullet theory, I do not feel strongly about whether or not there was a conspiracy, I just want to know what happened.  I really enjoyed JFK and I am glad to have seen it because it inspired me to do some research on the subject.  I think it did raise some great points about Oswald such as the fact that he was not a great shot, and he also would have had better aim had he fired before Kennedy's car made the turn by the Depository.  I think there are still a lot of questions to be answered. For example, the shots were taken over 8 to 9 seconds (Warren Commission). That's a lot of time.  Why couldn't Kennedy have been saved in this time, before the fatal head shot?",

This film is creepy in a way that makes the Blair Witch Project look like kid's stuff. This is by no means a horror movie but the lengths at which the government will go through to keep the JFK assasination under wraps is as blatantly obvious as it is startling.Oliver Stone's hatred for vietnam shows again in this film (the most noticable portrayals are Platton and Born On The Forth Of July) as it plays a fundimental part in the assasination.There are so many memorable scenes in this film. The most gripping ones being the conversation with Donald Sutherland and the final hour long sumery that Costner gives the the jury. Every performance is top notch and it adds to my feeling of Joe Pesi being one of the greatest actors of our time.If you can get your head around the communist/mob driven/government conspirisy plot then you will find an absolutely amazing and gripping film.

However, i believe he has simply lost his freaking mind with this movie. None of the portrayals represent the whole truth, because we do not know the truth. That is fine, whatever Oliver. But pandering to the lowest common denominator, i.e.,conspiracy theorists (I use that term loosely) that believe LBJ, the CIA, Castro and little green men from Mars were all behind the assassination. Costner's portrayal of Garrison 's emotion run the usual gamut from A to B. Would it kill the guy to maybe not look like he is always constipated? However, i took delight in the film's portrayal of that insane, evil, closet case J. Edgar Hoover. He looked positively ravishing in this film! So beautiful! Hoover, you entered the wrong profession - you could give RuPaul a run for his money!! sly old dog Hoover",

            "content": "This film is long, there's no denying that. However there's also no denying that it's 3 hours and 26 minutes well spent, especially if you have any interest at all surrounding the events of JFK's assassination.Oliver Stone is clearly passionate about this subject and this is the reason he takes as long as he does to lay out the facts (as he sees them), as well as the many things we simply don't know about what transpired. It's a great insight into the machinations of government, the search for truth, and the simple fact that what is commonly thought to be what happened deserves closer scrutiny.As expected the cast do a stellar job. Kevin Costner shines, though so do the likes of Gary Oldman, Joe Pesci and Tommy Lee Jones. Donald Sutherland also gives us a great monologue, though this is undoubtedly eclipsed by the half hour or so monologue from Costner at the culmination of the film. I won't mention any more actors, though there were certainly more stellar performances.While the long running time and verbose script might make this film seem like a chore for some, if you concentrate on the story presented it's well worth the effort.",

            "content": "One of the things that I truly appreciate about the film is the boldness with which the director has gone ahead & depicted what he wanted to. After all, the film hints at Kennedy's assassination being carried out by orders from the highest level of bureaucracy. I can imagine the kind of controversy the film would have been subject to after its release.Kevin Costner plays Jim Garrison, a New Orleans District Attorney who is convinced that there is a big conspiracy around President Kennedy's assassination. He along with his team start gathering evidence to prove it. In their quest for reality, they come across several startling facts about the American Defense Establishment & the political backing that it gets. Things get heady when, Garrison's investigation is out in the media. Those involved in the conspiracy try & tarnish Garrison's reputation so that his investigation loses credibility. Not to be bogged down by his detractors, Garrison works day in & day out to prepare a strong case to prove conspiracy. The climax is marked by a riveting courtroom drama where Garrison convinces everybody that there was indeed a conspiracy to assassin President Kennedy.Now, the thing that I like the most about this film is that none of the characters have concealed identity. Everything is out in the open. Right from Clay Shaw (Tommy Lee Jones) being gay to David Ferrie (Joe Pesci) being involved in the Cuban War.Perhaps the most riveting scene in the film is that involving a former general & Garrison where the general gives him the insight that rather than 'who' assassinated the President, it is much more important to know 'why' he was assassinated.Costner carries out his role with panache & is truly at his best when he arouses emotions in the climax. Joe Pesci is quiet convincing & kudos to Tommy Lee Jones for carrying off the controversial role with such audacity.Its a 10/10 & a must watch for all those who like political dramas despite its 3 hours running length.",

It was released to great controversy, but not the right kind.  The media (vafenculo) played up the fact that Stone had 'tampered with history.'  Isn't an artist required by definition to be uncompromising in his vision?  I think that the questionable scenes based on witness testimony or the Zapruder film are not fictitious at all, by mere definition.  How much of the film is incorrect?  Maybe two-five mins. total; this picture, however, is well over three hours.  Three hours of historical revelation (at least it's revelatory for those who don't read books) and all the press can focus on is those couple of minutes that probably have more truth to them than most Americans would feel comfortable thinking. \nThe U.S. involvement in Central America and Southeast Asia were journalistic non-events, kept from public scrutiny by the corridors of power.  That hardly nobody in this country knew (knows) about them in any detail is the fault of the Washington propaganda machine.  That Stone puts 'JFK' into mass circulation and Americans knowingly permit the media to dismiss the film as controversy hype and inaccurate is much less than sheltered ignorance.  It is sedition of the worst kind--an intellectual and social shirking of one's duty to eliminate falsehood from history and forbid the tampering of the collective consciousness around the world.As Garrison (Costner in the film) says, \"...it was a coup d'etat...\"  At least admit it.",

            "content": "How did Stone do it? He took material that if you gave to ten other directors they couldn't make anything better than a shoe commercial and turned it into a riveting detailed great piece of film. Detail, detail, detail. This movie theorizes so well, even if it is all Stone's theories, that it's hard not to feel it's ALL true. Casting was also some of the best I have seen of a movie made in the nineties. Costner was solid, Oldman unbelievable, Pesci wild, Jones Oscarworthy, Candy a break from the norm, Bacon best of his career, Lemon great small role, and even Stone's kid (who played Jasper) got in there. Oldman was great. From a guy who has a thick British accent WOW!! Everything about Oldman's Lee Harvey, the twitches, irritability, shadiness, was perfect and just how I could picture Oswald. Sutherland as X was great, perfect role. I can't say enough of Stone's directing though. What really did it for me was the final court room scene. Most directors would have languished too long in the scenes leading up to Garrison's final speech (Sleepers was a big violator of this, it killed that movie), but Stone understood that you can't slow down the movie at this point, keep the frenzied pace and then let Garrison give you the perfect climax of what has been discussed at length in the plot. That is how a good courtroom scene is done and done effectively. The flashbacks were well used too. Stone showed you what was needed to make your mind believe it even more because instead of just saying something happened and having you take time to visualize it Stone gave you a little peak. It also allowed you to better place the characters to the events that were being discussed. Stone realized the size of information and events he was throwing at you in a short period of time, this was very apparent in the scene with Sutherland's X. This is a great movie that details one of the most significant events in our history. An event that truly altered our countries path. The best part was that it was presented in a grand fashion and told with great vigor and life. Bravo!",

I'm not talking about the theory being wrong, because it's never been disproven; I mean that some of the \"facts\" that it presents are simply false. I'll give some examples: 1. Lee Harvey Oswald wasn't a very good shot.This is just wrong. Oswald was a sniper in the Marines, and I saw a documentary where someone read off of his training log. Shooting at a target of similar size to Kennedy's body and at twice the distance, he hit 48/50. On another day, he hit 49/50 under the same circumstances.2. Garrison's moving speech.This never happened. In real life, Garrison had absolutely no evidence against Shaw and therefore had no case.3. A large amount of the \"actual\" footage of the assassination.Stone, being a brilliant film maker, combined reenactments with real footage to create his own images.Now I'm not saying this was a bad movie; it was excellent, but this movie is the last place you should look in deciding who you think shot the president.",

            "content": "While I doubt it was Stone's intention, his \"JFK\" does more to damage the credibility of the conspiracy theorists than any other work besides Posner's \"Case Closed.\" In telling the story of Jim Garrison, the man who never met a theory he didn't believe, Stone convincingly tells the story of almost 30 years of wacky \"theories\"--none of which have stood up to even the most cursory scrutiny. He, does, however, leave out one very important group of characters, namely, the small army of conspiracy nuts who attached themselves to Garrison's \"investigation\" with all the tenacity of a bunch of leeches going after a warm body.The great irony is that Stone himself genuinely seemed to believe in a conspiracy and set out to create a counter-myth to stand against the much-maligned but never seriously refuted conclusions of the Warren Commission. And given that Stone is an incredibly gifted film-maker (or was anyway), his version is quite a bit more entertaining than that dry 26 vol. report. But, as the movie progresses, the counter-myth becomes ever more maniacal--it was the homosexual underworld, no, wait, the Cuban exiles, no, it was the Mob, no, it was the Mob and the CIA, no wait, it was the CIA and Lyndon Johnson, no, it was the entire structure of government and industry working with all the above!There's no great mystery, really. The evidence (the real concrete evidence, not all the alleged forgeries and coverups and faked autopsies) has, and always did point at one person and one person only: Lee Harvey Oswald. And Stone, to his credit, gives time to this; and Gary Oldman, to his huge credit, creates a very convincing LHO. It's not too much of a stretch to imagine his character killing JFK. The creepy underworld of the conspiracy theorists is well depicted: the depraved homosexuals, the sinister \"black ops\" people, the lunatic fringe that Garrison dredged to produce his \"case\" against Shaw. Everyone and everything is over the top, as it should be.\nThe JFK Assassination has always been about sensationalism and hysteria and Stone captures this world perfectly. He also does an incredible job of re-creating the swirling sense of paranoia of the early 60s and the aura of government betrayal at a time when the Kennedys were assassinated (and MLK), the CIA seemed to be running amok, and the Vietnam War spinning out of control. The movie is an artistic triumph. It's also a fast primer into the world of conspiracy theory where every piece of evidence against Oswald is \"fabricated\" and every conjecture about a conspiracy the \"truth.\" Garrison the lonely crusader for truth is accurately (and ironically) depicted as a guy who got caught up in the JFK obsession to the point where he believed anything and everything anybody told him. If Stone had any sense of irony of his own, he would have showed us how Garrison's massive ego and vendetta against Clay Shaw made him the perfect tool for conspiracy buffs who desperately needed an elected official (another irony) to demonstrate that other elected officials orchestrated the murder of JFK.JFK: the Movie does more to make JFK: the Conspiracy look laughable than all of the conspiracy literature put together. It's an incredible movie about how a search for the truth becomes more twisted and bizarre than the \"truth\" it's supposedly pursuing. A great movie, if not for quite the same reasons as many posters here would have you believe.",

The fact that the movie is so well made and Costner's acting is so good apparently makes it easier for people to believe that the plot's egregious nonsense is history. It's also saddening that Kevin Costner and the other outstanding film artists who made this movie should have spent their great talent on popularizing the movie's ridiculous contention.

            "content": "Some movies make the statement they are based on true events. Others claim the title to be inspired by true events. Stone attempts to do the former, but ends up doing the latter. This is a good movie. An idealistic man tried to unravel the conspiracy of the assassination of a president, and ends up being thwarted by the conspirators at every step as they cover up their tracks. Stone is a very good director and this movie is no exception. The historical accuracy of this film has been debated by very knowledgeable and passionate people, and I've read enough to find its credibility lacking, so I am judging this movie as a work of historical fiction - inspired by true events. The death of JFK was taken as a shattering of the myth of Camelot, the end of the 20 years after WW2 when America reigned supreme and basked under the sun of its military and economic might. Stone plays upon this sentiment very well, presenting us with a series of \"what if's\" focusing on what would happen if JFK had lives. An idyllic utopia in which there was no Vietnam, where civil rights miraculously spread across the land, and several other unrealistic, but very appealing notions. As a Vietnam veteran, one can understand Stone's passion in making this movie. Its rather obvious that he associates the death of JFK with the start of events that led him to a series of unpleasant events in his life. Just as one mourns the death of a child because of the potential and hopes of the future, so we mourn the death of JFK based on notions of what could have been. Whether or not JFK could have accomplished these things is another matter, but we can hold this belief inside that had he lived things would have been better. Stone plays for his audience and his time very well. The Cold War had just ended, and we no longer needed the same government that kept the Evil Empire at bay. Documents became declassified, and there was an overall backlash against the shadowy government - X-files, alien autopsy reports, etc. It was not difficult for Stone to feed upon this climate of distrust of the government in presenting his conclusions in a very appealing manner. There is no proof because the conspirators destroyed the truth. For a public just finding out a lot of the things that its government did during the Cold War that was subsequently kept quiet, the killing and cover-up of a president seemed very realistic. As a piece of storytelling, this movie is great. It sucks you in and keeps going at a mounting pace until its eventual climax where all is revealed, and nothing is proved. As a piece of political propaganda its a masterpiece, and should be studied by every filmmaker and politician as how to take disjointed facts and coincidences and twist them together to paint a compelling story that the public would love to swallow up. Did these events happen as shown on the screen? Its possible. Stone himself admits he took dramatic license in several events, which, if you are trying to show a factual and historical story pretty much kills your credibility from the beginning. More and more time has passed for any one of this apparent legion of conspirators to come forth and make a deathbed confession, and so the veil of conspiracy and cover-up wears thinner and thinner with each passing day. Surely Cancer Man must be getting tired eliminating witness after witness, document after document. Watch the movie, think about it. There is plenty more to learn about what happened outside the movie, the JFK movie board itself, and the links provided in and of themselves will provide you with more information that you can imagine. But in the end, this is just a movie - inspired by true events.",

We have: a suspect (Lee Harvey Oswald); his gun, shells and fingerprints; ballistics tests; autopsy evidence; witnesses who heard shots from the Depository and saw a gunman who looked like Oswald in the window; Oswald's presence at the scene of the crime; the long thin paper- wrapped package he brought to work that day; several reenactments that proved someone with Oswald's military training could have committed the crime, and that one bullet could have wounded both JFK and Gov. Connally; Oswald's actions after the murder (he fled the scene, went home, got his handgun, shot and killed a Dallas police officer); etc. Can this evidence be questioned? Of course! Certainly, Oswald's attorney would have done so in court. But the fact remains that a solid criminal case exists against Oswald. Every day, people are convicted on less evidence (I know; I have served on criminal-case juries three times). By contrast, conspiracy theorists have no suspect, no gun, no shells or fingerprints or ballistics evidence or a paper or money trail -- they have no case that could be presented in court. To the argument \"We could present a case, but the evidence we need is locked up,\" I reply: how do you know what this locked-up evidence says? What would you tell a judge: we know someone other than Oswald killed JFK, but we can't name the killer or present any actual evidence? The judge would throw you out of court, as the real-life jury did with the real-life Jim Garrison. This film, which is reasonably well done as a movie, is nothing more than fantasy entertainment.

Been to the 6th Floor Museum where Oswald supposedly acted alone in shooting the President (it's apparent he couldn't have from there, though they still claim he did). Been behind the picket fence and actually climbed up the column Zapruder shot the most famous home movie ever (he had to have been in the plan - there's no way he wouldn't have ducked for cover or at least flinched as the bullets whizzed past him from behind).That Oliver Stone was able to explain Jim Garrison's heroism and a more accurate picture of this coup d'etat is an epic achievement in storytelling. The cinematography and editing are superb.No one will ever know the full truth but anyone believing the Warren Commission \"report\" - especially after watching this brilliant expos\u00e9 - is either foolish or just willfully ignorant of what evils our government and its actors (from LBJ down) can perpetrate...",

            "content": "Oliver Stone's JFK is a good movie, but it relies on too much historical revision to get it's point across.  It's good that viewers have had their minds opened and may now believe JFK was killed by our own government, but at the same time Oliver Stone's rather fanatical opinions about government issues in the 60's and 70's cloud this film.  For all of you who have not actually read any detailed research about the assassination, I would recommend it.  The film JFK takes many elements which are only speculation and makes them into hardline fact.  Now, I don't think the film is bad...80% of it is pretty much all based around the circumstances that comprise most of the conspiracy theory, but the remaining 20% is a little iffy.  The best example I can think of is Donald Sutherland's character of Mr. X.  In the film, Mr. X is essentially the turning point for Garrison. His story convices Garrison that the assassination is well beyond the scope he initially assumed.  However, in reality, Mr. X didn't really exist. The story he tells in the film was actually lots of information from several different sources and people.  Making the character of Mr. X might have saved screentime, but it deteriorates credibility.  Audiences were probably pretty impressed that a high-ranking military official would confess these things to Garrision...well, he didn't.  While some claim that Mr. X was indeed a real person, the information is sketchy.  my point is, Stone makes a lot of the case look for more believable than it really is.  Regardless, the movie certainly makes people think, and maybe that's why so many right-wingers love attacking its fans as \"Communists\" or historcial revisionists.  Anyone who earnestly thinks the ENTIRE case for conspiracy is simply paranoia and coicidence must be virtually brain dead, as much as I hate to say it.  There is something here, and getting people to think and talk about it is pretty damn important.",

            "content": "This is a well-made, suspenseful movie--in spite of it being about the most famous murder in history. When I watched the movie--most of which narratively was told in retrospect--I felt the knot of suspense that I feel while watching a fictitious thriller---even though I know what's going to happen because it's historical! I'm also an amateur historian, a trial attorney who deals with the problems of reconstructing past events by using various types of evidence. Over the years I've read most of the Warren Report; I've read the conspiracy books. I find flaws in the former--and serious error in logic on the latter. Long ago, I concluded the evidence available was overwhelmingly demonstrative of Lee Harvey Oswald's factually causing the death of the president by shooting him with the rifle found. How that would have played forensically in a real trial is impossible to say. The conspiracy writers have no evidence of anything, just holes in the evidence presented by the Warren Commission. From these holes come theories that devolve into circular arguments where they end up proving the theory by assuming to be true. If the conspiracy writers could have been able to assist Oswald's defense counsel (hypothetically), they could have created reasonable doubt, which may have acquitted Oswald--or gotten him on reduced charge of manslaughter. But enough reasonable doubt to prevent a conviction is NOT the same thing as proving beyond a reasonable doubt the guilt of other alleged culprits.But this is a movie website, made for movie buffs like myself, who enjoy reading about movies and discussing movies and reading what other film buffs have to say about movies. As a movie, JFK is something I have watched a few times because it is so well crafted. I suspect Oliver Stone must be tough as a director because he also got performances out actors I didn't think possible--even known talents. It's editing, the music, the sound, the sets--everything creates this bizarre, paranoid effect, where nothing is as it seems. Like one of the legendary conductors that can move an entire orchestra to great climactic crescendos, Stone creates a thriller set withing a courtroom drama. It's a virtuoso work, that also shows mastery of narrative technique, such as shifting point-of-view, retrospect and foreshadowing, story-within-a-story, building to devastating and heartbreaking ending of JFK's death and of a traumatized nation left with fear, uncertainty and unanswerable questions in the middle of a nightmarish Cold War.As an historian, I am not moved very much from what I still believe to be the sad, absurd and unspectacular truth. As a lawyer, I am impressed with the way reasonable doubt can be generated by working up facts more likely to be deemed irrelevant at a trial; equally, I am relieved to see that reasonable doubt to prevent a guilty verdict in the trial of one person (which never happened) is not sufficient to prove conspiracy in the trial of another. As a movie fan, I am awed with what a great director can do with historical material and a good cast and crew. As an American, I am also glad that movies like this can be made. It is the mark of a society free enough to express such withering criticism of the government without fear of punishment.I strongly recommend this movie to anyone who has not seen it yet, and that it be seen repeatedly by those who have already seen it. The mark of a classic is it that can speak to people of all generations--and differently to the same person moving through life into older generations.",

The JFK scandal is controversial enough as it is, so watching it for the first time can be a little confusing.  A team of district attorney's led by Jim Garrison (Kevin Costner) intend to find the truth in the John Fitzgerald Kennedy assasination.  JFK is a very informative fact-based story on the methods and strategies behind this great strategy.  Garrison stops at nothing to find the truth and risks the lives of his co-workers and family in the process.  Great cast in this movie: Costner, Pesci, Tommy Lee Jones, Kevin Bacon, Michael Rooker, Sissy Spacek, Jack Lemmon, Walter Matheau, Vincent D'nofrio, and Ed Asner.  Besides Costners' portrayal of Garrison, Kevin Bacon was excellent as Willie O'Keefe.  Excellent acting in this film. Robert Richardson deserved his cinematography Oscar and I just recently found out that he worked with Oliver Stone on NATURAL BORN KILLERS. Richardson also brought his photography work to Quentin Tarantino's new release KILL BILL which was very stylish and original. JFK was as captivating and riveting as any other film i've seen.  One of my top ten favorite films.  I will add another dvd to my Oliver Stone collection real soon.  A for a grade",

I feel much the same when watching films by Michael Moore (particularly faranheit9/11). As a result one of the feelings I take from Stone's films is a feeling that I am being patronised. Strong and very biased views are being hammered into the viewer from the outset. This is certainly the case in 'JFK' particularly the mesmerising editing in the opening montage scenes which, although brilliant, is clearly biased. Don't get me wrong I generally agree with arguments of Michael Moore and Oliver Stone I just feel that in 'JFK' and in other Stone films such as 'platoon' and 'born on the 4th of july' we are watching more a propaganda pamphlet than a piece of cinema which has balanced views and more open debate towards certain issues.",

This movie is a story built on shameful lies playing on the viewers emotions of a fallen president with a masters skill of the art. When confronted about his lies and proved deceptions, Mr. Stone was called out rightfully so and he ended up finally calling his movie JFK a \"Counter Myth\" to the government lies about the assassination. That's healthy, informative and constructive? Building on his (Stone) perceptions of lies to this American event that still brings hard felt emotions to most who remember and still feel its impact, is a travesty Stone did not share his doubts only, but created a 3rd dimension that never happened, and never did. I call it a slap in the face to the viewer and shameful to many viewers to come, that know nothing of the Kennedy assassination and now see JFK as FACT 101. This movie has become the world's \"general understand\" of what happened in Dallas 1963, and the events before and after. Its a travesty for that simple reason. It is clear to me Mr. Stone has a real love and devotion for Pres. Kennedy's memory, as do I and many around the world, but it's clear viewing his 3 hour lie that he believes the myth, and so should his viewers. A good movie director does not is make a good historian.

            "content": "God, I remember how highly I thought of this film when it came out. Being 19 years old at the time, I suppose my interests toward \"important\" issues were evolving into a more relavant, adult and analytical perspective. I wanted information. I wanted to know who was pulling the strings behind the secure illusions of my youth (those comforting magical walls that all seem to crumble in the turbulence and onset of higher education and young adulthood). But of course, as a teenager, I was certainly more influenced and impressed than I am now with the flash and fervor of those who truly create a lot of attention through their work -- entertainers. As unfortunate as it may seem, we cannot easily dismiss the stranglehold that all forms of media and pop culture have on our thinking and opinions in this country. Indeed, when \"JFK\" was released in 1991, it was preceded and followed by an onslaught of assassination conspiracy coverage in which a massive amount of unchallenged accusations and other preposterous information was given an air of seriousness by the public, myself included. \"JFK\" also should be given credit for sparking interest in the house passing legislation that released an unprecedented amount of previously classified files regarding the assassination. I would applaud the film for at least opening this dialogue. But the predominant public opinion that there was a conspiracy still persists. Much of this speculation is rooted in the same low standard of proof that this film depicts. It should therefore share some of the responsibility for the continued popularity of these views.In Roger Ebert's new book (\"The Great Movies\" I think), he still insists that the inaccuracy of this film (which is largely outdated and discredited at this point) doesn't matter. Film should not be held to the same standard of truth, as journalism is, but is instead about depicting feel and emotion, he claims. I agree with him in that the movie is a conglomeration of conspiracy theories and feel -- specifically the paranoia the country felt after the assassination, of which I shared at one time. We want to think that JFK died for something more important than a lone crackpot's disturbing and dillusional political fanaticism. We want to know that JFK died for a reason. The movie dramatizes this desperate mood surrounding the search quite well. I truly disagree with Ebert's assertion that films have absolutely no responsibility to get their facts straight. First of all, I think some events, such as this one, deserve a higher standard of accuracy in thier cinematic treatments. I would mind less, and I think most people would, if say a film like \"Ed Wood\" was further from the facts than \"JFK.\" Secondly, Oliver Stone does not present this story as mere speculation, but as historic revision (regardless of what he may claim he intended, this is certainly how the film was presented and preceived. One merely has to review all of the college lectures Stone gave, and still gives, in an attempt to achieve credibility and excite outrage). From the opening documentary footage (which is sprinkled with recreation footage, by the way) and somber Martin Sheen voice over to the inclusion of mostly fact-based characters and the exhibition of the Zapruder film, Stone is certainly making a real accusation that falls short (wisely, in my opinion) of presenting us specific any conclusions. What should have Stone done then? I would never argue that this film shouldn't have been made, or worse yet, censored in some way. I just feel that this is a really lousy, innaccurate, and largely irresponsible jumble of fact and fiction that attempts to exonerate an assasin, exalt a dishonorable and harrassing politician (Garrison), further tarnish the reputation of an deceased innocent (Shaw) and avoid the logical and reasonable information that explains the Warren Commission inconsistencies and other seemingly \"mysterious\" evidence.  Acting wise, Costner, Pesci and Bacon all give hammy, way over-the-top performances and the story-telling is simply confusing, vague and disjointed. I could go on and on (haven't I done that already?) about the specific evidence that completely refutes what Stone has depicts, but this isn't exactly the forum. I strongly recommend that anyone interested in keeping an open mind toward reason and facts surrounding these nagging issues and debates (the pristine bullet, altered body, Oswald FBI/CIA connection, et.al.) read \"Case Closed\" by Barry Posner. The information is exhaustively and professionally researched with an academic approach of the highest standard and integrity. This is a very special and important book that does not ignore Oswald or Ruby's stories, for they are integral in understanding how this tragedy came to be. Nor does Posner ignore the arugments, put forth by completely rational people, that lead one to mistakenly conclude the existence of a conspiracy.",

As for the politics, I think there's a lot to recommend it, especially if one applies the Discomfort Litmus Test, i.e., just note how many howls of outrage and dismissive splutterings were aimed at Stone and the movie. It touched a chord. \"JFK\" has been unfairly painted as a conspiracy nut's fantasy. But Stone was making a movie, not a documentary - although heaven knows there's enough material out there in real life to make Stone's movie seem pallid. I believe that Stone's purpose was to show how smoothly and competently an assassination of the president could be carried out by the powers that be, how they could simply view it as a necessary step in advancing their own interests, and how expendable any individual is in the scheme of power politics. Stone certainly used a lot of material that is fairly well vouched for, and if he fictionalized the meetings at the upper levels of government, he was really saying, \"This is how it could have happened. It may not have been the same people as I'm showing, but if not them, then others. If you look at the evidence, it could have been something like this.\" Viewed through that lens, \"JFK\" is a provocative thriller that should be seen in a double feature with \"The Parallax View\", which also dissects the mechanics of conspiracy and presents it as \"business as usual\" for those who deal in that currency.",

            "content": "When I saw JFK, I realized I wasn't seeing just another film based upon real events. JFK was an eye opening film that told another side to the assassination of our 35th president. It featured two of my favorite actors; Kevin Costner who played Jim Garrison and Tommy Lee Jones who portrayed Clay Shaw both played an important role in bringing facts to light that may or may not be true. Jim Garrison was responsible for bringing the only prosecution in the JFK assassination. Garrison didn't have it easy looking for answers to his questions; he had to battle a lot of governmental red tape, and he still didn't get his answers. There were other Hollywood heavyweights who had added their names to this film besides Costner and Jones: Jack Lemmon, Donald Sutherland, the late John Candy, Gary Oldman, Joe Pesci, Walter Matthau, and Kevin Bacon. These actors might not have had major parts but they are tremendous talents and they all had important contributions to get this story out in the open so the American people could make their mind up as I did. In my opinion, this is one event that had to be brought to light in film so we could visually see what the real story had been on November 22, 1963; it also gave me information to base my decision on whether or not there was a cover-up or among the ranks of the government or not. With the flashbacks to that fateful day in November, I understood what the movie was about. Oliver Stone did a flawless job in recreating the events surrounding the JFK assassination. After watching JFK, I have reason to believe there was a conspiracy but I'm not sure because it seemed so one sided. This was definitely an eye opening history lesson that was told that everybody should see.",

Even if you don't have an interest in the JFK assassination, I think that any fan of film should watch this and appreciate it for what it is: An incredible piece of filmmaking made by a man at the peak of his powers.So what is good about this film?Well plenty. From the ground up it smacks of quality. The script is fantastic (and there is a LOT of it). It has an incredible cast who all deliver astonishing performances (Joe Pesci is amazing) - there isn't a weak performance in this film. The photography is fantastic and the way the film is put together (with incredible editing than won an oscar) - at times the line between documentary footage and filmed footage becomes blurred and this creates an unerring sense of realism. It has a superb soundtrack from John Williams, largely consisting of horns that just oozes passion. - and that is this film in a nutshell really. It's passionate. Oliver Stone weaves his magic with such incredible vigour that by the time the film finishes, you are left feeling half exhausted.So what's wrong with it? Well after you have seen it, you need to remind yourself that this is a film - and that's all it is. It is not a definitive documentary account of the events surrounding JFK's assassination, but merely a take on events by a man who has a clear idea of what he himself believes.I think one of the reasons why this film caused such a stir when it was released - and still promotes debate, is that it WORKS. Oliver Stone has made a fantastically powerful film here that for me just underlines how great the medium can be. If you haven't seen it, then I urge to get a copy, sit down without interruption and watch it. Then you can decide for yourself.",

Anyone who has ever fired a bolt action rifle knows that this is somewhere between difficult and impossible - a lot nearer to impossible.Another thing: I have never heard a satisfactory explanation of why Ruby killed Oswald, not even one.

I even agree with the comparison to Riefenstahl.  As I sat in the theater, I said to myself that this was the greatest piece of propaganda I had ever seen.  I meant it as a compliment, for cinema is replete with messages that aim to shift attitudes and manufacture beliefs.  Most do not do the job as well as Stone's film.That said, I have rethought my position.  If Stone included so many overlapping and competing theories [and assassins!] in one film, mustn't he have known that each new possibility would dilute the probability that previous suspects were responsible? Think of Oliver Stone in front of that federal jury: just as each new conspirator that Garrison named created a reasonable doubt about Clay Shaw's role in the matter, so too every new \"force\" that Stone identified made it less and less probable that the list of suspects could conspire successfully.  If Stone seems to draw to Dealey Plaza every group of nuts extant in 1963, that makes it hard to understand how they managed not to shoot or at least expose one another.So, suppose the movie is about how conspiratorial thinking defeats itself. Once a Jim Garrison is prepared to disbelieve official accounts--and, boy, does the Warren Commission invite disbelief!--then vistas of suspects are opened up.  If Lee Harvey Oswald is a patsy, his background suggests multiple agencies who could have used him.  If one follows the money [as in \"All the President's Men\" or Jerry McGuire], then a host of powerful dudes stood to benefit from JFK's demise.  [Granted, most of the well-heeled stood to profit no matter who was president!]I appreciated the movie when first I saw it.  I enjoy it annually now.  I appreciate most the sheer vertigo that ensues when one begins to doubt authorities.

[Isn't it \"funny\" that YOU haven't heard much about that trial and its outcome?]. Naively, Mark Lane assumed the federal trial (which featured subpoenaed witnesses who were CIA officials at the time of JFK's assassination) would settle the issue of JFK's murder.  I said, \"naively.\"Oliver Stone and Lane disagreed on content and certain characters.  Lane insisted on complete accuracy while Stone insisted on artistic control. Stone won.  Lane did not wish his name to appear in the credits to preserve his credibility (but Lane and Stone still parted friends).Having said that, JFK is after all a brilliantly made film.  Also, the bad press received by the film was more of the American journalistic Establishment covering its self-righteous collective ass;  taking offense at an effectively executed in-your-face conspiracy movie.  Perhaps not so oddly, when the movie was first released the Establishment attacked the film's premise (based on \"Plausible Denial\") rather than its art ... which SERIOUS and impartial critics had to agree was good.If nothing else, The Warren Commission Report is clearly a conspiratorial work.  As far as the men who murdered Kennedy in Texas... obviously they got away with it.  Stone's movie is rather mild on that score.  But it is excellent theater and a  good suspenseful mystery.",

That actor was actually in this movie, Donald Sutherland. Garrison was not simply solving a puzzle, he was in a chess match with the best and brightest. He later said if he had it to do over again he wouldn't have, as it cost his family and himself too much emotionally. But the match ended in a draw, although Shaw was found not guilty, the course of the prosecution left its own record, here rather melodramatically presented by Stone.

The film however only improves with subsequent viewings and for J.F.K. conspiracy theorists (like myself) it is both entertaining and informative, and makes a great companion piece to the director's other masterpiece \"Nixon\".Now all thats needed is for the U.S. Government to release all outstanding CIA files,uncensored of course, and let the world know the truth!(although we all know that will never happen)",

To offer no disclaimer that the film is essentially fictional is akin to deceiving the viewing public, flirting dangerously close to libel, distorting history and exploiting a tragic event for commercial gain. The inclusion of a known historic event (albeit tragic) in an openly acknowledged work of fiction allows some potential for entertainment and perhaps even enlightenment - thereby protecting the work from being merely exploitative. If the work however pretends to be something it is not, then the inclusion of a known historic event in its narrative may justifiably cause offence. I confess I enjoyed the film enormously but the pleasure is a guilty one.

CIA (and in broader sense Mafia, which wouldn't have been able to act without CIA's sanction and coordination anyway)did not kill Kennedy for the reason Kennedy would take the money away from the Eisenhower 'military-industrial complex' but for the reason he had not only screwed CIA during the Bay of Pigs but also shifted his blame and planned to break it up into thousand pieces. In that sense Kennedy was a consummate son of a bitch, ingrate and dastardly.At the time of his assassination Vietnam was only one of many 'Communist-threatened' areas of interest for the U.S. administration--it only became THE issue only after Johnson (who had had the knowledge of the plot all along and gave the final sanction at the Murchison meeting )became the president and put into action the escalation in Vietnam as a reward to the Texas Oil, ultra-right, 'military', and 'industrial' complex that helped him to power.

            "content": "The interesting thing about this film to me is not so much the conspiracy theories that it cites, but rather its portrayal of Jim Garrison.  I myself am not a proponent of any of the conspiracy theories cited in this film. I tend to regard them in the same way I regard urban legends or sightings of Elvis.  However, the films account of Jim Garrison's activities in relation to the trial of Clay Shaw is definitely of interest to me.Having read Garrison's book, `On the Trail of the Assassins' and various other accounts of the JFK assassination, I find that the movie only serves to support my belief that Garrison's case against Clay Shaw was utter fiction.  There really wasn't anything even remotely resembling hard evidence that Clay Shaw had anything to do with the JFK assassination. There are indications, however, that Garrison probably singled Shaw out because of his homosexuality.  It's pretty well documented that Garrison was homophobic and this is even referenced in the movie when his wife cites it as the reason Garrison is going after Clay Shaw.  In fact, in his interview with Shaw in the movie, he puts Shaw on the spot for hiring a male prostitute before he even mentions Lee Harvey Oswald.  (The character played by Kevin Bacon in this film is fictional by the way.  There was no Willie O'Keefe) What bearing does Shaw's homosexuality have on the Kennedy assassination?  You tell me!  Another thing you notice in the movie is that Garrison's witnesses all seem to be from the bottom layer of society.  In real life, his only real witness (if you can call him that) was a man called Perry Russo whose deposition was initially taken under the influence of sodium pentathol.  Until then, Russo never even mentioned knowing Clay Shaw, and the name he gave, Clay Bertrand, was used by Garrison as evidence of Shaw's guilt.  (There was never any hard evidence that Shaw ever used that alias, although Garrison insists that it was given by Shaw when he was arrested) The point is, the more you know factually about Garrison, the more the film shows him not to be some kind of Shakespearian hero, but rather a corrupt and paranoid man with extreme charisma.  It's also worth noting that if Clay Shaw hadn't died of cancer (not mysteriously as the film suggests) he'd have probably won the civil lawsuit he'd brought against Garrison for wrongful persecution.  It's also worth mentioning that Shaw was financially broken by the legal expenses involved in defending himself against Garrison's lawsuit.  The film makes no mention of this, of course as it would not serve Stone's ends to make a documentary about how Garrison effectively ruined Shaw's life.The frustrating thing about this movie is that since it is cinematically well crafted, and the performances are compelling, it is also grossly misleading.  Aside from making Garrison into a hero, it makes Oswald look like some kind of complex character straight out of the Manchurian Candidate.  (A movie I'm sure Stone loved...I certainly did.)  Oswald was a bitter little man who wanted to be a big man.  I saw no indications of this in the film.  Costner's portrayal of Garrison was actually more accurate than I expected as it gives indications of all the aspects of his character I've cited above.I'd say if you don't know a lot about the Kennedy assassination, read up on it before you subject yourself to this movie.  In spite of it's implausible theories, it can convince the uninformed of some very inaccurate things.",

I saw this film when I was 13 years old not even close to be aging appropriate and it blew me away. A 3 hour film feels like a 2 hour journey into the descent of America. The cinematography won an Oscar and Oliver won Best Director at the Golden Globes.The movie has been bashed for taking a number of things from creative licensing of characters, to wild theories and being propaganda against the government. While its up to you to decide that or not, it does not change the fact this case happened. All the information about magic bullets, JFK's brain missing, the assaults on Jim Garrison and the players involved in New Orleans are all true. That is what is lost in all the complaining that a good chunk of this actually happened. I would also suggest people listen to Oliver Stone's audio commentary done a few years later to get a better idea where some of the facts and myths lie. The hobos just turned out to be hobos, but his Nightline interview is very revealing where he was attacked like Garrison was. The commentary is worth the price of the DVD alone.As for the movie, it is one of the last films out there that requires you to think and think hard. Even if 10% to 20% is Hollywood, the other 80% to 90% is pretty scarily true especially the Oswald stuff. You probably have the greatest group of actors ever in this picture. Oldman, Tommy Lee, Costner, Martin Sheen, Sissy, Jack Lemon and Joe Peschi. You even have Walter Mathuew and John Candy in small roles. You will never get that much talent into one film ever again and its probably due to the talent this film was made. All the actors sans Sutherland have a passion about this film. Sutherland has not helped matters saying its all nonsense even after knowing he was playing a real Colonel. If this movie was done in the 70s or 80s, everyone would be black listed especially Stone who probably has not fully recovered from this film. Yet, it is a heroic effort about heroic people. Garrison and his staff are the real heroes who did win the case years later in the arena of public opinion. Most polls show a belief that Kennedy was killed by a conspiracy, its just which one. That was the point of the case and it like the movie succeed all expectations.After reading the FAQ about this movie, someone did a great smear job about this film. All of those sans the technical parts should be deleted. The Beltran/Shaw confession did happen which was the turn point of the case.",

Before this movie, I thought it was Oswald and it never crossed my mind that it couldn't have been. But after seeing this movie, you'll believe how dumb we all were to believe in the story our government gave us on who killed JFK! He only wanted peace with Vietnam but our money thristy government wanted war to get more money so... they Kill Him!!! But the story is not just the best part of the movie. The film had an Unbelievable cast!!! No one did a bad job in this film. With the film being full of celebrities, you know it's got potential. Also, Oliver Stone did a Master work of art with this film. The filming, cinematography, editing, music, everything was flawless! It brought new awarenss in our country, and at the end of the movie it said Congress was to review which files were to be revealed and which were to be never shown to the public due to the making of this film. I was amazed! Not by that, but by the film! I gave it 10 stars and it deserves it. I'm not saying it deserved Best Picture rather then Silence of the Lambs, but Oliver Stone definitely deserved Best Director!",

I was impressed by Kevin Costners closing speech at the trial. Perhaps a bit too emotional for the European mind in a case like this, but then again - what American doesn't become emotional, when the credibility and integrity of their government is under question? And here comes the spoiler: Governor Connally, sitting right in front of president Kennedy in his car, cries out in the middle of the horrible fracas:\"My God! They are going to kill us all!\" They? What circumstance made the good governor refer to the shooter/shooters in plural? I was surprised and disappointed to find that neither the Warren Commission nor Jim Garrison regarded the actions and statements of those in the motorcade worth while to investigate: to me it seems that at least a few of the individuals present knew what was going to happen, and where.

            "content": "One of my favorite directors is Oliver Stone, who is either called a conspiracy-riddled nutcase or a genius, depending on who you ask. Stone's 1991 film JFK shows me that he is the latter. I loved this film. In fact, I would have to say it is one of the best movies I have ever seen in my life.Released surrounded in controversey, JFK tells the story of a New Orleans District Attourney Jim Garrison (Kevin Costner), who was so rattled by John F. Kennedy's death that he decides to do his own investigation, and it takes him everywhere from New Orleans' homosexual underworld to the steps of the Lincoln Monument in Washington, D.C. where Garrison meets the mysterious Mr. X (Donald Sutherland).Garrison then tries to convict one Clay Shaw (Tommy Lee Jones in his Oscar-nominated performance) of conspirating with Lee Harvey Oswald. Through the film, we see Stone's conspiracy theory begin to make sense, and we see his attempt to show us, the viewer, what he thinks of this event in history.\nStone's take on the assassination is incredible. He brings everything forward to the table, and this is the first film Stone made where he started using his rapid-fire editing style, switching back and forth from different film stocks, such as still photos, black and white film, color film, 16 mm stock, 35 mm, and more. This really keeps the viewer on edge, and it better -- this is one long film, the director's cut racking in at 3 hours and twenty-five minutes. The film flies by us, however, because of the Oscar-winning film editing.All in all, I would have to say JFK is one of the best films of all time, tying with Pulp Fiction as my favorite film of the ninties. It's brilliant. See it. Now.",

He always does, which is why most of his storylines get a little tedious. True to form, he rarely passes up a chance to take a shot at his enemies, real or imagined, whenever he can. But the thing I found most interesting about this 1991 film was how our hero, Mr Garrison, was forced to deal with every obstruction the White House and other gov't agencies could throw at him. He was slandered by the establishment press, was harrassed by the IRS, and was forced to deal with a coordinated campaign, engineered by the Administration and the Justice Dept, to hinder his investigation and discredit him at every turn.\nGiven the recent misadventures of a different prosecuting attorney and another administration, one can't help but notice the parallels. As Mr Garrison would  say (very loosely paraphrased), \"We are now on the other side of the looking glass. From now on, black is white, and right is wrong.\"\nI, for one, would be curious to know how much screen time Mr. Stone would invest on this aspect of the story if he were making the film today.

It runs at such a fast pace and I found myself on the edge of my seat as DA Jim Garrison (played wonderfully by Kevin Costner) and his team uncover events and leads that all point to a sinister plot to murder John F. Kennedy in 1963. Tommy Lee Jones and Joe Pesci are utterly brilliant. Gary Oldman as Lee Harvey Oswald left me speechless - a British actor playing one of (if not) the most notorious alleged killers in US history and he pulled it off beautifully.The scene between Costner and Donald Sutherland as \"X\" - a former Pentagon official is one of the best scenes of cinema. The editing is sublime and Sutherland's delivery of crucial information is breathtaking.The ending left me angry and dissatisfied that nobody has ever been prosecuted for this awful crime.

            "content": "Oliver Stone is the first director of the post 70's generation of autuers to have his own distinct style.  That style has never been more effective.  His message has never been more important of contraversial.  That message hits us at America's quietly descending core, a piece of what this country stands for.  Oliver Stone literally looks us in the face and tells us that this country is what we make of it, and if we step back and let power and greed run the country for us, that power will be abused.  And it has.  And it was. Stone combines all the most plausable theories into one massive opus that makes a powerful movie. Although specifics are distorted and some \"facts\" may have been omitted, the truth lies within what he shows and embellishes. The constant jump cut and total scattering of ideas and theories in this film lend the past a frustrated feeling of distance.  The film is three hours, but the pacing is so fast and relentless, it just glides by like a slide show at a million miles a minute.  You have to watch it twice to catch it all.  I must also add, whatever is not true in this film, and that's a lot less than many may be led to believe, this movie is not a documentary. It uses the past and creates a conflicting myth to the one that is official, in school text books, but only believed by 30% of the nation.  This time period was so ill handled and miss documented, that an alterior myth is something special and daring.  It just may inspire people to look up what's official and what's not, what's real, or fictional.  And this applies to both the Warren Report and Oliver Stones' Collage.  It may even get a few people to demand the truth, to vote, to take part in a government that revolves around that very action.  This is a noble film that never demands the audience believe what it sees. It show a completely opposite perspective that 70% of us have thought possible since that fateful day.  It's a great film achievement in every sense of the phrase.  It is Oliver Stone's best.",

Tippet and if David Ferrie were alive Stone would have been sued. That whole palm print from the morgue was disproved years ago. Probably most conspicuously is the complete absence of Garrison's homosexual angle to the conspiracy and assassination. And whiny Kevin Costner, he's whined through every movie he's made, was totally miscast as the glum faced, shell shocked Jim Garrison.Stone picks and chooses what he wants for facts. He's a distorter and at worst a lier. If you want a good work of fiction watch this flick, if you want a good work with historical facts read Vincent Bugliosi's book Reclaiming History.",

Not because it tells the truth of the Kennedy-assassination (who can purport to do that?), but because it alerts people to the mysteries surrounding the murder of JFK. The movie cannot be said to tell a true story; indeed the weaving together of fact and fiction is a dangerous path, because some people may believe that the movie is *the* truth. Nevertheless, for people who are aware of the problems concerning the investigation into Kennedy's assassination, the film is an interesting summing-up of the major theories, concerning the reasons for and perpetrators of Kennedy's murder. Sometimes the movie does go a bit overboard (the implication of LBJ to me seems to be unfounded), but overall it remains quite truthful to most of the theories. Personally I believe that Kennedy was the victim of assassination. I've done quite a bit of reading on the subject, and far from being able to tell \"the truth\", I do believe that Jim Garrison was onto something, and the Garrison-theories still seem to me like the most likely.\nFor people who are aware of the ethical problems of weaving together documentary footage and fictional film as Stone does, JFK is a great movie to sum up the major theories about the Kennedy-assassination. For those who aren't aware of these problems, the movie is dangerous in its manipulation of \"the truth\".",

As a master piece of cinematography this movie JFK is on a par with Natural born killers, of course its a completely different movie... but there are parallels: political contexts, the role of the media, violence etc. As Natural borne killers is a film about individuals doing murder, by serial killings, JFK is mainly about political murder. The film is mainly based on Jim Garrisons book \"On the trail of the assassins\". I have read this book \u2013 and its a great book in its tantalizing plot. I can not say that either the book or the film is what happened in Dallas ergo the killing of president Kennedy, what I can say is that the film is a great adaptation of a book that was being accused of being a insane mans egotistical search for notoriety. Hollywood changed this claim in a big way and gave Jim Garrison the pat on the back that this former DA deserves. Whatever the truth may be, Garrison did his job, by this I mean he did his job, like all civil servants ought to do, with total disregard for personal benefit, in search for the truth, over and beyond his professions stated responsibility. The film has some some very deep implications about power and the almighty's control of the media, and this subject should be discussed all he more since the medias roll in world politics is ever greater in steering opinions, morals and the way we think about history If you haven't seen this movie you ought to, and if you have seen it read Garrisons book.",

I love the broad range of interesting characters, the amazing sets, and the historical significance.Kevin Costner stars as New Orleans D.A. Jim Garrison, who, in the years following the Kennedy Assassination, conducts an investigation thats sole purpose is to find the true killers of President John F. Kennedy.  Along the way, he meets some of the most diverse characters I've ever seen in a movie. They include David Ferrie (Joe Pesci), a extra-nervous anti-Castro radical; Guy Bannister (Ed Asner), a sleazy P.I. who ran guns for an invasion of Cuba; Jack Martin (Jack Lemmon), Bannister's assistant; Willie O'Keefe, a gay male prostitute who heard conversations of many of the key players in the \"conspiracy\"; \"X\" (Donald Sutherland), an anonymous defense department official who believes the assassination was a conspiracy in the government; and Dean Andrews (John Candy), a New Orleans lawyer who was approached to defend Lee Harvey Oswald by a mysterious man.  Eventually, Garrison arrests businessman Clay Shaw (Tommy Lee Jones) and a thrilling, vivid court case ensues, whose verdict is not known until the last minute of the film.All of the performers in the film portray their characters with equal gusto, and any hint of the actor or actress is forgotten; they become their characters.  Kevin Costner has a good accent and great screen presence. Sissy Spacek is also good as his wife, Liz Garrison.  Tommy Lee Jones, wearing a humorous wig, brings a certain class to his role.  The late John Candy, in one of his only dramatic roles, is wonderful as the jive-ing Dean Andrews.  Gary Oldman is perfectly cast as Lee Harvey Oswald, and his attitude and appearance perfectly reflect the accused assassin.\nIn conclusion, 'JFK' is not only a history lesson, but it is also an entertaining period piece.  Despite its 'R' rating for extreme language and some violence, it is an excellent film, and, in my opinion, one of Oliver Stone's best.",

Attorney Jim Garrison isn't satisfied by the federal government's explanation on the events, and starts his own case on the assassination. What he finds is something more horrible than he could ever imagine.Oliver Stone's JFK is an interesting film on many levels, firstly for the fact that it ever got made at all. The book is based on the testimony of District Attorney Jim Garrison on the conspiracy theory surrounding the Kennedy assassination. It's a miracle this book was written at all if everything in it is true as there were government officials from the CIA to the FBI who would be more than happy to silence Mr. Garrison permanently. It's this aspect of Garrison's life that the film partly explores, as he struggles to build up a case against Clay Shaw whilst trying to raise a family and remain a dutiful husband, all the while dealing with attempts on his life and being slaughtered by the media.Secondly, the film is interesting for the fact that it was released by a major Hollywood studio, as the material is not what you might call \"gentle\". This is a hardcore attack on the U.S. government, including, among others, ex-president Lyndon Johnson and the CIA. It's not the sort of thing a studio releases lightly, which is why I give credit to Warner Bros. for taking such a huge risk, and also to the actors who appeared in it. I expected a whole lot of uncredited roles for actors who might fear outrage because of appearing in such a political movie, but everyone was credited.Speaking of actors, all the performances in this film were excellent. Everyone including Kevin Costner (who gives the performance of his career), Joe Pesci, Gary Oldman, Tommy Lee Jones, Vincent D'Onofrio, Sissy Spacek, Donald Sutherland, Jack Lemmon and Michael infest their performances with heart and emotion.

I liked his performance almost as much as I enjoyed his performance in Dances With Wolves.The supporting cast is also very masterful too as well. Tommy Lee Jones (in a very small role) was very good whenever he was in the film talking. other performances By Kevin Bacon, Joe Pesci, Sissy Spacek, and Michael Rooker were excellent. I loved the 20 minute scene with Donald Sutherland talking to Kevin Coster about how the conspiracy was done.We need to find out the truth about this, and this movie really does show key facts that Kennedy wasn't just killed by Oswald. It was actually impossible. This movie is one of the best \"true stories\" movies i have ever, other then \"The Insider\", which doesn't even match this excellent film.This film really, honestly deserved the Oscars it won and i wish it could of won more. This movie is great, rent once you have the chance. 9 out of 10",

A REPRESENTATION of not even fact, but theory. Personally, I think there was more to it than a guy in a book depository, but one can not draw solid conclusions from this movie. Oliver Stone wanted everyone to start thinking that a conspiracy was involved in his murder, in order to accomplish that he had to do go beyond even possibly what he believes and know that anyone watching will at least meet half way, believing some things and dismissing others. Overall, it was a fantastically made MOVIE. But that's what it was. The movie itself is BASED on true facts that occurred (the trial and everything that happened in the movie more or less happened) and the theories in the movie are displayed for the audience to decide upon (even with a strong bias). So make your own decision, no one will really ever know what happened except for the man or men who pulled the trigger and whoever, if anyone, contracted that person. I wouldn't get too hot about the whole topic anyways. Closure is over rated, trust me.",

But, at least, he stirred up some strong emotions in film goers, as well as reawakening people's interest in the assassination of John F Kennedy, which resulted in thousands of previously classified documents relating to that event being made public.

            "content": "I have been interested in the JFK assassination for over 10 years, but after seeing Oliver Stone's movie I found myself needing to do as much research into what happened as I could. Reading books, researching online and even visiting Dealey Plaza. Even before seeing the movie my thoughts were that no man could've made 3 perfect shots from the TBD in such little time with a piece of crap Mannlicher Carcano, a rifle which has since been slated for being an almost unworkable piece of junk.Stone's movie is thought provoking, tense, and dramatic. Filled with a star studded cast like Costner (who gives his best ever performance as Garrison), Sutherland, Pesci, Lee-Jones, Oldman it flows seamlessly, add to that a brilliant score by John Williams who is a master at film scores. The courtroom scene is probably my favourite part of any movie I've seen, a brilliant speech by Costner who nailed this part down to a T. None of his previous performances have topped this oneNow I wont say everything in the film is 100% accurate, but the bits that are accurate make you think hard about what really happened in Dealey Plaza that day. I was already a believer that the Warren Commission was a whitewash full of inconsistencies, this film and the book \"Crossfire\" by Jim Marrs confirmed it for me. And the single bullet theory sold by Mr Spector was so hard to swallow, that one single bullet could pass through 2 peoples bodies and change direction many times, was quite frankly laughable. There was a conspiracy, its just who was involved and how many were in on it is the big question.Was it the Mafia?? The CIA? Anti-Castro Cubans? The Russians?? Do yourself a favour after seeing this film, research as much as you can and you may find the answer you are looking for. I have my own theory as to what really happened but that would take up pages and pages of words so I shall leave it there.Suffice to say JFK is a must see for anyone who's interested in the assassination. My only gripe was that it was a bit long to watch in one sitting, its a film you have to watch 2 or 3 times so you can absorb all the info it gives you. Top marks Mr Stone, keep fighting the fight Oliver!",

I also liked Kevin Costner in the film, his acting here was authentic and waaay better than \"Waterworld\" or even \"Tin Cup.\"  I didn't like Joe Pesci or Sissy Spacik in the movie, but it wasn't bad enough to detract from the overall value of the film.  The camera work and use of file and faux file footage really brought it home for me.  The closing montage of various footages in such a rapid succession let you see Costner's character's train of thought in a way that is often hard to portray. When Costner was demonstrating the \"Magic Bullet Theory\" I could not help but chuckle to my self as I was reminded of the Keith Hernandez \"Radioactive Spit\" episode. 7 out of 10 stars.",

            "content": "I've got to say that this is truly my second favorite movie of all time (with the first being Silence of the Lambs).  I was initially attracted to it because it is a \"period film\"-typical of Oliver Stone-and because I am a fan of his other work (Loved Born of the Fourth of July also) I was not disappointed in any way-this film was brilliant.  The characters are very three-dimensional. Even if you aren't a \"conspiracy buff\", this is a very, very believable movie.Are some of the conclusions far-fetched? Is the story a bit one-sided? Perhaps. Stone is famous for that. This was one assassination-I don't believe that the Mob, LBJ, the anti-Communists, and the pro-Vietnam people could have all have Kennedy snuffed out. But you have to admit that this movie makes you THINK, which is kind of rare these days.The events are told in a very effective method-the beginning with Walter Cronkite is great.  Costner is superb as Garrison, and I absolutely loved all the \"cameos\"-Jack Lemmon, Ed Asner,Kevin Bacon-geez, I could probably make a shorter list of who is NOT in this movie. My favorites are Joe Pesci's character and Donald Sutherland, who is always good as mysterious-too bad that Fletcher Prouty (the supposed \"real\" Mr. X) couldn't have shed some more light on the role of this character in the whole \"conspiracy theory\" in his book.  Hats off as well to Gary Oldman-no one else could have done Oswald and gotten away with it like he did.After watching this for the first time (in the theater), I have read almost all of the books that Stone used to make this film. Although most of the story is written from Garrison's \"On the Trail of the Assassins\" and Jim Marrs'book, you can definitely see that Stone did his homework on this one.I think that every American should see this film at least once. This is an absolutely facinating movie-you will not be the same after seeing it, I guarantee. Like I said before, whether you believe the story or not, it makes you think.",

Also, he more than insinuates that the country would have stayed out of Vietnam and been a virtual Shangri-La.  Absolute garbage on all counts.  This film does an injustice to the softer-headed people in this country, whose opinions are shaped solely by moving images.As I left the theater after viewing 'JFK,' I overhead someone, also exiting, who said that they were embarrassed to be an American.

            "content": "Oliver Stone's `JFK' is a frustrating little movie. Kevin Costner turns in one of his better performances, which nearly breaks the mold of his limited capabilities as an actor, as Jim Garrison, the D.A. who tried to prove in court that Lee Harvey Oswald didn't act alone shooting JFK on November 22, 1963. Other, better actors turn up in and out of the three-hour movie; Gary Oldman is cutely sinister as Oswald viewed in black and white flashbacks, Joe Pesci is an agitated leader of one of the botched Cuban refugee training programs (prior to the Bay of Pigs) who may or may not have known who killed the president, and Tommy Lee Jones is the Southern businessman Clay Shaw who Costner accuses of having secretly worked for the CIA in the time of the assassination. Donald Sutherland, Jack Lemmon, Vincent D'Onofrio, Kevin Bacon and Walter Matthau all turn up in quaint cameos as well, but the only real constants in the movie's progression (meaning, flashbacks notwithstanding) are Costner and Sissy Spacek as his wife.The picture is spectacularly shot and edited, and won deserved Oscars in both categories. All the actors do a fine job, particularly Pesci and Costner, who like I said, almost gets past his creative rut of playing frowning, na\u00efve boy scouts (see Field of Dreams, The Untouchables, etc). Stone offers a menu, if you will, of conspiracy theories behind the assassination - to generalize, you can pick from the Cubans, LBJ or the Mafia. While these little vignettes are sensationally delivered, none of them really propel the story forward, but rather provide interesting interludes in the main plot, which is fairly thin: Garrison wants to prove that Oswald either didn't do it at all, or didn't act alone, and ends up bringing Tommy Lee Jones to court because of it. His obsession with the president's death provides a little rocky domestic territory, as his marriage and home life get pushed out of the way, but this too is presented as being unimportant in the big picture.What is the big picture? Aside from some potentially convincing ballistics information, such as a technical breakdown of Arlen Specter's `magic bullet' theory, Stone didn't really convince me that the JFK assassination was an intricately developed plot to serve an ulterior political motive - maybe that there was a second shooter, at best. His offering of theories, insights as to why the Cubans might have done it, etc, in exchange for evidence supporting the arrest of Oswald didn't sway me rationally like he may or may not have hoped it would. One does not get the opportunity to rethink history, but rather to look at it and try to tie it together as possible with what limited information they have. I guess my point is that some of the proposals in this movie are a little too far-fetched for their own good. As a movie? Well, it makes for an almost exciting, definitely watchable investigation, moving at a grueling dramatic pace that holds the viewer's attention very neatly - until the bizarrely flat final act of the movie. Costner's Garrison makes a staggering speech in the courtroom to prove not so much that Clay Shaw was involved in the assassination, but simply that there's more to the killing than meets the eye. This is a dramatically potent scene, I guess, but it's uneven in comparison to the rest of the movie and makes it more of a tidy presentation and less of a film; as if the two were mutually exclusive. `JFK' is most worth watching due to its clean and engaging management of information, its performances, and its technical proficiency, but not for its quality as an artistic or especially galvanizing motion picture.",

For many years following the trial, further inquiries that would have put the matter to rest were discouraged. Understandably, the conspiracy theory remained dormant for decades. Indeed, director Oliver Stone, too young at the time of the assassination - and given his proclivity to denounce government and big business - was much too disinclined to be objective; therefore, it was not unexpected of him to present the story with Garrison as a martyr. In that regard, 'JFK' can be regarded as unreliable and, indeed, dangerous history. The fact is, however, that 'JFK' should be appreciated primarily as a sophisticated, complex and masterful three-hour narrative which few contemporary filmmakers (with the possible exception of Milos Forman and Martin Scorcese) could have accomplished with equal skill. No character is superfluous, the casting, flawless, the pacing and editing, both impeccable.

The ensemble cast is excellent as well.  Kevin Bacon, Tommy Lee Jones, Joe Pesci, Walter Matteau, Donald Sutherland, Wayne Knight, Sissy Spacek and Jack Lemmon all give outstanding performances, mostly in walk-on roles. Gary Oldman plays such a good Lee Harvey Oswald it's scary.The movie is based on \"On the Trail of Assasins\" by Jim Garrison. Garrison begins to investigate the murder of the president, and he soon finds that he's getting more than he bargained for.  He unravels a twisting tale of secrets and clues in his attempt to discover what really happened on November 22, 1963.  Cuba, the mob, the FBI and CIA, the White House - nobody is spared in Garrison's investigation.Stone has put together a visual masterpiece.  His incredible blending of movie footage and real-life footage makes you wonder what is real and what isn't.  In addition, John William's score is, as always, awesome.The big question viewers of this movie always have is: how accurate is Stone's conspiracy theory?  Upon its release, it received critism from many sources, including THE GOVERNMENT ITSELF (perhaps because someone finally caught on to them?)  It is hard to say if Stone is completely correct, but there are certain, undeniable facts.  There is the magic bullet theory, which Coster shows must be a lie because it is simply impossible.  There is also real footage of the assassination which shows Kennedy's head moving back and to the left, meaning the shot had to come from the front right. This film proves that Oswald - shooting from behind and above Kennedy - could not have been the lone shooter.  (In fact, Stone argues that Oswald didn't fire a single shot that day).  These facts and others show that Stone hits most, if not all, his marks.This is one of the best movies of all time and a movie that all Americans should see!",

Now, this does not go without saying that if one has no interest in JFK, history or anything else along those lines then they might find this film of little interest.This film really made me think.  In any high school history book, you're going to read that Lee Harvey Oswald killed JFK because he was a marxist fanatic.  That's it.  This film throws all your misinformation about the assassination of JFK right out the window, and it does so with great entertainment.Kevin Costner carries the film very well.  Tommy Lee Jones and Joe Pesci create wonderful characters, especially Joe Pesci as David Ferrie.  For me though, Donald Sutherland, calling himself X, the deepthroat-esque character in the film was really interesting to listen to.  No other actor could have given that compelling of a performance.  His subtleness is what is able to sell the character and the story that he tells Garrison about(Costner).Overall, i felt this film was very interesting and insightful.  If you're looking for a great compelling drama or anything having to do with JFK, history, or conspiracies and how they're formed, see this great Oliver Stone film 9 stars out of 10!",

There are remarkable parallels between the Kennedy assassination and 9/11 in that both appear to be false-flag operations that misdirect the public in another direction. It is almost as though they are both based on chapter 3 of the CIA handbook for Black Ops. As for \"factual errors\" that are being referenced by some reviewers, one thing always associated with black ops is a psy-war effort to attempt to throw fog and false leads into anyone who would pursue the truth. It is done so that the average viewer will give up in confusion, perhaps not buying the \"official\" story, but neither giving complete credence to the alternatives. I have to say that I was disappointed by JFK when it was first released. At that time, I thought Oliver Stone was a propaganda artist. I must say his version has held up over time much better than the Warren Commission, which is a laughing stock now. In the context of 9/11, JFK is positively chilling. Costner's speeches at the end ring loud and clear and he could as easily been talking about 9/11 as JFK. When Costner talks about LBJ getting Brown and Root a Billion-dollar contract for dredging Cam Ranh Bay, my hair stood on end. I was in Vietnam in 1968, lost some friends there. Now with a Kellog added, Halliburton's \"lucky\" subsidiary is still raking in billions in war profits for that most connected of companies, but it is more blatant than ever. Ike's warning has come true with a vengeance. Split hairs all you want about the facts in this movie, it has an important message that resonates more today than it ever could 16 years ago.",

Not Oswald the accused assassin you see Oswald interact with his wife Marina whom he brought back from russia but his relationship with his two infant daughters June and Rachel who he loved very much this movie is the only movie that showed Lee Harvey Oswald as a man not an assassin or a patsy or man posesed by the spirit of Dr. Sam",

            "content": "This is my second favorite movie right next to \"The Green Mile\". Oliver Stone and Jim Garrison fought for what they thought was justice and Stone made a great movie about it. The beginning is one of the best in cinematic history.Don't take every word of the movie for fact, of course (O'Keefe and Mr.X are composite characters, final speech never happened, Camp street/Lafayette street thing also not above doubt). But as far as theories about the Kennedy assassination go, it's the one that I think makes the most sense.The guys who (according to Stone) killed Kennedy will never be tried. They are;1; Probably dead by now.2; Probably above the law.Stone condemned them in front of History, which is all we can do. Why couldn't Kennedy have been killed by a conspiracy? Why not? Ever read Machiavelli? They are no ethics in politics. We hold as fact that Julius Caesar (along with a whole bunch of roman emperors) died as a result of political intrigue. Catherine the Great murdered her own husband to get power. Her grandson Alexander the first murdered his own father and Peter the Great killed his own son. Archeologists now think king Tut and Raamses III might have been murdered by members of their court. Not even the popes and Tibetan monks were above that sort of thing! Why couldn't it happen in 1960's United States? Democracy? I'm sorry to say this, but the only difference between democracy and dictature in that matter is how many people you have to fool in order to gain power. The difference is that this time, we're the ones being fooled, pretty hard to consider! We tend to have blind faith in our government (whatever country is the one we call ours). If they don't protect us (especially in war time or in a tensed international situation), who will? Stone's great merit was to make us doubt. Remind us to never leave our brains at the door. At the end of his monologue, Costner seems to break the fourth wall and speak to us as he says: \"It's up to you\".In the end, I say everyone has the right to disagree with me, Stone or with any other \"fried conspiracy theorists\" (that, by the way, are also citizens, even the ones believing in UFO stuff) but those who compare this movie to \"Birth of a Nation\" (a movie that pratically resurrected the KKK) or to Riefenstal's work show extremely bad taste, underestimate the negative impact those movies had and are insulting more their own intelligence than Stone's work.",

My advice to anyone about to watch this film is treat it as fiction.

As a dramatisation of history it is very successful, but it is eclipsed by the documentary JFK:The Bush Connection, which adopts a no-holds barred approach in naming the main perpetrators of the murder. The acting performances in JFK are superb, the late John Candy displaying his best ever film character performance. The cinematography is excellent, and the film editing, incorporating documentary film which segues seamlessly with Oliver Stone's shots, is absolutely brilliant. The use of music and sound effects heightens the drama at the appropriate moments and is used very selectively to attain Stone's desired result. The abridgement of such a wealth of post-Kennedy information in regard to Kennedy's murder is a task in which Stone was quite successful, but like Mark Lane, author of Plausible Denial, I felt Stone did not go far enough in pointing the finger of accusation at Howard Hunt who was shown to be one of the organisers of the assassination team in an American court of law.

The characters are rich (even if they are just characters), and the logic is laid out in a way that Sherlock Holmes couldn't have improved upon. True, Kevin Costner doesn't show the most emotion (or even talent) in this film, but that's appropriate, because we are supposed to concentrate on all the other wackos that make up for Costner's blandness.  Joe Pesci, Tommy Lee Jones, Kevin Bacon, Donald Sutherland, and the entire supporting cast are terrific. While it is true that Oliver Stone may not have it exactly right, he proves pretty convincingly that there was some kind of conspiracy.  And the underlying message is one of revolution; if our governmental leaders are corrupt, he says, then we -- America -- have to take the power out of their hands.  Also, he lobbies for the release of the JFK assassination files, which is probably a good idea. This is a great political thriller.

His character's closing argument is so beautifully acted (look for the moment when he looks into the camera) and so passionately written and delivered it packs an emotional wallop that will stay with you for days. Whether or not the information presented here is entirely factual is beside the point. Stone's genius here is capturing the national mood and an inherent emotional truth concerning the assassination of JFK: we couldn't possibly believe Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone. We know there is a greater truth out there, and we the American people deserve to know the truth. We owe it to ourselves to question and probe until we get it. A great American classic",

Now, does Oliver Stone pick and choose which facts he wants to include and which he wants to modify (or forgo altogether)? Yes. But this film concerns the single most analyzed and dissected conspiracy theory in human history and Stone does it a great service by providing the viewers with an entertaining and fun 3+ hour ride. The cast (Costner, Oldman, Tommy Lee Jones, Pesci to name a few) is fantastic. Although Costner received criticism for his New Orleans accent, I didn't find that it took away from the film \u2014 I cannot say the same for Dennis Quaid's in The Big Easy. The editing is scattered, but in the best kind of way \u2014 it is enough to provide a sense of style but doesn't become distracting. I was pleasantly surprised that we start with Eisenhower's farewell address to the nation, wherein he warns the American people of \"the military-industrial complex\" \u2014 yes, he uses that term. This kicks off really what the plot is about: War. Mr. X's (Donald Sutherland) information dump went on for what felt like at least twenty minutes. The reveals were pertinent to the plot and at over three hours already, I'm not sure how Stone could've folded these bits of info into the plot, but it did begin to feel like a parody after a few minutes. I'm a sucker for courtroom drama and a flowing, poignant closing argument is the cherry on top and Costner delivers in every way here. I especially loved him delivering the final line directly into the camera. Let me paraphrase it for you: \"The government hates you and thinks you're stupid.\" Amen. Garrison (Costner) leads his team in an impossible fight to challenge the system, but we must never surrender. Sure, it's long, but JFK, full of French Quarter gay-sex orgies, top-down conspiracies, painted-on thick eyebrows, and Gary Oldman is why we sit down to watch movies in the first place. *Side Note* I now get why the Seinfeld scene with Newman, Kramer, and Keith Hernandez's loogie is even funnier than I thought.",

Twenty Nine years on, we know that some of the accusations rammed down our throats by Stone to the point where we knew they must be true, have in fact, been explained away, but JFK has lost none of its power in spite of this. Even if every theory suggested in the film had been proven wrong in the intervening years with inarguable evidence, Stone's telling of the story would have you questioning it all again. And let's be frank, there is still much of this tale that remains unsolved, shut away from the prying eyes of the public, and some of it just absolutely stinks. The level of research and commitment Stone brings to this (admittedly, that's a level he had to commit to when taking on this project) is staggering, and Kevin Costner's central performance as DA Jim Garrison is a career best. Unsurprisingly, JFK picked up an Oscar for Best Editing, but missed out on the big categories, presumably proving too controversial for the Academy in this respect. It remains a pivotal piece of film making, and gave Stone the opportunity to go on to make the excellent Nixon (1995) and W (2008) which I'm yet to see. JFK is film making at its most important, whether it's giving you all the facts or not, and proves when a director is this focused, they can make you believe anything.",

Some of the characters didn't feel particularly believable, but the acting was reasonable overall. On the other hand, the pacing should have been better. Things didn't need to be dragged out quite so much, and the runtime probably shouldn't have exceeded 2 hours 30 or 2 hours 45 minutes.

Kennedy. Stone presents his theory as to who assassinated President Kennedy alongside why he was killed and the entire process of how it was carried out in a masterful fashion. The last half of JFK is one shocking revelation after another reaching the climax when you meet Donald Sutherland as X in a phenomenal conversation of massive consequence and outstanding filmmaking. You will certainly never forget JFK.\n\nJFK's director's cut is nearly 3 \u00bd hours, but it's edited in a flash pan style of rapid fire cuts between actual documentary footage and dramatic recreations in a historical fashion to bring this turbulent time in American history to light. The editing keeps you engaged, while the sheer volume of information that Stone gives you is enthralling. John Williams' gripping score helps keep you in suspense whether someone simply rattling off facts or if an eye witness is recounting their experience in their own words.\n\nStone's direction is impressive for such a mammoth film of impactful legacy and serious subject matter. He constantly finds interesting angles, fascinating framing, and moody lighting. JFK is easily in the upper echelon of Stone's already iconic filmography.\n\nFurthermore, JFK is also notable for its behemoth cast of heavy hitting character actors all delivering mesmerizing performances. Kevin Kostner leads the fray as DA Jim Garrison, who was brave enough to take on the Kennedy assassination case and attempt to bring Kennedy's murderers to justice. Kostner is exemplary as the cool and observant district attorney Garrison. Kostner's shining moment in JFK is the entire finale courtroom sequence, which essentially sees Kostner perform a near hour long monologue of facts in the Kennedy case to convince and inform the American public. It's moving and even brings Kostner to tears in a moving display of human empathy and goodwill towards men. You can tell that Kostner was genuinely touched by JFK's death and memory for this story had to be told. JFK contains arguably Kevin Kostner's greatest performance if you needed any more convincing.\n\nLikewise, Sissy Spacek is wonderful as Liz Garrison. Her portrayal of the unappreciated and tireless wife to Garrison is moving as she had to take care of their children while the world ridiculed her husband and denied the legitimacy of his investigation. Spacek shows range in this more outspoken role compared to her more subtle quiet roles.\n\nYou have to love Joe Pesci as the flamboyantly gay David Ferrie. His paranoid rant in the hotel room with Kostner's Garrison present is genius and prime Pesci going off on everything. Similarly, Tommy Lee Jones pulls off a realistic gay Clay Shaw. Jones finds the heart of this unruly Southern gentleman that is hiding a tremendous secret. You despise Shaw by the end of JFK. Even, Kevin Bacon pulls of a realistic gay character with Willie O'Keefe being a gay prostitute fascist hatemonger. JFK creates 3 notorious gay villains that are just one part in the Kennedy conspiracy.\n\nFor example, Gary Oldman disappears into the role of infamous assassination Lee Harvey Oswald. His Russian accent is perfect and his mannerisms fit Oswald immaculately. You never think that you are not watching the real events play out when Oldman is on screen. He is just that realistic. Additionally, Brian Doyle Murray is gripping and suspenseful as Jack Ruby. Whenever he appears on screen, you always note his presence. \n\nOn the other hand, Ed Asner is vicious and hateful as Guy Bannister. His fearsome fascist Republican is so despicable from the moment Asner appears on screen. Asner provides a Republican venom that feels as relevant now as it did when JFK first released. Asner gives an unforgettable performance that rivals Kostner, Jones, Pesci, or Candy, honestly.\n\nJack Lemmon is funny as the nervous informant Jack Martin. Walter Matthau is great as the blunt Republican Senator Russell Long with his grievances against President Kennedy and off hand remarks about the assassination's likely culprits. John Candy actually acts his greatest dramatic performance in JFK as the New Orleans conspiracy informant Dean Andrews. He chews up the scenery with a flourish of style and accent. I loved John Candy as an actor and JFK demonstrates his versatility. Candy gives one of JFK's best roles honestly and he's only within 2 scenes. \n\nLaurie Metcalf is awesome as Jim Garrison's researcher with an attitude and opinion. Her scene of informing Garrison of her findings at the dinner is excellently acted. Jay O. Sanders is really good as the indignant researcher for Garrison named Lou Ivon. His outbursts are memorable. Even better is Michael Rooker as Ivon's foil named Bill Broussard. Rooker finds a gravitas and seriousness that is rare in an actor. His high caliber performance results in fascinating conversations with Kevin Kostner. JFK also features a nice dramatic turn for Wayne Knight as Numa Bertel.\n\nLastly, I really have to commend Donald Sutherland as the CIA informant X. His acting gives weight to the dramatic reveals he uncovers for Kostner's Garrison. Sutherland plays it stunned by the conspiracy, but he also feels moving as he says The United States is essentially compromised at the highest levels. Sutherland is so wondrous in these roles of informational dispensing like he did in Murder by Decree.\n\nIn all, Kevin Kostner, Sissy Spacek, Ed Asner, John Candy, Tommy Lee Jones, Joe Pesci, and Donald Sutherland give my favorite performances from all the magnificent displays of acting in JFK. Oliver Stone should be proud of his service to America and creative direction for JFK.",

Even though many films and books have been made on this subject Stone is talented enough to not make this movie feel or look stale. Kevin Costner plays the lead attorney general Garrison who is hell bend on finding the cause behind the great calamity of November 1963. This is a strong performance by an actor who isn't a very good actor. Kevin Bacon is also good in a small role as is Tommy Lee Jones. The English actor Gary Oldman plays Lee Harvey Oswald and there is a physical bearing that cannot be denied between the two men. If you are a fan of political movies and enjoy thrillers there's a lot to appreciate about Stone's film. On the other hand if the JFK subject holds no passion for you, and long films are a chore (and this one is) then JFK wouldn't be the best of choices. ",

            "content": "This is a film based around a conspiracy theory that uses dubious information to back up it's argument but thanks to Oliver Stone's skillful directing and one of the most compelling courtroom scenes I have ever seen the film works. No, you won't necessarily walk away as a conspiracy theorist, at least hopefully not, but you'll be able to appreciate Stone's ability to tell a story that is ultimately entertaining as he brings a colorful cast of characters together to draw conclusions about them and show them engaging in debauchery. This would have been my choice for Best Picture in 1991 because although it is controversial it's an undeniably well made film.\n\nJim Garrison, Kevin Costner, serves as the District Attorney of New Orleans and begins to investigate the Kennedy assassination shortly after it occurs with a team of investigators. He begins to find leads that point to the assassination being an inside job but when suspected murderer Lee Harvey Oswald, Gary Oldman, is murdered he is forced to stop his investigation and told that Oswald was definitely the lone shooter. He begins investigating again when he disagrees with the conclusions drawn in the Warren report and he believes that multiple shooters were involved in the assassination because he does not believe in the magic bullet theory. His investigation culminates in his attempt to prosecute New Orleans businessman Clay Shaw, Tommy Lee Jones, which ultimately fails because not enough evidence is presented.\n\nThe actors are asked to deliver very difficult dialogue here as they spew out boatloads of information and must speak in an urgent tone at all times. Fortunately they are up to the task as they weave all of this together and make a compelling argument, all the while they never leave us confused as we can logically follow their argument. Laurie Metcalf in particular shines as investigator Suzy Cox with her tenacity and sensible approach to her work serving as the ideal of the film. Even Kevin Costner, who can be a stolid leading man as seen in Dances with Wolves (1990), is a figure that we can admire as he appears to be the only person with the bravery to voice his moral outrage at the accepting of the faulty Warren report. The entire cast is stacked as you get Sissy Spacek, Kevin Bacon, Joe Pesci, Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau and Donald Sutherland in small roles doing some great work. \n\nThe editing of the film is masterful with Stone's penchant for using various different lenses and visual styles coming to the forefront as documentary footage, flashbacks and scenes set in real time all being woven together. The whole film moves at a very fast pace but even though we only really need the information we get in the first 2 and a half hours for the court case to be affecting it never feels like a boring exposition dump. Pietro Scalia and Joe Hutshing earned their Academy Award for Best Editing as they really had their work cut out for them and they managed to create an entertaining, informative film out of a very serious subject matter.\n\nAs someone who thinks that The Silence of the Lambs (1991) is highly overrated I find it offensive that Oliver Stone lost Best Director to Jonathan Demme. I appreciate Demme's work as a director of romantic comedies like Something Wild (1986) and Married to the Mob and I think that Rachel Getting Married (2008) was the best film of 2008 but The Silence of the Lambs is overwrought and not particularly shocking. Meanwhile Stone takes on an incredibly ambitious project and executes his vision well to produce an angry film filled with conviction that would have seemed like a simple piece of propaganda in the hands of most other directors.\n\nThis is a film that deserves to be seen even if the viewer is vehemently against the ideas that Stone puts forward because despite the fact that I didn't walk away believing Garrison I appreciated the man for his principles. It's also en \u2018epic' that is remarkably easy to watch, unlike Lawrence of Arabia (1962) or Reds (1981), so put it on and see how engaging it is, get drawn deep into Garrison's belief and maybe even question some of your own.",

The two prime examples: when Kevin Costner presents his case to the jury at the end, and the second, when Donald Sutherland talks candidly to Costner in the park.  The first, okay, he's a lawyer, you can expect that.  But the second case?  Sutherland appears to be boasting about his acting chops for memorizing such an intricately detailed script, and comes off as incredibly phony.  The cast, again, incredible.  The story intriguing.

Stone and company provide a thoroughly compelling case, claiming that there were others involved other than Lee Harvey Oswald. Clocking in at over 3 hours, JFK is very long, and my patience oftentimes runs thin for investigative films/shows. Luckily, it pays off in the end with an incredible courtroom scene where Garrison presents his case to a jury. Stone has convinced me with relentless amounts of evidence that the legal declaration stating that Oswald acted alone in the killing of JFK had to be a farce, to some degree.",

I was thinking, \"Oh no! Do I have to listen to this for 3 hours?\" The answer was yes, but he quickly sold me. I think his acting got better as the film went on. That's one thing this film has, it's an amazing cast. Joe Pesci, Tommy Lee Jones, Gay Oldman, John Candy, Kevin Bacon, Donald Sutherland, Wayne Knight, Sissy Spacek and so on. This film is extremely well acted. Now just because a film has good acting, doesn't mean that it will be entertaining. I will admit, this is a very long movie and it starts off pretty slow. As Kevin Costner's Jim Garrison begins the case on the assassination of JFK, his leads are pretty minimal. It doesn't seem like his case is building that much as most of the evidence is shrouded in secrecy. Luckily, the intrigue is so strong that you have to keep watching. Throughout the film, more and more clues start to come Jim Garrison's way and by the end of the film, it is just an amazing scene to see. In most films over three hours long, in my opinion, if it doesn't have a stellar climax, then I am very upset that I watched a film for three hours for an ending that wasn't satisfying. Oh my goodness, the climax of this movie is perfect! You really sit there in your seat thinking, \"This is outrageous! How can the FBI allow such a thing?!\" I don't think it is a spoiler to say the JFK was killed and there is a talk of a government conspiracy. Speaking of which, I gave this film a perfect score because I love films about United States politicians and love conspiracy theories. I believe that you need to be a bit of both to get the best out of this movie. If you are a person who couldn't care less about United States politics and think all conspiracy theorists are nutjobs, then yeah I'd say that this film would be too complex or uninteresting for you. If you do care about those, this is a perfect movie! An absolute must watch!",

It's still a good movie and it has some brilliant actors (actually it feels like 50% of the actors in Hollywood show up in this film,) but there is something sadly missing. The story tells about the only legal case ever brought to trial in relation to the assassination of John F. Kennedy. I think a more emotionally effective film would have spent more time on Jim Garrison, and his struggle to get this day in court. They try in a few brief scenes to point out the difficult family situation Garrison is experiencing, but the movie never came across as being about him. Instead it was all about the case. There is some fascinating stuff in this film, but it feels so scattershot that I sometimes grew confused over how it would tie together. The movie is long and it all seems to be pointing towards that final scene where Garrison gets his day in court and can present his big closing argument.\n\nWhile watching this big climax suddenly it hit me. This isn't a film about Jim Garrison and his passion to get the truth out there, this is a film about Oliver Stone's passion to get the truth out there! It's a 3-hour-long \"closing argument\" that spells out for the audience all that has been found in the many studies of JFK's assassination. Stone even conveniently connect the dots for us, making the assumptions so we don't have to ourselves. There's nothing wrong with this film, and certainly if even half of the things presented as facts in the movie are accurate then it's worth getting the truth out there to general audiences. I applaud the idea, but didn't adore the execution. In many ways it felt like the movie was just throwing as many pieces of damning evidence they could find in an effort to make a point. Sadly the point they make is \"We don't have any idea what happened, but it wasn't what the Warren Commission said.\" I think this movie could inspire someone to look deeper into the truth of things, and to question what we are told, but I don't know how well it holds up as a cohesive story.",

JFK is one of the best pieces of filmmaking i've ever seen, and one of my all-time favorite films.\n\nWith films like this, where the subject matter is delicate and lies close to people's heart, and where it is incredibly controversial there will always be haters of the movie just because they hate it (I've read many reviews like that) without even viewing the film properly, without predjudice or anything like that.\nI am no american, and i am too young to have been alive around 1963, so i knew little about the assassination going into this film, except ofcourse that JFK was assassinated by Lee Harvey Oswald (which is something i learned in school, i didnt know if it was true or not, i did know that there was some controvery around the assassination though, and that's it) So i went in watching without predjudice. A movie like this will always have historians or other people complaining about how factually inaccurate it is, and frankly, i dont care about this in any way, same with biographies, i dont care if it is incredibly inaccurate, i care if it is a well-made film, and damn, JFK is one hell of a well made film. It's one of the most riveting, educational, thrilling, mysterious, and controversial films of all time. In my honest opinion there really is little to complain here.\n\nThe main thing about this film is exposition and there's a lot of it in the film. There are times when Stone essentially asks us to listen while a character explains things. These scenes could have been deadly. He makes them exciting by using persuasive actors, by cutting between many different points of view, and by reconstructing the events being described. Stone's film is hypnotically watchable. Leaving aside all of its drama and emotion, it is a masterpiece of film assembly. The writing, the editing, the music, the photography, are all used here in a film of enormous complexity, to weave a persuasive tapestry out of an overwhelming mountain of evidence and testimony. Film students will examine this film in wonder in the years to come, astonished at how much information it contains, how many characters, how many interlocking flashbacks, what skillful interweaving of documentary and fictional footage. The film hurtles for 188 minutes through a sea of information and conjecture, and never falters and never confuses us. That is not to say that we are quite sure, when it is over and we try to reconstruct the experience in our minds, exactly what Stone's conclusions are. \"JFK\" does not unmask the secrets of the Kennedy assassination. Instead, it uses the Garrison character as a seeker for truth who finds that the murder could not have happened according to the official version. \n\nJFK is one of the best edited films of all time.",

And yes, you have to take the \"facts\" presented with a grain of salt, but at the same time maintain a good balance, because Stone does provide info that at the time may have been controversial, but which we now know to be very close to the truth.\nThis is definitely a film that will leave you thinking and debating for some time afterwards.",

Kevin Costner did a wonderful job portraying Jim Garrison, it was very apparent to me that he cared about the part he was playing. Other actors in the film were all the same way, very professional about their parts and they did a great job being realistic. While the entire movie is about a theory that has never been proven true, it does a great job explaining why Stone thought that there was a conspiracy to kill John Kennedy. It can also be very persuasive. If you think that the movie is fact, it can make you hate the government because you think they killed Kennedy.\n\tWhile I am a fan of the movie, I think the movie could be much better if it were shorter. Some things are impossible to make shorter, and I understand that, but three and a half hours felt like an eternity while watching it. Some parts of were interesting and kept you entertained, while others confused you and made you wonder how it had anything to do with the plot of the film at all. If this film were greatly reduced in length, down to two hours or somewhere thereabout, I would have enjoyed the movie much more. It is also quite obvious throughout the length of the film it is an old movie, it is low resolution and there are even spots in black and white. I wouldn't mind if this were updated and made HD. I am a fan of the conspiracy topic, but the movie was not the best way to show what might have happened in Kennedy's final days. That is why I gave it a 4/5. If the film were a little more concise, it would likely be much closer to a 5/5.",

Also when Clay Shaw was on the stand and lied that wasn't right because he told police that he went by the name Clay Bertrand and all of this other stuff that he told the police but he lied on the stand in front of all those people. I also liked how it showed when Oswald was in the book depository I liked how it showed like a recap of it and showed how it went down kind of and I also liked how it would show how Jack Ruby shot Oswald and how he did it like how he got into the place like one of his friends let him in.

Kevin Costner is the right actor to helm this behemoth ... he brings seriousness and gravitas to the proceedings.  The vast supporting cast are consistently great, even Sissy Spacek who is saddled with the worst character in the film.  Her \"unsupportive spouse\" is a tiresome stereotype that just manages to come off as selfish and more than a little dumb.  While Michael Rooker's skeptic sometimes is the sanest chracter in the film, she's shrill and annoying.  Where the film fails is in painting a coherent picture of the assassination.  What it has to work with is a lot of unanswered questions, but it persists in supplying answers even when it has no evidence to support them.  Characters repeatedly offer \"it could have happened this way\" speculations, and then immediately act as if a fact has been established when really, a speculation was thrown out.  If it did this a few times it wouldn't hurt the film, but about 75% of the conclusions drawn are of this nature.  At 3 1/2 hours, it's a long slog, and one that could have been relieved a bit by having fewer very very long speculative monologues.",

Kennedy, here adapted from On the Trail of the Assassins by Jim Garrison and Crossfire: The Plot That Killed Kennedy by Jim Marrs. Stone opened a massive can of worms by effectively proving that nothing was what it seemed when Kennedy was assassinated, and it makes for a gripping political thriller. When Kennedy was assassinated on November 22nd 1963, New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison (Kevin Costner) learns about the links the assassination had to New Orleans, and that the accused assassin Lee Harvey Oswald (Gary Oldman) had several co-conspirators, including pilot David Ferrie (Joe Pesci), male prostitute Willie O'Keefe (Kevin Bacon) and, most crucially the flamboyant Clay Shaw (Tommy Lee Jones). But, as Garrison delves deeper into this case, he discovers a web of political lies and skulduggery, cover-ups and corruption, and he learns a lot of shocking home truths from the mysterious X (Donald Sutherland). It's a film which got America and the rest of the world talking again. Stone weaves a compelling and shocking history lesson as a suspenseful thriller, and his arguments are shocking and believable. Plus, he gets a brilliant performance out of Costner, whose Garrison will not stop fighting and looking for the truth.",

I finally had a class assignment that I was excited about, a research paper on the assassination of JFK. Thus began my lifelong love of anything John F. Kennedy. I've read both Jim Garrison's 'On The Trail Of The Assassins' and Jim Marrs' 'Crossfire The Plot That Killed Kennedy', the books Oliver Stone's JFK is based as well as many other books and articles on the last President assassinated. I have come to the conclusion that there was more to his murder than Lee Harvey Oswald getting off three remarkable shots within 6 seconds. Without getting too deep into my theory, I 100% believe the mob was involved and 100% believe Lyndon Johnson was not. Maybe smaller levels of government were involved but not the reaches Oliver Stone and Jim Garrison believed. Biggest proof mob was involved: 1) helped with unions to get Kennedy elected. 2) The Kennedy's went after mob once they were in office. Especially Bobby. 3) Patsy(Oswald) was killed by a low level mob enforcer, Jack Ruby. 4) Bobby was killed 5 years later. Now to the movie. At a brisk 191min(Director's Cut), JFK is an exciting, thought provoking and well acted piece of celluloid. This is one of the movies that inspired 6 Degrees of Kevin Bacon because anyone who was anyone in 1991 was in this movie. Sissy Spacek and Michael Rooker are standouts among a standout ensemble, but this Kevin Costner's movie and he kills it. The final courtroom scene is one of the finest of its kind to date. 'I say let justice prevail or the heavens fall\", Jim Garrison exclaims as he ascends the steps. Unfortunately Jim, this is America, Justice prevails when you can afford it. We may never know the whole story but at least we have entertaining movies like this to help pique our interest, open our eyes and make us think for ourselves.",

            "content": "A film that perfectly explores the assassination, and also comments on what could've happened, and makes audiences wonder if we'll ever know the truth.  Based on Jim Garrison's \"On the Trail of the Assassins\", and Jim Marrs' \"Crossfire: The Plot That Killed Kennedy\", JFK follows the events surrounding the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, and the investigation that ensues.  The film perfectly follows the men involved with the investigation as they interview people that might have possible connections to the crime, or wherever possible suspects mentioned during interviews.  While historical films never completely stay true to the events, this is something that historical accuracy should've been important, but writers Oliver Stone and Zachary Sklar leave out events, but still use enough information for this long, detailed masterpiece.  The film also details the affect the case and investigation on Jim Garrison, his associates, and his family, showcasing smart characterization.  JFK also digs deep into the truth behind the assassination that still confuse and arouse people to this day, including the possibility of a government conspiracy, a second shooter, or that it was a government job.  It leaves us with questions unanswered, just like today, and we still wonder and hope that we'll get much needed answers one day.  Oliver Stone is able to capture each scene with finesse, while being aided by cinematographer Robert Richardson, who perfectly captures each scene that helps with the tone and mood of every scene.  Composer John Williams does a great job at composing the score, which helps with the mood of each scene (tense, heartfelt, and shocking).  Stone and Sklar craft a script that makes the right transitions while staying even, as well as remain engaging and thrilling throughout the lengthy run time of three hours, nine minutes (three hours, twenty-six minutes with the Director's Cut).  The film is also aided by terrific performances, brought to life by the likes of Kevin Costner, Kevin Bacon, Martin Sheen, Laurie Metcalf, and the best one if all, Tommy Lee Jones.  A must-see, and the perfect cinematic representation of JFK's assassination.",

            "content": "With the 50th anniversary of the assassination of President Kennedy this week, the media is awash with the memory of Kennedy. In addition we are being plied with new films such as Killing Kennedy and Parkland. It is a good time to enjoy the masterpiece that is Oliver Stone's JFK.\n\nFew films create the amount of discussion that can emerge after a viewing of JFK. As arousing as the material may be, it should not distract us from some superb performances from the cast and an iconic achievement from the director. To paraphrase a number of critics; as history it may be controversial, dubious, biased and bunk but as film-making it is riveting, electric and a masterpiece.\n\nJFK sports a supreme cast\n\nHeaded by Kevin Costner, the cast includes Tommy Lee Jones, Gary Oldman, Sissy Spacek, Joe Pesci, Donald Sutherland, Kevin Bacon, John Candy, Walter Matthau, Jack Lemmon and other familiar faces.\n\nCostner, though, is the main role. Following the flawed but immensely popular Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves and his double Academy Award win for Dances With Wolves and preceding his role in The Bodyguard, Costner was in the peak of his career. He was not the only one as we shall see. But did he make the most of a substantial role in this film?\n\nOn one hand it is a little harsh to be too critical. In many a mystery, conspiracy, or crime film the main investigator is not necessarily made into a compelling character. Instead it is the story or the suspects who lead the intrigue. In literature and television, where the investigator character has the opportunity to return, there is more scope to make it an interesting character. This can follow the character into a film adaptation but is otherwise not essential.\n\nThe fact that Costner has little in common with the real life Jim Garrison - an imposing 6'7\" attorney with a deep voice - may suggest other considerations, like looks and name, took precedence. (Cheekily, Jim Garrison does have a role in the film - as Earl Warren, the Chief Justice whose report Garrison sought to undermine)\n\nThat being said, the script provided ample opportunity for Costner to produce something special. Two opportunities in particular - the domestic scenes with Garrison's wife, Liz [Sissy Spacek]; and the final courtroom scene which ends with almost a Mr Smith Goes to Washington passion. Overall, Costner is fair but not great. That being said, I certainly prefer Costner for this role over Harrison Ford and Mel Gibson, who were favoured by the producers\n\nJFK, though, is more about the superb supporting cast than the lead\n\nJack Lemmon has only a small role, but in a matter of minutes he shows us the ability that saw him win two acting Oscars. When we think of John Candy in a serious role most immediately think of Cool Runnings, but in this film, despite a small one, he shows how much more range he has. So nervous was he, to be in a serious role surrounded by so many big names, that he is perspiring heavily in all his scenes. For many, JFK was the first introduction to Gary Oldman who brings to life a portrayal of Lee Harvey Oswald who, in this story, is necessarily contradictory and requires a powerful performance delivered in small increments.\n\nThere are three supporting performances in particular that stand out in this film. The first is Joe Pesci, also in career-prime form, who came into JFK on the back of Home Alone and an Oscar win for Goodfellas and would follow JFK with My Cousin Vinny and Casino. Pesci is superb as the paranoid, anxious, panicky, violently anti-communist and somewhat loony David Ferrie.\n\nDonald Sutherland delivers an exciting portrayal of the enigmatic X in one of the film's most iconic and memorable scenes. It went a long way to establish Sutherland's ability to play the authoritarian. His future roles, whether in Commander in Chief or The Hunger Games, owe a fair bit to his performance in JFK. Even his voice carries that potential as we saw in Lord of War.\n\nMost impressive though is Tommy Lee Jones. Coming a couple of years before the role that would establish his name - for the wider audience anyway - in The Fugitive, this is not the Tommy Lee Jones you may think you know. Here he plays Clay Shaw; a Louisiana businessman and something of a Southern dandy. The scenes of Shaw's private party, where Jones is covered in gold paint and humiliated, reminds one of the risks and experiments actors are willing to do in their early career. Jones' Oscar nomination for the role shows it's benefits.\n\nThe real star of this film is Oliver Stone\n\nWith many films the key task of the director is to not get in the way of the plot or the characters, but to give them room to produce their magic themselves. A good director is often considered to be a light, invisible factor with little to say. A great director is often considered one who gently enhances the story and performances - providing emphasis or subtlety as the situation demands. It is a job that is easy to screw up, less easy to do well, but dangerously tempting to overstep and do too much. JFK is a standout as a film where the director has a strong presence; as some omnipotent, omniscient and omnipresent manipulative deity; yet this influence does not overburden and screw up the film, instead it enhances it significantly.\n\nJFK has a special place in my film memory. As a young fan it was the first real taste of what a director has the power to do, if - and it is a big if - he can pull it off. JFK is special because the absurd level of manipulation and ambition in vision does come off.\n\nThe film is full of examples of Stone manipulating the audience, but three scenes standout. The first is the iconic \"We're through the looking-glass here people\" scene, where Garrison and his entourage from his DA's office discuss the history of Oswald over cocktails at a Louisiana restaurant. The second is of Garrison meeting X who fills him in on the big picture of the activities of US military intelligence, the influence of the military-industrial complex, angry sacred cows within the Pentagon and the shift in policy for war in Vietnam. The third is of Garrison at court attempting to debunk the magic bullet theory and sharing his own vision of the assassination.\n\nEach of these scenes are heavy in dialogue, bombarding the viewer with information. But they are well paced, using quick silent shots and scenery to break it up. Music, provided by Hollywood legend John Williams, is used variously to quicken or slow the heart rate or create mood. Sometimes sombre and haunting, sometimes pacey and suspecting. Each of these scenes combine shots of the conversation of the moment with archival footage - both historical and re-imagined, using actors of the film - shifting from colour to black-and-white.\n\nIn addition, there are insertions of images covering a plotline not currently being discussed. For example, the looking-glass scene is broken up with images of someone producing a doctored photo of Oswald. These insertions, sometimes subtle, sometimes overt; are effective in create inferences and subliminal messages in the mind of the audience. Thus, both conscious and subconscious of the audience is infiltrated, rightfully earning Stone his place as a master propagandist.\n\nEach of these scenes rank highly in my list of favourites, they join scenes from The Silence of the Lambs, The Shawshank Redemption and a few others as those I most enjoy replaying in my mind.\n\nJFK represents such an achievement in direction that it could possibly never be repeated. Its technique is so effectual that when viewing other films with a tense, conspiratorial or mysterious story - such as Zodiac or Zero Dark Thirty - it is tempting to think they could benefit from more of a JFK treatment. But the technique is so synonymous with JFK, parodied everywhere from Seinfeld to The Simpsons, it would be abundantly clear that that was what you were trying to do.\n\nThere was a time when I called Stone my favourite director with some confidence. This was mostly due to my regard for this film and also for Platoon (I was probably too young to appreciate Wall Street and Born on the Fourth of July at the time). I also gave him dues for two films that were not well appreciated but I still had time for - Natural Born Killers and Any Given Sunday.\n\nBut as the years went by it was harder and harder to call Stone my favourite with conviction. Not only had many other contenders risen (or at least continued to produce good work) but Stone was clearly deteriorating. The failure of Alexander on many levels was probably the final nail in the coffin. In retrospect, JFK probably represents the peak of the three-time Oscar winner's career.\n\nJFK was well represented at the 64th Academy Awards with nine nominations\n\nIt only came away with two - for editing and cinematography - as these awards were a very tough contest. As well as JFK, other top contenders included The Silence of the Lambs, Bugsy, Beauty and the Beast, Terminator 2 and Thelma and Louise. It is nice to remember these awards are occasionally a difficult choice between excellent candidates. The Silence of the Lambs took out the big 5 - screenplay, actor, actress, director and picture. In the face of such strong competition you can't complain too much and just being nominated is considerable recognition - something that certainly can't be said every year.\n\nAs much as I love this film, in most cases I find I have to side with the Academy in their choices. Best Picture, for instance, rightfully belonged to The Silence of the Lambs. John Williams missed out on best score for JFK to Alan Menken for Beauty and the Beast. Mind you he has missed out many times for excellent work. Tommy Lee Jones could probably feel unlucky to miss out on the supporting actor award to Jack Palance - for playing Curly in the fun, but never revisited, City Slickers. Best Director is tough, but I have to say I would have given it to Stone rather than Demme again for The Silence of the Lambs, by a small margin.\n\nDespite the controversy of its material and the decline of its director, JFK remains a modern masterpiece, represents peak performances from a number of participants and deserves to be held up as the best example of the power of the director's craft.\n\nhttp://rants-n-raves.com/2013/11/22/film-review-jfk/",

I don't know what I believe after watching this movie but it seems like something definitely is up with the JFK assassination. And it's a tribute to the films tolerance for complexity, open-endedness and inconclusiveness that by the end of the 3 plus hour runtime you don't know what the film believes either. Stone seems to be saying that History, like Art, is open to interpretation. A lot of interpretation. There's some great scenes in this movie like Kevin Costner as Jim Garrison, the dogged prosecutor determined to find out what really happened at Dealey Plaza, pointing out all the military and intelligence offices in downtown New Orleans right across the street from each other in a paranoid frenzy. Or Donald Sutherland (\"Call me X\") laying out a ton of suspicious information in a few short minutes. John Williams' score which has elements of Coplandesque patriotism along with discordant, frenzied themes deserves a lot of credit for helping to create an atmosphere that resembles a High School Civics class combined with a tense thriller. Beyond all the fear and the cynicism this is a movie about dedication to high ideals, questioning what you've been told, and the high price paid by those who ask those questions and try to live their lives according to those ideals.",

            "content": "\"Who killed the president?\"\r\n\r\nAround the time I watched JFK, I was reading this novel by Stephen King called \"11/22/63\". The title of this book was also the date of the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. Like this film, 11/22/63 was about the assassination, yet it also has its own set of characters. But the film and the book are very different. While JFK is about the true story of Kevin Costner's character and his colleagues trying to go in deeper into the Kennedy assassination and why it happened, 11/22/63 was a science fiction book. It was all about a teacher who is friends with a guy who owns a diner. One day, the guy calls the teacher to his diner, and the teacher finds out that the guy has a time machine in his diner. The guy is obsessed with finding out who killed John F. Kennedy and wants to stop whoever did it (because as it was illustrated in JFK, there was a sort of chain of horrible events after Kennedy's assassination, such as the Vietnam War, and the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert Kennedy). He tells the teacher to go back in time in order to stop Lee Harvey Oswald. So the book and the film are very different. But if I were pressed, the film made a much larger impact on me. On paper, the book should've made the bigger impact. It had a thrilling story, it was over 800 pages long, and featured a closer look at what really happened on November 22, 1963 in Dallas, Texas. In fact, when I read that book, it held information I didn't know about Oswald such as him having a wife and brother. That was probably the most I ever knew about the events and people surrounding the assassination. But as informative and thrilling this Stephen King novel really was, it ain't got nothing on JFK. \r\n\r\nI'm no stranger to the conspiracies and controversies surrounding the assassination. As a matter of fact, I am one of those people who are very interested with urban legends and conspiracies. I'm just very curious about the uncertainty of it all. So as one would point out, I should've been very interested in this movie since it is a conspiracy movie. Be that as it may, I initially thought JFK would be one of those long, drawn-out history films, retelling stuff that obviously already happened. Pretend you're in school, and the lesson that day was JFK's assassination. Your class is noisy, and your teacher becomes so irritated, she threatens to make the class stay in the room during recess. That doesn't stop your class, so your punishment is to sit down in your chair, and read your history book and learn all about the assassination until recess is over and you can go to your next period. That's what I though JFK would be, despite the fact I've seen its 84% rating on its RT page. \"Going to your next period\" was a metaphor for when the movie ends and you can stop being bored learning stuff that already happened. But this movie was truly incredible. It was bashed by some critics for not being truthful in some points, but in my opinion, JFK made history interesting. It told me about points and people who were part of the pre-assassination, post-assassination, and during the assassination. It introduced a cast of characters I never knew were part of anything like George De Mohrenschildt, Bill and Janet Williams, Jim Garrison, Clay Shaw/Clay Bertrand, David Ferrie, Oswald's wife Marina, Earl Warren, Guy Banister, and the mysterious Black Ops Agent called \"X\". All the performances were great, especially by Kevin Costner, Tommy Lee Jones, Gary Oldman, Donald Sutherland, Joe Pesci, and even Kevin Bacon. When Jim Garrison's team are together and one of them are telling everyone else about something find out, even if what they're are just facts, they were interesting and I just wanted to keep watching. The assassination already happened over 45 years ago, but it's just as every bit as interesting and thrilling as any movie you can buy at your local store. \"It's a mystery wrapped in a riddle inside an enigma!\", said by Joe Pesci's character David Ferrie pretty much summed up everything I thought about the film. Everything was so complicated, yet several people, most especially this one determined district attorney, was so focused on finding what they would give their lives for: the truth. They'd be disillusioned with anything less than the truth. It was already difficult to find the truth, yet there was even people who didn't want them to find it out. People who would also give their lives just so the truth would not be found out. Because of that, not only was each fact they revealed to each other over dinner interesting, it also made me excited because each fact was one step closer to what I also wanted to know: the truth. When a movie about a guy wanting to know a truth is so good that it makes the viewer want to know the truth too, you know that film is special. These people take the viewer with them on a journey to the truth and it was thrilling every single step of the way. \r\n\r\nWhat I disliked about the film was what kept from giving this movie a complete 5 out of 5. When I first watched this movie, it was engaging and kept me completely immersed in the film. I did not want to stop watching, I did not go to the bathroom, I did not check the clock to see what time it was. I was focused. But I decided later on to rewatch the film in order to see if it was still cool. And it wasn't as cool. While the film was still really well-acted and crafted, when the team of Kevin Costner tell their facts over the table, I realized, it wasn't as riveting as the first viewing because I already knew those facts. After the first viewing of JFK, I realized that this film was different from other true story films I've seen because I didn't know about Jim Garrison's investigation and his case against Clay Shaw. There were other political true story films like Recount (starring Kevin Spacey and Denis Leary) and Game Change (starring Julianne Moore and Ed Harris). Recount and Game Change are about the political campaigns of Al Gore against George W. Bush and of John McCain against Barack Obama. Though Recount was only about the campaign team of Al Gore, Game Change was actually about Sarah Palin's involvement with John McCain's campaign (with Julianne Moore as Palin and Ed Harris as John McCain). Now, I know both of those films weren't like JFK or Argo, both of which relied on thrilling the audience. Recount and Game Change was about retelling the personal behind-the-scenes events that happened to those involved with the campaigns and elections of Gore and McCain. But nonetheless, I already knew who won the election, so no matter how the film tries build up that its main characters are working so hard so they'll win, it's sad to watch them doing it, 'cause you know they still lose. But for JFK, I didn't know anything. I didn't know about the different facts the team was talking about. I knew of the conspiracies, but I didn't know them like the back of my hand. When this movie revealed it to me, it was awesome. This film made all the dumb action and cheesy humor in Michael Bay's films look worse than they already are because you need a little more than looking at the picture to understand what's happening. This movie, like Pulp Fiction, was carried by the dialogue. It asks more from the viewer. It exercises your brain. And like Inception, because of that, this movie is so great in many ways. But when your watching it for a second time, you already know what happens and you already know how the ending's gonna turn out. As Roger Ebert once said, \"Every great film should seem new every time you see it.\" That's what I feel about a lotta movies. But for this one? Not so much. Also, as interesting the ideas and theories of Mr. Garrison were, they were very outrageous. Because of this film, I can believe that Clay Shaw was Clay Bertrand therefore was an accomplice in a wide conspiracy to assassinate Jack Kennedy. Because of this film, I can believe that Lee Harvey Oswald wasn't alone on that fateful day on November 22, 1963. Because of this film, I can even believe that the Warren Commission was mostly a work of fiction, and was just released to satisfy the American public. But to believe that Lyndon B. Johnson and J. Edgar Hoover were part of everything and Kennedy's assassination was coup d'\u00e9tat? I know the film isn't exactly asking me to believe Jim Garrison. But I admit it. If I was alive in 1966-1969 when his investigation was on the news, I would think he was just a crazy guy with crazy anti-government theories even without the media displaying him as such.  \r\n\r\nWhen something big happens, like an assassination, the loss of a candidate at an election, or a financial crash, the public only see them with the naked eye. The media is what helps them comprehend and see these crises. Though it is kind of a fact that the media sometimes exaggerates things and as illustrated in JFK, they display rumors to destroy a reputation if it seems fit. The media has always done that, and they always will because there is no one there to stop them. Even if there is, I doubt it'll stop them. So there is no absolute way the public can know the real and definite truth behind these big events. There are even people other than the media, maybe politicians or even police authority, that don't want the truth to get out. Even for this film. Maybe Oliver Stone tweaked some important points, I don't know. I've never thought of that before, and when I watched this film, it brought out that thought, so I'll give this film that. It's four years until all the information about the assassination that was not discussed with the American public is released. Nobody knows anything until then. But until then we'll just have to make do with this movie. Anyway, JFK, with its fantastic dialogue and speeches, great performances, and its unique style, JFK is a spectacular and truly unforgettable film. Though it might not warrant repeated viewings, one cannot forget the impact and thrill caused by the thought-provoking first viewing of the closest look into one of the greatest and controversial mysteries ever to exist within American history.",

The movie has one of the most superb casts of any movie that I can think of, except of course that there are no women in this movie apart from the doting housewife. In spite of that, every movie buff will adore the parade of familiar faces, from Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau, to Donald Sutherland and John Candy, to Gary Oldman and Joe Pesci. Also, the perverted homosexual love seen with Tommy Lee Jones, Joe Pesci and Kevin Bacon dressed as 18th century pompadours  is one you will probably never forget. This movie also makes you forget things like Waterworld and the Postman, and remember that Kevin Costner is actually a talented actor.",

            "content": "Director Oliver Stone is no stranger to biopics or documentaries covering the lives of influential or powerful people. He has looked in the lives of Vietnam veteran and political activist Ron Kovic in \"Born On The Fourth Of July\"; Jim Morrison, the lead singer of \"The Doors\"; military general and conquerer \"Alexander\" the great; Cuban revolutionary leader Fidel Castro in \"Comandante\" and two films on the exploits of American presidents Richard \"Nixon\" and George \"W.\" Bush. In the films mentioned, Stone explores the lives of these men but in \"JFK\" he does the opposite and explores the death of the man and in the process, crafts one of his most accomplished films.\n In Dallas, Texas on November 22nd 1963, President John F. Kennedy is assassinated. The official explanation released by the F.B.I. doesn't make sense and is very suspicious. As a result, New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison (Kevin Costner) decides to investigate and uncovers a dangerous conspiracy that may involve more than he could ever have imagined.\n Oliver Stone has done his homework here and bombards the audience with facts, theories and reports from the media, interviews and eyewitness testimonies. He covers the history of events right across the board from the Bay of Pigs to the Warren Report via the questionable marksmanship of \"lone gunman\" Lee Harvey Oswald. Whether or not you agree with Stone's theories is of little importance. What is of great importance is his ability to pose serious questions on one of the most tragic political events and biggest conspiracies in American history. It could easily come across that Stone (or Garrison) have all the answers but they don't. This is a film that endeavours to get to the root of the truth. Many questions will remain unanswered but it's also not the type of film that claims to provide them. Some information is pure speculation but the very place where Stone succeeds is his ability to instil debate. He welcomes it and the film is far more powerful because of it. It's a tangled web that has been weaved and Stone deserves the utmost respect in tackling it head on. What's most impressive though is that it's never boring. With all the details, it could be in danger of losing the audiences attention but it doesn't and this is thanks-in-large to editor's Pietro Scalia and Joe Hutshing in skilfully piecing all the fragmented narrative strands together. They won an Oscar for their work and deservingly so. Another deserving Oscar winner was cinematographer Robert Richardson for his marvellous attention to detail  in capturing the look and feel of the 1960's. Amongst the the brisk pace and attention to detail is an abundant cast of quality actors and no matter how small the role, each of them get a chance to shine; Gary Oldman makes a perfect Oswald and other notable displays from Kevin Bacon, Joe Pesci, John Candy, Donald Sutherland and an Oscar nominated turn from Tommy Lee Jones as eccentric socialite, Clay Shaw. It's Costner who is the main focus here though and he delivers a solid and determined performance. More importantly, he's an appealing presence which is very much required when the film steps over the 3 hour mark. He captures the obsession of Garrison and in a lot of ways makes it our own; his dogged determination for answers reflecting ours. When all the dust has settled, the film culminates into a conventional court room drama but still remains riveting. It's during this time that despite some shocking revelations earlier in the film that Stone finishes with aplomb and takes his chance to disclose some staggering pieces of information.\n A conspiracy theorists dream, that may take some criticism for being hypothetical or one-sided but there's no denying Stone's bravery or his skill in encapsulating the paranoia and unrest at this time in history.",

While it's obviously not completely embedded in historical fact, taking many liberties and drawing on a lot of assumptions, it effectively raises questions as to what really happened on that tragic day.  Top notch performances by an ensemble cast keep the film exciting through every twist and turn.  I was especially intrigued by Donald Sutherland's brief performance as Mr. X.  The political intrigue moves at a blistering pace and each new development is fascinating.  Normally, I would consider the heavy use of the footage of JFK being shot to be in bad taste, but it's necessary to the structure of the film, and helps drive home the message that is being presented.  Regardless of how much of this story has been fictionalized, there is more truth out there than the majority of the American people realize, and Oliver Stone does a good job of making that point.",

            "content": "Simply put, one of the most compelling and engaging conspiracy films ever made. It is a masterpiece of artistry by Oliver Stone presenting the overwhelming complexities and theories pertaining to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy in Dallas, Texas, in 1963. This is not a film about the facts of the assassination, but about the suspicion and the \"not-knowing.\" \"JFK\" accurately reflects our national state of mind since Nov. 22, 1963. We feel the whole truth has not been told, that more than one shooter was involved, that somehow maybe the CIA, the FBI, Castro, the Mafia or the Russians, or all of the above, were involved. We don't know how. Stone's unrestrained energy and limitless technical skills assembles a perplexing array of \"facts,\" presenting the film leaving the viewer fully immersed as the conspiracy theory unfolds.\r\n\r\nNew Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison (Kevin Costner) takes it upon himself to re-open the case years after the assassination, not satisfied with the extremely suspicious story presented by the FBI. Kevin Costner, in the central role, plays the role brilliantly with determination as the character of James Garrison, who begins to assemble a mountain of evidence, footage, characters, testimony, theories, and motives. The film weaves through a sea of information, conjecture, documentaries, and fictional footage for 188 minutes, and never falters and never confuses us. Individual pieces of information alone doesn't amount to much of anything, but when it is all the piece's are assembled with incredible skill, it all falls into place, and the result is extraordinary. A film with a smooth and consistent visual style would have felt false. Stone and his expert cinematographer, Robert Richardson (who won the Oscar), work in every relevant visual medium: 35mm, 16mm, Super 8, 8mm, video, still photos, color, black and white. His editors, Joe Hutshing and Pietro Scalia, also Oscar winners, assemble this material like the pieces of a jigsaw. It's not linear; there's a sense of parallel events moving forward on more than one front at a time. \r\n\r\nOne of the most satisfying conspiracy theory movies ever, and Oliver Stone's finest work to date. Stone utilizes his incredible cast of characters extremely well. Riveting, engaging, and fascinating from start to finish, despite its historical inaccuracies and conjuncture. Despite its length-a bit over three hours, the film's prolific cast, coupled with its fascinating insights and theories, leaves the viewer completely invested throughout. The film effectively captures and reproduces the overwhelming emotions of a country during a very dark moment in American history.",

I have never been concerned with what views a film may try to assert, I am far more interested in how the director does it. Of course, the ability to evoke tremendous feelings is a necessity, which the film does. Hands down, Oliver Stone's \"JFK\" is one of the well-constructed films you'll ever see. Aside for its marvelous technical mastery, it has one of best supporting casts with excellent performances from the likes of Joe Pesci, Gary Oldman, and Tommy Lee Jones. I have seen Kevin Costner in Brian De Palma's \"The Untouchables,\" a film that I dislike, more importantly it had a sub-par performance from Costner. But, in \"JFK,\" Costner erases any ill I had for him with such a composed performance and by delivering one of the greatest monologues in film! Not to mention the several other minor characters in this film who have their own charm. \"JFK\" is a great film, and probably the best film I've seen since I saw \"Fellini Satyricon\" last, which was over a month ago.",

I was surprised Costner didn't get more praise for this film, I thought his performance was incredible.  Tommy Lee Jones was incredible in the film and deserved his Oscar nom, and I also really enjoyed Joe Pesci who was great as usual.

            "content": "I think that it would be pretty awesome to have Oliver Stone as a history teacher for the three days he would have with the job before they fired him. Heck, I don't even know if he would make it three \"periods\" into his \"first\" day, and it wouldn't simply be his crazy, controversal views on politics and history that would land the nail in his teaching career coffin, it would be him being caught with whatever kind of insane drugs that he takes for an early morning snack, which I guess would go hand-in-hand with his dubious history lessons, because you would have to be on drugs to think up history this crazy. No, his history isn't even mildly that farfetched; in fact, it's riveting, especially now-a-days, when you can look back and have your mind blown by the fascinating fact that in his youth, Gary Oldman looked an awful lot like Sam Rockwell. Seriously, someone has got to make a movie with Christoph Waltz as Ryan Gosling's dad and Gary Oldman as Sam Rockwell's. Granted, Gary Oldman would have had to have been 10 when he had little baby Rockwell, but hey, he was probably one smooth toddler, so who's to say he didn't attract his teacher's attention? Wow, that statement was so creepy, trippy and deeply offensive that Oliver Stone's probably going to make a movie out of it at some point, because you know that it's pretty much that guy's job to make people mad. Clearly, he's not doing his job well, because everyone's digging on this film, and while I'm not particularly animalistic about it, I'm enjoying myself too. However, it should go without saying - partially because I do the segway to death - that there aren't still bumps in that enjoyment.\r\n\r\nThe film's ability to go so long at a steady pace with dialogue and rarely fall into dullness is impressive, though not surprising, considering that this is Olver Stone and that he is very well known for his ability to pump plenty of intrigue and style into his work. However, there are points in this film where the stylizing gets a touch overwhelming and rather gratuitous, certainly not to the extent of \"Natural Born Killers\" - where he just killed the filter and let lord knows what dump out -, but you will still find yourself saying, \"Okay, maybe that was a little much\" at points. Still, overstylizing is the least of the film's problem, because even though this film is able to dance outside of dullness, when you're looking at over 3 hours - or almost three-and-a-half hours in the case of the director's cut - consisting almost entirely of dialogue and investigation, things are gonna start losing steam, if not look a little too familiar. The film gets pretty darn repetitive pretty darn fast, and sure, the film breaks out of the loop quite often, but those moments are still gotten to eventually, with the preceding time being occupied with exposition, followed by exposition, then exposition and yet more exposition, and after a while intrigue's going to dip a bit. Many will walk into this film expecting fact-after-after-fact-after-fact, but it's hard to be prepared for just how unrelenting this film is in its barrage of exposition and discussion, something that is never - not even for a second - tedious, but with this film running such a mammoth length, disengagement is to be expected. Ladies and gentlemen, allow me to tell you that those expectations go unfulfilled and that this film is never disengaging. Intrigue dilutes a little bit after a while, but never fades, keeping at a constant flow that makes the film consistently fascinating and, well, rather entertaining, and has to thank the top-notch filmmaking team behind it for that.\r\n\r\nRobert Richardson is one of the greatest cinematographers alive and few people aim to prove it more than Richardson's long-time collaborater, Mr. Oliver Stone, who makes many demands for lively, lush and versatile shots with lighting that can switch from bright to bleak in the blink of an eye and not feel offputting, and sure enough, you get that here and it all comes out brilliantly thanks to Richardson's masterful eye for photography. Of course, providing Richardson with great material for photography isn't the only thing that Oliver Stone does to keep the film engaging, because Mr. Stone is really bringing both in the directing seat and on paper. Oliver Stone's and Zachary Sklar's script stands to be tighter and more dynamic, but is still pretty sharp, keeping the long sequences of exposition going with not only snappy dialogue, but an endless barrage of consistently riveting and deeply fascinating facts married with probable fiction. Now, I and countless other think - nay - know that the made-up theories behind this film are quite frankly bogus, and the film seems to think that too, as it lacks the pretense of trying to really force its crackpot theories on you, but is still assigned the mission of providing complex and compelling possibilities that organically intertwine with incontrovertible facts, and it's a mission that is accomplished gracefully with the help of Oliver Stone, as well as his star-studded cast of true acting talents. With intrigue in each person's presence and emotion backing up their tension, every last member of this big name cast sells that they are all components of complexity, as well as humans, with each person - whether they be primaries, secondaries, tertiaries or even cameos - establishing the feeling of depth and tension as everything unfolds in both the case and them as humans. I for one couldn't be more impressed with Kevin Costner, who's always been a hit-or-miss actor, but one to really deliver when he hits, and boy is this a hit, because outside of charm and a great southern accent (Certainly better than his English accent), Costner is providing a sublte, yet powerful force of obsession and some degree of fear as Jim Garrison cuts deeper and deeper into the horrors of conspiracy and makes many shocking discoveries that could not only affect the nation, but his own life, and Costner's ability to convey all of that with such grace is all too refreshing. Now, in all honesty, the film is not as good as I'm making it sound, but there is still plenty of top-notch stuff pumped into this film, and maybe there's not enough of that top-notch stuff to make the film itself, as a whole, top-notch, but there's still plenty that's genuinely riveting about this film.\r\n\r\nWhen it's all said and, well, said - seeing as nothing's getting done other than talking -, the film is really pulled down and diluted by its countless loose, repetative sequences that lose steam after a while, yet never to the point where the film is left completely devoid of intrigue, because although the film stands to be tighter, it boasts dazzling visuals to engage your eyes and snappy, complex writing to engage your mind as fact and fiction find themselves seamlessly fused - with the help of Oliver Stone and his razor-sharp cast - to make \"JFK\" a consistently enjoyable and thoroughly fascinating study on the truths and theories behind one of America's greatest tragedies and the dark depths surrounding it.\r\n\r\n3/5 - Good",

Jim Garrison (Kevin Costner) a DA of New Orleans is convinced that there is a lot more to what the officials are willing to share and after finding a lot of loop holes in the Warren Commissions report, starts an unauthorized investigation with a small team from his office. He starts putting together facts, speculates certain conspiracy theories and the case starts consuming him. The fear, humiliation, object of losing his family doesn't stop him from going further. \r\nThe amount of information, fact or fiction fed to the audience in extraordinary and since it is a little speculative and involves one of the most popular conspiracy theories, there is a better chance the audience gets sucked into it. Screenplay doesn't allow a single dull moment and every actor gives a one up performance scene after scene. The look of the period and a clever mix of real and shot footage helps too. One problem here is that, it does not just present the important facts and let the viewer decide, it thinks for the viewer too.

            "content": "\"JFK\" is probably the only film in movie history where anyone who reviews it has to start off with a disclaimer:  Where do you stand on The Issue?\r\n\r\nFine.\r\n\r\nI first studied the Kennedy Assassination in a history class in high school called \"America Today\" that covered US history from 1945-until the mid-70s, which, at that time, was present day.  I went over the evidence with my classmates, and, like most of them, I came to the conclusion that there was no lone gunman, there were multiple shooters and providers of logistics and that it's highly questionable that Oswald was even one of the shooters, much less acted alone.  A few months later, as noted in a caption at the end of the film, a Congressional committee agreed with my conclusion.  So, although it's common for those who disbelieve the Warren Commission to be labeled as nutcases or people who need to wear tin foil hats, it should be noted as fact, NOT opinion, that there are conflicting reports from our own government on the subject.\r\n\r\nDisclaimer over.  Now, onto the movie.\r\n\r\n\"JFK\" is simply a masterpiece.  It shocks the audience and makes them think.  What a GREAT achievement for any movie!  That's not something you're going to get from most movies, and, in a country that obsesses over \"Dancing With the Stars\", it should be treasured as the masterpiece it is for that alone, but there is so much more to recommend it.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, it has an ensemble cast to rival \"The Godfather\"  or \"The Longest Day\" in talent.  You have Jack Lemmon, Sissy Spacek, Tommy Lee Jones (Oscar nominee), Kevin Bacon, John Candy, Donald Sutherland, Ed Asner, Joe Pesci, and Gary Oldman.  I can't remember too many movies, before or since, with a better cast that used them all so well.  Not a single performance is wasted.  \r\n\r\nAnd, it's all held together by a TOWERING performance by Kevin Costner.  I'll pay Costner the ultimate compliment:  He infuses his character, New Orleans DA Jim Garrison, with the same courage, idealism and conviction that Jimmy Stewart brought to his performance in \"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington\".  And, Costner's closing argument in the case is one of the greatest speeches in movie history rivaling George C. Scott's opening speech in \"Patton\", Burt Lancaster's trial speech in \"Judgment at Nuremburg\", Spencer Tracy's heartfelt plea for love and tolerance in \"Guess Who's Coming To Dinner\" and Stewart's famous filibuster in the aforementioned \"Mr. Smith Goes To Washington\".  It's a remarkable, stunning sequence and, IMO, Costner didn't win the Oscar he was deservedly nominated for solely due to the controversial nature of the movie itself.  This is simply his best work.\r\n\r\nSecond, \"JFK\" is a technical marvel.  The period look is perfect.  Stone's decision to use an opening newsreel to give historical background followed by a sepia-toned prologue about the assassination is nothing less than brilliant.  And, quite simply, \"JFK\" has the most astonishing editing of any movie I've ever seen--cutting to different film stocks and types to denote flashbacks and events.  This movie makes facts, speculation and history simply sit up and breathe.  Quite an accomplishment.\r\n\r\nReserve plenty of time to watch it as it is well over 3 hours long.  But, I dare you to be bored by any of it.  And, if this is your first exposure to this subject matter, you also won't be able to resist researching it further.\r\n\r\nA final thought as to how I see the movie and its subject matter:  I'm struck by what Donald Sutherland's \"X\" character notes about the how and the why of JFK's murder simply being a parlor game for scenery.  Indeed, there is so much condemnation, ridicule and scorn heaped upon those who support any of the movie's theories that one wonders who the critics of the conspiracy theorists are trying to convince:  Those they criticize or themselves.\r\n\r\nIMO, in a country that claims to be a democracy, but, instead  has had a history of slavery, war profiteering, wars based on lies (the constant invocation and backdrop of The Vietnam War in JFK is spot on), environmental destruction, corporate oligarchy and government corruption at the highest level, it's beyond sad  that a conspiracy to kill a president who tried to do some good for our nation, with the conspirators never being brought to justice, is not beyond the pale, but, instead, is highly plausible.  \r\n\r\nIndeed, that scenario fits right in with the rest of American history.  \r\n\r\nAnd, THAT is the true, tragic power of \"JFK\", regardless of anyone's opinion about its methodology or subject matter.",

This is a truly unique movie - a dizzying three-hour conspiracy theory epic about historical events.  The movie throws an incredible amount of information at you, but is so well-made that you're able to follow it anyway. Oliver Stone isn't always the greatest filmmaker, but perhaps only he could have given us this one.\n\nThe film follows the efforts of New Orleans district attorney Jim Garrison (played by Kevin Costner) in his attempt in the late 1960s to uncover the truth about the assassination of John F. Kennedy. As he delves into the official version of the story and into the lives of associates of Lee Harvey Oswald, he learns that the official version of the assassination by the Warren Commission - that Oswald acted alone in killing Kennedy - can't possibly be true. It is much harder to establish exactly what the truth is, however, as Garrison finds out in his encounters with a wide and sinister web of suspicious characters.\n\nKevin Costner in his glory days plays Garrison, and I think he gives a phenomenal performance. He's fierce and determined without being melodramatic, and his courtroom scenes are just riveting. Tommy Lee Jones is the embodiment of effete creepiness as Clay Shaw, a New Orleans businessman Garrison suspects of involvement in the assassination. Gary Oldman is a very mysterious yet sympathetic Lee Harvey Oswald. Joe Pesci, wearing possibly the worst wig and fake eyebrows in movie history, is terrifically energetic and weird as another suspect. Sissy Spacek is fine as Garrison's wife, though the character is mostly a shrill and peripheral one. A bunch of other actors, including Kevin Bacon, Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau, Ed Asner, Donald Sutherland, and John Candy, appear for a scene or two but make very strong impressions. \n\nThe film is a technical masterpiece, and indeed won Oscars for its cinematography and editing. It has incredible cinematography that hasn't aged a bit. The editing stuffs in quite a lot of disparate documentary sources, and is particularly amazing during the climactic trial scene as Garrison gives his long monologue explaining why the Warren Report must be wrong. The combination in this long final sequence of Oliver Stone's direction, Costner's performance, and the editing make it a stunning piece of filmmaking. It becomes powerfully persuasive, and (assuming none of the facts given in the sequence are made up) I for one left the movie convinced that there must have been a second shooter, and indeed that Lee Harvey Oswald may have been innocent altogether. That magic bullet theory, if the film is explaining it right, is plainly preposterous. Although I know at least some elements of the film are fictionalized, JFK is nonetheless  amazing.",

Kevin Costner and Tommy Lee Jones really shine. I won't go into detail about the films plot as everyone pretty knows the story of this film.

The cast that star in this film make this film work well enough, and JFK is a pretty good conspiracy thriller.

Oliver Stone manages to keep you interested as the film demands the viewer to answer the questions that the film asks. Though I'm not really big into Oliver Stone films, JFK did entertain me, and if you enjoy conspiracy thrillers, you're most likely going to enjoy this one.

            "content": "Oliver Stone's JFK is an exceptional work of controversial matters, and a work I find to be reminiscent of David Fincher's Zodiac, where the lead character becomes obsessed with an otherwise \"closed\" case. It presents an interesting enough topic to attract an audience of legitimate size, and that topic is the assassination of John F. Kennedy and  the conspiracy that surrounds it.\n\nSome may find it's length (which stands at an astounding 3 and a half hours) to be a turn-off. Some may be at odds with the way that the story is presented, which is somewhat a blend of fact and fiction. I'll say that at the beginning, I sort of felt the same way, too. But once you get about ten minutes in and the story picks up, you can't help but find it interesting. Like I said, it's an interesting enough topic. \n\nAnd the running time really isn't a problem. JFK whizzes right on by. Personally, when I spend money on a dvd, I like it to be a little long. Makes me feel like I got my money's worth.\n\nThe movie, as a whole, is very well-acted. It's got an ensemble cast, plus a couple of cameo-like appearances, and everyone is at the top of their game. The writing is great and so is the direction. They're not anything special or out-of-the-ordinary, but they're good, nonetheless.\n\nNormally, I'm not attracted by an Oliver Stone film. They're just something about them that doesn't spark an sort of interest in me. It may have something to do with his recent career turn. Maybe I should pay more attention to his mid 80's to mid 90's filmography. I can see that that's where most of the magic is.",

            "content": "Years later, no one could tell you the honest truth of who they think was behind John F. Kennedy's assassination. People have theorized endlessly about conspiracies, whereas some simply say Oswald was acting alone. Oswald was just raving mad, or Oswald was a devoted ex Marine with well trained skills. Whatever the verdict is now, there technically is no credible evidence as to whether or not there is a conspiracy, but some (such as myself) can't simply accept what the government calls \"the truth.\"\n\nThank God for a guy like Oliver Stone, for making a movie so risky and controversial that he knew society might scoff at. The way I see it, people treat politics as fragile as religion, therefore they don't allow any questioning. We know the theories and the statistics, but it takes a true visionary to make a sort of \"what if\" type film. Here, in this movie, we follow Jim Garrison (played by Kevin Costner) as district attorney of New Orleans. It's clear from the very beginning that Garrison is a man with determination. How he got where he is is never quite explained, but it can be implied (through a story he tells of taking on 9 men in court, and winning) he's a man who won't go down. Even as his interrogation of one of his accused conspirators (played by Tommy Lee Jones) rats him out and goes public he stays true to what he believes in. Now, history and facts aside, this is a great theme in other courtroom drama films (12 Angry Men, To Kill A Mockingbird) about integrity and going against what the accepted order is.\n\nIn \"JFK\" we follow Garrison's side of the story so well it's sort of automatic to side with him. Sure, the evidence he finds may have not been recorded by the Warren Commission or the CIA, and we can never really know what facts Stone may have made fiction. Regardless, it's an interesting attempt to expose what a lot of people to believe is a corrupt government. What Garrison fins ultimately as the film progresses, is that JFK's assassination isn't something could've been done by a man alone. Was it the mob? The Cubans? What he finds is an even more sinister plot. One to rule the country with menacing power. A force that still rules today--the government.\n\nSo what ultimatum could you come to? In a film like \"JFK\" the main character can only go so far with his supporters to get his theory understood. Now, when the movie comes to a close, it isn't necessarily important whether or not what we just saw was true fact. What is important is that the American people take to heart what the message of the movie was trying to deliver. Like the title card says at the end, \"What is past is present,\" our greatest fears may lie in what we put most of our faith in to built our country. There may be incomprehensible forces that can sabotage and destroy things, keep wars raging and certain political figures out of office. Pretty disturbing when you consider all the power the government has. \n\nRegardless of what this movie brings up, there will always be even more ludicrous theories presented. By now (and it's been 20 years since this film's debut) I expect people should at least learn from this movie. It holds as great an importance to America as \"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington\" does. If SO MANY people are 100% positive on who killed Kennedy, then why does this subject never cease to stir controversy? Because people want to look for a conspiracy? I don't think so. People refuse to let it die, one so many eye witnesses can't shave away from their memory (no matter how many right wing or left wing bigots and stubborn politicians try and silence them). Hollywood as just put a frame around the much looked at problem. It's a mystery as broad as the pyramids, and one we might never conclude.",

John Williams's eerie and suspenseful ( and has a military flavour in it) score, builds the important bits to the movie, and allows it to soar.\n\nCostner's speech at the climax may have drop the bomb on the white house, but it is ever so real and poignant, that every countrymen will question what happen on that faithful day and their own govs.\n\nAnd the films also succeeds in engaging the audience to use their intelligence, and to raise fears among the audience.

Ebert's argument for such high praise is that it captures the emotional truth of John F. Kennedy's assassination.  The truth being - that the American people felt there was cover up in the JFK assissnation.  Ebert never suggests that JFK is factual and in fact seems certian that it is not, but he doesn't seem to care.  He likes the fact that Oliver Stone makes a movie like this, a movie that a documentary can't deliver - a movie that protrays feelings instead of facts.\r\n\r\nI agree with Ebert that JFK is well made movie - ranking it in the top 100 films of all time - I'm not so sure about that - I'm not even sure this is the best movie Oliver Stone has ever made.  At times JFK gets caught up in its questions - a birage of questions that are forgotten as soon as the movie is over.  It makes for a long winded and convulted argument.  It makes the movie way to long.\r\n\r\n  I'm also not a big fan of conspiracy theories in general - 9/11, walking on the moon, Martin Luther King - conspiracy theories often trivialize serious events, and turn them into comedy gong show that distracts from the true nature of the event.  Admitedly there are a lot of questions surrounding the death of JFK and if there is a conspiracy theory I'd be tempted to adhere to it would be Kennedy's assassination.  But still you can't watch JFK and honestly say Stone didn't set up a straw man.  Certainly there is another side to this story - the truth for which Jim Garrison so staunchly agrues deserves a better critique.  Emotional truth sure - but not at the expense of the facts - otherwise you end up on the wrong side of the joke.",

All the different conspiracy theories, unchecked facts and unanswered questions could very well have been answered or debunked before or since the movie's release over 20 years ago; but, the movie does such phenomenal work holding our hand through the nature of the scruples and then letting us think for ourselves when it reaches its many conclusions that just don't add up with the official report.  The editing is a slick mix of documentary footage, recreations, and voiceover narration that place the viewer right in the thick of the confusion and mayhem.  It's very very effective; more amazing is that it doesn't lose its efficacy, despite assembling a staggering amount of famous faces to lend their own small interpretation to history.  To his credit, Kevin Costner was tolerable, and perhaps a little more than that with this performance; it's too bad his family had to suffer at the hands of his obsession, but the family plot felt a bit too tacked on.  The family strife may have been true, but it was one of the few times in its whole length where it felt like a movie and not a History Channel special (that's bad).  It seemed like Stone put that in there so it wasn't just a bunch of neat little anecdotes and angles of the assassination all plastered together.  Sissy Spacek's impatient wife was probably there to lend cohesion.  Still and all, it's nice work on Stone's part (how did he get John Williams to lend his incomparable talents?) and it definitely evinces his zeal for the truth and his unwilingness to swallow everything his government tells him.",

Garrison asks questions that were never satisfactorily answered, and maybe have no answers.

Kennedy has taken place. Two days later, a man named Lee Harvey Oswald, who the FBI had interrogated about the prolific murder without recording a single piece of his statement, is shot dead by a Kennedy follower while being escorted outside of a station. Soon, an investigator Jim Morrison (Kevin Costner) stumbles onto the case, and finds many discrepancies and issues with the interrogation process...and history, to that of the apparent assassin, Lee Harvey Oswald. He, along with a large of investigators, begins to piece together the locations and origination of Oswald before Kennedy's murder.\r\n\r\nWhether the film is fiction or non-fiction, with facts stretched beyond believability, this is a highly engrossing, thought-provoking, and believable film. The film stretches, and I go by the director's cut, of 205 minutes, and it doesn't lose its suspense for one minute. The many scenes of them questioning the relationship between Oswald and other men, including a wealthy guy named Clay Shaw and Bertrand (two last names, played by Tommy Lee Jones), plus the flashbacks are so fascinating. One particular scene with the flashbacks, and even the interrogation, with David Ferrie (Joe Pesci), who witnessed the associations with Shaw/Bertrand and Oswald is incredible well done (and well-acted as well). I suppose the small criticism with this movie is a scene of a fight between Morrison and his wife (Sissy Spacek), over ignoring his family. This scene, perhaps, may not have been needed, but somehow, it seemed well-suited. It is hard to say. The last 45 minutes in the courtroom are truly compelling. Political thrillers, such as \"All The President's Men\" and \"The Manchurian Candidate\" (1963 version) have tendency to be exciting, and JFK definitely falls into this category of greatness.\r\n\r\nIn addition, if you watch this film and thought that Oswald was the assassin of JFK, your opinion might change. Mine may have, thanks to the in depth investigation of the murder and where the original gunshots had originated. Morrison believed that there were others involved and he continuously investigated, even still when Oliver Stone's film was being made. Tragically, he never was able to solve the mysteries, due to his death, the year after the release. Too bad! A man so heavily dedicated in solving Kennedy's murder failed to succeed.",

            "content": "JFK follows New Orleans district attorney Jim Garrison (Kevin Costner) as he latches on to loose ends poking out of Kennedy's assassination, and becomes obsessed with unraveling the threads. As the narrative plays out, we are treated to some of the most notable actors of all time who appear quite awkwardly. The long list of notables includes Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau and Sissy Spacek as Garrison's wife who is all but ignored as Garrison concentrates on conspiracy. Oddest of all is the appearance of Joe Pesci and Tommy Lee Jones, both of whom sported a bizarre hair-and-makeup job. But the real kicker is how Stone intersperses footage he shoots for the movie with newsreel footage of famous and infamous events and figures associated with the Kennedy assassination, the 1960s and Washington politics. This emotionally charged montage of images includes footage of crosses burning, Malcolm X and Martin Luther King, Jr. as well as the Cuban missile crisis and of course the assassinations of Kennedy and Oswald. Most manipulative of all is the way Stone uses the newsreel footage with his own faux-aged footage to distort the past and blur the lines between reality and \"stonality\", for lack of a better word.\n\nTo be fair, Stone had somewhat noble motives in developing JFK - to remind the American people to not \"sin with silence\" (a quote from the movie), but as the saying goes the path to hell is paved with good intentions. Clearly, Stone advocates questioning leaders, holding them accountable and never letting government grow too powerful or dangerous. But film is the most powerful medium and when does revisionism and film manipulation grow too powerful or dangerous? Like a schoolyard bully who doesn't know the size of his own muscles, Stone creates such a powerful illusion, convincing narrative and emotionally loaded series of images that - as far as an ignorant populace is concerned - his film essentially unseats history in favor of its own agenda. What is that agenda? Stone's Garrison says it directly after the initial montage of footage ends: \"Today I am ashamed to be an American\". If JFK airs at least every year, that shame can be perennial.\n\nA new generation of moviegoers sees the Kennedy assassination not through history's lens, but through Stone's, forever impacting public perception about the most visible national tragedy next to 9/11/01. I won't get into an analysis of all the ways Stone's account differs from reality or the reasons he ignores and massages facts. For that I recommend an excellent Atlantic article, JFK: Oliver Stone's Fictional Reality, by Edward Jay Epstein, a real associate of the real Jim Garrison, as opposed to the make-believe associates of the make-believe Garrison, played by Costner. To Stone's fans who adore the film and believe it to be art and a great constitutional call to arms, I would caution that it is the height of irresponsibility in artistic license to use the death of a leader and a country's mourning as the launching pad to replace fact with fiction. Of course, Stone also works his own voice through Garrison's mouth in telegraphed ways - mostly about the military industrial complex, but also when Liz Garrison wants her husband to be with their kids. \"You know I don't like these tribal rituals,\" Garrison says of an Easter egg hunt.\n\nLike many figures whose lives have actually intersected with Stone's work, including Ray Manzarek of The Doors and Edward Jay Epstein of Jim Garrison's team, I find Stone's film not just irresponsible and factually inaccurate but purposefully manipulative in a reckless way. This review will no doubt generate its share of controversy, but that is what Oliver Stone invites: controversy.",

Everyone in this star-studded cast brought their A-game for \"JFK\". From Kevin Costner's commanding turn as Jim Garrison to Gary Oldman's dynamic portrayal of Lee Harvey Oswald, the acting remains a flawless aspect of the film. Another aspect of the film I admired was the Oscar-winning cinematography. Cinematographer Robert Richardson does a stunning job at seamlessly integrating actual archive footage and mock archive footage into the film. He also does a fairly impressive job with lighting techniques in some more tense scenes. Overall, \"JFK\" struck a very powerful chord with me, and it remains a fairly provocative film that enforces that the power to question is one of the most effective abilities of the citizens of a country.",

Just like Jim Garrison, the film never slows down. The film does open up a lot of ideas about what really happened, but the great thing about this movie is that it can be enjoyed no matter if you believe parts of what they are saying or not. The cast is absolutely amazing in this movie. It's scene after scene of recognizable faces and big names. Costner, Jones, Oldman, Spacek, Pesci, Laurie Metcalf, Gary Grubbs, Jay O Sanders, Vincent D'Onorfio, John Candy, and Donald Sutherland, and the list goes on, but thats who I remember. It's an amazingly well shot film and it it won the Best Cinematography Oscar. Kevin Costner is electric in his role and his last speech during the trial of Clay Shaw is powerful and really well executed. The film shows us glaring faults in the investigation of JFK and then basically tells us to go find the truth. The film is dedicated to the young who seek the truth. This is Oliver Stones best film by far and the guy has made some really good movies; Platoon, Wall Street, Salvador, and the always overlooked Talk Radio.

It is actually about the New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison, and his prooving of the conspiracy behind the Assassination of Kennedy. It is a well-acted and suprisingly entertaining film (at least for me). I was almost never bored in the film. There is some great cinematography and editing used in the film. However, I must admit that I did get kind of bored before the climactic and jaw-dropping last thirty minutes. After that, I was so astounded that I couldn't even talk.

And I knew that in general this film was going to be pretty inaccurate and take as much dramatic license as possible in the name of telling a great, engaging, and absorbing story. \n\nAnd, now that I've seen it, I can easily say that yes, this is a riveting cinematic experience. But, I do think it's overrated and not the full on masterpiece it's been touted as being. However, if you treat the film as having no relation to reality in any way whatsoever, ie as just a fictional investigation into a fictional assassination, it still holds up as a wonderful story about a guy determined to bring about truth and justice. But, it's not totally fictional. It's a look at probably the most well known assassination of all time. \n\nI honestly don't know what to believe in watching the film, and I'm not sure if Stone really knows the truth either. I'm not sure anyone does. That's not the point. The fact that people obsess over this case is a testament to its power. The fact that this is such a talked about and controversial movie is an even further testament to the strength of things. \n\nDespite some dodgy writing and conclusions, this film is a brilliant show of cinematography and editing, especially with the editing. The presentation, like some of Stone's other works, is a frenetic, schizophrenic explosions of various filters, lenses, formats, styles, and techniques, all in the name of artistry, symbolism, or some other sort of important reason. And...it works. It definitely makes for a unique experience, that's for sure. \n\nDon't ask me to name the whole cast. That'd be insane. I think Stone may have out Altmaned Altman on this one. The choices are excellent though, and it's nice seeing so many notable names, especially since a lot of them are in tiny roles or cameos, and many agreed to take pay cuts to be in the film.  Costner is absolutely brilliant as Garrison, and Rooker, Knight, Sanders, and Metcalf are all equally strong as his underlings. Gary Oldman knocks it out of the park as Lee Harvey Oswald, which I expected, but for me, the two best performances after Costner belong to Joe Pesci and Donald Sutherland.  Pesci's breakdown and Suther;and's monologue rank as some of the best moments of their respective careers, and the final courtroom monologue given by Costner is one of the most epic things ever.\n\nI really enjoyed this film despite its flaws. I feel it is definitely an important piece of work, because it really did open up a lot of eyes, and it did so in such a stellar cinematic way, but it didn't shake me enough to warrant the full grade that this sort of thing typcially illicits from me. Defintiely give it a watch though.",

JFK details the details that detail one of the most infamous days in American history, the assassination of President John F. Kennedy is studied so hard in this film that it's an all out ambush on one's senses.  It's an epic and classic political thriller that stops for nothing in it's astonishing fast paced and ultra-kinetic narrative.  A film that every American needs to see, a triumpant and towering success that details a landmark of grief and sadness in Americana with absolute flawlessness.  Stone's visceral and bombastic trademark of storytelling is utterly effective here, it's a completely wicked punch of suspense, tension, history, and historical vividness that assaults the eyes and the mind.  Films like this just don't appeal to the masses, which is a seriously sad fact given the pure subject matter and historical accuracy (or inaccuracy as some believe.)  A movie of one man's determination to make a difference, to overcome all the fabrications and falsehoods in a quest for the absolute truth.  The movie that has it all, if it was related to the JFK assassination it's in this movie, all the conspiracies, all of the footage (even the shockingly graphic Abraham Zapruder footage) the truths, as well as the falsehoods.  Exceptional film making and completely stunning editing for the entire 3 hours.  Oliver Stone delivered masterpiece here.  An epic of politics, Americana, and historical significance that will never be matched.\n            Kevin Costner stars in a riveting and a pure performance of brilliance throughout.  It also stars Gary Oldman (the ultimate 90's villain) as Lee Harvey Oswald.  Electrifying performances by all involved including Sissy Spacek, Joe Pesci, Tommy Lee Jones, Michael Rooker, and Laurie Metcalf.  A steller cast with even better acting.  A masterwork all the way around.",

            "content": "Oliver Stone's JFK is a rare feat in the movie industry:  a 3+ hour film that doesn't at any point seem to drag or feel at all superfluous.  That in and of itself is a remarkable achievement, which can be credited to Stone's expert storytelling that is on display here, which keeps the film moving swiftly along towards the final showdown in the courtroom.\r\n\r\nKevin Costner plays Jim Garrison, a district attorney in New Orleans who decides to unravel the perceived conspiracy behind the assassination of JFK.  He, along with his staff, begin piecing together the various bits of evidence, chasing lead after lead and eventually setting their sites on a target to take to court as the only person to ever be prosecuted for involvement in the death of JFK.  That man is Clay Shaw, played with superb understatement by Tommy Lee Jones in one of the best performances of his career.  \r\n\r\nThe ordeal puts the kind of hardship on Garrison and his family that we often see in the \"fight the system\" legal thrillers, but it feels much more honest and real here than it does in other films.  Perhaps this is because Garrison was an actual person, or perhaps it is because of the performances of Costner and Sissy Spacek, who plays his wife, or perhaps, and most likely, it is a combination of the two.  Whatever the reason, the stakes surrounding this investigation feel appropriately high, which gives a great sense of weight to the finale of the film.\r\n\r\nAlong the way, Stone employs the best of the best in Hollywood in the supporting cast.  Along for the ride in supporting roles are Kevin Bacon, Gary Oldman, John Candy, Walter Matthau, Jack Lemmon, Joe Pesci, and the list goes on.  Normally it would be distracting to go through a 3+ hour film and constantly see famous face after famous face pop up for a few lines of dialogue, but the actors do such a great job in their varying amounts of screen time that we actually buy them as the characters they play, rather than simply being there as celebrity cameos.  \r\n\r\nStone also does a phenomenal job of mixing real video footage of the time period with his own original footage of the actors doing their work.  It gives the film a sense of perspective and setting that might otherwise be missing, and it adds a sense of authenticity to the proceedings as well.\r\n\r\nEven though it clocks in at over 3 hours, Oliver Stone's JFK is a riveting legal mystery thriller that keeps its audience on the edge of their seats for the duration.",

Equally condemnatory on Garrison's obsession with studying this case to the point of driving his wife insane and his meeting with Mr. X (who brings an interesting theory as to why Kennedy was shot), this film is practically Oliver Stone's greatest achievement as a director. Forget about the schizophrenically sadistic \"Natural Born Killers\" and the stoic \"Platoon\" - for relative cinematic nirvana by one of America's most celebrated directors, \"JFK\" is hands down the way to go.\n\nWhile strange in presenting the alternate myth that Lee Harvey Oswald had absolutely nothing to do with the shooting and had actually acted with a group of homosexual renegades led by David Ferrie (Joe Pesci) just so he could get some information about this assassination attempt that they were going to do just because Kennedy \"gave the niggers their rights\", the film does accurately debunk the infamous \"magic bullet theory\" that Earl Warren gave to us. After hearing Costner explain how insane such a shot that is (and especially after looking at the Zapruder film through his eyes), we can either be convinced that Kennedy was killed just to kickstart the Vietnam War (and look what we made out of that) or that Stone is just a crazed nut.\n\nThe truth is: it's just a movie.

            "content": "Director: Oliver Stone\r\nWriter:  Based on \"The Trail of the Assassins (Jim Garrison) \r\n         Cross: The Plot that killed Kennedy (Jim Marris)\r\nMains:  Kevin Costner, Kevin Bacon, Tommy Lee Jones,\r\n        Gary Oldman and Sissy Spacey\r\n\r\nNot who. Not How. But Most Importantly Why?\r\n\r\nSynopsis: This movie is about the Assassination of Jesse James oops sorry The Assassination of JFK. The world is shocked by the assassination of JFK. It takes its toll on the American public but more on Jim Garrison (Kevin Costner) the New Orleans District Attorney. Garrison has taken a personal interest in this fishy assassination and wants to get to the bottom of it. Battling with his wife he wants to show the public things the the government covered up in addition he's also battling over his marriage because of the time in effort put into the onion layered case. The battle for the truth starts now.\r\n\r\nMy Take: Before a start i would like to mention that it took me a solid 30 mins to adjust to the horrible accent of Kevin Costner. It was as painful and difficult as my eyes adjusting to a 3-D movie. Now thats out the way this movie was AWESOME. Evey one still today would like to know the entire truth behind JFK's assassination. Did the CIA do it? Was the FBI involved? Was the White House Involved? Did the Cubans kill JFK? How about Lee Harvey??? No one know but this movie tells off a damn pretty good theory. Highly believable, but i what i love most about this film is they explain why. Why would anyone want to kill JFK. CHANGE is a terrible thing to someone who is comfortable. CHANGE is mostly a unwanted risk. JFK was all about change and this could of possibly ended his young life. This movie explains so much about this whole conspiracy and so much about the true power the government has. Mass Media Control is probably the biggest. Oliver Stone really gets you involved in this one. The movie is 3hrs and 30mis long and i didnt blink. Possibly one of the best court scenes ever!! I was really pleased with this film and it gets a 5/5 from me true or not. Remember its all based of some facts and some theories.\r\n\r\nConclusion: I feel that any American is obligated to see this movie. Yes the acting is off and you can debate back and fourth of its authenticity but the fact still remains that this event took place right here in our back yards. Oliver Stone shows you every angle, every gap and every loop. This film was amazing and it explained allot of things i didnt know about the JFK assassination. Does it add up? Of course it does IMO, this was a great take on the whole plot. Remember that the movie is based off of 2 books by 2 different writers. I loved every minute of this long movie except Kevin Costner's horrible voice.\r\n\r\nAs a mentioned put aside the authenticity or the director adding his own views this movie is a Incredible Political Thriller!!\r\n\r\nMust See!\r\n\r\n5/5",

And JFK succeeds in this aim. In fact, the movie is so inspiring that the very word doesn't seem adequate to describe it--\"inspiring\" is so overused these days, when it should be kept safe somewhere in order to be taken out and used when describing things like JFK, especially the last 40 minutes or so, in which Jim Garrison's final speech to the jury makes even Atticus Finch look like one of those chimpanzees that can only string together a few words at a time in sign language. JFK makes your fingers shake and your heart pound (again, banal, but appropriate in this context); it's the kind of movie that makes you wander the house in a daze, and you're afraid to give even the slightest attention to anything else for many hours afterwards (a book, the news, another movie, tv, some random video your brother's watching on youtube) for fear of corrupting the emotions that have taken possession of you.

            "content": "Hmmmm...difficult to judge. On the one hand I enjoy the characters and the overall cinematography that subtly ties the film together, yet on the other I could have sworn that Kennedy survived Oswald's bullet to fight alongside a replicant Jose Canseco against Abraham Lincoln's psycho-ninjas during the Second American Revolution of 1912. I guess what it really comes down to are my criteria for good filmmaking versus historical accuracy (and when the History Channel kicks your ass in historical accuracy, you know you're f-ed). What do I enjoy more: quality directing or cyborg-JFK riding a woolly-hippopotamus into the Battle of Sugarlick Canyon?\r\n\r\nDamn...I guess I'm going to have to go with filmmaking on this one-which means the forgotten story of evil Lincoln uprising against the Bull-Moose Society will have to be shelved once again until America is finally ready to hear the truth. \r\n\r\nOliver Stone is one of those polarizing directors who can craft a perfect, memorable film but which-in retrospect-many people may want to forget. And while many of Stone's films such as Platoon and Nixon may bend a few facts to reach a higher truth, JFK is notably distinct in that it completely f-ing warps time and space to reach its conclusions. Shove a copy of Howard Zinn's A People's History of the United States into a paper shredder then try to crazy glue the thing back together on the inside cover of a Dan Brown novel until the text resembles Lee Harvey Oswald doing the Surra de Bunda with Fidel Castro and you'll have a pretty decent idea of Stone's screenplay, if you catch my meaning. It's such a fun and engaging plot you can actually reenact it without leaving your couch, just wiggle your finger against your lips and babble loudly-it's like Oliver Stone is sitting right next to you, discussing his newest Wall Street movie!\r\n\r\nBut then I did promise I'd defend the artistic integrity of this film, didn't I. Yes, despite all my pointless bitching and ranting there's a lot to be praised with Stone's work. For one there's the superlative cinematography which expertly blends the use of various footage styles and formats into one seamless fusion of events. In fact, I'd be willing to bet that the indistinguishable use of both real and fictional footage is one of the reasons why some people find this film so engrossing while others find it so repugnant. At the very least it makes the film all the more powerful-after all isn't it filmmaking's greatest achievement to make the audience believe in the movie's reality? Then again, we do have people suffering from Avatar induced depressions don't we, so maybe all Oliver Stone really needed was to blow out the back of Kennedy's head...IN 3-D!!!\r\n\r\nComplementing Stone's directing is a cast that can only be described as \"all-star.\" In addition to Kevin Costner taking the lead role as Jim Garrison, we also have Kevin Bacon, Joe Pesci, Tommy Lee Jones, Gary Oldham, John Candy, Sissy Spacek, that guy from 6th Day, that guy from Bad News Bears, and Newman from Seinfeld...okay, so maybe they're not all gold stars but at least we have a solid compilation of silver and bronze ones. Appropriately enough, the acting is well-executed as well and it's hard not to watch the terrific final courtroom scene without getting swept up in Costner's argument (this scene is particularly dear to me since I finally grasped the double irony of a similar scene from Seinfeld).Honestly, I would rank Costner's performance in JFK as probably the best in his career, although I'm sure my younger brother Stuart would vote for Waterworld...he's a simple kid. For everything this movie lacks in the coherent story department, it really makes up for in every other possible way.\r\n\r\nSo once again I have to ask where I stand on this film. Although handled with great technical and artistic expertise, Stone blurs the thin line between art and propaganda is beyond recognition with this one. Like a dog circling around a fire-hydrant, I just need to stand my ground and let the piss fall where it may. Perhaps the opinion closest to mine is Roger Ebert's-this isn't so much a pack of lies so much as it is a mood piece. No matter what the intent of this film is or was, it perfectly captures the emotions and reactions the average American harbored for their government after 1963. It was a mess. A clusterf***, if you don't mind the comparison to something substantially more organized and with fewer holes (in the story). Few things can ever quite reflect that loss of innocence, that dissolution of trust in the American government, or that overwhelming desire to understand just what the f*** is going on. In that sense, this film succeeds admirably. \r\n\r\nPost-script: I referenced it, so being a good little college-grad I should probably list my sources.

Tommy Lee Jones and Kevin Bacon are a pleasure to watch. Donald Sutherland, Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau and even John Candy, Sally Kirkland and Vincent D'Onofrio deliver little parts of the puzzle without ever becoming distracting. Gary Oldman is a chilling dead ringer for Lee Harvey Oswald.

In fact, his movie suggests five possible conspiracy theories;  1) Communists 2) Texas Oilmen and Defense Contractors 3) The CIA and anti-Castro forces 4) Mafia and 5) A military / industrial complex.  New Orleans DA Jim Garrison had his own opinion, and you may agree with him after listing to the persuasive dialogue of Mr X - who in real life was Colonel Fletcher Prouty of the Special Ops Force.  Since nobody credible has stepped forward to admit their complicity in such a conspiracy in nearly fifty years, it is difficult to agree with the conclusion of Garrison.  After all, we now know Mark Felt was Deep Throat, the informant of the Watergate crimes.  Anyhow, the conclusion of this movie is far less important to me than how they got there, and this movie had an excellent supporting cast, including John Candy, Kevin Bacon, Donald Sutherland in surprising roles.",

This is NOT a film about JFK, which led many viewers astray.

To be honest, there probably is more embellishment than fact, as the Kennedy controversy still remains in the air today.  The grueling footage of the Zapruder film analyzed and documented in the final courtroom scene is chilling.  Tommy Lee Jones gives a wonderful performance, along with Mr. Pesci and an overlooked Ms. Spacek.  The film, of course, belongs to Mr. Costner and a brief and devastatingly important moment with Donald Sutherland.\n\nControversy will make you watch the film.

And the acting was great ranging from all kinds of actors but mainly I give credit to Costner and Tommy Lee Jones who were both great all the way through the film and I thought Costner derserved a rare Best Actor nomination but I was glad to see Tommy Lee Jones got one for Supporting Actor. The story was great as well and made us think what kind of a world we liveed in then and still do now but the biggest problem I have with the story/screenplay is the talking their was way too much talking in this film and especially the last court scene with Costner talking for almost half an hour and doing that will ake the film and the ending drag and drag some more. But I give credit to Oliver Stone who I have always thought has been a great director and this was one of his best but nowhere near Platoon or Born On The Fourth Of July or even Midnight Express but this film was good but its flaws defintley show. Good film. 80%",

            "content": "JFK, Great Movies\nIn the time since I first saw the film \"JFK\", I have found myself inexplicably drawn to the events in Dallas, TX on November 22, 1963. I have researched online and in libraries to learn the truth of these events, and I would say that my outlook on those matters has changed substantially. But underneath that, and the controversy that developed from it, there is one universal and almost indisputable truth regarding the film: JFK is simply an excellent movie. And no difference of opinion can refute this. I have seen my fair share of films over the years, I'm not a cinema maniac by any means. But I think I can judge a quality product when I see one and that's simply what this picture presents. It is, as Tom Wicker of the New York Times said at it's release, propaganda; but the same can be said for every film by Michael Moore... of whom I'm NOT a fan... but they are still strong pictures. JFK runs the difficult task of presenting fact, fiction, conjecture and opinion, twisting them all to present the increasingly difficult to dispute conclusion that Lee Harvey Oswald did not act alone (and according to director Oliver Stone, did not act) in the assassination of President Kennedy.\nThe films accomplishments though, past this controversial thesis, are many: \n1.) Kevin Costner turns in one of the greatest performances of his career. While his accent is stronger than Garrison and the physical resemblance not astonishing, Costner three dimensionalizes a character and lives in it throughout the film.\n2.) An impressive and versatile cast is used superbly. The film is loaded with quality stars such as Kevin Bacon, Tommy Lee Jones (in an Oscar nominated role), Gary Oldman, and Joe Pesci (who share an intense and crucial scene); as well as character actors and actresses such as Michael Rooker, Sissy Spacek, and Jay Saunders. Stone even navigates a dramatic turn from the late comedy great John Candy and utilizes Hollywood legends Ed Asner, Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau and Donald Sutherland superbly.\n3.) With the possible exception of the lone gunman theory, every possibility of truth is explored, at least in dialogue. Because the case has never been fully elaborated on no one can say for certain what the truth is; Stone presents all views while advancing his theory.\n4.) The film is a masterwork of editing. It won the Oscar for film editing in 1991, and deserved it. I once read in Entertainment Weekly that a normal film has roughly 200 cuts in it; there are more than sixty in the opening minutes alone here. Even more impressive when you consider the variety of film used.\nJFK is not absolute fact, it does not truly pretend to be. By Stone's own admission, Laurie Metcalf, Michael Rooker, and Kevin Bacon play composites or dramatized characters, not the real thing. But standing alone as a movie, JFK is untouchably excellent. And if it does force you to question, as Costner's Garrison asks in the closing moments \"of what is our government made?\", then it's all for the better.",

As the film goes on we're dragged further into what we're supposed to believe is the truth. I'm not sure if Oliver Stone's point was to make these conspiracies come true but rather just tell that story as it happened. A Louisiana DA learns certain information about a case and thus pursues what he believes to be the truth. Perhaps a black ops coup is a little out there, but the fact that his office was bugged and many of his key witnesses have since died does make the story interesting.\n\nI wasn't a big fan of Sissy Spacek, but that may be an issue with the writers. I never understood the scenes were the wife can't believe her husband is pursuing something we the audience can see is worthwhile. Besides that, I enjoyed the storytelling and will say the scene with Donald Sutherland explains a lot in a short amount of time, but it was still enjoyable. Much like a Law and Order episode.",

But it is also brilliant. It carves its drama based on actual events -- the assassination of the thirty-fifth president of the United States, John F. Kennedy. What is mesmerizing about JFK is its meticulous approach to adapting a real life historical phenomenon through known actors and its disinterring deductive arguments. JFK is skeptical, yes, but it also does not flinch in telling a story. It becomes so eager in exposing the clandestine assassination that the film becomes a conspiracy itself. Oliver Stone tells a convincing tale and he covers every angle. By the end of it all, you'll be locked in Stone's conscience. It tells you what the director think happened but that does not necessarily make it true or defined. It reveals only the possible. After such an unexpected event, there needed to be an angle. Something to point us in a direction, whether it is valid or not.\r\n\r\nJFK does not perhaps work as a reliable history lesson, because history class inhibits facts and is hesitant on interpretation. Stone acts as a dramatic historian -- it allows him to incorporate his opinions in the factual evidence. What dirt can this director dig up? His story revolves around the real life story of Jim Garrison (Kevin Costner), a New Orleans District Attorney who applies witnesses, evidence, and pure conjecture in discovering who, in fact, killed Kennedy. Stone, though far from my favourite directors, plays his cards right here. Stone often got wrapped up in character-centred stories (Natural Born Killers and Alexander) that it snared his ability to tell a general story around a pursuable onlooker. JFK is a kinetic causal pyramid not a forgettable cat and mouse game. Events build up to a pinnacle pay off. Okay, so Stone eventually relinquishes to court room drama, but he will save himself (I promise, I will elaborate later on).\r\n\r\nJFK has a stellar opening. It presents itself onscreen as an intellectual tool. It's in documentary style and the commencing credits allude to the cocking of the gun that shot Kennedy. Through documentary footage alone, Stone grabs our attention. Then JFK snowballs into a back and forth narrative of Garrison's journey in revealing the culprits of the assassination and then effortlessly cutting to the pre-assassination shenanigans between the suspects: Lee Harvey Oswald (Gary Oldman), Guy Bannister (Edward Asner), and Clay Shaw (Tommy Lee Jones). Well, the last two are actually witnesses who interacted with Lee Harvey Oswald. They may just be the gateway to unraveling something much more intricate and elaborate than anyone once thought. That's what drives JFK. Its mystery floods the screen. The characters's motives are so vague that we can't help but allow Stone to gradually reveal them to us. \r\n\r\nStone's film is compacted with credibility because it interprets a real life story that questioned the assassination. It's not just Stone's thoughts, it's his dramatic application on another's thoughts. In the end, they ultimately have to be perceived as the directors. His build is extravagant. His pace is slick. There are numerous things happening at once but Stone always provides a voice over to guide us through the sequences. We watch each event and put the pieces together ourselves. By the end of JFK, we have our own little conspiracy theory.\r\n\r\nThere is even a laconic scene involving Donald Sutherland, playing a retired agent named X. As clich\u00e9 as the pseudonym comes across, the rendezvous between X and Jim untwines another thread of the plot. As X claims, he can provide Jim with the background, all Jim needs to do is establish the foreground. It is subtext: to all the audience, it is up to you to put it all together. Stone will provide us with the skeptical theories and our interpretations will undoubtedly rectify. Don't be surprised. Your solutions may precisely compare to the directors.\r\n\r\nStone also handles the family side to Garrison's life with care. We are compelled to watch Jim interact with his concerned wife (played by Sissy Spacek) and his few children because Stone ascertains an important dilemma. Jim is distant from his family because he wants to create a just country for his children. Not a place where we will always bury our head in the sand. His wife insists he is not loving anymore; his impassive approach to them is crushing. Especially in these times. Stone envisions this scenario properly: to certain degrees, both Jim and his wife are both right.\r\n\r\nJFK slightly underplays itself in the third act. Garrison endures a trial against Clay Shaw, claiming he was an accomplice in the assassination. Inevitably, JFK had to wallow in courtroom drama, for this is what happened in Garrison's tumultuous yet esteemed career in 1969. Stone is toying with historical inquiry not historical fact. But that climactic turn is just so unwelcoming. JFK starts to conclude its ideas on a too literal note. It feels as if Jim Garrison is talking at the camera -- with a sombre retrospective, he feeds us his ideas. For a director, it is too obvious. Too plain. But in all fairness, Stone rescues this sequence through some suave editing. After a daunting ten minute speech by Costner, the recollecting events combine into a flawless answer. Stone has his interpretation delivered on a silver platter.\r\n\r\nStone masters JFK because he fulfills the story with pungent ideas and palpitating drama. Was the government in fact involved in killing their own leader? Okay, that's a stretch, Stone. Or is it? JFK is that good with its persuasiveness. It covers every angle up until no other reasoning seems applicable or available. Just Stone's. JFK, as a result, is more of a historical theory than a cinematic afterthought. It handles this daunting event with emotion, dilemmas, mystery, and a myriad of questions. Was there something more to Kennedy's killing that didn't end with Oswald? One thing's for sure, there is something more to Stone. He truly is a virtuoso in historical drama. \r\n\r\nI SAY--See It.",

To me, that speaks volumes to how good this movie is, that it is so powerful, and had such an impact, that an Act of Congress was passed because of it.\r\n\r\nJust a great watch. A long movie that really has some amazing filming techniques. Sometimes goes a little fast, but gives some great angles and looks from everybody's point of view. \r\n\r\nIt's a movie that leaves you thinking and pondering.

The amount of research, time and energy that went into this movie really shines through. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not just an erroneous conspiracy theory, but a highly justified examination of our government and misinformation regarding political issues. On a technical note, JFK is also one of Oliver Stone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s best shot films. In many ways it is a beautiful piece to look at, regardless of content. The attention to detail concerning film stock, found footage mixed with the movie is extremely impressive. I love how they would use B&W cameras, 8mm & 16mm just to show you different parts of the history surrounding the case. It also has an unbelievable cast led by a wonderful Kevin Costner. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s completely mesmerizing on so many levels. Even if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a non-believer, you can still appreciate it for being a great work of art.",

It concerns New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison, played impressively by Kevin Costner, in a bravura performance, and his involvement in finding the truth about the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, which will become his obsession. Garrison conducts his own investigation with his trusted team, and what they discover will lead him to his prime suspect in the assassination conspiracy, the prominent aristocratic gay businessman Clay Shaw, brilliantly played by Tommy Lee Jones, in an unforgettable Academy Award nominated performance. Dramatic moviemaking with masterful direction by Oliver Stone, and extraordinary supporting performances by Gary Oldman, Kevin Bacon, Sissy Spacek, Michael Rooker, Joe Pesci, Jay O. Sanders, Jack Lemmon, Ed Asner, Donald Sutherland, Brian- Doyle Murray, Vincent D' Onofrio, John Candy, Wayne Knight, and Walter Matthau. Phenomenal Academy Award winning cinematography by Robert Richardson, with brilliant editing by Joe Hutshing & Pietro Scalia, and a hauntingly effective score by John Williams. An intelligent and thought-provoking motion picture. Highly Recommended.",

Examples include the not so pristine \"magical bullet\", which only looks pristine from one angle, and the physics of why JFK's head went \"back and to the left\" after the last shot. \r\n\r\nI would recommend that book, or even the more recent \"Reclaiming History\" by Vincent Bugliosi- which I haven't read- for those reasonable souls that still have any lingering suspicions about JFK's death. The truth is, Lee Harvey Oswald, a former military sharpshooter, Castro sympathiser and American defector killed JFK alone from the book depository where he worked because he was nuttier than a squirrel turd. No conspiracy. With today's forensics, the state of the art in JFK theory is the lone gunman, Oswald. (Thankfully someone in Hollywood has finally come around. Tom Hanks has an upcoming miniseries on HBO that will back up the non-conspiracy crowd, still just 25% of Americans.) \r\n\r\nWith that said, I still like this movie quite a bit. Call me a hypocrite, but if I'm flipping through the channels and it's on, I watch it. I can't help it. It has a great cast and Oliver Stone has a way with editing and camerawork, even if what he's saying is a crock. It's an entertaining conspiracy thriller. But this movie is NOT HISTORY and is best approached as fiction loosely based on fact, like Brian DePalma's top shelf \"Blow Out\". Admire the moviemaking, dismiss the message.",

Kennedy or the conspiracy theory surrounding it.  The more I learned, the more I leaned toward the idea that Lee Harvey Oswald killed Kennedy himself, and he probably without any backing from anyone else.\r\n\r\nIronically, it was Oliver Stone who set me on the path to skepticism.  I was so taken in with this film that I couldn't believe anyone was still arguing that there wasn't a second gunman.  Then I saw an interview where Oliver Stone where he admitted to changing facts and fabricating entire scenes.\r\n\r\nEven back then I understood that filmakers would often play around with the truth in autobiographies and historical films.  Sometimes this is done out of necessity, like when three crucial real life events are crammed into the shoot-out at the Little Bohemia Lodge in \"Public Enemies\".  Other times it is done to add to the suspense of a movie, such as the phone call at the end of Frost/Nixon which never happened.\r\n\r\nBut this wasn't just artistic license at work.  Oliver Stone had an agenda.  He was so passionate in his belief that the country had been lied to, and he was trying to sell me on that belief.  And he HAD sold me on it.  But the best way to prove if someone is an enlightened genius or just some conspiracy nut is if he has to lie to get you to believe him.\r\n\r\nStone went beyound just changing or adding a few speculative scenes to tighten his movie and make it more dramatic.  He flat out lied about well documented facts.  In the movie, Jay O. Sanders tells Kevin Costner that Ozwald couldn't fire the three shots in the 5.6 seconds established in the Zapruder film.  In reality, it's over 8 seconds between all three shots.  He says that Ozwald was interrogated for 12 hours with no report of it when there are several reports of it interrogation in the \"Warren Commision Report\".  He says that the police purpsefully neglected to test the rifle to see if it had been fired, when there was no way they COULD test it because the technology didn't exist.\r\n\r\nThese weren't oversites.  Stone purposely changed these facts (and countless others) to try and pursuade us into falling in with his belief system.  And judging by the film's rating and reviews, he's doing a good job.\r\n\r\nMy advice, enjoy the movie as a pretty work of fiction.  If you're looking for evidence of the truth, try \"The Kennedy Assassination: Beyond Conspiracy\" or do some research yourself.",

Yes, I was naive, but whether I believed the film or not it  was unimportant as it got me interested in learning more about the gov't and flow of money and power. That's what makes great movie making, sirring the collective conscious into asking questions. It also provided a great skit to comedy show Seinfeld. The film did blur the lines between reality, fact and cinematic license. Anyone watching this film as a \"documentary\" on JFK's shooting is fooling themselves as much as anyone who believes Fox News reports actual facts without an agenda. Both are great examples of propganda. It's obvious that JFK meant a great deal to Stone and his generation and he's not satisfied with the investigation and the \"official\" conclusions from said investigaion. He does make some compelling arguements but again everything can't be taken verbatim like the Magic Bullet theory which to Stone and many others makes the case for a 2nd shooter on the Grassy Knowl. The History Channel did a recent special where they analyized the bullets trajectory and again it seems like a \"magic bullet\" until you move the 2nd person in the car that got hit into a different position. Then the bullet ravels in a straight line as to be expected. Why 40 some years earlier the investigators figure that iut I don't know. And that's if you believe the History Channels' investigation. Either way even if you do believe the History Channel as oppossed to the Magic Bullet theory it doesn't answer a lot of other questions raised in the film. If you're interested in this subject I suggest you watch both. Cinematic wise, the film is some of Stone's best work. Solid acting, pacing and editing.

To this day, many Americans believe there was indeed a conspiracy to kill Kennedy. This film inspires feelings of patriotism and a yearning to fully understand what happened in Dallas on that November day in 1963.\r\n\r\n\"JFK\" is an excellent piece of fiction. So excellent, in fact, that it has essentially brainwashed a great number of viewers into believing everything in this movie is true. Actually, Oliver Stone took many liberties with this \"true\" story, and did not keep the facts straight. Stone made things up as he went along, in order to make Garrison seem like the hero who solved the conspiracy \"mystery.\" Anyone watching this movie would think Clay Shaw and the CIA were, without doubt, behind the Kennedy assassination. Oliver Stone has made an innocent man guilty in the minds of thousands of Americans who will believe any bullshit they happen to see on the silver screen. Yes, this could have been a classic movie, but Oliver Stone took history and distorted it in order to make a movie that would entertain rather than inform. This movie is nothing but conspiracy propaganda on a Hollywood budget.",

            "content": "Remarkably Boring for Such a Controversial Movie  \r\n\r\nFacts are not determined by popular vote.  It's considered a logical fallacy to say \"such-and-such is true because most people believe it's true,\" \"so many people can't be wrong,\" or what have you.  Now, I admit that one of the examples I use to explain how egregious the \"ideas\" in this movie are is that almost every conspiracy theorist in the business--and I have to tell you that the die-hard JFK conspiracy theorists are crazier than the die-hard Moon hoax people, though not as crazy as the die-hard 9/11 conspiracy theorists--backed away slowly when they heard that Oliver Stone would be championing Garrison, crazy by crazy conspiracy theorist standards.  On the other hand, I don't need that to point out the enormous flaws we're dealing with here.  It's just funny.  Note that I will only mention as an amusing aside that Walter Cronkite ripped Roger Ebert a new one for his positive review of this piece of crap, stating categorically how factually incorrect it is from start to finish.  That's just funny, too, despite how much I respect Roger.  I bring this up, though, to remind people that \"But [insert enormous percentage here] of the American people think it was a conspiracy!\" carries no weight as far as evidence goes.\r\n\r\nFor reasons that surpass understanding, someone over on IMDB has put the beginning of the movie in spoiler tags in the parents' guide.  But John F. Kennedy was dead, to begin with.  Crusading New Orleans District Attorney (TM) Jim Garrison (Kevin Costner) is shocked, the more so because he's in the South, where not everyone necessarily thinks Kennedy's death was a bad thing.  One day, on an airplane, he's talking to Louisiana Senator Russell Long (Walter Matthau), who sets Garrison to thinking that there's maybe something fishy about the assassination, that maybe Lee Harvey Oswald (Gary Oldman) didn't act alone.  The version of Oswald and the assassination he tells does seem awfully improbable--there are good reasons for that--and it sends Garrison in search of the Real Killers (TM), who logically must be from New Orleans, because Oswald spent his childhood and a few months of his adulthood there.  He determines that the conspiracy involves David Ferrie (Joe Pesci) and Clay Shaw (Tommy Lee Jones) for reasons that are so stupid that Oliver Stone doesn't mention them.  (Apparently, gay people always use their first names but different last names when they're coming up with alibis!)  He fights to keep close to his family (Sissy Spacek, acting rings around Costner) while all the while gaining the ridicule of a nation.\r\n\r\nBut, to the curious, the reason he gained the ridicule of a nation was that his ideas were stupid.  No, really.  And Oliver Stone didn't help himself by adding in the rampant speculation and known lies of another nut, L. Fletcher Prouty, putting in an ahistorical appearance wherein he is played by Donald Sutherland.  (Prouty is a Holocaust denier, the nuttiest nuts of all.)  Both men are known to have taken, shall we say, flights of fancy, and they've taken Stone--and the audience--along for the ride.  The thing you will notice about both their ideas of conspiracy is that they require a lot of people.  Midway through the film, Bill Broussard (Michael Rooker) says a mafia conspiracy is more believable than the one Garrison is positing, given that the twelve people in the room have a hard time keeping quiet.  Garrison mocks him for this, but it's an awfully good point.  Notably, Garrison--and this is true of the man, not just the character--tends to assume people are telling the truth when they're saying what he wants to hear.  Oswald says he was a patsy?  Well, Oswald was telling the truth!  Clay Shaw says he's never used the name \"Clay Bertrand\" in his life?  He's a dirty liar!  Critical thinking does not happen in this movie.\r\n\r\nBut okay, let's move beyond that.  I will admit that I have a hard time being objective about this film, because the history is so awful--and we'll get back to that--and I was all prepared to write a really angry review.  Only I kind of can't.  Oh, I can be snippy.  I can be rude.  But angry?  Frankly, I don't have the interest to be angry about the film.  Stone goes out of his way to make Garrison a more sympathetic character--the real Garrison was not as personable as Costner by a long chalk.  We are shown the strain the case puts on his family.  He is hurt by all these lies everyone is telling about him.  He is a good, kind man who just wants to do right by a country he thinks is betraying him.  He's just so hurt by the whole thing.  But you know, when he's going on for, jeez, it must be at least five minutes at the end of the movie, not even Costner's actual genuine tears get me into things.  Stone is not a bad filmmaker, and I'm actually quite looking forward to getting to some of his other films.  This one is just tedious.\r\n\r\nYes, okay, there is a conspiracy here--there are people who are really trying to keep us all in the dark.  There are people lying to us and trying to cover up evidence which doesn't suit their conclusions.  They are pushing a story which doesn't fit history.  And Jim Garrison was one of them.  Simply put, no one could look at the actual evidence, not the lies and misconceptions here, and really see anything but one lone crazy trying to be famous and important.  Not if they're looking objectively.  It's been said that the reason people believe it was a conspiracy is that the accounts don't seem to balance if it's just Lee.  (Okay, and hands, please--who wishes they could have seen Neil Patrick Harris in the role on Broadway?)  \"Back and to the left\"?  Makes complete sense given physics and anatomy.  \"Magic bullet\"?  Fails to take into account the actual seating in the limo.  And so on.  Even the brain thing--evidence points to Bobby Kennedy's having had it buried with his brother when they moved the body to its current grave.  No, they won't resolve everything, but enough evidence is there that there is no reasonable doubt.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, let me just present three websites.  The first is a good overview of the assassination as a whole and all the stupid ideas people have about it.  The second is a list of 100 historical errors in the film.  The third is a forum you can go to in order to discuss it, should you think I'm wrong--or even to be snarly at CTs if you think I'm right.\r\n\r\nhttp://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/home.htm\r\nhttp://www.jfk-online.com/jfk100menu.html\r\nhttp://apollohoax.proboards.com/index.cgi?",

            "content": "Oliver Stone's revisionist history lesson, \"JFK,\" created a lot of controversy upon its release for embracing the conspiracy theories toward President Kennedy's assassination. Stone focuses the story on New Orleans DA Jim Garrison (Kevin Costner), who leads an investigation into the assassination and brings a case to trial against businessman Clay Shaw (Tommy Lee Jones), whom Garrison believes was involved in a conspiracy to kill the President. Garrison's investigation leads him to interview a wide range of government officials and civilians who may have knowledge of what happened. Stone broadly implicates everyone from the mafia to the KGB to LBJ to Castro and more for being responsible for the assassination. This is pure speculation, and even if some of the theses are intriguing, Stone doesn't differentiate between fact and fiction. He wants to paint with a broad brush that points the finger at everyone. Its a morally offensive approach that justifies conspiracy theories without reservation. The portrayal of Jim Garrison as a heroic figure is questionable and the relationship between Garrison and his wife (Sissy Spacek) is bland. \"JFK\" is all exposition, and even if the movie holds our attention it has no dramatic arc. In filmmaking technique, Stone incorporates color with black and white, archival footage, photographs, and historical reenactments for the purpose of propaganda. The large ensemble cast includes Joe Pesci, Gary Oldman as Lee Harvey Oswald, Donald Sutherland, Kevin Bacon, Jack Lemmon, Walther Matthau, John Candy, Laurie Metcalf, Michael Rooker, Vincent D'Onofrio.

It is one of Oliver Stone's finest movies and the entire cast is superb.\r\n\r\nJFK tells the story of Jim Garrison and his pursuit to solve the JFK assassination conspiracy.  In 1963 when Kennedy was killed everyone was led to believe that the shooter was Lee Harvey Oswald.  However, three years later, Garrison played by Kevin Costner looks back at the shooting and reads about the happenings after.  Slowly, he starts finding clues that he believes prove that there was a conspiracy behind the assassination.  He believed that Kennedy's own staff and the CIA planned and executed the assassination.  Due to the fact that they knew Kennedy was never going to go to war in southeast Asia.  Even through his extensive research and fact finding.  Garrison was never able to prove his beliefs.\r\n\r\nJFK is very well done thanks in part to Oliver Stone's beautiful direction.  It is easy to tell that he spent a lot of time on the film both during and after production.  The look of the film is gorgeous as we get a wonderful take on a 1960/70 New Orleans.  Stone also provides real and staged footage of the assassination, but you would never know thanks to the crisp editing and cinematography.  Even though the movie is over 3 hours you never get tired thanks in part to the great screenplay and very natural direction.\r\n\r\nAnother great part of JFK is the cast.  It is filled with big name after big name and each actor gives it there all.  Kevin Costner is great as Garrison, playing him as a man who knows the truth, but just has to find a way to prove it.  Other contributors are Jack Lemmon, Edward Asner, Tommy Lee Jones, John Candy, Kevin Bacon, Gary Oldman as Oswald, Walter Matthau, and Joe Pesci is a standout as David Ferrie a man who is a suspect in the case and is very jittery and on edge because he is afraid to die.  All in all, JFK compiles one of the greatest ensemble casts of all-time.\r\n\r\nJFK is a must see movie about the conspiracy over the John F. Kennedy assassination.  It is a drama, but could also be considered a documentary because of how telling it is and how real it feels.  JFK truly is one of the best movies ever made because of how well it works at every level of film.",

Pacy and creatively edited, the action switches from city to city with scarcely a moment to breathe. I couldn?t comment on the accuracy of the film?s assertions although the opening frame that sees Dwight Eisenhower speak of the ?military-industrial complex? is a nice touch. Most of the actors turn in good performances, with Gary Oldman and Joe Pesci especially memorable. Only at the end does the pace flag ? given the inevitability of a court decision for which we already know the outcome, coupled with the dullness of Costner?s brow beating speech, straight out of a propaganda piece and unfitting for a film: this is the only place where Stone is guilty of hectoring; otherwise, this is a decent movie.",

I think the only weak performance was the sister from Rosanne.  \r\n\r\n  I think the one concern I had with the film was the length.  I found that the major facts of the investigation are repeated over and over again with another repeate in more detail at the trial.  The problem with this is I wasn't interested in hearing about the same thing again.  I think it would have been better if they built it all up and then you get the climax in the court room the same time as the jury.\r\n  \r\n  Not a movie you would watch once a week but still a great peice of filmmaking in a specific point of view of what actually happened in that day that really changed the world.\r\n\r\n  I look forward to 2029 to find out what actually happened that day.",

Big as the package is though, it's solidly put together and looks great. As for the film itself, a lot of it will come down to whether or not you enjoy Oliver Stone's films and where your stand on the Jim Garrison conspiracy theory. Thankfully it doesn't try and shove it down our throats, but rather gives us enough information so that we can leave asking more questions than when we started. For most subjects this would be frustrating, but not so in this case. It's as complex a case as any, and should be taken on with renewed interest rather than anger and outrage over the possibility of government involvement, as previous generations have done. The film is far from perfect and does wane during family scenes, but the fact that Stone and Co. present all of the subject matter and ask all the questions in over 3 hours without losing our attention is an impressive achievement.",

            "content": "Oliver Stone has created his masterpiece, in my eyes, with 1991's \"JFK,\" a film about John F. Kennedy's assassination and one man's obsession of finding out the \"truth\" about who shot the president. Historians have ripped the film apart for its inaccuracies and flaws in logic to the point where the film can't be seen as what really happened on that infamous day in November 1963, but I find it being wrong in the facts department to be quite arbitrary: it's still an interesting story with an urgent narrative and the kind of film details -- film editing, cinematography -- that are frequently studied in film classes. It's a movie based on opinion, and so what if the opinion has proved to be faulty; \"JFK\" is a testament to free speech -- isn't it great to have that at our disposal?! -- and the emotions that overpower our logic.\n\n\nWhile the title suggest that Kennedy plays an active role himself, he is only seen in brief, grainy home video footage that plays over in the film's most powerful scenes. Instead, the film follows Jim Garrison, a New Orleans district attorney (played by Kevin Costner) that believes without a shadow of a doubt that Lee Harvey Oswald didn't act alone (or, perhaps, wasn't even responsible for the assassination) on November 22, 1963 and that we were deceived by the Warren Report that claims that Oswald was the lone gunman. Claiming a conspiracy on the government's part is a very risky thing, but to Garrison everything doesn't seem right: witnesses claiming they saw something over a grassy knoll, Oswald is conveniently murdered before a trial could be put together, and the bullet that killed Kennedy had a near to impossible route to make the police reports factual.\n\n\nA three hour film about a man obsessing over Kennedy's assassination? How could this be thrilling entertainment? \"JFK\" is not a spectator's film -- it insists you invest at least some emotion while Garrison fetches clues to solve a grand-scale murder mystery that already has an answer -- and is three hours long with \"clues\" that, at the end of the day, could just as well be dead ends. We aren't any closer into figuring out who killed John F. Kennedy than we were before watching \"JFK,\" but isn't the thrill of watching one alternate scenario play out enough? For me, it was.\n\nTo study this film is to analyze an expertly crafted epic drama from a director that constantly forces his audience to think outside of what we are taught -- his 1986 war film \"Platoon\" has a very different view of the Vietnam War: The United States weren't always the \"good guys.\" From a technical standpoint, this is a film teacher's dream: the film shifts from the present (in this context, 1966) to the infamous day (November 22, 1963) at lightning fact speed, with a film technique that allows a viewer to know if they are watching something from the past or present -- the past footage of \"witnesses\" is played in grainy black and white. This isn't an acting piece -- several of the high profile actors waved their usual fees to work for scale, as they considered the project too important to pass up -- but the performances are solid; Tommy Lee Jones as Clay Shaw, a shady businessman that Garrison suspects to be a big part in the conspiracy is a standout. It should be noted that there is no attempt on Kevin Costner's part to play Jim Garrison as a complicated character with a level of acting prowess that Costner has never shown; Costner plays Garrison as a man with simple emotions, gaining respect as a capable leading man here. It's a thankless job, but Costner wisely knows that this isn't the time to try and put on an overblown acting performance in hopes of an Academy Award nomination. It's a movie that is larger than life, and the actors have the easiest job of the movie (a statement you aren't likely to hear in many of my reviews) -- the blunt of the responsibility is placed on director and co-writer Oliver Stone's shoulders and everybody must share in his passion to bringing this tale to the screen.\n\nWhen it's all said and done, do I believe in Jim Garrison's theories? It's an opinion, but I don't. I find it quite \"convenient\" that Lee Harvey Oswald was able to successfully achieve what he did on November 22, 1963 all by himself, but I doubt the government killed Kennedy. Maybe Oswald had an accomplice with him that somehow got away? Maybe Oswald was a lucky shot? Maybe. Regardless of my feelings on the Kennedy assassination, I find \"JFK\" something I can get lost into easily. It's somewhat cheesy and tactless to call a movie with such a plot line as entertaining, but such is by far my opinion of the film.",

Instead, this tale based on Jim Garrison's pursuit of the truth behind the JFK assassination is a tightly woven conspiracy theory thriller.  Every performance is spot on, and I read that many of the actors waived their normal fees to be a part of it.  Which would explain why there are so many big name actors playing some very minor roles.  While Oliver Stone might play fast and loose with some of the facts of the case, he himself admits that this film is merely his \"counter-myth to the myth that is the Warren Commission\".

That brisk pace and flow is mostly due to this first-rate editing job, seamlessly threading different kinds of film: archival, re-enactments, and others. It's a method Stone would go on to over-use to a shocking extent three years later in Natural Born Killers.

That said, I think the CIA had a good deal of involvement, and any other participants in the government were rogues. \n\nSo the movie itself. OK, so it's pretty clear that the entire movie for me was extreme in its suggestions, so apart from that, I have to address the actual quality of the film. Well, I thought it had some good moments. The last hour, the courtroom, has a nice kinetic energy and delivers a very organised argument in a convincing manner. BUT, oh there it is... BUT the movie is a movie, not a documentary, so we are given characters. Trouble is, they aren't interesting. I couldn't care less about Jim Garrison's personal life (in fact, nor did Oliver Stone). So for the film's technical brilliance in editing and pacing, I applaud Oliver Stone in creating a film so controversial yet in no way exploitive or out-right ridiculous.

It's very rewatchable. \r\n \r\nAnyway, the story.\r\n\r\nJim Garrison (Kevin Costner), is the DA of New Orleans, and makes a case in the murder of John F. Kennedy. They find out that it may not have been Lee Harvey Oswald who pulled the trigger. Garrison has 12 assocites help him, in a case we already know they aren't going to win. Yet, Stone manages to make us root for them. \r\n \r\nAlright, the performances.\r\n \r\nThe whole film is filled with memorable faces. I think this is done, so that we could remember their character's names easier. Costner gives maybe his best performance here, somehow juggiling obbesion with determination, and we really don't know which one he is in the later scenes. \r\n \r\nOther key performances were Tommy Lee Jones, who played Clay Shaw, who Garrison believes helped assassinate Kennedy. Joe Pesci plays David Ferrie, another supposed conspirator. Kevin Bacon, Jack Lemmon, Sissy Spacek, and Donald Sutherland all give good supporting performances.\r\n \r\nBut I think the key supporting performance comes from Gary Oldman, who plays Lee Harvey Oswald. Oldman makes the character his own, and he isn't even seen in person, only in flashbacks, or newsreels. At the end, where Clay Shaw was on trial, I felt for Oswald almost, because it states he didn't know about the assassination, and then was blamed. \r\n \r\nIf you have any interest in John F. Kennedy or his assassination, watch JFK. Watch it.",

            "content": "In November, 1963, a monumentally horrendous event happened in Dallas, Texas. America's boy sweetheart President, the one who represented Camelot, was shot in the head. Ever since that fateful day in Dealy Plaza, there has been much ado about the events surrounding the assassination of John F. Kennedy. The Warren Commission, which was put together after the events, concluded that Oswald acted alone in his efforts to kill Kennedy. In spite of this, many people in this country have different feelings as to what went down in Dallas.\n\nThis film is largely a chronicle of one particular conspiracy theory that surrounds the death of President Kennedy, as well as the story about the one D.A. to bring a charge against someone for the death of JFK. The D.A., of course, is Jim Garrison, played by Kevin Costner. I'm not a huge fan of Costner as an actor, mainly because he's either really good or really bad in his roles. For every Field of Dreams and Dances With Wolves, there's a Waterworld or Wyatt Earp to destroy your image of him as an top-flight actor.\n\nLuckily, JFK is one of his better roles. He adopts a fairly good Yat accent for his role as a New Orleanian, and we really feel for the guy as he's on his almost obsessive crusade to find truth.\n\nAs stated previously, this film is about Garrison's attempt to make light of a dark and complicated subject. Just as broken up as the rest of America immediately after the assassination of the President, years later, he's tipped off to reopen a previously closed investigation of pilot David Ferrie (Pesci), an associate of Lee Harvey Oswald (Oldman) while Oswald was in New Orleans. During this time, Garrison flies to Washington DC with Sen. Russel Long (Matthau), who himself expresses doubts as to the validity and accuracy of the Warren Commission findings, which actually leads Garrison to read the entirety of the report himself. After reading the Warren Commission report and finding inaccuracies. His office then interviews various people connected with Ferrie, which eventually leads him to Clay \"Bertrand\" (Jones). \n\nOn another trip to DC, Garrison meets with X (Sutherland), a mysterious Air Force colonel who explains his belief that there is a grand conspiracy at various levels of government, crime (Mafia), and the overall military-industrial complex. This helps to further resolve Garrison to continue to his investigation, which leads to various consequences, including threats to his life and trouble at home with his wife (Spacek). \n\nEventually, Garrison gathers enough evidence to charge Clay Shaw for the murder of John F. Kennedy, as a part of a much larger conspiracy. During the trial, he goes to express outrage at the Warren Commission's belief in a single-bullet theory (proposed by current Republican US Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, then a lawyer for the Justice Department). In his closing remarks, Garrison concludes that there is evidence that the assassination of JFK was a coup d'tat, involving the highest levels of government.\n\nOne certainly cannot deny Oliver Stone's guts for making a movie surrounding this chain of events. He took a lot of heat, and continues to take a lot of heat, for making a movie about Jim Garrison's investigation into this particular conspiracy theory. I've heard people refer to this movie as one of the most haphazard, dangerous movie of all time, because the idea that someone would glorify Garrison for digging deep into this event following a conspiracy, no matter how false it may be, could be a traitorous act. I don't see it that way. At its time of release, there was actually talk of censoring parts of the film. While it's regrettable that due to this movie, many people reference this movie as being fact, I don't see anything wrong with giving Jim Garrison his side of the story.\n\nWith that having been said, there are aspects of this movie I didn't like. I found it extremely confusing to follow, in part due to the film-making. It seemed that this film was going 100 miles per hour, trying to jam every bit of information in that it possibly could. While there was certainly a lot surrounding this story, I thought it could have been better condensed and more understandable. \n\nThe acting in this film was first rate. Costner was fantastic as the in-over-his-head Jim Garrison. Tommy Lee Jones was also very good as Clay Shaw, the defendent in the JFK trial. Also of note is Joe Pesci's turn as David Ferrie, the man who eventually led Garrison to Bertrand/Shaw, and Donald Sutherland steals the screen in his very short segment as X.\n\nThis film has had a lasting cultural impact. While the merits of truth may not be there, this film did (and still does) help in getting society to ask questions of their government again. Government isn't always trustworthy, and we as a people need to do our part to keep it in check. I recommend this movie for anyone that enjoys a good conspiracy theory thriller, anyone willing to see a different side to the JFK story, or someone who just likes groundbreaking films.",

His character's closing argument is so beautifully acted (look for the moment when he looks into the camera) and so passionately written and delivered it packs an emotional wallop that will stay with you for days. Whether or not the information presented here is entirely factual is beside the point. Stone's genius here is capturing the national mood and an inherent emotional truth concerning the assassination of JFK: we couldn't possibly believe Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone. We know there is a greater truth out there, and we the American people deserve to know the truth. We owe it to ourselves to question and probe until we get it. A great American classic",

I love conspiracy theories way more then the next guy, but a lot of this was pure speculation and fiction. I would be alright if it was presented as that, but the film is quite arrogant in it's depiction of what it thinks is fact that it becomes sickening. Kevin Costner is likable, I guess, save for a few of his sickly charming everyman moments. The film will divide viewers; those who believe the government is honest and could never be capable of killing their own president will dislike the film, while those who have a shred of belief in the fact that it could be possible for our government to stage such a conspiracy may like it. Stone is a different kind of director; he doesn't care who he offends, and he makes some of the most preposterous films, usually profiting off of American tragedies such as September 11th, this, and Vietnam; and I hate him for that. He also succeeds at creating fantastical representations of legendary figures, such as Presidents Nixon and Bush. I get what the message is; be scared of your government, because they can do more and cover up more than you think. But I think that's alright. I've reached a point in my conspiracy theory-filled world were I've begun to believe that cover-ups and black ops are necessary. When X (played by Donald Sutherland, probably the best character in the film) exposes all the facts to Garrison, about how the economy runs because of war and how we need war for industry to function and how JFK was wanted to change all of that... I was on X's side! Now, the whole point of the film is to say that change is good and what JFK was trying to accomplish was good and the CIA and such wanted to rub him out so they could return the US to status quo. I guess it's the conservative voice inside that's telling me that what happened here was good, and I'm listening to it. Other miscellaneous notes... the quality, in terms of conematography and style is excellent; the film is a prime example of how a film should be shot. The splicing of real footage, created fake footage, real scenes, and flashbacks was flawless. Also, when Garrison finds out Robert Kennedy was killed, he suddenly gets the urge to fuck his wife (WTF?). And finally, the Seinfeld magic loogie demonstration finally makes sense to me. All in all, it was a good film, but I don't necessarly agree with the message it's trying to send.",

Flashbacks dominate the film, which is very well shot with excellent use of camera angles. These effects make Garrison's story all the more believable. The highlight of the film is the final scene, what it has all been building up to, the very climax. Garrison is bringing a court case against the homosexual aristocrat Clay Shaw, and the viewer cannot forsee the verdict until the very end.",

Taking the Vietnam War to frighteningly realistic levels (Platoon), satirizing modern stardom with cold blooded psychopaths (Natural Born Killers), and managing to make an entertaining film about stockbrokers (Wall Street), but taking one of the most controversial issues of the 20th century and creating an engrossing tale of a man's search for truth, and in it...justice.  JFK was not without it's de-riders, claiming it is a complete falsehood (even though every single thing he said was proven...but I digress), but I wholeheartedly disagree.  In my opinion (and Stone's himself)...JFK is his masterpiece.\n\nIn case the film's title doesn't give you a big enough hint, JFK follows New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison and his investigation into what he thinks was one of the biggest cover-ups in American history: the assassination of President John F. Kennedy...and who (or better yet, how many) killed him.  Staring an ensemble like no other, which includes Kevin Costner, Tommy Lee Jones, Kevin Bacon, Sissy Spacek, Jack Lemmon, Joe Pesci, Donald Sutherland, etc. and they all are in top form in this mesmerizing drama.  \n\nApart from the great performances, the thing that really struck me was the editing and the cinematography.  Re-creating November 22. 1963 this perfectly must have been one of the most painstakingly tedious projects a director could undertake, but Stone does it with such finesse that you may start to think you are watching the History channel, and not a re-created set.\n\nEvery single frame of this film is passionately precise, every performance is noteworthy, everything...is...great.  While Stone has made some great films since 1991, I don't think he will ever surpass this masterwork.",

Its the chance that something so cunning and against the majority actually happened, entrances every part of us.  Its this idea that we've been bamboozled is what is so enticing. \"How could they have possibly done that? Is this true?\" Oliver Stone knows this and he puts it to use on one of the greatest and most jarring assassination in American history: JFK's assassination in Dallas. Stone creates a kinetic film that tries to reconstruct this conspiracy through the eyes of Jim Garrison, the district attorney of New Orleans who himself did try and bring this conspiracy to court. With the intercuts of archival footage and film footage, along with recreations, Stone drops into Dallas and asks to \"look closer\" and find our own truth. In this three hour opus, we are entrenched with Kevin Costner's Garrison, who is just like us, someone who is trying to find truth amongst what doesn't make sense, as well as trying to not let it consume him. With each minute we spend with Garrison, we start to believe his theory more and more, and soon as it engulfs him, its engulfs us as we need to know the truth. Soon, we're going mad and we start to see each kernel of truth as it begins to unfold in front of us and it all leads to a dramatic court room scene that has Costner giving one of the most stirring monologues I've heard on film. And then we realize that the film isn't about proving a theory right. Instead its about the right as an american citizen to question and dig at the burning questions that haunt our minds and souls. Of course there must be an advisory for this film: do not take every photo, every shred of evidence for fact. Much of the films points are based on some evidence, but don't let this be the brunt of your evidential weight. Instead realize that some of these things did happen, but they may be embellished to a degree inorder to create a fluid and moving story.",

Of course, this film is completely bias in it's viewpoint, but the evidence unearthed by New Orleans DA Jim Garrison is pretty overwhelming, and you are left with the feeling that Lee Harvey Oswald couldn't have acted alone. This is obviously a subject close to Stone's heart, and it shows from the finished film and screenplay. Combining real footage, reconstructions, news clips, and photographs into a unique mixture, JFK looks like nothing you've ever seen before. Add to that a truly superb performance from Kevin Costner, as well as every role, no matter how small, filled by a recognisable face (Tommy Lee Jones, Joe Pesci, Donald Sutherland, Sissy Spacek, Jack Lemmon, Waltger Matthau). This helps keep track of proceedings actually, because so many characters are introduced over the course of the 3 hours+ of this film, so your doing well if you manage to follow everything.

Structured as a bit of a courtroom drama with New Orleans DA Jim GarrisonSpinning an impeccable yarn about the conspiracy theories revolving the assassination of John F. Kennedy, JFK is a captivating, riveting, and truly compelling film. Structured as a bit of a courtroom drama with New Orleans DA Jim Garrison (Kevin Costner) investigating the case, interviewing people with knowledge of the situation, and presenting his case to the jury. While compelling, the film is definitely very long, especially the director's cut. The film does a good job weaving everybody into the final case, while also showing just how hard it was to prove his conspiracy case against businessman Clay Shaw (Tommy Lee Jones) being involved in the assassination of JFK. What Garrison does do, however, is convince the audience of every conspiracy theory possible. Laying out the evidence and painstakingly going though the minutia of details, everything sounds plausible and backed up with incredible evidence. What definitely becomes clear is the fact that there were multiple shooters. While Stone no doubt framed it in that fashion with the details he had, it should just be obvious to anybody knowing about the law of physics in relation to the magical bullet.Powerfully told, smartly written, and excellently acted, the film is anchored by a terrific lead performance by Kevin Costner. The embattled New Orleans DA with a tough home life as a result of his obsession, his home life may be a bit cliched. But while he is interviewing people and pitching his case, Costner is fantastic. The closing monologue as Garrison makes his case to the people is impeccably acted and written with Costner nailing every line, every question, and every moment of that sequence. Stone's direction turns the sequence into the equivalent of a hypnotic episode and Costner slinks right down into it perfectly. He is a terrific lawyer and detective in this film and matches the film's epic quality.However, what truly adds to the film's epic feeling is the supporting cast. Littered in this film are various tremendous actors giving terrific supporting performances. These include, but are not limited to, Jack Lemmon, Joe Pesci, John Candy, Donald Sutherland, Kevin Bacon, Tommy Lee Jones, Edward Asner, Gary Oldman, Laurie Metcalf, and Michael Rooker. The whole cast, from beginning to end, truly nail their roles and add brilliantly to the odd cast of characters linked to the assassination of Kennedy. With each interview sequence being incredibly tense, riveting, and well told, the film finds power in its dialogue that more than entertains. With each interview, it becomes tough to balance everything we have heard in our minds, but Stone is smart to include wrap-up scenes in the DA's office every once in a while where the group find out exactly where they are and what they have that they can use in a courtroom.That said, it becomes clear during the film that people are just not ready. Garrison spins this incredible case that very clearly points to the conspiracy, but he is brick walled throughout by the media. Even though the jury agrees there was a conspiracy behind the murder, the connection to Clay Shaw is tenuous at best relying on sketchy witnesses. But, to uncover the conspiracy behind anything, weeding through what the witnesses say is a must, no matter who they are. People too willingly write off conspiracy nuts as crazy loons, even if some of what they say may be based in fact or covered up fact. Not every inch of conspiracy theories are true, but more than people are willing to admit. JFK shows this incredibly well with even employees in the DA's office expressing doubt about what they have and the horrible witnesses they talked to. That said, the key to understanding the assassination is given X (Donald Sutherland). In a terrific supporting role, Sutherland's mysterious military colonel tells Garrison that the who is just scenery to distract people from the why. Incredibly true, every conspiracy theory falls down when people get down into the who. Often times, there is very little evidence supporting the who or loose connections at best. If people focused on the why and worried about the who later, then maybe something would actually come out of most conspiracy theories.Long, maybe too long, but compelling and a truly unique conspiracy thriller mixed with courtroom drama, JFK is one of director Oliver Stone's best work with an excellent performance from Costner and the whole cast. Easily convincing the audience that there was a conspiracy, it does not pretend to show us the who because it hardly matters who kills Kennedy. Rather, Stone's film painstakingly sets the scene for why and makes a compelling case on that front. Now, it is up to the jury of the audience to figure out whether they believe it or not.",

Thank you Oliver Stone for this movie, that you dedicated \"to the young in whose spirit the search for truth marches on\". It is important to understand, how politics is working in reality to see through the lies of official versions of big political events. If you know 9/11, you will see similarities. The movie is great of course with many famous actors, even the length of more than 3 hours was not a problem for me.",

It is also the mother of all conspiracy theories together with Roswell with probably thousands of variations. It is far to interesting to ever be left alone. To be fairThe assassination of JFK is one of the biggest stories of all times. It is also the mother of all conspiracy theories together with Roswell with probably thousands of variations. It is far to interesting to ever be left alone. To be fair there is a lot to debate. Kennedy had many enemies in the CIA, military, the mafia who founded his campaign, in politics and other areas that want to get him out of office. As always the investigation got really political, witnesses saw different things from each other (normality with so many people), the report has loop holes and errors were made. I repeat nothing abnormal and the bigger an investigation gets the more errors will be made and inconsistencies will be found. After looking into both sides I have no clue who is right or wrong.  But lets go to the movie. The movie is based on the book  \u201cOn the trail of Assassins\u201d by prosecutor Jim Garrison who made in real life a re-investigation in the assassination of JFK as the official Warren-Report had some inconsistency and weaknesses. The film is well crafted, directed and has a legendary cast of actors. Like I said the story itself is one of the most interesting stories of all time and a mystery people talk about today over 50 years later. The director Oliver Stone knew what he did and made a remarkable movie. The cast is superb with legendary names like Kevin Costner, Gary Oldman, Tommy Lee Jones, Kevin Bacon, Walter Matthau, Jack Lemon and Donald Sutherland to name a few. Rarely ever get you such a cast of talented actors in one movie and I say everyone delivers. It is a great overall performance that made this movie even better. Then we have the score from John Williams who is a legend himself. It enhances the atmosphere and is fitting. The rest is history as the movie earned fan and critical acclaim. It won 2 Oscars and was nominated for 6 more. Is it factual correct or solves the mystery? I don't know about either or if it can even be solved. It is however entertaining and I enjoyed it in a time where I normally would have avoided such a movie. Overall I think this is a classic worth watching and remembering.",

JFK isJFK is an absolute masterwork of filmmaking and story telling, never has editing and cinematography blanded so well together, to create one of the most riveting, educational, thrilling, mysterious, and controversial films of all time. JFK is one of the best pieces of filmmaking i've ever seen, and one of my all-time favorite films.\r With films like this, where the subject matter is delicate and lies close to people's heart, and where it is incredibly controversial there will always be haters of the movie just because they hate it (I've read many reviews like that) without even viewing the film properly, without predjudice or anything like that.\rI am no american, and i am too young to have been alive around 1963, so i knew little about the assassination going into this film, except ofcourse that JFK was assassinated by Lee Harvey Oswald (which is something i learned in school, i didnt know if it was true or not, i did know that there was some controvery around the assassination though, and that's it) So i went in watching without predjudice. A movie like this will always have historians or other people complaining about how factually inaccurate it is, and frankly, i dont care about this in any way, same with biographies, i dont care if it is incredibly inaccurate, i care if it is a well-made film, and damn, JFK is one hell of a well made film. It's one of the most riveting, educational, thrilling, mysterious, and controversial films of all time. In my honest opinion there really is little to complain here.\r The main thing about this film is exposition and there's a lot of it in the film. There are times when Stone essentially asks us to listen while a character explains things. These scenes could have been deadly. He makes them exciting by using persuasive actors, by cutting between many different points of view, and by reconstructing the events being described. Stone's film is hypnotically watchable. Leaving aside all of its drama and emotion, it is a masterpiece of film assembly. The writing, the editing, the music, the photography, are all used here in a film of enormous complexity, to weave a persuasive tapestry out of an overwhelming mountain of evidence and testimony. Film students will examine this film in wonder in the years to come, astonished at how much information it contains, how many characters, how many interlocking flashbacks, what skillful interweaving of documentary and fictional footage. The film hurtles for 188 minutes through a sea of information and conjecture, and never falters and never confuses us. That is not to say that we are quite sure, when it is over and we try to reconstruct the experience in our minds, exactly what Stone's conclusions are. \"JFK\" does not unmask the secrets of the Kennedy assassination. Instead, it uses the Garrison character as a seeker for truth who finds that the murder could not have happened according to the official version.\r JFK is one of the best edited films of all time.",

The subjective procedure is the conflict that the makers neither can solve or eradicate due to its track that it has chosen. The avid narrative that is at best fueled with rage and sanity and at mediocrity a raw flat investigation. Stone's law are never black or white, he walk a perfect and safer line in order to filter out its smarter audience. He not only has the potential and range to flash out its star cast but foliates them in its palpable heartbreaking tone. Driven by the star power and stellar performances by each cast member, the runtime barely matters, in fact it leaves the audience hungry for more. It is rich on technical aspects like advanced camera work with smart editing, metaphorical cinematography and finely detailed art designing. Brimmed with various perspective and enough content for the audience to work on it keeps them tangled in its pathos bubble. Stone's work on adaptation might be smart and cut deeper but its eye popping execution is the game changer. Costner oozes power, vulnerable and pleads for the justice as the script and viewers demands with a support from a louder and complex Oldman, emotionally driven Rooker and reserved Jones. The final speech, Costner at the heart of it, and the research of the incident carried off by the makers are the high points of the feature. JFK is not only an important feature on terms of the raised questions in here but the craft whose exploration undeniably bedazzles you.",
