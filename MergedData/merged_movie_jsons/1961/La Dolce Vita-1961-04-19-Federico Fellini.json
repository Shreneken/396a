            "content": "Long, episodic film by Federico Fellini about the conceits and facades of life: fame, intellect, sex, friendship, despair, innocence, etc.Marcello Mastroianni is perfect as the shallow tabloid reporter who joyfully follows around Rome a blonde movie star from Sweden (Anita Ekberg) as she prowls around the city's bars and bistros. He is also having an affair with a woman (Anouk Aimee) while his girl friend (Yvonne Furnaux) seems to be going nuts.But as Marcello moves through the city following the movie star, the miracle of the virgin, a few parties, etc. we see that his life is very empty because the things he reports on are meaningless drivel. We see that fame and fortune and the trappings of success are meaningless.Marcello starts to realize that the movie star is a vapid airhead, the miracles are a sham, and his friend's (who seemed quite happily married) ghastly murder and suicide show the futility of life itself.The Fellini themes are common to many of his films, but what makes La Dolce Vita so memorable are the cynical tone, the Nina Rota music, and the string of terrific visual images.The opening scene is of a helicopter hauling a gilded plaster statue through the air across Rome. The flying saint is a bizarre image but serves to set up the movies which is all about images and events that are never what they seem to be.Notable are the scenes of statuesque Ekberg in that terrific strapless black dress with the voluminous skirts as she swishes around dancing and eventually wading through a city fountain. The party scenes are also notable. The first because of the intolerable intellectuals who sits around and talk and talk but never do anything. The last party has the indelible image of Mastroianni \"riding\" a drunken blonde woman as though she were a horse. The final image of the giant dead fish is quite unsettling as it symbolizes their bloated lives.Fellini is brilliant in filling scenes with odd people as extras, usually hideously dressed or wearing ugly glasses. The \"gallery\" of people who inhabit the city is one of grotesques, vapid fashion slaves, the rich, hangers on, etc.A long film, but highly recommended and very memorable.",

            "review_title": "Bitterness Of The Sweet Life",
            "content": "LA DOLCE VITA presents a series of incidents in the life of Roman tabloid reporter Marcello Rubini (Marcello Mastroianni)--and although each incident is very different in content they create a portrait of an intelligent but superficial man who is gradually consumed by \"the sweet life\" of wealth, celebrity, and self-indulgence he reports on and which he has come to crave.Although the film seems to be making a negative statement about self-indulgence that leads to self-loathing, Fellini also gives the viewer plenty of room to act as interpreter, and he cleverly plays one theme against its antithesis throughout the film. (The suffocation of monogamy vs. the meaninglessness of promiscuity and sincere religious belief vs. manipulative hypocrisy are but two of the most obvious juxtapositions.) But Fellini's most remarkable effect here is his ability to keep us interested in the largely unsympathetic characters LA DOLCE VITA presents: a few are naive to the point of stupidity; most are vapid; the majority (including the leads) are unspeakably shallow--and yet they still hold our interest over the course of this three hour film.The cast is superior, with Marcello Mastroianni's personal charm particularly powerful. As usual with Fellini, there is a lot to look at on the screen: although he hasn't dropped into the wild surrealism for which he was sometimes known, there are quite a few surrealistic flourishes and visual ironies aplenty--the latter most often supplied by the hordes of photographers that scuttle after the leading characters much like cockroaches in search of crumbs. For many years available to the home market in pan-and-scan only, the film is now in a letterbox release that makes it all the more effective. Strongly recommended.Gary F.

            "content": "I first saw this movie probably over 25 years ago when I was quite a bit younger.  At that point I enjoyed it for its party scenes, sense of joy and life and vitality and....Marcello Mastroianni.  Now that I'm older myself and have just recently seen the movie again, I find that I have a much deeper understanding of it.  Maybe it takes some age to find some meaning. In a nutshell, Marcello is at a crossroads in his life, he's unable to settle down or move foreward into any direction - he's a diletante with aspirations but no real goals.  He's wrapped up in himself and in projecting rather dreamy ideals onto other people.  But as he keeps projecting on to others he comes to find in each situation that he doesn't really know the person and they are a mystery and probably a disappointment to him. certainly steiner is the biggest disappointment and disillusions him to a degree that he is apparently lost to a life of corruption and decadence as a result.  but it's not that these people are difficult to understand to someone other than marcello - i think we can see that anita ekberg's character really is just a big good-natured blond and not the mysterious goddess marcello makes her out to be; his father is again - the typical traveling salesman and perhaps not the paternal figure that marcello would like him to be. his amour maddelena lives up to her name even as marcello starts believing himself in love with her - he's literally seduced by nothing more than an image he creates in his own mind. his friend steiner seems to have it all to marcello and to be the renaissance man that he would like to be - but, of course, he is dissatisfied and disturbed and we see what the end is.  the only one whom marcello forms a somewhat realistic connection with is his girlfriend whom he treats badly and neglects despite her obvious love for him.  he refuses to actually work on the one relationship that he could actually succeed at - he would rather dream about possibilities than actualize something.marcello cannot communicate with others because he cannot see them as the people they really are - he just sees them as projections of his own needs, aspirations, desires and goals.  when he finds out what they're really like, he either turns away or falls apart. this is an outstanding movie - 10 out of 10 and beautifully photographed.  if you don't get it now, try again in 10 years - it will wait for you to catch up.",

            "content": "This movie is about a Roman journalist at the crossroads of his life but unable to move forward in any meaningful direction. He is a man trapped in his life of superficiality.Federico Fellini's La Dolce Vita is a very aesthetically beautiful film. The widescreen compositions are often outstanding. The crisp black and white photography is lit to perfection and a joy to behold. One of the factors that makes Italian cinema in general so appealing for me is the gorgeous natural light of that country, allied with the stylish decor and architecture; and in this film these elements are well in abundance. If nothing else, La Dolce Vita is a treat to the eyes. Style over substance is a term that could certainly also be applied to the denizens of LDV's Rome. We are introduced to an array of beautiful but shallow character's; from Marcello Mastroianni's gossip journalist, via Anita Ekberg's international film star or Nico's fashion model, everyone is beautiful on the surface but somewhat dead underneath. And perhaps this is a problem with the film in general; a three hour expose of shallow people is an exhausting experience.The film is not plot-driven. It's episodic, divided into seven days in the life of a Roman gossip columnist. It's not always obvious what the point of certain events actually is. I found myself spending quite a lot of energy actually trying to actively understand the meaning of Marcello's experiences, and not always successfully I concede. But suffice to say that a very general reading of the film's message would be that it is about the superficiality of celebrity and the emptiness of much of modern urban life. And while a lot of it is still very relevant today \u2013 in particular the public's obsession with celebrity \u2013 it's not always clear what Fellini is trying to say. It's quite an obtuse film, with a fair amount of symbolic imagery and loaded dialogue. It's certainly serious cinema. Although I often found myself enjoying it most when it was less intellectual and more sensual, such as the wonderful iconic scene where Anita Ekberg takes a dip in the Fontana di Trevi. This justifiably famous sequence is the most purely cinematic moment in La Dolce Vita and, in my opinion, the film could have benefited from more scenes of such striking power punctuated through its three hour running time.Overall, although I do admire this film, I find it too tiring and drawn out to love. It's very well acted and photographed, it's just a little unengaging and occasionally tedious. That said, it's one to seek out if you are at all interested in 60's New Wave cinema.",

            "review_title": "Complex And Rambling",
            "content": "Mostly because of the terrific high contrast, B&W visuals, and the evocative music, this is the only Fellini film I have seen that I have somewhat enjoyed. I recommend it, but not without reservations. It's a complex film with many textured layers of meaning. And, in typical Fellini fashion, it rambles and it meanders.Deviating from standard three-Act structure, Fellini's story consists of roughly eight episodes, all starting at night and ending at dawn, more or less. Each has its own crisis. And the only thing that unites these episodes into a coherent whole is the story's protagonist, Marcello (Marcello Mastroianni). In his job as a journalist and overall observer of human nature, Marcello encounters people in high society who seem outwardly happy and self-fulfilled. On closer examination, however, these people are empty, hollow, alienated, emotionally adrift and vacant.A good example is the starlet Sylvia (Anita Ekberg), a glamorous figure, but she's all image and no substance. \"La dolce vita\" is the first film that uses the concept of \"paparazzi\", which implies the importance of \"image\", separate from substance.Throughout the various episodes Marcello sees these \"images\" of happiness, of contentment, but the images are deceptive, elusive, unreliable. In one episode, two \"miracle\" children \"see\" the Madonna. \"The Madonna is over there\", shouts one child. The crowd chases after her. But the other child who \"sees\" the Madonna runs in the opposite direction. Happiness, self-fulfillment, religious visions ... they're all a will-o'-the-wisp. And so, the film conveys a sense of pessimism and cynicism.The film thus has deep thematic value. It caused a scandal when it was released, and was banned by the Catholic Church, apparently for appearing to be anti-religious.Yet for all its deep meaning, \"La dolce vita\" can be a trial to sit through. Somewhere in the second half I began to lose interest. I don't have a problem with Fellini's deviation from standard plot structure. I do have a problem with a director who doesn't know when to quit. This film goes on for almost three hours. A good edit, to delete all the fat, would have tightened up the story and rendered it more potent. As is, it's too strung out, too stretched, too meandering.If the viewer can persevere, there's enormous cinematic art in this film. And helped along by Nino Rota's music, the film is wonderfully evocative, at times stylishly melancholy.",

            "content": "I just saw a new print of this wonderful film after not having seen it for maybe 20 years and it is still spellbinding. Fellini sums up an era and an attitude here, and succeeds in doing something that ought to be impossible: he makes a full and meaningful film about empty and meaningless lives. Mastroianni seems to have been to Fellini what DeNiro has been to Scorsese--a perfect embodiment of a personal vision. What a wonderful actor he was--brilliant in his youth and in his age. Many other performers are hardly less fine here, and the cinematography and composition are stunning throughout. There are so many indelible images from this film, images that have become iconic over the decades: Ekberg in the Fontana di Trevi, the statue of Christ flying over Rome, the astonishing, candlelit procession at the castle, to name a few. It seems plot less and yet it isn't plot less at all; Marcello's ultimately fruitless search for meaning, a search that he abandons in the end, as he stares across a slight and yet unbridgable abyss on the beach at a lovely young girl who seems to possess the knowledge and understanding that is denied to him. I'm astonished at the number of people who don't get this movie, who seem to think that Fellini expects us to admire the bizarre characters who people the film, or who think that a movie about worthless individuals must be a worthless movie, or who don't seem to understand that movies that are full of what become clich\u00e9s usually do so because they capture an important vision. Fellini made several exceptional films: 81/2, La Strada, Amarcord, and The Nights of Cabiria come to mind, but La Dolce Vita may be, when all is said and done, his masterwork.",

Here Federico Fellini warns us about the disenchantment of plenty. So, at the end, this scandalous film of 1960 is a morality tale. Marcello Mastroianni is superb, a beautiful exterior with an interior that is dying, slowly but surely. The term \"paparazzo\" was coined in this film. The hunters of the banal grew in numbers over the years but not in scope,\nAnita Ekberg became a symbol of the sixties and who was she? A fantasy, impossible to reach. Real is his wife, the splendid Yvonne Fourneaux. Real is his father, played with heart breaking resignation by Annibale Ninchi or the suicide of his close friend, the intellectual played by Alain Cuny. La Dolce Vita is almost 58 years old and I imagine that the its message, like in most art, will live forever.",

            "review_title": "Oh, Marcello, I'm So Bored.",
            "content": "Well, this episodic, ambitious exploration of life in Rome in 1960 hits one bull's eye after another and emerges as one of the best films of the 1960s, maybe one of the greatest ever. Imagine a film about boredom that is not in itself boring.I fear, though, that some youths may be turned off by it because so many things stand for something else that I'm tempted to bundle them up into \"themes.\" I can see it now. A couple of kids in phat pants wearing nostril rings, their ankles garnished with tattoos of barbed wire, hitting the beer or the hi-energy drinks on the couch, munching Doritos, scowling and cursing at the film from the very start. \"Hey -- this thing's in BLACK AND WHITE. They're talking Portugese. And it's got SUBTITLES!\" Maybe that's unkind though. Maybe they can shake off the MTV chains and manage to sit through this and discover something they didn't know about someone's life other than their own.Marcello Maistroianni is the central figure, a journalist with an unfocused vision, who wanders from one episode to the next, wondering what to do with his life. He meets a LOT of interesting characters along the way, each representing something else. His desperate girl friend, Emma, offers him the life of a petty bourgeois. She'll feed him, give him a home and children, and she'll grow plump with age and develop the shadow of a mustache. Marcello isn't sure what he wants but he knows he doesn't want THAT.His \"intellectual\" friend, Steiner, represents someone or something that Marcello would love to become. Steiner is sensitive, artistic, talented, a writer, poet, and a musician who plays Bach in a cathedral that is acoustically active because there are no people in it. Nobody is in it -- get it, kids? Anita Ekberg is the hypermastic Sylvia, an American movie star, her head as empty as her bodice is full. She doesn't understand a word of Italian as Marcello woos her, and he can't speak English. As they're about to kiss, knee deep in water, the Fontana Trevi shuts off, night dissolves into dawn, and a pizza delivery kid has stopped his bicycle to stare at them as they swish self-consciously out of the fountain.Religion? The cathedral may be forgotten but religion in its rawest form is not. A young brother and sister team claim to have seen the Virgin Mary in a desolate vacant lot. The paparazzi have set up bright lights, generators, and cameras all over the place. Hundreds of the lame and halt appear at the site of the miracle, hoping for a cure. The paparazzi pay the kids' mother, father, and grandfather to pose on the balcony of a soulless apartment house, pointing supposedly at the spot where the vision occurred. The fact that the photographers have them pointing in different directions makes no difference. The paparazzi suddenly run off and leave the three alone on the balcony, and Fellini lingers for a few seconds on the absurd and tragic image of three posturing human statues there, mother pointing one way, father another, grandfather praying on his knees -- all of them fakes. It rains, the hot Klieg lights begin to explode, and a riot follows in which the supplicants tear apart the tree at which the Virgin appeared, stuffing leaves into their jackets, wrestling one another for souveniers or charms.The final scene in which Marcello watches a monstrously ugly fish hauled out of the sea and then tries to communicate with a twelve-year-old blond angel, and fails, is heartbreaking.The film isn't about boredom. It's not even about emptiness. It's about what's missing, the thing that creates the emptiness and leads to boredom. Fellini isn't up front about it, and neither was Orson Welles when he dealt with a similar issue in \"Citizen Kane.\" Fellini was more explicit in some of his other films -- \"I Vitelloni\" and \"Amarcord\" (\"I Remember\"). Traditional values, and the youthful innocence that made them possible, are being lost. Values have been cheapened. Not that those values were perfect or indeed anything but illusory, but how can we get along without our myths? We follow kids around who see the Virgin Mary and who like some politicians because they resemble \"rock stars.\" We're losing our ability to appreciate Bach and the patience to sit through a black-and-white movie made in another country. Our assessments of other peoples has been degraded into \"good\" and \"evil\" without modulation. Our Western culture seems to have passed from naive to decadent without ever having gone through florescence. If this is what Fellini was getting at, it's no wonder the film is as sad as it is.",

Yes, this of course if the signal that you should NOT read any more but simply mark my review as \"not helpful\" because my opinion differs from the norm. I actually get this a lot if I buck popular wisdom but shouldn't a review try to say something different other than \"I agree with you and everyone else\"? Now don't misunderstand me--I did NOT dislike the film nor do I say it was poorly made. But the film's messages about fame and the pointlessness of life got rather tiresome to me after a while. Plus, while at first the film seems to say that certain lifestyles or types of people are hollow and banal, the final message of the overall film seems to be ALL life is pointless. I really enjoyed the scenes with Anita Ekberg--they remind me of the pointless adulation of celebrity today (such as Anna Nicole Smith) but after a while it seemed that Fellini was pretty much lampooning and condemning everything and leaving the viewer with the possible conclusion that life is meaningless so you may as well become an idiot (like Marcello had become by the end of the film). In many ways, though the movie is often upbeat and trivial, the meta-message is much more depressing and cold than that many Bergman films. I at least liked to have seen SOME spark of hope or at least a movie that didn't go on for so long that it left me a bit depressed.Overall, not a bad film at all, but there are many Fellini films I prefer, such as WHITE SHEIK, LA STRADA and AMARCORD.",

Some parts of the film look like a long commercial for \"Vogue\", \"Chanel\" or something.The movie centers in Marcello Rubini (Mastroianni), a gossip journalist in Rome who lives a decadent lifestyle surrounded by the equally empty (headed) rich and famous. Although Marcellino meets alluring women, has tons of friends, and leads an (apparently) exciting life, he is unhappy, unsatisfied, and wants to become a writer (he tries to write a novel in his spare time). He's fed up with his hedonistic take on life, but at the same time he is aware that \"intellectualism\" won't save him either (the suicide of his friend Steiner proves this). So? What's the point to all this crap? Fellini doesn't give us a hint of an answer, no clues.The director once famously said: \"I have nothing to say, but i want to say it anyway\". I believe him.",

That ends with La Dolce Vita, because I despised this film. It is a meandering mess of vignettes that surround the life of a loser. It's kind of hard for me to express how much I hated the main character of this film, as he was just a loathsome cad with no relatable qualities. He stumbles his way through one pointless interaction after the next, none of which amount to much of anything. That is with the exception of the murder/suicide thing which is mentioned briefly and then brushed under the rug as if it was just another wacky moment that happened in this jerk's week. I cannot fathom why I'm supposed to care about anything in this movie, as it plods along at a snail's pace.This is where someone is dying to talk to me about all the symbolic messaging and themes that La Dolce Vita expertly lays out for me, and how dumb I am for not seeing them. You'll say it is a brilliant morality tale, an epic satire of the spiritual malaise of modern society, the perfect merging of art and life, or some other grandiose claim that impresses upon me why I should appreciate Fellini's work. I'll be honest, in the grand scheme of things, I am pretty dumb. I'm willing to own that fact, because I'm wrong about things frequently. However, any time someone comes at me with that kind of defensive language, I'm quick to respond that a movie has to hold up as a narrative to deliver those messages effectively for me. Themes and symbols are amazing tools, but they have to be latched onto a story that makes me want to explore them.I cannot remember the last time I watched a movie and checked to see how much time was left more than I did with La Dolce Vita. I think I was about 15 minutes in when I first pushed the \"info\" button to see how long I would be enduring this slog of a film. As the hours started to pass, I'd check repeatedly, and (like a kid in the backseat of the car on a long road trip) I'd say \"Are we there yet? It can't be that much longer!\" It felt like an eternity that I was watching, and I genuinely did doze off for a couple minutes at one point. Not that I missed anything of consequence, since there are no consequential things in this film. Boring isn't a strong enough word for La Dolce Vita, this movie gave me a whole new perspective on boredom, and I couldn't even distract myself playing Candy Crush or something more productive because I had to watch in order to read the subtitles.As I wrap up my thoughts on La Dolce Vita, I think this is a good moment to remind everyone reading this that opinion on film is entirely subjective, as it is with any artform. However, many of us derive a sense of self from our opinions on art. What we love is a vital part of who we are! As such, when I lambaste a film with this kind of vigor, I know there are people who feel personally offended or they want to clap back at me for being wrong. It is almost painful when someone hates that which you love. So let me say, all of these problems that I expressed exist between me and this piece of art. The film and my taste mix like oil and water, but that doesn't mean I think less of you if you love it. In fact, it has ridiculously high ratings on almost every movie website, so I'm the one in the minority here. I hated La Dolce Vita, and can't say I understand why it is beloved. Thankfully, I'll never have to watch it again.",

It is a simply wonderful film, and one of the best movies of the 60s. It is a scathing satire on the decadence of contemporary Italy and the hypocrisy of the Catholic Church, and Fellini's reputation for flamboyant and controversial imagery and subject matter can be seen in full flight here. In no way is that a bad thing, I loved the subject matter La Dolce Vita took and it dealt with it in a superb way. It may be a scathing satire, but it is also a surprisingly mature and poignant film as well.While over two and a half hours long, La Dolce Vita is never dull, or at least not to me, because everything is so well done the film just engrosses you. The script is truly excellent and easy to understand and the story is a brilliantly written(if episodic) one too with some wonderfully constructed scenes-loved the musical sequence best of all, and the encounter with Anita Ekberg in Rome's Trevi Fountain is unforgettable. Fellini's direction is outstanding and one of the main reasons why La Dolce Vita is as good as it is.From a visual stand point, La Dolce Vita cannot be faulted either. The cinematography is simply gorgeous as are the immaculate production values. In fact, I don't know about anyone else but this is one of the most visually beautiful films I have seen in a while now. Nina Rota's score is one of his best, it is very beautiful and memorable. The acting I found little to fault either. Marcello Mastroianni is absolutely wonderful playing a wholly credible if somewhat unsympathetic character, and all the acting and characterisations are on par too.All in all, this film is a masterpiece and for those who haven't seen it already, I recommend it highly. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

            "content": "\"-What now? -Drive, or stay here.\"Marcello Rubini is the outsider looking in. He is a character torn between the the safety of the center and the lure of freedom found in eccentricity. The Rome in which he moves is created by centrifugal movement. The center of this space is shifting, mobile, never remaining in one place for long. It is located wherever what happens to be in vogue at any given moment happens to be, as Marcello moves through it throughout the episodic and discontinuous plot of the movie. Whether it's the arrival of an American movie star (Sylvia) to Rome, the apparition of the virgin Mary, or the latest adventures of the rich and famous in the bars on Via Veneto, Marcello is there, accompanied by his trusty photographer, Paparazzo. Marcello spends a great amount of his time in his car, moving from one assignment to the next. He circles Rome as a perpetual wanderer, a modern Oddysseus. This circulating movement is opposed to the place that is supposed to be his immobile place of refuge, his flat, a place he hardly ever enters during the film, except on a few occasions such as to save his fianc\u00e9e from suicide in one of the film's early scenes. His life, as a journalist, as perpetually unfaithful lover, and as the film's anti-hero, consists of a dialectic between these two modes of habitation. \"Journalism pays well if you're good\", Marcello tells his father in one scene in the film. \"I have and a car, and a flat - una macchina, e uno appartamento.\" Indeed, and the tension between these two modes of habitation is what structures his days and the film.Sometimes, however, the categories can shift, or be transformed into one another, like in the early scene when Marcello and Maddalena meet the whore and agree to drive her home. The whore is so impressed with the luxuriousness of Maddalena's car that she exclaims that \"it's not a car, it's an apartment!\" Indeed, and Maddalena, like Marcello, is perhaps only really at home when she is in motion. This occurs shortly after a conversation where Marcello and Maddalena debate the advantages of rest versus movement. \"-I need an island\", Maddalena proposes. \"\u0096Buy one\", Marcello responds. \"\u0096I've thought of it. But would I stay on it?\"The center, by contrast, is epitomized by Marcello's friend Steiner. Indeed, the essential scene where Marcello and his fianc\u00e9e visit Steiner's apartment is located temporally at the dead center of the movie. It is the eye of the storm, the still point where the ceaseless motion of the rest of the movie comes to a halt. However, later on it really becomes a truly \"dead center\", a place of death, as Steiner kills his children and then himself.The (lost) center for Italian men is the place of the wife and the mother. La Dolce Vita also amounts to one long caricature of these men, sometimes going into open ridicule. Let's recall Marcello's tender declaration to Sylvia: \"You are everything. You are the first woman on the first day of the creation. You are mother, sister, lover, friend, angel, devil, earth, home.\" This speech, though wonderful, is also superbly comical, not least because Silvia doesn't understand a word of Italian. Marcello is ultimately only talking to himself, and if someone was really listening, one doubts that he would find the nerve to speak. His speech is echoed and turned even sillier by another character in the movie. One of the guests at Steiner's party is an old, ridiculous professor. An oriental-looking girl has been brought to the party to entertain, and with her sitting at his feet, the professor passionately declares: \"The only true woman is the oriental woman. Where was Eve? In the garden of Eden. That was in the east. There, love is truly at once mysterious, maternal, lover, daughter, oriental women crouches at your feet like an infatuated tigress.\" For Marcello, this woman, in the form of Silvia, comes from the west, for the professor, she comes from the east \u0096 the direction of the compass doesn't matter, she doesn't really come from anywhere but their own dreams.Marcello's view of this is ambiguous, but for the viewer the effect seems clear. The deep irony of the movie places the idea of the center where it belongs: it's the old idea of the essence, that can only belong in the junkyard of European metaphysics. In light of this realization, it's impossible for this movie to have a happy ending, it must turn on itself and take itself apart. The remaining part of the scene at Steiner's house becomes tainted with melancholy. Not much later, of course, the dream of the quiet center receives its death blow, with Steiner's murder of his children and his following suicide. The rest of the movie, with its culmination in the famous \"orgy scene\", is a story if disillusionment and destruction.The movie is filled with gestures of broken illusions. When Marcello retreats to the ocean to find peace to write, he encounters a beautiful young girl who works as a waitress, and for a moment he pictures her to be \"as beautiful as an angel from an Umbrian church\". The illusion doesn't last. Before long, she is revealed to be just a normal little girl who wants to dance to the latest tunes on the jukebox, human, even possible to love, but no angel. And yet \u0096 and yet \u0096 at the very end, it is once again morning. The exhausted party guests go out to the beach, and the last thing we see is the face of Marcello's \"Umbrian Angel\", as she tries to get in touch with Marcello, her words drowned out by the sound of the waves. We do, finally, not know what Marcello thinks in this moment. Perhaps there is still some hope, if not in delusion, then in truth.",

The sweet life is a paradox because the only sweetness is in the wealth and over indulgence of the characters. For these people, the sweet life is moving through life without purpose or accomplishment. Their lives are designed to impress others, but the others aren't worth impressing. So Marcello sits back and observes. He participates but is never happy. He indulges but gets no enjoyment. He is faced with his own mortality and dies a little each day. He wakes up the next day without a connection to real life. Anyway, that's a little speech and it may completely miss the mark because Fellini is so complex and such a master of the crazy world he presents, I could be all wet.

            "content": "A triumph of style over substance.One can't overcome the feeling while watching \"La Dolce Vita\" that Federico Fellini thinks he's being terribly intellectual and profound, but there's precious little going on in this film's head. It's telling that on a second viewing, when I thought I would discover nuance and detail I missed the first time around, I was instead bored and found myself counting down the minutes until the film was over.Fellini seems to be criticizing a decadent, empty modern society in which ideas have died. Fair enough. But if he's going to make that point -- and drag it out for over three hours, no less -- perhaps he would have been wise to choose someone other than the rich, privileged class to make the point with. The grand conclusion he comes to in his film is that money, wealth and status aren't enough to give a life meaning or purpose, and don't offer anything to offset the void of boredom that they create. This isn't news. Has there ever been a time in history when the privileged classes haven't been bored? I thought the strongest sequence in the film was that depicting the media frenzy that erupts when two children see the Madonna in an empty field. It reminded me of a news story that occurred just a few months ago here in Chicago when a similar frenzy erupted over a water stain in the shape of the Virgin Mary that formed on the wall of an Interstate overpass. Fellini beautifully caught the utter absurdity of people trying to convince themselves that what they want to believe is true, and the sadness that this need is necessary in the first place.In the film's final sequence, Marcello Mastroianni's character tells the people he's partying with that they're the most boring people alive. I second that. Too bad that a movie about boring, vacuous people makes for a boring, vacuous movie.Grade: C+",

            "content": "When it comes to art, the best one can do is receive it with grace, measure it against one's soul and if one is so inclined, speak from the heart about it. That's the only thing that matters, all else falling away. Comments about the execution are irrelevant, really. If someone talks about that, it isn't from their heart and doesn't really matter. This is excellently executed, but with art the only demand is that it cross a threshold of competence, making it close enough for us to reach. All else is decoration. Read elsewhere for comments on the decorative qualities of this.I'll start from the end. I recommend you see this because it is a necessary launching ramp for \"8 1/2.\" I believe that film is essential viewing for any citizen of the world, and to get it, you have to sit through this. Its roughly the same shape: Fellini himself, an empty and artless man posing as an artist who can only place himself in a definition of emptiness defined by the seven types of women.In this world \u0097 a convincing one \u0097 women define the world by their being, and all spaces \u0097 physical spaces I mean \u0097 are carried by them into existence. Men merely stand between surrounding walls and the woman who made them whether she is present or not. When strained through the cloth of cinema, we have something like this film. (I wish some Japanese filmmaker would do for this what \"H Story\" did to \"Hiroshima Mon Amore\" but in Barcelona.)So it is a competent film, even decorative. It is art, and for reasons beyond itself, you should see it. But it doesn't measure well against my soul. Nor famously did it against Fellini's, which is why, after a celebrated crisis, he developed a different style for his next films. I suppose it is true that you could see this as about the bankruptcy of Roman aristocrats, or about more general bankruptcy of men. But I see it as about Fellini's own self inflicted, selfaware malaise.But why is this one recommended to be rejected and the later one valued? Because of the cinematic form, dear friends. That's all that matters. Usually this form is considered realistic or neorealistic and the later films fantastic surreal. I think we can do better than that. The \"neorealistic\" films are composed by a self that stands outside. It sees and reports. It sees and judges; this is a film that assumes judgment. Its an essay, \"explained\" because both the filmmaker and the viewer stand outside it. Even the edges of the frame are perfectly placed, so as to remind us of the window we peer through.\"8 1/2\" and his other project I admire (\"Block-notes di un regista\") have the filmmaker distinctly in the thing. The edges shift. We are invited in. Some things aren't clear, what we encounter hasn't been filtered to make sense for us. Its a party, but not one the camera understands, so we are in the midst of the battle instead of observing the party.So if it is art you come for, you won't find it here unless you think competent decoration and impressive effect matter. What matters is whether the artist's blood mingles with ours, and Fellini didn't bleed until after this, probably because of this. Later, he did add that girl at the beach so his types of women total 8. I suppose you need to see this, then \"8 1/2,\" then Greenaway's \"8 1/2 Women.\"It may not be the best way to capture a film, by bracketing it somehow. But it works for me in this case. This is just a bracket.+++++++One could say things about many of the characters and performances, and I cannot resist mentioning one: Nico. In the next to last segment, she plays a top model engaged to a royal nitwit. We gather at his castle and go ghost-hunting where we are given the woman-outside- the-walls story. This was when she really was a top model and before she became Andy Warhol's primary avatar in the world. She originated the \"Gothic\" look copied by millions of girl misfits. She reinvented a form of sultry singing (then newly in rock) that turns the notion of this movie inside out: deliberately soulless and therefore attractive.This film also brackets her amazing glow as the Chelsea Girl. THE Chelsea Girl. You should know about her. She had a real life. We all live in the ashes, unbeknownst.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",

But then hours later I'm thinking about what message the film's director will really try to convey with this work, I'll detail a little about it throughout this analysis.We follow the story of Marcello an Italian journalist, quite famous and admired by his friends, he is a symbol of what many men want to be, in addition to the qualities mentioned, Marcello is rich, has a beautiful Triumph TR3A and is always accompanied by beautiful women, also present in high society parties. (Finally live the life of dreams).As the story unfolds, Marcelo, who has a toxic relationship with his girlfriend Maddalena, always mistreats and disrespects and betrays her, who at a certain moment asks the other Maria (Mother of Jesus) to change him so that he can leave this life and start like her. However this seems to be really a miracle because Rubini always with beautiful women, from prostitutes to movie actresses. Always without any limit, not even when your close friend dies.At a certain point, the father of the journalist appears who lives the same life as his son, from brothels to brothels, and at one point there is a scene in which he looks at his father, with a sad face, and gives us the dimension of what he will become in the future, someone who lives at parties but deep down is always sad, alone and forgotten.This is the reflection that the film leaves for us, is it worth a life full of futility and trivial relationships? The director appeals to the exaggerated exaggeration of the scenes in which Marcello obviously lives \"the life of dreams\" precisely to show us a behavioral and thoughtful attitude what a determined person is and this can help to repeat casual films.As it is portrayed in Italy (for me one of my favorite countries, I will still visit), the film shows a series of real places, style in clothes, glasses and hairstyles. As for the soundtrack, we have Jazz, Blues, Piano, oriental music. We also observe several paintings and sculptures of the plot, which enriches the experience even more.The only negative point for me is that the character Marcello almost doesn't suffer for his actions and everything ends up working out in the end, this frustrates me a little, but obviously doesn't compromise the film.",

Of course, it turns out not to matter a joy for it is a joy to watch from start to finish. The camera work and direction are perfect and every scene looks wonderful. Some of the dialogue seems a little arch today, did people really talk like that? Perhaps yes, clearly there were a lot of intellectuals or at least pseudo intellectuals about. Everything unfolds seemingly without effort and in a seeming natural way. We swing from church to whores and literature to night club with the odd something to eat and rather a lot to drink thrown in. Strange times in Italy are being alluded to here and to what extent it was the freedom afforded by the end of the war and a certain flow of money or whatever it is certain that the scandal over the discovery of the body of young Wilma Montesi on the beach and talk of sex and drugs in high places fuelled this little fire. Whether Fellini's invention of the word, paparazzi originated from the Italian word for sparrow or mosquito, the intention is clear and remarkable but then almost everything in this film is. In conclusion I must mention Anita Ekberg and confirm that my screen really did sparkle and shine throughout the period she was there and such was her presence, thanks to lighting, framing and her own seeming 'love of life, that her afterglow prevented the film seeming in any way to lapse into ordinariness once she was gone.

This happens with a certain frequency. The big problem is, after all that, to face all the thoughts and conclusions in a sober monday morning, when everything is just real, concious and above all that sincere. This is the the big question and problem of Marcello Rubini, a reporter of a gossip magazines who has to deal with the fact that he tastes the same poison he spreads by leaving in a group of people which he sucks his living.In a moment he is directing his papparazzi and, in the next, he is running away from them. He flows between all kinds of social circles and the only impression he gives is that it doesnt matter what kind of craziness you are getting into everything is a big clich\u00e9. From the mainstream world of a gorgeous actress who feels able to express opinions about everything (and we buy it), passing throught the religious world of the faith, and also an intellectual circle that gives a fake impression of freedom, everything turns out to be an escape. That blonde girl appears as a stroke of pureness and sincereness, something we should really look for, but we just dont. In the case of Marcello's life, writing is the solutions he always substitute for vain experiences. Something he likes and that he needs a young girl to tell him that.

Marcello Mastrioanni shines here as a reporter seeking a story as he seeks himself through vapid women and parties, all the while ignoring the only thing that has a true meaning - his mistreated and often abandoned girlfriend, who truly loves him.In his self-absorption, Marcello (same name as the star's) lives in an idealistic universe where he imposes qualities on other people that they don't possess. Ultimately he finds out that these people lack what he believes they have - or rather, what he gave them. In his disillusionment, particularly over the character of Steiner, whom he admires so much, he basically gives up and accepts \"la dolce vita\" for what it is - a big nothing that dulls the brain.Looking at it outside of Marcello's mind, it's all clear to the viewer that the Anita Ekberg character has none of the exalted values he instills in her; she has, in fact, no mystery at all. She's a party girl. He has no real connection with his father, though he believes he does. With Steiner, reality hits Marcello in the face.Fellini gives us so many vivid images - Ekberg at the fountain, the scene at the castle, the statue of Christ as it is flown over Rome - absolutely stunning. And then, a young woman at the beach (the same woman from the cafe scene) who waves to Marcello and seems in her own way to have all the answers to life. But he wouldn't understand those answers.Ultra-modern even seen today with its existential point of view, La Dolce Vita, despite my awkward attempts to describe it, is a film that demands repeat viewings. The world is more shallow than ever. It's as Fellini described and even predicted. After a night of partying, like Marcello, we still all have to face ourselves in the morning.

It seems like Fellini was going for alienation and a search for meaning, and without knowing anything about the director, I would venture to say that the picture was autobiographical to a large degree. I could be totally off base, but that's the impression I got.Most of the characters in the story are fairly pathetic, including the principal player Marcello (Marcello Mastroianni). They engage in self absorbed, hedonistic behavior, living only for today with little regard for anything other than self gratification. The exceedingly fleeting nature of fame and notoriety is given short shrift with the frantic buzzing of the paparazzo running around in circles trying to capture the next big headline or lurid photo for their tabloids. So it comes as a shock when the one seemingly serious character in the story, Steiner (Alain Cuny), proves to be the one who can't cope with his life of achievement and intellectual pursuit and ends it in tragedy. All rather depressing if you think about it.I guess the main thing that bothered me while watching the story was how random Marcello's day to day encounters turned out to be. There didn't seem to be a sense of continuity to his life and maybe that was the point. Unable to find fulfillment in his relationship with Emma (Yvonne Furneaux), Marcello simply bounced around accepting whatever life handed him on a particular day instead of seeking out something meaningful.The one character that I was able to identify with most was the young working girl in the caf\u00e9 who didn't want to be there. At least she had a purpose in her situation, it was to get out of there when her father finished his job. I got the idea that she might have been smitten by Marcello's attention in complimenting her, which is why I was left somewhat dismayed when she waved to him near the end of the story while standing on the beach. I replayed it a couple of times, and it looked like she was mouthing 'love you' to Marcello, though of course he was too far away to see or hear her. For her to connect with Marcello would have been an unintended consequence waiting to turn into another hopeless situation if that were to happen.",

His knack for capturing a face and/or a mood is without equal. Of course his list of influential films is quite long - \"La Strada\", \"Satrycon\", etc. Each has something new to offer, but is unmistakenly Fellini. What a pure joy to watch the movement and placement of the camera and the lighting. You cannot help but see what he wants you to see. I could feel the wetness of the fountain as Mastroianni climbs in with Ekberg. Alcohol, sex and the desire for something new is behind the miserable lives of those in the movie. OK, the story lacks a bit. In fact, it plays like a series of vignettes - each with a little moral, or at the very least providing us something to avoid.

It all seems pointless, up until some point in the last 40 minutes when some change does occur, however even afterwards the material still drags along in an episodic manner, and it takes ages to reach that point. That is what I feel the film's weakness is - it shows an excessive amount of events that have little purpose other than just to show Mastroianni going about his everyday business. For the first couple of hours, any significant amount of story is absent. The film just goes on and on, and although well shot with some great lighting choices, the relevance of the different episodes is not at all clear. I feel that I understand what Fellini is trying to say about the life of the main character, however I feel it could have been done more effectively with lesser and shorter scenes. The bulk of the film just has little weight for what seems to be at the heart of Fellini's tale.",

            "review_title": "Cinema's new intoxicating taste, served by a true artistic pioneer ...",
            "content": "\"La Dolce Vita\" is the turning point of Fellini's career and a new breath for Cinema's artistic inspiration. The tone is more eccentric, energetic, stylish, flamboyant, and more deliberately flawed because Fellini understood the necessity to stop being a film-maker and establish himself as a true author. No wonder the film met an international success, winning the Golden Palm and being such an event by itself. When American cinema was declining, Italy was fixing the new rules. What lacks in the film is less a structure than a plot but its absence is partly due to the meaninglessness nourishing the lives of its protagonists. The main character Marcello, played by the namesake Mastroianni, is a journalist who follows movie stars and covers tabloid news and therefore is the \"privileged\" witness of a world falling into decadence, of hookers and strip-teasers, of starlets full of illusions and disillusioned intellectuals, of libidinous newcomers and alcoholic has-beens, a gay and sinister world incarnating a society that lost all its boundaries for best and worst, and it's often from the morally worst that comes the aesthetically best.But the episodes are not disjointed at all, the film obeys to a simple yet insightful pattern: a nighttime event followed by its questioning at dawn. One night, Marcello makes love with the beautiful and wealthy Maddalena (Anouk Aim\u00e9e) in a prostitute's house, at dawn, he finds his fianc\u00e9 Emma (Yvonne Furneaux) unconscious after an overdose and declares his love while she's still semiconscious in the hospital. He goes to a Cha-Cha-Cha Club with his father and introduces her to Fanny (Magali Noel), a beautiful French dancer, but after the party, the father is victim of a stroke. Another episode involves a false miracle that ends in tragedy when the crowd running after the kids who saw the Virgin Mary, tramples a crippled child. All the episodes are made of ups and downs, and as the film progresses, we've got less time to enjoy the frenzy of the moments than to feel the bittersweet taste of the aftermath, yet the lessons of the past are never respected in the present. Indeed, we all recover from hangovers and although we swear never to touch alcohol, we end up drinking again, a man cheating on his woman would feel guilty but sooner or later, the impulses would come back. Marcello can't help it either. The greatest demonstration is how he immediately falls in love with the beautiful Sylvia. Anita Ekberg is marvelously sensual as the beautiful actress, her voluptuous body, her milky skin, her child-like voice and constant excitement brightening in her eyes, she literally embodies \"La Dolce Vita\", a sort of never- ending, dream-like fantasy, a Divine Comedy throning above our sad realities. Marcello is hypnotized by the unreachable beauty of this world, and the mythic \"Marcello, come here\" sensuously delivered by Sylvia in the Trevi Fontaine sounds like an invitation to join this Dolce Vita. Yet even this magical night ends up with an anticlimactic slap in Sylvia's face by her jealous lover. There's something essential in Mastroianni's performance, he rarely looks happy, his face is passive and in his eyes, there's a constant boredom inhabiting his heart. And the word 'passive' takes all its meaning, in all the many episodes that constitute the films, made at the epic length of three hours, he's involved but he's not the central character. He just lives the situations while the essential is elsewhere, the Jesus statue, Sylvia's arrival, Steiner's suicide, the party with his father. He's like a man caught in a crazy adventure but incapable to take something out of it, incapable to find a true meaning to his life. And maybe the only enjoyment Marcello can afford is the freedom to abandon himself to lust and pleasure, like intoxicated by his own weakness. And I guess, that's why the material of the film was quite subversive, it was asking disturbing questions. Take the photographers who're always here no matter what happens, they're like flies buzzing around a dead corpse, the film is notorious to have inspired the word 'paparazzi' from the character Paparazzo's, Marcello's friend. They all look totally amoral and pathetic, with no absolute sense of decency yet how many of us aren't fascinated by this world of gossip and eager to know about our favorite stars? \"La Dolce Vita\" questions our capability to abandon the chances of knowing the true love, to be a good person, a normal person, just to live life at its fullest and so many Fellinian nights, pinnacling with the climactic orgy, when Marcello rides on a totally drunk woman, slapping her in the bottom. Shocking? Today's world has become worst. Think of girls posing in Facebook sites, making like stars of themselves, think of spring breaks, lust is everywhere, and what most of us won't admit is that they conveniently despise the amorality when it's unreachable but maybe if they had a chance to touch it even once, they would change their minds. Or would they really want to give them a try? Fellini creates a panorama of all the new temptations that made the Roman nights, the degeneration of morality within a conservative society. \"La Dolce Vita\" is an ironic title since it's more about the death of morality, when a Christ statue is waved at by bikini-clad women or a dead fish is invaded by curious eyes, you know there's something rotten in this society. It's funny that Fellini, who was supported by the conservative wing and even the Vatican for his neo-realistic films, praised for their themes: the quest for redemption, people's inner goodness, was attacked for \"La Dolce Vita\" because it was depicting sin. Actually, the film embraces the meaningfulness of the world it depicts, and if the main character doesn't seem ready to redemption, that's simply because he sold his soul to the devil.",

More than just a parade of degenerate Sixties Eurotrash, all of human life is captured in these frames, from prostitutes living in flooded slum apartments to glittering nobility in their crumbling castles.The common thread is the thoroughly captivating Marcello Mastroianni as the gossip columnist/aspiring novelist, later turned burned-out publicist. His relationship with the parade of females who inhabit his world, often fleetingly, is nuanced and authentic feeling, while the episode with his father, who shows up for an unexpected visit, is a delight that brought a wide smile to my face.The unique, episodic structure of the film feels neither showy nor forced, and the film moves through its segments with the natural grace of a great symphony.An added bonus for me was seeing a young Nico of Velvet Underground fame , looking relaxed and happy. Would that things always turned out that way for her.In sum, a totally unique tour de force and, unquestionably, one of the greatest achievements in cinematic history.",

Told mostly through young reporter, Mastroianni's viewpoint, the stories may appear like a collage of events but there is more to that and the characters do have something in common. Most of these people here live in the world of glamour and wealth and others pursue that lifestyle but after having all that, they still live an empty life and are desperate to find meaning and value in life. Mastroianni himself is one such person and in the end he pretty much accepts his life the way it is (as is evident in the final scene during the encounter with the girl at the beach) because he fails to see a way out.Fellini has often told his stories with a distinct style and 'La Dolce Vita' is no different in that aspect. It may seem as though it is a collection of short stories but to me, it is more than that because these short stories are part of a large one. The film itself is full of energy. There's always something happening. The cinematography is terrific. Fellini's regular Ni\u00f1o Rota's score is breathtaking. The cast is superb as it includes Fellini's regulars like Marcello Mastroianni, Magali No\u00ebl, Anouk Aimee and more.'La Dolce Vita' is like a beautiful poem on canvas.

It is a beautiful exploration about life that does not preach or try to tell you what to think.  I understand why many are frustrated with it.  It seems to go nowhere at times, but thats the point.  And most importantly the scenery on this trip to nowhere is beautiful.So, if you are the type that does not like to watch films that are art, do not watch this.  Watch Coyote Ugly.  It will entertain you.  Other films to avoid:  Last Year at Marienbad, The Seventh Seal, The 400 Blows, etc.  Go see something with a gun on the cover instead.For those who like a challenge rather than simple escapism, this is a film that engages you.Different films for different people.

            "content": "There are occasions when you know you are in the presence of greatness but can't quite work out why. This kind of experience is provided by Fellini's classic LA DOLCE VITA. Everything, it seems, has been perfectly planned - from the irresistibly cool performance of Marcello Mastrioianni in the central role of Marcello Rubini, to the wonderful supporting cast including Anita Ekberg, Anouk Aim\u00e9e and Yvonne Furneaux; Nino Rota's memorable score; Otello Martelli's cinematography; and Fellini's apparently uncanny command of the mise-en-scene. Every frame, it seems, has been exquisitely planned, with the viewer's eye not just drawn towards the protagonists, but to the action happening in the background.In terms of plot, LA DOLCE VITA is relatively straightforward; it chronicles in picaresque terms a week in the life of philandering journalist Rubini - someone who devotes his entire existence to hedonistic pleasure. He has a steady girlfriend Emma (Furneaux) but he chooses to chase after every woman he encounters, even English-speaking starlet Sylvia (Ekberg). The fact that he has a limited grasp of the language is irrelevant; what matters is the thrill of the chase. Fellini makes no judgment on Rubini's behavior; on the contrary, he sees it as part and parcel of \"La D\u00f6lce Vita\" (or the sweet life) experienced by most men of his age.Yet there are limitations to this life; Rubini and his colleagues are always shown either climbing into cars, or dining in caf\u00e9s and restaurants. Through this technique Fellini suggests that they have a rootless life; the idea of \"stability\" symbolized by a home or a regular apartment is foreign to them. Rubini has a place to live, but he sleeps there infrequently, preferring instead to find alternative beds to crash down on.In another sequence Rubini encounters his elderly father - someone who had come up from the provinces to see him. Fellini has a joke at Rubini's expense by having the father refuse an offer to go see a film at the cinema (he's seen all the latest releases in his provincial town). Life on screen is not La Dolce Vita: the father wants something more tangible. After an evening devoted to wine, women and song, the father returns to sleep in Rubini's apartment and suffers a mild heart attack. Refusing all offers of help, he goes to hospital alone. The sequence suggests that this is what will happen to Rubini once he grows old; no longer able to stand the fast pace of life, he will become bed-ridden.Yet Fellini refuses to leave viewers with such a pessimistic message. In a climactic final sequence, he shows Rubini indulging himself at a party that lasts through the night into the early morning; he ends up riding a woman, while indulging in sado-masochistic fantasies that adumbrate the more explicit work of Pasolini, released later on in the Sixties and early Seventies (Pasolini has an uncredited role in LA DOLCE VITA as a writer). Such moments reveal the extent to which la dolce vita can corrupt people, but they also reveal Rubini's visceral enjoyment of the moment; refusing to think either of the past or the future, he simply savors each experience for what it is.LA DOLCE VITA is the kind of movie which, although lengthy, can be repeatedly watched, allowing viewers to discover new things each time they experience it.",

I truly did.I am currently working my way through the IMDb Top 250, and I began with \"La Dolce Vita.\" I understand that the movie is culturally significant. I'm not some boor who only enjoys movies with exploding robots or massive amounts of T&A, nor am I a simpleton who requires straight-forward plots with happy endings. But the fact of the matter is that I found this, Fellini's purported masterpiece, to be utterly dull and non-compelling.I won't say that the film is without merit, because there were some scenes that kept me dialed in. The desire that Marcello feels for Sylvia is one of those, and the scene where Maddalena asks Marcello to marry her is another. But these are scenes that are mired in between other muddled sequences that seem to drag on forever.And yes, at 3 hours, this film is mercilessly long. I don't mind long films, and have happily sat through much longer. But this film indulges in the mundane. Shots, sequences, and dialogue that contribute absolutely nothing to the story are lingering and plodding. At times, I found myself having drifted off into a daydream, only to come back and find out that I had missed nothing in the intervening time. This story could be told competently, and in half the running time, if the film had any sense of pace.Part of my apathy goes toward the general unlikability of Marcello. Especially in this day and age, who cares about those who indulge in the glitz and glamour of the film world? Do we really relate to the Marilyn Monroe expy that is Sylvia? I can't look at Marcello, who vacillates between wanting to be a writer and suddenly declaring himself to be an advertising exec and feel any kinship with him. I fear that in 2015, there are precious few people who understand or even want to know what the 1% do, especially when the educated have a hard time finding the most menial jobs. Fascination with the rich and wealthy may have found a wider audience in 1960, but does not play nearly as well to a 21st century audience.In all honesty, this movie appears to be one of those films that people love to pretentiously declare their love for, if only to win the admiration of other people who also secretly dislike it, but wish to be admired as \"film buffs\" themselves. Personally, this particular film buff has no desire to ever see this movie again.",

Dark, cynical, comic and lengthy (nearly 3 hours) maestro Fellini perhaps asks too much of the audience to hang with such an unctuous crowd for so long but his impeccable display of film language and imagery over the course of the film has more than enough visual awe to supplant the constant presence of indecorous bores. In La Dolce Vita we follow hack reporter Marcello (Marcello Mastroianni) who makes his living prowling the via Veneto seeking out gossip and scandal. Sometimes a small coterie of photogs follow him like vultures in search of disaster to pick over the victims. It's an unseemly business but it pays the bills for Marcello who once harbored higher aspirations as a writer. When he meets with a former mentor (Alain Cuny) his desire to be a serious writer becomes re-kindled if only briefly.As Marcello, Mastroianni is slimily outstanding as he snakes about for gossip and tomcat's non-stop, even after his live in attempts suicide. Still he manages to convey a good deal of his own vulnerability making a fool of himself twice while professing his love for a vivacious (Anita Ekberg) Hollywood star in The Trevi Fountain and to a wealthy nymphomaniac that was easily distracted. Misogynistic, abusive, corrupt; albeit with a brief tender familial attachment to his visiting father (Annabille Ninchi), his self hating surrender to the\"sweet\" life during the film's powerful finale makes no attempt to exonerate but it does allow for a moment's sympathy. La Dolce Vita's episodic structure covers a lot of ground as Fellini eviserates among others, decadent aristocracy, bloodsucking media, church, intellectual pomposity, commercialism and nostalgia for Fascism. Achieving it by way of minimal dialogue, clever juxtaposing and devastating caricature the film offers up as many bravura visuals as you will find in any of his other works. The problem is our hero is a heel and the crowd he runs with an unpleasant self absorbed lot one would have trouble spending ten minutes with, never mind three hours. La Dolce Vita is however a breathtaking ordeal.",

To this I can answer that:1. One can very well understand something and yet not like it\n2. This is entertainment and for me it should provide enjoyment\n3. No \"masterpiece\" should be enduredAs far as the understanding goes, this is the tale of shallow journalist Marcello, torn between suffocating monogamy and meaningless promiscuity and frustrated by his job, but unable to achieve anything professionally meaningful.It's also a merciless portrayal of a society rotten to the core, which you will appreciate if you like to think we're all digging in the dirt, but I beg to differ.Finally, I strongly suspect that the everlasting notoriety of this overlong movie is mostly linked to Ekberg huge jugs, even if they appear only for a fraction of time. To be noted, Ekberg's name is linked only to this movie, as if to prove that you cannot build a career on the size of your breasts, even if you can gain perpetual fame.Conclusion: most characters in the movie are unpleasant and/or freakish; the weakest points of Italian society are exposed mercilessly and there is no hint of purpose in any of these lives; also, this depressing tale is terribly datedLa Dolce Vita works only as an historical record about the misogynistic society of Italy in the Sixties.

            "content": "I've talked about my relationship with Fellini in the past, but everything I've seen from him so far has left me cold. In addition to this film, I've also seen 8 1/2 and La Strada. While I don't have any issues with those films per se, I felt like they flew over my head. Given that, I wasn't so hot on rewatching this film concerning its 3 hour runtime, but to my surprise, I ended up liking it quite a lot. Though I'm not sure I loved it per se, it's definitely made me more eager to revisit 8 1/2 and La Strada.On the surface, this film is lovely to look at. It largely consists of various parties Marcello goes to, where he's surrounded by his friends and various women he intends to start a successful relationship with. The deeper one delves into these scenes, however, Marcello's lifestyle feels less like a utopia and more like a prolonged mid-life crisis. The great tragedy of Marcello is that he desperately craves a change in scenery, yet every event he attends results in the same scenery and a similar outcome of winding up back at square one. Instead of abandoning this unfulfilling lifestyle though, he keeps on attending these parties, experiencing more and more failed relationships along the way. Though it's unclear what he wants, there seems to be something he intends to obtain from this lifestyle before he fades away from it altogether, except, one party after another, his attempts keep falling flat. On the surface, it could be said that his intention is to start a successful relationship, but I think his motives are more complex than this. He's already engaged to Emma, yet cheats on her and shows little interest in their relationship. However, if their relationship seems as if it's about to be destroyed, he attempts to prevent that from happening. This raises questions on whether he even knows what he wants. Whatever his intentions are, it's clear his desires won't be fulfilled in his current state.The most commonly criticized aspect of this film is its length. While I'm not going to pretend the movie kept me fully engaged all throughout (I felt its length in a couple party scenes in the latter half), I think its length was part of the point. I love how Rotten Tomatoes has \"...La Dolce Vita remains riveting in spite of -- or perhaps because of -- its sprawling length.\" in the film's Critical Consensus. Marcello seems trapped in a never ending cycle of attending parties and forming relationships, yet always ends up unfulfilled. His response to these failed attempts are to try again and again until something finally works out. In that sense, the repetition adds more layers to Marcello's characterization. I suspect that another rewatch will make this aspect more profound. As it currently stands, I struggled with the film somewhat (albeit, far less than I did when I first watched it), but the odds of me revisiting it are definitely much higher than they previously were.Overall, I really liked this film. Brimming with bloat and repetition, it's not for everyone, but there's definitely a lot going on in the film beyond presenting a gorgeous portrait of nightlife in Rome interspersed with some drama. It's not quite a great film for me (again though, I suspect I'll like it more with another viewing), but it's grown on me to the point it's now my favorite of Fellini's films.",

The pleasure it gives to the seeker of art is supreme.The human existence has as it were two poles and Fellini thought about both of them; one is the social, outer pole, that of the social relations, and also of the net, the web of these relations. The other pole concerns privacy, inner life, secrecy, maybe contemplation.The first one, in its rather many forms (the futility of the social life in large cities, the meaninglessness of the provincial existence), was denounced by Fellini in his many satirical works; Mastroianni says Rome is a jungle and it gives him the comfort of some privacy and _hiddenness; for Fellini yet, it's a desert. The sense of alienation and _enstrangement pervades the unseen channels of this outer life. And Fellini strives to exorcise it\u0097and, as it were, pardon my being rude, to vomit it. He tries to detoxify himself by denouncing these evil malformations of the life. He's the satirist of genuine alienation. Some talked much about these things; Fellini genuinely felt them.Unafraid to state the very obvious, let's say what are the themes of this movie: --the sloth, the hollowness ,the emptiness; --the contrast of the two, or more, beauties\u0097the women in Rubini's life ; --Fellini takes again a sarcastic look at the Italian popular religiosity (from a man who believed in fortunetellers and Castaneda, this is rather disturbing); -- Many actors in this movie have strangely sharp features\u0097Mrs. Ekberg, Barker, Mrs. Aim\u00e9e\u0097which makes them resemble some eerie bronze masks. Was Fellini guided by instinct, is it hazard, or was it deliberate the choice of these people with sharp and eerie features? LA DOLCE \u0085 is an almanac ,and a kaleidoscope, a series of scenes from the roman nigh\u0097life.In some Fellini movies, his characters are rather thin, _thinnish characters, barely sketched. Because they're either symbols, or caricatures, cartoons. In LA DOLCE \u0085, life and art, as I said, coincide, make but one, are one. No self\u0097indulgence, no overindulgence, no sloppiness. This is perhaps Fellini's only 'realist' movie, but realist in a substantial and existential way. LA DOLCE \u0085 is a radiography of the types of feminine natures as well\u0097Sylvia, Maddalena, \u0085 (the ecstatic, the possessive, the depraved\u0097bored type \u0085). Mastroianni is the puzzled pilgrim. His relations with women are besides fulfillment. This is the most coherent Fellinian synthesis. Also perhaps Fellini's most thoughtful script.It seems that in LA DOLCE \u0085 Fellini says the toughest things\u0097tougher, I mean, than in IL BIDONE, LE NOTTI DI CABIRIA or Ginger e Fred\u0097very tough movies themselves; yet LA DOLCE \u0085 is tougher. See the whole Steiner subplot, if I may term it that. Simultaneously, it's a movie of over-abounding poetry.It might be Fellini's most serious attempt at touching the reality, the unseen reality. He touches the humans' frailty, the There is satire; but there are also life scenes offered without any comment\u0097plain scenes. And the one passes into the other, I believe. So, the movie is _unspokenly daring and multifaceted.And here Fellini shows the firmest hand, the tightest control over his subject. LA DOLCE \u0085 is made from a celestial substance.He was a satire freak, yet see how artfully he alternates the vain sociality and the almost pious contemplation and the hope\u0097what prodigious showmanship, what a high note!",

It's long (almost three hours) and is a series of seemingly unconnected episodes in a week in a gossip columnist's life.Marcello Rubini is a writer who dreams of bigger things but lives a superficial life going from party to party. He engages with many women, including his fianc\u00e9e, Emma, Maddalena, Sylvia, Nadia, Nico, etc. We encounter a despondent intellectual named Steiner, who ends up killing his two young children and himself. There are two encounters with an enigmatic teenage girl, Paola, including the film's final scene, which is quite famous.I confess I found the film quite pointless and fell asleep briefly twice. It's well-known for taking cinematic chances for a 1960 movie, including scenes with gay, cross-dressing men, and a strip-tease. It includes a gossip photographer named Paparazzo that led to the term Paparazzi for those photographers who have no shame in ambushing celebrities. It won an Oscar for costume design.I agree with a critic that said La dolce vita was little more than a sequence of events with no common denominator linking them into a meaningful whole.",

Now I've had the chance to watch it again and I still find it unimpressive, making points out of clich\u00e9s and doing so in a heavy-handed way. It is basically a series of episodes designed to reveal to the protagonist, a melding of flaneur and journalist that life is empty and ultimately meaningless. In the lead Marcello Mastroianni does as well as can be expected and probably as well as anyone cast as a cipher could do. Alain Cuny, so memorable in the last seen of the Prevert-Carne Les Visiteurs du soir, is effective as the role model/idol with feet of clay but ultimately this is as empty as the life it depicts.",

            "content": "Federico Fellini's ironically named masterpiece - \"La dolce vita\" means \"the sweet life\" - is a kaleidoscopic look at unfulfilled gossip writer Marcello Rubini's (Marcello Mastroianni) search for meaning in the high society world. His encounters with aristocrats, movie stars, and other people sum up an existence that can never reach its true potential for Marcello. The closest that he comes to real happiness is when he meets actress Sylvia (Anita Ekberg, whose scene in the Trevi Fountain is the most famous), but even that one is not joy as much as descent into madness.Probably the two most effective scenes are Sylvia's arrival, and then the Madonna. Both depict people crowding around to see what they perceive to be \"cool\" things. First a movie star, then a presumed miracle that turns out to be a bust. But they both catch people's attention, serving as an example of the empty world that Marcello inhabits. To crown everything, the end has the same occurrence as the beginning; Marcello's isolation is accentuated by his inability to hear people, and acceptance thereof.All in all, definitely a great movie. I recommend it. Also starring Anouk Aim\u00e9e, Yvonne Furneaux, Magali No\u00ebl, Alain Cuny, Nadia Gray, Lex Barker, Annibale Ninchi, Walter Santesso, Jacques Sernas, Nico and Valeria Ciangottini.",

            "content": "Rome. Marcello, a persistent journalist, is always on the look out for a hot story. He finds his suicidal girlfriend poisoned by pills in his apartment and manages to save her from sure death by bringing her to the hospital. But he doesn't have time for mourning: he catches a plane the next day to talk to the famous star Sylvia, but her husband beats him up in the end. Marcello rushes to one place where a girl had a vision of the holly Mary, then is later on interrupted by a visit from his father. Marcello tries to write a book and end a relationship with Emma\u0085 Federico Fellini is a tremendously talented director, but in my opinion more successful in his first film-making phase of realistic, simple films with heart ( shining \u0084La Strada\" and \u0084La Notti Di Cabiria\" ) than in his second from \u0084Da Dolce Vita\" ( 1960 ), in which he went on producing weird, surreal and heavily pretentious satires and farces. The only excellent film from his second phase is \u0084Amarcord\", which ironically reminds us of his first phase of realistic films. \u0084La Dolce Vita\" is a quality drama that criticizes an empty society that feeds on shallow, sensation oriented stories from the press and media ( the word \u0084Paparazzi\", used for the first time here, later on even became a part of the dictionary ). In that aspect, it doesn't attack the journalists as much as the society that fuels them. But although \u0084Vita\" won the Golden Palm in Cannes and was nominated for an Oscar for best director, set design and script, it feels rather shallow and empty itself.------------------Many sequences are great - for example, the opening shot in which a helicopter is shown carrying a statue of Jesus Christ, or the one where a man is \u0084protecting\" his face from the photographers by placing a newspaper in front of himself \u0096 as are some details \u0096 but Fellini decided to put too much of his ideas in the story, causing it to go out of control. After 165 minutes of screen time the movie loses it's energy and becomes a little bit of a bore. I guess the ending scene with that rotten fish sums it up for me: subversive and profound, but too pretentious for it's own good.Grade: 6/10",

            "content": "Vague spoiler alert.The thing I really enjoy about La Dolce Vita is Marcello's struggle to let go. This happens on such a variety of levels: 1. He wants to be part of the insane society he reports on, but in their presence he seems boring and unwilling to be completely whimsical, getting wrapped up in serious declarations to frivolous movie stars.2. Though he wants to be part of their world and be frivolous about everything, he cannot let go of his conscience, his needy girlfriend, his family, his desire for connections and stable relationships.3. He cannot let go of his initial goal to be a writer despite his clear desire not to be.4. When trying to write, among other situations, he needs to control everything rather than letting himself experience life.5. When he finally achieves his idea of success, being rich and having wild parties, he is disappointed when it's not \"fun\" enough and tries to control the situation rather than letting himself be amused and carried along.My view of Marcello as an indecisive control freak was not the only thing... For most of the movie Marcello does have a conscience and a heart, unlike the people whose society he craves. But by the end, Marcello has made his choice, and lost his heart and all sense of proportion. Initially one hopes Marcello will follow his admiration of Steiner... but when things go badly there, Marcello interprets that as a warning to be frivolous or else. What a sad way for him to misinterpret. Though no one wants to see him end up with Emma in a staid life as a scandal-sheet reporter, his success need not have been accompanied by a loss of heart.Despite this depressing progression, this movie is lovely. It maintains its lightness and surprises all the way through; its personality, like Marcello's, is torn between frivolity and conscience. All the characters are beautiful and delightful. (I would marry Anouk Aimee in a second!) And despite my heavy-handed interpretation, Fellini is subtle and poignant in his criticism of Marcello, especially poignant and even generous when his father comes to visit. I recommend this movie very, very highly - an easy 10/10.",

            "content": "The fountain scene with Marcello Mastroianni and Anita Ekberg is one of the most memorable scenes in film history.  The image of Anita Ekberg getting wet in a fountain is very erotic.  Anita Ekberg has never looked more beautiful then in this one scene.  It defines everything about the films of Fellini.  The scene reveals about the state of loneliness that the two characters share.  Marcello does some soul searching when watching Syvia go into the fountain.\nLa Dolce Vita(1960) was the film that turned actor, Marcello Mastroianni into a star.  In Mastroianni, Fellini saw the perfect actor to symbolize the director's innermost feelings and thoughts.  Fellini also found in Mastroianni, someone who was another side of the director.  Marcello fills the screen with grace and quietness.  He portrays a man whose driven by his job of finding things to fill his scandal sheet.  In the end, he becomes part of the same crowd that he's writing about.\nThe director when he did La Dolce Vita(1960) at the beginning of the 1960s was coming off a decade in which he produced some of the great films of the 1950s Italian cinema such as I Vitelloni(1953), La Strada(1954), Il Bidone(1955), and Nights of Cabiria(1957).  La Dolce Vita(1960) began a period for Fellini of surrealistic and symbolic motion pictures.  Federico Fellini evolved from a Neo Realist to a Surrealist filmmaker.  The direction of the picture is excellent and professionally realized.  Fellini would do only four films during the 1960s, but the four films are some of his best. His filming of the gathering at the end of La Dolce Vita is an example of the circus environment that Fellini was fond of.\nPersonally, I prefer his next film of 8 and a Half to La Dolce Vita(1963). One, the film is rather slow at times and uninteresting.  Two, 8 and a Half(1963) does a better job at fully describing the director's most personal thoughts.  Three, Marcello Mastroianni gives a much more complete performance in 8 and a Hafl then in La Dolce Vita(1960).  This does not mean that La Dolce Vita is a bad film or is one of Fellini's worst.  Its just not one of my top favorites films from him.\nThis was the movie that the term Paparazzi came from as there is a character in the film whose name is Paparazzo.  The music by Nino Rota is very good and wonderful to listen to.  Anouk Aimee is good as the girlfriend of Marcello.  Future Italian Western specialist, Giulio Questi has an appearence as an actor in La Dolce Vita(1960).  The original producer wanted Paul Newman for the lead role of the journalist, but Fellini refused to cast him so the producer left the project(a positive moment in the making of La Dolce Vita).  The shot of the Helicopter carrying the stature of Jesus Christ is symbolic of the commercialistic aspect of religion.",

A unique, indescribable magic that oozes from the imagination of countless talented directors of the 40's-60's era, especially from Fellini's imagination.

            "content": "Films like this don't come about often. To me, this film actually represents cinematic perfection. Inductive screenplay, wonderful mise-en-scene, stunning direction and stunning photography, as well as a legendary Marcello Mastroianni, one of the best actors ever no doubt at his best here.From the outset, you know this film is going to be special. A special portrait of the Italian sweet life during the 'economic miracle' of the 60's. A time where the Italian people could finally stop worrying about life and money and save money to go out at night and party. And from when we see Marcello, we idolize him. He is a winner. A well respected journalists, known by all, who always winds up being at the right party ever night and lives the life of a king. His life resembles much one of a singer, like the ones portrayed by Jamie Foxx and Joaquin Phoenix. He has someone who waits for him at home, someone who cares about him, but he still loves to party and make love to other women.The scene where he tries to take Sylvia (Anita Ekberg) to any house so he can make love to her, is just fantastic. As is the fountain scene, that is so widely known, I'm not even going to start discussing its cinematic importance, as far as photography and performance are concerned. But no matter where he ends up being every night, he can never leave Emma, although he can't promise to marry her. She says \"If I won't stay near you, who will?\".Yet, he's a free bird. He loves to flirt with other women, perhaps because he knows that Emma will never leave him. He tells Maddalena he loves her, even though he obviously doesn't mean it, just like she doesn't mean it when she tells him (they are both tipsy). And even at Steiner's party, where Marcello takes Emma with him, he seems to be more sexually attracted to Steiner himself than to Emma.It's an inductive script, we never know what is going to happen next. We let Marcello be our guide through Rome, and he really does take us to the most extraordinary places. The liveliest clubs and the most beautiful settings. And we witness whatever adventure the night reserves for him. Fellini is able to capture our attention from the very start, until, while at first we wish we could be there at those magnificent parties, we actually get the feeling that we are in those parties, we are part of the crowd.But the parties and the sweet life is not all he deals with, far from it. Being a Fellini film, Fellini is not afraid to sweep us off our feet with different side objects. There's a whole sequence devoted to religion, another devoted to family, and one exquisite one where Marcello meets his father in Rome, and takes him to a night club. He loves being with his father, and would love to spend some time with the man he doesn't know, as he tells his friend Paparazzo. But his father is more interested in the sweet life, and in fact, ends up leaving the club with another woman. And when he leaves, he is unable to understand that his son wants to know him better. It's a touching scene, a short glimpse of Marcello's past that Fellini allows us, possibly to let us understand where his personality came from. When Marcello tells Paparazzo that he doesn't know his father, he also talks of the way he would stay away for weeks, and he would hear her mother cry very often. This is the way he has been treating Emma, yet he fails to understand it. Or, more possibly, he does understand it, but chooses to ignore it.I could talk about this film a lot more. Every time I see such a cinematic masterpiece, it leaves me speechless, completely speechless. To me, this film appears flawless on all levels. And to think that its runtime is almost three hours...you just don't feel it. I recommend it to all lovers of cinema. Do not miss it, watch it before you die, and be immersed in the sweet life of a time that will never come back, in a time place that will never exist as such again.",

            "content": "I first saw this film this past summer, around July. My previous experience with Federico Fellini had left me a little jaded. I had long ago, probably before I even knew of Fellini, rented his Satyricon, since I am a classics enthusiast and had read some Petronius. I can't say that I hated Satryicon (and to be completely truthful, I was not as well informed about the seventh art as I was when I saw La Dolce Vita for the first time, so I should probably go back to it one of these days), but I did not like it. It seemed way too flamboyant, and I felt it attempted to show depth when really it had none. I did, however, research the director a bit in print after I saw it. I knew that 8\u00bd came highly recommended, so I rented it. An hour and twenty minutes in, I turned it off. I found it pretentious and silly. My third Fellini was Juliette of the Spirits. It was about a year or maybe less after I saw Satyricon, and I think I can honestly say from this vantage point that I disliked it a lot. I remember it very clearly. It reveled in spectacle and very obvious symbolism. I had to watch it for a class, and it gave me the proof that I had longed for so much that my professor was a complete hack, having no right to teach a college level course. But, several months later, on the suggestions from so many avid Fellini fans, I attempted yet another of his films. Again, my choice on the rental shelf was poor: Roma. A lot of respectable people do like this, but I for one felt that it was the work of a director who was clearly full of himself. I think that in retrospect, I fell even more strongly this way. Having seen so many of his other films now, any one of them, any one that actually takes place in Rome, is a much better love poem to Rome than was Roma. \tAgain, I saw La Dolce Vita around July of this past summer. It is nearly three hours long, so unfortunately I had to split it into two sessions. But I did enjoy it, maybe not immensely, but I could see, for the most part, its point, and its construction I found ingenious. It did not affect me all that greatly, though, at first, possibly because I saw some of that infamous Italian spectacle in it (especially the ending, which I did not understand at first and just found a bit pretentious; now, i see it as one of the best endings I've ever seen. I even had a dream about being on that beach and seeing that fish just this weekend). Instead, I found that this is the sort of masterpiece that takes a long time to ponder and understand. A month after I saw it, I realized that a lot of it had secretly stuck in my brain. It filled my dreams. When I was asleep, I partied with Marcello. When I daydreamt, I was filled with sorrow and pity for him. \tIn the past three months or so, I have seen most of Fellini's most famous films: La Strada, Nights of Cabiria, and even 8\u00bd again, which I loved the second time through. I have also seen his first film (though co-directed), Variety Lights. I have liked all of those (see my comments on 8\u00bd to read my take on Fellini's career, his downfall after 8\u00bd especially).\tNow I have come back to La Dolce Vita, a film that has been stewing in my head for several months now. Armed with information to help me solve its puzzles, I found it utterly brilliant the second time through. In fact, I think it is Fellini's best film. And yes, I do know what the fish symbolizes.",

Other Fellini films offer something similar, but none I've seen are as great as this one (and this one is the only one I've felt compelled to watch more than once).It starts with a statue of Jesus tied to a helicopter flying over Rome. It ends with a bunch of delirious, drunken partygoers coming across a \"sea monster.\" And everything in between somehow makes the journey from strange point A to an even stranger point B make sense.I understand why this is so beloved without actually being able to put into words why it's so great.

            "content": "For a movie that seems to have a reputation as a loose collection of events, La Dolce Vita is surprisingly tightly built. This is my third or fourth viewing of the film, and my appreciation for it just grows with every new visit to this mad look at the circus that was Rome in the late 50s.Federico Fellini found the perfect actor to play Marcello Rubini. Marcello Mastroianni was the Italian Cary Grant, the consummate movie star, and he eases into the role of the society journalist Rubini with aplomb. He's slick when he talks to women, deflecting when he talks to men, and he carries himself with suave indifference to most of what he sees. That feeling of floating through life, though, isn't just an affectation to bring along because Mastroianni was a cool guy in real life, that's the core of the contradiction at the heart of Rubini as a character.Like many Fellini protagonists, Rubini is caught between worlds. He comes from a small town (not by the seaside) but lives in Rome, adjacent to the rich and famous. He wants to write serious literature, but he actually writes gossip columns about the rich and famous. He's engaged to an attractive woman of no real social importance, but he's constantly trying to (and occasionally succeeding at) bedding women of incredible wealth. He's a man of physical sensations, but he does seem to yearn for more spiritually. As we progress through the series of episodes, we watch Rubini explore the contradictions within himself, and even progress through his life with views of how he will end up.So, it's hard to talk about this without just delving into the individual episodes in order, but oh well. The first sees Rubini meeting up with Maddalena, a wealthy heiress he knows, at a swanky club. They drive off after Rubini receives a threat from someone he harmed with a column, and they pick up a prostitute before going to the prostitute's hovel of a home, complete with flooded floors, and make love in her bed while the prostitute waits outside. The next is the most famous sequence in the film where Rubini spends time with Sylvia, an American actress built out of pure sex that Rubini ends up completely falling for. He worships her, ends up getting her away from the crowd, and tries to find a place to bed her, completely stymied until she comes upon the Trevi Fountain and romps around in the movie's most famous scene.Rubini moves on to cover the reaction to a miraculous appearance of the Virgin Mary to two small children on the outskirts of the city. This is a larger, more circus-like version of a similar scene in Nights of Cabiria, as people crowd around a supposedly holy spot, desperate for some touch of the divine. Unlike Cabiria, though, Rubini doesn't get sucked into the crowd. He ends up taking a spot in a light tower and watches from above. His fianc\u00e9e, Emma, though stays below and does quietly pray for Rubini to become the faithful man she had fallen in love with. Much like Cabiria, there are views of the small pleas that come from genuine needful spaces, like a woman holding onto her child, both draped in black, kneeling by the small tree where the Madonna appeared, and begging for help for her sick girl. The way the soundtrack drops all of the crowd noise as Rubini focuses solely on her seems to indicate at least a desire to have that kind of deep feeling, but Rubini's attention moves yet again to the circus that surrounds them.The next sequence sees Rubini and Emma showing up to the luxurious apartment owned by Steiner, a friendly acquaintance of Rubini's. The conversation is urbane and philosophical with a poet telling Rubini to shed any permanence (with Emma right there on the couch) and Rubini having a private conversation with Steiner who talks about the balance between his comfortable existence and his desire for something more to feed his spiritual needs. The next sees Rubini's father making a surprise visit to Rome and spending the evening with his son in a nightclub. This is one of the more interesting episodes when it comes to viewing Rubini and his potential future. There's a lot of his father in Rubini. They're both womanizers with eyes towards getting what they want when they want it as evidenced by the father's successful attempt at picking up a dancing girl that Rubini knows. When his father has some sort of health crisis as the woman's apartment, he becomes circumspect after an evening of rabblerousing. On a certain level, it feels like Rubini is looking at his own future as his father struggles to get up from his chair after suffering what was probably a minor heart attack and struggling to catch the train to return home to his wife.Later, Rubini accompanies some old money aristocrats to their remote castle where he watches this decrepit family saunter around their huge estate. There, he meets Maddalena again, and she confesses that she wishes to marry him but she can't change who she is, and she is way too loose of a woman to be tied down to one man. Unable to see her because they're using a sound echo to communicate across different rooms, Rubini confesses his desire to marry her as well (in a similar way that he confessed his love to Sylvia who didn't understand his Italian), but she immediately falls into the arms of another man who walks up to her. She's never seen again, and Rubini wanders through the crowd until he makes love to another woman in the abandoned structure they're walking through.Rubini later has a fight with Emma where she needs him to remain faithful to her, but he doesn't want to change. He kicks her out of his car, leaves her on the side of the road for a few hours, and returns to pick her up after which they embrace tenderly in bed. He gets a call that Steiner had killed himself and his two children, and he has to go and try to help the police break the news to Steiner's wife. The movie's final sequence is its most grotesque and saddest. Rubini, long after having abandoned Emma, apparently, leads a group of low end showbiz types into the house of a friend where they tiredly attempt an orgy that never gets off the ground. As night turns to day, Rubini and the gang wander out to the beach where they see a dead leviathon dragged onto shore, and Rubini sees an innocent girl he had met earlier. They can't hear each other over the pounding of the waves.So, why recount the movie in such detail? The depth of this movie comes from Rubini's navigation of these different set pieces and how they relate to his desire for change contrasted with his immutability. He wants to become the real writer, but he keeps finding reasons to ignore it in favor of the more frivolous stuff he does write. He wants to settle down with Emma, but he sees how Steiner commits suicide and his father seems so pathetic, so he ends up casting it aside. He wants something to fill the void in his soul like religion, but he can't get past the artificiality of the spectacle around it. In every instance, he ends up choosing the easier way of life, the one detached from other people, challenges, or commitment, and where does he end up? Feebly trying to incite an orgy amongst a bunch of nobodies in someone else's house, unable to even communicate with the innocent young woman not of this new grotesque world just a hundred yards away.For a movie that is titled The Good Life and has this reputation of rich people being frivolous in a beautiful city, the movie's really about how completely empty it is. I'm reminded of Terrence Malick when he went to Hollywood with Knight of Cups and came away with a movie about the emptiness of the place (La Dolce Vita is a whole lot better, though). They're both movies that seem to revel in the details of their world, but the takeaway is not that these places and existences are fulfilling in anyway. Rubini could have made something great of himself, or he could have been happy with Anna. However, he ended up choosing pure frivolity, and he has nothing but a drunken stupor for it. Again, for a movie with a reputation of mad insanity and decadence, La Dolce Vita is shockingly focused and penetrative in theme.",

            "content": "LA DOLCE VITA is a comedy drama, which, in a surreal and grotesque way, shows a tragicomic deterioration of high society in Rome.The main protagonist is a journalist who wants to become a writer. He writes trivial stories about carousing in high society for a tabloid. His job is to attend each party or important event. However, actresses, artists, starlets and easy life are very appealing to the journalist who, in that frenzy, is trying to find a meaning, love and happiness...Mr. Fellini has, through sharp contrasts and contradictions, showed senselessness of life. That apparent freedom, which includes hedonistic behavior, prostitution and promiscuity is actually a vaguely wandering without a purpose. The protagonists have, in a strange way, Alienated themselves from reality. They enjoy the \"sweet life\", but they do not understand it.Mr. Fellini, in an ironic way, shows, through unusual incidents, all the superficiality of one layer of society. However, he is not making fun of a frustrated, unfulfilled and unhappy group of people. He has actually replaced dignity with sensationalism. It is a sad view of decadence of one man and his environment. Fellini's world is really crazy, no less crazy than ours, but it is empty. An irregular mosaic structure was arranged in a meaningful and sad whole.The protagonists are lost and do not understand each other.Marcello Rubini (Marcello Mastroianni) is simply brilliant as a journalist, who goes through crazy experiences, while examines important questions of life. Emma (Yvonne Furneau) as his fianc\u00e9e is, perhaps a true hero in this story, regardless of the pretty powerful bourgeois tone in her character. Steiner (Alain Cuny) is an artist, writer, poet and musician. He is everything that Marcello wants to be. However, Steiner was, despite the wonderful family, tired of life.Anita Ekberg as Sylvia is a big movie star. Marcello is, from the first moment, in love with her. She is a singing and dancing lady, who slowly, like a dream at dawn, escapes from him. Walter Santesso as Paparazzo is \"it\" in the true sense of that word.The logic is definitely a little \"moved\" in this film. However, the point is crystal clear.",

            "content": "Having seen 8 1/2 (the only other Fellini movie I've seen) before this, I can say that La Dolce Vita was very similar in not only style and tone but also at a deeper level. Ironically, the most striking difference I found between 8 1/2 and La Dolce Vita was that the meaning (if any) of 8 1/2 was much clearer and accessible than that of La Dolce Vita. At first anyway.The story of 8 1/2 revolves around a director, Guido played by Marcello Mastroianni, struggling artistically with his newest film project, much like Fellini apparently was at the time, hence deciding to make a movie about a director having no ideas what to make a movie about. It explores the concerns Guido/Fellini has about his newest film including the possibility that it may be meaningless and that this may actually reflect the meaningless of his life. In a weird way, one could argue that the whole point of 8 1/2 is that the movie itself has no point but that it's okay for it to be pointless and yet this is the point of the movie so there is a point after all (or I'm crazy, that's always a possibility).In a similar sense, it could be argued that La Dolce Vita is pointless as well but that that's okay, after all, why should every movie have to have some kind of point? Why can't they just be enjoyable? If some people (perhaps including Fellini) question the meaning/point/importance of their lives then how can a mere movie be expected to have meaning? Like 8 1/2, perhaps there is meaning to be found in La Dolce Vita even if it incongruously depends on accepting there is no meaning to the film other than to be an interesting story about \"the sweet life\".Of course, all of this justification of the apparent lack of meaning to La Dolce Vita (and the meaning lying therein) would be unnecessary if it weren't at least a very entertaining and intriguing film which I think it is. There are moments of comedy, drama, romance and others more difficult to categorise though no less infused with the magic of cinema. As random seeming as many of the events and sequences in the movie are, something about them works. I don't think I can satisfactorily explain why this is the case although perhaps an explanation is unnecessary. Like a nice dream, La Dolce Vita is beautiful and entrancing but doesn't necessarily make much sense. But then again maybe it doesn't need to.",

I plan on reading all of them but, after having seen it after so many years ( I first saw it when it came out in 1960 and loved it) I feel the urge to immediately clarify one point: this movie, like all the others he made,is autobiographical. Fellini, like all great artists, is always talking about himself. He is like a pig in his through (no offense intended)who sits in it, taking pleasure in the warmth emanating from his own ejections, all the while trying to give meaning to himself and his feelings. And wondering why other people find interesting what he is saying. The themes are always the same: the need for incestuous maternal love, the adventure of leaving the little provincial town, the reminiscences of his (much idolized) boyhood, an absent father figure that he tries to summon up, a purifying young female figure,etc. etc. This was his greatest success and it is so because he put so much of himself into it while casting a cynical (but not overly harsh) eye on his fellow men. To really understand this movie one needs to think of it not like a series of episodes illustrating a decaying societies but more like a large, very large canvas,or better yet a large fresco, showing, not without some sympathy, the ebullient, multi-language society in which a smart young man from a provincial little town in Italy is trying to find his ways and a meaning for his life. A great movie, not unlike a modern Divine Comedy or Ulysses with an Italian Leopold Bloom navigating and getting lost in a sweet, intoxicating modern days Rome, not dissimilar from the one he later described in Satyricon.",

Same as you cannot read The Catcher in the Rye when you are fifty, because you will dismiss the book as you have gone past the thoughts of the main character. His actions and his experience no longer apply to you, LA DOLCE VITA has the same opposite effect when you are finding yourself \"in the midst of your life\" and at fifty look ahead and indeed behind you. This is a film about incommunicability. The lack of any chance to being understood, and as the main character wanders around Roma's sweet life, he cannot esxpress himself and cannot make himself being heard, so he lives life superficially, surrounded by extras that live life by the day, throwing hours forward, only trying to achieve an immediate \"success\", a quick orgasm, a financial advantage, while feelings are impossible to share at any stage. The incommunicability is exemplified by the character of the philosopher Steiner, who we might think, by looking at life from a different and deeper angle, might elevate himself over the shallowness of all the other characters and that by taking his life stops time (see Dostoevsky's Kirillov) and opens the eyes of Marcello to the meaninglessness of life. Interestingly, this movie won the Palme D'or taking the prize away from Antonioni's L'Avventura, another film about incommunicability (in fact the two worked together for quite some time). The end of La Dolce Vita runs parallel to another Antonioni's masterpiece, The Red Desert, where the two main characters, Mastroianni and Monica Vitti, find themselves unable to communicate and understand what someone else is trying to tell them. Another movIe that has taken a lot from La Dolce Vita is the more recent The Great Beauty. Both main characters are writers but they are disillusioned and live the Roman life surrounded by shallow or simply lost eccentrics each and everyone trapped in their own personal world in search of immediate gratification (and many more similarities). Please do not miss this masterpiece and do not dismiss it for its forced frivolity.",

I found that I was not riveted by the film at all, and I spent more time trying to understand it than I did actually understanding it. This is not to say Fellini's classic is not well-shot and well-paced if not too dry and thus too needful of patience. It looks good and sounds good, but to me, it just lies there, flat on the screen. No real life to it.However, I really like what it says, what it shows. I wasn't terribly enjoying it, but it is the essential example of neo-realist cinema, which is the period this film is from. Fellini takes the playboy protagonist and strips him down to his core. He pushes aside all of the James Bonds, Darryl Flynts, Don Juans, and Captains Courageous, and displays the natural, genuine course of your average cocky, womanizing everyman's man's self-discovery, an aggressively realistic approach. Mastroianni's all-too-real portrayal of the cold, shallow, brutally self- centered main character is one of the best I've seen recently, even if I didn't care for the film much at all.",

I mean, it's supposed to have something to do with moral decay and the waste of a man who is supposed to be a writer. I'm afraid it looks like pretty mild stuff these days. People staying up all night, going from party to party, meeting famous people who like to stay up all night going from party to party, getting lucky. What's the big deal?There are some interesting scenes going nowhere: two children who lie about having a vision of La Madonna (no, not HER, the other one) which results in a lot of havoc where a mob tears apart the little tree under which the vision didn't happen, and an old man dies in the rain; there's a bit with a really charming dancer (who later played the beauty in \"Amarcord\") who seems to be having a lot of fun amid these jades.But \"La Dolce Vita\" is really just one of those passe things where rich people have money up to their ears and nothing to do but act bored. And as for the \"wasted writer,\" hell, he begins the movie as a gossip columnist and at the end he is the agent for a stud movie star. I mean, if anything, it's a step UP.Fellini's good at getting us down into what he considers the sewer and pointing his finger. \"Look,\" he says, \"A woman who has empty, loveless sex!\" \"Look, homosexuals hanging out in cafes!\" \"Look there! See all night parties where people don't attend mass! I wonder what anyone born after 1970 thinks of this moralizing?What are they to make of the 20-minutes of Anita Ekberg, running amok, showing all of her teeth and most of her chest? Or the character named \"Steiner,\" whose suicide and murder of his children has some kind of final effect on the bored and empty Marcello? After 40 years, this movie is as fake as it ever was, only now it's dated, too. For anyone who argues that you should see it for the style, if Fellini's style is all you want, see \"Satyricon.\" Or if you want to see Fellini when he is really good, see \"Amercord\" or \"Nights of Cabiria,\" or \"And the Ship Sails On.\"",

Marcello is the perfect modern tragic hero in this era of television and tabloid saturation. After all, if a resurrected Jesus can do no more than arouse self-infatuated waves and flashbulb greetings as he descends upon Rome and a crowd of frenzied onlookers devours a tree under which two innocent children claimed to have seen Christ/Mary, surely artistic purity cannot survive.We all know that when Marcello meets the young girl in the cafe that she cannot possibly possess enough innocence and inspiration to fuel Marcello's endeavor at writing a novel and help him stave off the perils of decadent Rome and a career as a host to the leeches who inhabit it. Just like the dying manta ray desperate to stay alive on the beach in the last scene, only to be subjected to inane comments from Marcello's vapid \"friends\" like \"why is it staring at us,\" Marcello, too, is dying inside, and we know that any attempt on his part to communicate his suffering to those same people would be met with the same disdain and obliviousness.Notwithstanding the great sense of triumph and joy I would have enjoyed had Marcello left his party of idiots on the beach and joined his savior who was the keeper of his artistic soul, in order for the movie to be great, it must end with Marcello's figurative death and resound the ultimate despair of innocence lost.",

The first was heavily censored in 1970, and I remember being as upset by jumps in the audio and the visual tracking, than by the powerful anguish the characters exuded. The second was an accidental viewing on television, half-way through the film. The third was yesterday, at a special session, featuring an original copy with subtitles, but reduced to 165 minutes of the 177 or 180 minutes *the* original is supposed to run. One dearly scene I recall from the first or second viewing, is missing in this copy: the start of the bedroom scene between leggy chorus girl Fanny - Magali Noel - and Marcello's father - Annibale Ninchi...

Anyway, seeing the film now without many sequence jumps, on the big screen and in a fairly good copy, entitles me to follow the big crowd out there who rates this a 10. Having seen several other works by Fellini, I say this is the best. One thing puzzles me: why not more than 2 IMDb users commented on the character Paola, and just one mentioned the actress name, Valeria Ciangottini. She was 15-y-o when she played this character of a blonde girl from Perugia, working in an esplanade by the beach, where Marcello is trying to write a report. She looks so impressively beautiful, and pure (what an exceptional casting that was), that Marcello describes her as an angel from the churches' paintings... Later, he will meet her again at the beach, but there will be just hopeless sign language, as the roar of the sea and the wind cover their desperate try to communicate.

            "content": "La Dolce Vita has already been more intelligently reviewed than almost any film I can think of here on IMDb. The currently most popular review, by Mackjay is one of the best short reviews I have seen of this film and one of the best I have seen on this site.Clearly, there are many ways to interpret this work of art by the great Federico Fellini. As with most excellent pieces of art, what the film is about varies with its audience. For me, La Dolce Vita is a penetrating critique and indictment of the sort of bourgeois society Fellini found himself surrounded by as he approached the pinnacle of his success as an internationally-acclaimed director and script writer. The hollow, meaningless, existences of rootless and directionless people who, in reality, have nothing to do and all of the means necessary to accomplish great things, but no will, are the subjects of this series of narratives.The episodes of La Dolce Vita are united by Marcello, our protagonist - brilliantly played by a young Marcello Mastroianni. Marcello is an ambitious, pretentious, journalist, whose good looks and worshipful adoration of beautiful and successful women has allowed him to enter into the vacuous world of the European idle rich. Marcello is also the only unifying theme in the fragmentary primary plots of La Dolce Vita. His highly dependent and heart-breaking relationship with Emma, a woman whose obsessive devotion to him is as touching as it is inexplicable, and his attempts to find some mooring anywhere in the ephemeral and ethereal world of the 'beautiful people' he so desperately wants to be a part of, his equally desperate need for some form of parental figure which is so much a part of his relationship with Steiner and his own father.What is sympathetic about Marcello is certainly not his behavior, which is mostly reprehensible, nor his intellect, which he constantly appears to over-rate, but rather, the fact that he, unlike most of the people surrounding him, appears to be searching for meaning in an inherently meaningless social context. Yet, he -like his bourgeois colleagues - appears entirely incapable of creating it.Fellini creates quite a lot of meaning in this film. Although the film does not employ flashbacks or other standard back-story techniques, we learn about who Marcello really is through his relationships.His relationships with women - a major component of the film - are abysmal. Although he can not see it himself - he despises the adoring Emma because he hates himself and finds her devotion to him appalling. His non-committal relationship with Maddalena - the aging starlet - highlights his chameleon-like nature and well-illustrates the utter vacuousness of both characters. Ironically, in the climactic scene in their relationship, it is revealed that they both suffer from the same drifting, directionless yearnings and might, despite the impossibility for either of them to ever commit, be suited for each other.Even more telling are Marcello's relationships with Steiner, a father-substitute, and his actual father. We meet Marcello's father unexpectedly in Rome, and learn that he is a traveling salesman. Fellini's father was also a traveling salesman, and although I do not believe that Fellini endowed Marcello with a great deal of his own personality (after all Fellini maintained a very stable home life and career throughout his entire adult life), the brief exploration of this father and son is very revealing. Marcello likes, but does not know, his own father. And he very desperately wants to know him. The time Marcello and his father spend together are some of Marcello's happiest, most candid moments. But his father's job complements his wander-lust, and he must move on. Marcello, whose wanderlust mirrors his father's, is left in Rome, even less grounded and in search of paternal guidance. The closest thing Marcello has to a father figure is Steiner, a character who Fellini marks - immediately - as an exotic force.Steiner appears to be an intellectual, and potentially a leader who rises above the mediocrity of those surrounding him. But even Steiner himself candidly expresses his own lack of depth and character, and, ultimately, disqualifies himself in the most dramatic and final way possible.I believe that life and meaning are what people make of them. I do not believe that meaning is 'out there somewhere' waiting to be found. After all, 'meaning' is really just an artifact of human conscious.Is it not? So - for me, La Dolce Vita is more of an indictment and a character-study of modal personalities among the idle rich and bourgeois pretenders than it is a piece of social surrealism. Fellini's characters fail to find meaning because they refuse to dedicate themselves to anything. They fail to achieve passion because meaning never exists for them. And though many of them seek it, meaning does not exist because they are unwilling to create it. Addicted to vacuous, pointless and irrelevant lives, they become whimsical, self-indulgent stereotypes of themselves. And La Dolce Vita is as much a moral epic about the value of free will as it is a biography of a portion of the upper middle class.Highly recommended.",

            "content": "From so many perspectives, this film is a true artistic masterpiece, and happily, a commercial success.  Those vehement in their dislike are simply wrong; their criticism does not hold up.  Fellini and some few others, unlike most critics, completely understood that film derives NOT from the world of plays but from PAINTING.  First time viewers - if the plot seems confusing, should just sit back and enjoy the staggering accomplishments of lighting, cinematography and staging.  And that is leaving out of course, acting, writing directing!Briefly, the film follows seven aimless days and nights in the life of Marcello Rubini, a world weary Roman \"reporter\" who writes for gossip magazines. Yes, it does document the slow self-destruction of an unfulfilled writer, it is really a dire warning that the banality and sheer boredom of the late 20th Century were (are) likely to bore us ALL to death ... and Fellini hit the mark with perfect precision, the world's best bullseye, if you will ...The acting is first rate, Mastroianni is so masterful, that when he uses one or two of his cliches - they stick out like sore thumbs in a towering performance.  (We forgive him for those tiny imperfections!)  Likewise, all the players - from leads to bit roles are brilliant.A film then, not in this world, or really even of it, but an oblique reflection of the coming decade (the movie was shot in 1959) the details of which, Fellini already seemed to know!  Staggeringly hip and modern - well, a Masterpiece!",

            "content": "Rome, 1959/60. Marcello Rubini (played by Marcello Mastroianni) is a writer and journalist, the worst kind of journalist - a tabloid journalist, or paparazzo. His job involves him trying to catch celebrities in compromising or embarrassing situations. He tends to get quite close to his subject, especially when they're beautiful women. Two such subjects are a local heiress, Maddalena (Anouk Aimee), and a Swedish superstar-actress, Sylvia (Anita Ekberg), both of whom he has affairs with. This is despite being engaged to Emma (Yvonne Furneaux), a rather clingy, insecure, nagging, melodramatic woman (this explains his affairs!). Despite his extravagant, pleasure-filled lifestyle, he is wondering if maybe a simpler life wouldn't be better.Explores some interesting themes, but is a bit hit-and-miss. The examination of the intrusiveness and fabrication of the news by the media was good, highlighted by a few powerful scenes (the Virgin Mary kids and the bus stop scenes especially). There is also the idea of longing for a simpler life. However, these themes aren't explored very thoroughly, and there is no profound conclusion to them.The main problem is that the powerful scenes get diluted by some pretty dull, pointless ones. Too much time is spent on random stuff that has no bearing on the plot. Not only does this make the movie unnecessarily longer, but minimises the impact of the more profound sub-plots. Too many powerful scenes followed up by meaningless scenes.On the plus side, there's Anita Ekberg. She is stunningly beautiful and provides the movie's iconic moment - the fountain scene. Her role did not require much acting talent but she makes up for this by having great...presence. Unfortunately, she only appears for about 1/6th of the movie. Once she is out of the picture, the energy level of the movie reduces significantly.Interesting to note that the supporting cast includes Nico, later of The Velvet Underground and Nico fame. She appears as herself, sort of.",

            "content": "This movie ruined film for me.For a couple of weeks after seeing \"La Dolce Vita\" at the Bay Theatre in Seal Beach, I tried to avoid seeing movies. Because I deeply enjoy film, however, I was unable to successfully sit out two weeks of viewing, so I saw \"Broken Blossoms\" and \"Trainspotting\". Due to the inexpressionable impression \"La Dolce Vita\" left in my memory, I was disappointed by both films (before you start screaming, \"Trainspotting\" is also in my top twenty of all time). Watching \"La Dolce Vita\" was like eating the greatest meal of my life: nothing tasted quite as good afterward.This film engaged me at all possible levels. It was intellectually stimulating, with endless symbols and philosophical content. Marcello descends into a fantasy world every night, only to ascend to the harsh light of reality in the morning, over and over again. Women, religion, family, work, nothing offers real satisfaction, but only a temporary escape from the dull routine of life. Whether it is Steiner or his fianc\u00e9, Marcello ultimately finds that nothing is what it appears and that, when dawn breaks, he is back where he began, searching vainly for meaning until he is left with a life of debauchery devoid of hope, an unidentifiable monster of nature, unable to even comprehend hope or innocence.It was also technically stunning. Many of the shots are among the most gorgeous ever committed to celluloid. Of course, the scene in the fountain with the beautiful movie star stands out, but so do many others: the ascent in the tower to overlook Rome, the aristocratic party in the old mansion. The acting is flawless, from Marcello down to the smallest bit part.It was also entertaining. In spite of the heaviness of the philosophical material, Fellini successfully injected a surprising amount of humor. I found myself, and the audience around me, laughing out loud on a number of occasions. Anyone who isn't completely charmed by the night-time dance scene with the movie star is more jaded that Marcello at the end of the film. I found myself with a giant, irrepressible grin on my face at the conclusion of that scene, and realized that I, like Marcello, had been seduced by the beauty and joy of the moment.This movie is perfect. People have criticized it for meandering about for three hours, but this is precisely the point. We are following Marcello, who is meandering through life, looking for something that he cannot find. At the end, he is left with a life as inexplicable and unattractive as the strange sea monster on the beach, and we are left with startling memories of an unforgettable film.",

            "review_title": "Great film",
            "content": "La Dolce Vita (The Sweet Life), as ironic a title as has ever been used in motion picture history, Federico Fellini's 1960 film commentary on modern hedonism and anomy, and filmed in 1959 in Rome, may just be the best film in his canon, for it combines the Neo-Realism of earlier classics like La Strada and Nights Of Cabiria, while admixing some of the surreal touches of his later classics. Plus, it is the best written and most ambitious of his films. In many ways, its lead star, Marcello Mastroianni, would play a similar version of this film's lead character, gossip journalist Marcello Rubini, in Michelangelo Antonioni's La Notte (The Night), which followed the travails of a marriage over a single night. While this film does not follow a marriage, it does follow Marcello's personal travails over the course of a week full of nights and early mornings- although not necessarily in that order. Otherwise it may have been better titled La Settimana (The Week), or La Vuoto Vita (The Empty Life).This film is often coupled with its immediate successor film, 8\u00bd, and usually compared to negatively by most critics. It's the superior film, however, because, despite being even a bit longer, at just about five minutes short of three full hours, there is not any of the fat that could be trimmed from 8\u00bd. The later film is also a more personalized Fellini romp, and while some scenes may have biographical import to Fellini and film scholars, they do not work in service to the narrative within that film. La Dolce Vita, however, has no such fat, and, indeed, could have gone on a bit longer without feeling the least bit tedious, for Fellini employs the same picaresque narrative techniques he did in earlier films. In essence, instead of one long nearly three hour film the viewer is watching a series of seven or so twenty to thirty minute long short films with just one recurring character.This also allows for a good reason to justify why Marcello's character does not grow internally. He is the eternal troubadour, a modern emotionless Odysseus, flouncing about from one meaningless encounter to the next. That does not mean there are not moments of true depth and insight, and critics who have accused the film of being void of any deeper psychology are just plain wrong. Because someone is shallow does not mean that there is no reason beneath that fa\u00e7ade, it just means there's not much beneath the fa\u00e7ade- and that can be explained if one really pays attention to the film. In the film's commentary, critic Richard Schickel notes that film critic Alfred Bazin claimed that all of the characters in the film are simply behaviorist paradigms, without any internal motivations. Yet, we see far too many scenes that contradict this stance- one senses motivated by politics rather than art, and because one simply cannot delink one from the other. Behavior is caused by motivation, and scenes we see of Marcello with other minor characters- Maddalena, Emma, Sylvia, Paparazzo, his father, Steiner, Paola- clearly sketch in much of the man's background before the film starts\u0085. The film's screenplay, written by Fellini with Ennio Flaiano, is impressive, not just for its written brilliance, but for the boundaries it pushed open for film as an art form. Nino Rota, as usual, provides a superb musical score. Perhaps only the Alfred Hitchcock and Bernard Herrmann pairing equals the contributions of Fellini and Rota in creating memorable film scores. The art direction by Piero Gherardi, and cinematography by Otello Martelli, are all top notch, as well. The acting is first rate. Marcello Mastroianni went from a second tier Italian film star to an international sensation on the heels of his performance, and Anita Ekberg became one of the top pinup girls of the 1960s. Granted, her acting is not much, but the other females in the film are top notch, and all the supporting cast do well- especially Alain Cluny as Steiner and Annibale Ninchi as Marcello's father. Thankfully, the film's original producer, Dino de Laurentiis, didn't get his way and force Paul Newman into the lead role, for Mastroianni has a facile quality that the steely glare of Newman could never convey\u0085.Some believe that the seven days and nights of the film correspond to the seven hills of Rome or the Seven Deadly Sins. That is not really of import, for great art is never so easily and simply parsed. Whatever the reality is, the fact is that there's never been a better film about the anomy of the human condition- and it's not just modernity under scrutiny, for clearly Fellini shows that the pilgrims at the Madonna sighting, are as lost as any of the modern glitterati, thus implying it is endemic to the human condition, and reflected in the very picaresque structure of the film. La Dolce Vita is one of the great works of art by one of the greatest artists of the last century, and in that statement, there's not a hint of irony.",

The movie tells several different stories about an Italian paparrazzo journalist (played brilliantly by Marcello Mastroianni) living Rome which reminds me of Kurosawa's Rashomon (1950) because it was a story story told from different perspectives sort of unlike the plot to this movie. One thing i find coincidental about the characters is the first name of Mastroianni's character which is the same exact name. The movie also stars Anita Ekberg as an American actress named Sylvia who is about to work on a movie shot in Italy that is based on true events. There are many things I do love about this movie which include the romantic and dramatic scenes, I also love the characters, the cinematography, the music, the acting, and last but not least Fellini's direction for the film. But however there is one thing I don't get about the making of this movie and that was the purpose of making this picture, but all i know why Fellini made movies is the same reason all directors make movies is to show that movies have a big meaning in our lives without even thinking about it.",

That was not the case here.Here, overall, the film manages to evoke a certain \"magical\" feeling over the viewer. However, the fact that it has no plot and wanders for nearly three hours overpowers its good sides and make me bored to watch it. I was loving it in the first 45 minutes, them I started to get bored. Yes, I like films with plots, I mean, even Apocalypse Now has a plot indeed. And it also is a film that has color and many very powerful scenes. I think cinematography is important, think Barry Lyndon and Fanny and Alexander. Which is something I think a great film needs: The best visual arts uses color. I don't see a reason why an art film should be black and white. I mean, color is cool, right? See the later Kurosawa films.So, overall, I would say I was mostly bored by it.Edit: Having seem 8 1/2, I might say that I was much more impressed by that film than this one.

            "content": "When I finished watching this film the main thing I felt was frustration - I think my conclusion is that there are lots of good elements but they aren't well combined.The opening is promising - the premise is interesting and the striking images and soundtrack impress a character. But then, nothing, the film's stillborn, this frustrating episodic structure means that the initial impetus has dissipated well before the 3 hours are up.There are lots of things I like about each of the episodes individually - more than just decadence I think there's a tangible menace in the party scenes. The behaviour of the adults is creepily childish (underlined beautifully by the emphatic, infantile sounds of Italian). People are talking all the time, clamouring to be heard, but no one bothers to listen. There's a lot of laughter in those scenes but none of it is shared, there's no compassion, it is the characters' response to the absurd situation they're in - it's a laughter that's hysterical, deranged. I don't think Fellini is being at all subtle about Marcello being in hell - the only way he could make it more obvious would be for the walls to turn to flames. I don't agree with what some reviews said about the viewer too being seduced by the Sweet Life - I was alienated, if not repelled by it from the outset.My criticisms of the film are twofold. Firstly, if this is the point - that pure materialism is corrosive and cancerous and draws everyone into a hellish solitude - then I don't think the film as a whole communicates it too well. The episodes are not well enough linked - Marcello's hardly marked out as a enough of a \"good guy\" at the start to be corrupted, and it's only in the last couple of scenes - where we reach true psychosis - that there's a clear downward trajectory. For the rest of the film the plot's too ponderous and I think Fellini tries to throw in far too many side elements in each of the episodes. So in spite of the great direction, the style, the unmistakable soundtrack, the film is without a centre - there's neither a defining moment nor a clear purpose. It's like, if this film were a newspaper article there'd be no headline.My second criticism is that apart from not making its point terribly well, the point of the film isn't a revelation, it's just not that interesting. So pure materialism is corrosive and rich people can have horrible lives. Well who hasn't realised that yet? Classics are supposed to resonate through the ages - offer an insight that may cease to be new but never ceases to be profound. But the scope of this film is so limited. It seems to me just a belated, panicky, typically Latin response to capitalism - stimulated no doubt by the contact the director had had with the scene he's describing where American style capitalism at its most debauched was imported wholesale into Italy. The film describes this - it doesn't look beyond it at all. Oh, rich film stars committing suicide - yesterday's news. Other people back in the 1960s were foreseeing the voyeurism, the state we've got to now where celebrities are created for the very purpose of being destroyed for public amusement.And at times this is no more than Catholic moralism. Look at who populates Fellini's realm of the damned - divorc\u00e9es and homosexuals - the regressive and hysterical moralistic streak in this film detracts greatly from it when viewed today.A classic should be prescient and profound. This film doesn't really offer any sort of commentary - it's just a portrait of an obviously decadent portion of Italian society in the 1950s, and it's very much of its time.",

The scene where Anita Ekberg and Marcello Mastroianni wade in to the deserted Trevi Fountain, the climb up St. Peter's Dome, the helicopter carrying a statue of Jesus passed the ruins of old aqueduct - these are all wonderful, iconic things.Unfortunately, watching these rich folks zip around in their sports cars and carry on all night was just not appealing to me, especially as this film goes on for so long. To be honest, its plodding pace and meandering story seemed self-indulgent on Fellini's part. I believe the film is making a statement about how shallow these characters are and how the \"sweet life\" (at least the type these folks are living it) is an illusion, but it also seems to revel a bit in all of this shallowness, saying that this is life, enjoy it now. I like Mastroianni and he has such presence, but here his character behaves so badly to women, cheating on them and slapping them around, that he was hard to watch.At its best, the film gives us little moments of philosophical discussion, or the marvelous moment when the old man goes a little too far in his partying and has a health emergency, giving us real depth of emotion. A bit of a stranger to his son because he was never home when he was growing up, feeling like if he doesn't go out it makes him feel his age, but now sitting quietly and facing his own mortality - it's one of the film's best scenes, as we think this may one day be the sad fate of his son.I just didn't think there were enough of these kinds of moments. There is obviously commentary in the scenes of the paparazzi acting like animals to get shots of celebrities, but it seems overplayed and got tiring. Similarly, all the rich people carrying on boorishly in someone's mansion or castle just wasn't interesting to me, and in fact repelling in the film's second half.",

            "content": "From Oscar nominated director Federico Fellini (La Strada, Nights of Cabiria, Juliet of the Spirits, Amarcord), this film featured in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die has one of the most iconic images in cinema history, with the female star, so I was most keen to watch it. Basically this follows the life of Marcello Rubini (Marcello Mastroianni), in the space of a week, a regular journalist taking photographs for newspapers and magazines by day, and indulging in many passions and delights during parties and sexual experiences. Through the week he flirts with visiting American movie star Sylvia (Anita Ekberg), has a few meetings with wealthy beauty and bored socialite Maddalena (Anouk Aim\u00e9e), including an encounter in a prostitute's bedroom, has the shock of \"serious\" writer Steiner (Alain Cuny) killing his own children and himself, and he constantly pays little attention to his girlfriend and fianc\u00e9e Emma (Yvonne Furneaux), who at one point overdoses. The story is told in seven episodes for the seven days of the week, and by the end Marcello has gone almost into his own world of self-loathing and self-disgust with no way of seeing how to get out of it and back home. Also starring Magali No\u00ebl as Fanny, Nadia Gray as Nadia, Lex Barker as Robert, Annibale Ninchi as Marcello's Father, Walter Santesso as Paparazzo, Jacques Sernas as Matin\u00e9e Idol and Valeria Ciangottini as Paola. Mastroianni gives a good leading performance, and many of the supporting cast get their moments, especially of course Ekberg, who creates the iconic image where she, wearing black with long blonde hair, walks through the water and next to the falling water of the Trevi Fountain. To be honest, the fountain sequence was the most significant and eye-catching sequence for me, there were some other interesting moments, but I did not completely understand everything going on, however it is a classic drama to be seen. It won the Oscar for Best Costume Design, and it was nominated for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration and Best Writing, Story and Screenplay - Written Directly for the Screen, and it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Film from any Source.

It is beautifully shot from the forest clearing to the beach. Marcello's spontaneous smile sitting on the beach says a lot and the nonverbal communication exchange over the sound of the agitated sea is beautiful to see.

            "content": "There is so much critical acclaim for La Dolce Vita that I feel the pressure to give this a high rating. Unfortunately, I think this \"Fellini masterpiece\" is severely overrated. While there is much to admire in this film that gave birth to the word \"paparazzi\" from a character named Paparazzo, a news photographer who with a camera in arm scurries here and there like a rat in a maze trying to get a money shot, I feel that it lacks the emotional depth of some of Fellini's great works.La Dolce Vita, which means \"the sweet life\", remains a visually admirable film of an excellent standard, but I was not quite satisfied with the experience. There is not one moment when I cared for the lead character, Marcello Rubini (Marcello Mastroianni), a journalist who dreams of being a serious writer but is sucked into the decadent lifestyle of 1960s Rome, chasing celebrities and seeking aristocratic acceptance. He has a domesticated fianc\u00e9e whom he does not love. Instead, he goes around sleeping with beautiful, high-status women.Running at an epic length of nearly three hours, La Dolce Vita follows Marcello for seven days and nights as he meets various people in all corners of Rome. In the film's most iconic scene, Marcello is seduced by Sylvia (Anita Ekberg), an American celebrity actress, under the stunning backdrop of the Trevi fountain. Fellini, whose many films ooze style and energy, was also a creator of flamboyant images, which when accompanied by the music of one of his most frequent collaborators, Nino Rota, represented some of the most magical moments in Italian cinema.But while La Dolce Vita is certainly a stylish film with quite impressive, and at times panoramic, black-and-white cinematography, it somewhat lacks in terms of energy and drive. Much of the film after the Trevi fountain scene goes a bit downhill and appears lackluster. Thankfully, the film is punctuated by a beautiful yet off-key scene shot away from urban decadence of an innocent country girl interacting with Marcello who is trying to type a novel.The themes of celebrity worship, and the obsession with limelight are recurring threads of thought in Fellini's film. He is clever not to indulge in verbal moralizing via narration or through one of his characters, but instead let the visuals speak for themselves. Two powerful scenes come to mind: One, a scene of a woman being photographed by paparazzi and enjoying the spontaneous limelight oblivious to the fact that something tragic has happened. Another is a peculiar, almost surrealistic sequence of drunken crazymaking that nearly results in an orgy, with the dehumanization of women as sex toys.La Dolce Vita is not always a pleasure to watch. Of course, many would strongly beg to differ. But its long-winded nature does not go down too well with me. What still keeps this \"Fellini masterpiece\" alive as one of the key works of post neo-realist Italian cinema is the seductive allure of Ekberg, and the capturing of a past that seems light years away, yet its themes appear remarkably more relevant now than it was half a century ago. While a second viewing might change my mind about this film, I am not quite tempted to try.GRADE: B- (7/10 or 3 stars)www.filmnomenon.blogspot.comAll rights reserved.",

It doesn't follow a basic plot structure, and is really just a series of events that lead to the memorable ending sequence.There are many memorable scenes throughout \"La dolce vita\". The opening with the Jesus statue attached to a helicopter, the fountain sequence with Anita Ekberg (which is perhaps the most famous), and the ending scene on the beach come to mind as highlights, but they certainly aren't the only memorable scenes in this extraordinary film.Throughout \"La dolce vita\", Fellini satirizes the paparazzi's obsessive nature, taking photographs at everything they see, and the world's overall obsession with gossip and celebrities. While the film manages to portray the sweet life as a very glamorous way of living, it also showcases its dark side in more dramatic moments. It's also very fun to note that the film actually invented the term paparazzi, because of the obsessive character of Paparazzo.\"La dolce vita\" is, at times, very funny, at others nearly heartbreaking, and is always amazingly entertaining.

The story has fabulous moments, others less so, with long dialogues and sometimes too philosophical for the context in which they are said.

            "content": "The way I see this movie is as an ode to everyday's life. It handles eternal themes such as love, death, family and everything in between, without exaggerating or going over-the-top with anything. A random slice of life if you will, told Fellini style.Of course I love Federico Fellini's movies as much as everybody else does, which however also makes me sort of surprised that this movie is by many regarded to be one of his best. I really don't see this movie as such and wasn't as taking and intrigued by it as was the case with some of his other work, from around the same time period.But having said that, it still remains obviously a very enchanting movie, due to the way it all got shot and told. It's a real beautiful looking movie, that is also really well directed, which you'll especially notice when you really start to pay attention to the way it all got told and handled by Federico Fellini. It all got shot with a velvet glove and eye for detail.This of course isn't the first or only movie about random life but what still makes this movie sort of unique is the fact that the movie doesn't really try to provide any answers or solutions, which in itself actually works out as an answer and conclusion itself. It shows that you can't always have things in your own hands and you shouldn't be looking too hard for all of the answers in life, or chances are you'll miss out on some of its beauty. Just live life could be the shortest way to describe the 'meaning' and message of this movie.It also shows that not everything is what it seems to be in life. People we put on a pedestal are really not as great or happy as they look and things like love and hate can often be closer to each other than we would like to think. This not only shows in Marcello's love life but also in the relationship he has with his father for instance.So it's a movie that is heavy and serious on its themes perhaps but at the same time it also remains an happy and charming movie to look at. This is also one of the powers of a Fellini movie I think. No matter how heavy or serious some stuff might get, you'll never finish watching the movie feeling all down or depressed. It's because of the pleasant pacing and the sort of adventurous feeling of the movie but also of course due to it's wonderful looking visuals.I also was really fond of the acting. Kind of hard to believe that Marcello Mastroianni was not considered to be not suitable by the studios for this movie but luckily Fellini pushed his will through. I really can't imaging anybody else playing the main character, since Marcello Mastroianni is so perfect for it. He probably is my most favorite Italian actor of all time as well. Who also really makes an impact in this movie is Anita Ekberg but that has more to do with her looks and appearance in the movie than anything else (she is a former Miss Sweden, this should tell you enough really).Simply a wonderful and delightful movie but I just wouldn't call it Fellini's best to be honest. But this however should tell you more about the quality of some of his other movies than about the quality of this one.8/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

            "content": "Ask any stranger wandering on the street what comes to mind at the mention of Italian maverick Federico Fellini's La Dolce Vita and they will almost inevitably respond (if anything other than a confused stare) will be an image of stunning Anita Eckberg wading through a lavish fountain at night, her black dress trailing behind her as if she is so captivating the very environment itself is bleeding into her. However, the fact that, decades on, such a captivating and multifaceted film is often reduced to a single image in the cultural lexicon can be hardly even considered a disservice, as the film itself revolves around the automatic reaction of the general public being to ravenously seize and devour tiny, superficial details while oblivious to the more resonant 'big picture' unfolding around them. And the fact that the image the film is frequently reduced to yields such staggering beauty, profundity and tantalizing humour in itself can surely be seen as emblematic of the incredible power and whimsical genius of what can surely be considered one of Fellini's masterpieces, just as vibrant and enthralling as ever.Predicated as a satire of the opulent celebrity worshipping and party life of upper class, 1960s Rome, rather than falling prey to the usual satirical pitfall of overstating to the point of cartoonish parody, Fellini's film manages to strike a remarkable middle ground of equal criticism and celebration, sharing protagonist journalist Marcello's love/hate relationship towards the lavish lifestyles he reports on. Eschewing traditional narrative arcs in favour of a three hour series of generally disconnected episodes involving (among others) a pursuit for a famous actress, a suicidal fianc\u00e9, a crowd bustling from one location to the next in the hopes of spotting a spiritual 'Madonna' and an unexpected death amidst a constant slew of parties, wine, women and music, with Nino Rota's spectacular, swinging score constantly twinkling over-top of the mayhem. However, rather than a self-indulgent lack of editing, Fellini's chosen structure and length only serve to enhance the hypnotic beauty and reinforce the fundamental superficiality, perfectly paced and with not a single scene standing out as expendable in the least. In majestic contrast to the vacuous celebrity mingling fuelling the film, Fellini rekindles his usual aesthetic flair to dazzling effect, offering some of the most exquisite shot composition and editing ever to grace celluloid. Nonetheless, the trick to intrinsically understanding the film is to approach it from the perspective of a character study of Marcello, who is incarnated with effortless suave charisma by Marcello Mastroianni. Though seemingly a titan of celebrity and success (and it is fascinating indeed to see a tabloid journalist being heralded alongside the rich and famous he chronicles), Marcello's haunted, overcast eyes articulate a perpetual fuming of incompleteness and self-loathing, the shroud of a man rewarded for selling himself short of his potential. Whether Marcello evolves or deadens throughout the film is up for dispute, yet there lies a particular tragic beauty in watching him, surrounded by the jabbering paparazzi (a concept the film effectively invented), suckling like remora at the whale of trite celebrity, silently struggling to attain any dregs of fulfilment, purpose or meaningful human contact. Two scenes best articulate this: one, when his father visits, only to ignore conversation with his son in favour of flirting with an attractive dancer at a fancy night club, finally leaving early after becoming sick from excessive drinking, deflated and humiliated (Mastroianni's fumbling to connect with his father is devastatingly heartbreaking). The second shows him impulsively propose marriage to a flighty, former girlfriend while Fellini's furtive cameras show her kissing a stranger in the next room as he talks - a shattering sequence which perhaps best epitomizes the film's overarching themes of miscommunication and succumbing to trivial human urges over meaningful contact. To watch the emotionally muted Marcello react to each subsequent piece of heartbreak is truly staggering, and Mastroianni's performance, a masterclass of tasteful subtlety, is truly one for the ages.From playful opening (a helicopter carrying a statue of Christ delayed as Marcello flirts with sunbathing beauties) to unforgettably bizarre ending (a beached sea monster demonstrating the unmistakable grotesqueness of 'real life'), watching Fellini's La Dolce Vita is like being able to attend the most lavish party while still making fun of the other guests: half critical comment, half bawdy embracing of life, while entirely a portrait of a time, place and mindset fuelled with a kinetic vivaciousness unlike any other. Never has so deep a film been made about so light a central subject. -10/10",

Both were kind of drunken madmen: neither with much discipline, both stone geniuses. The opening has always bothered me: interesting, flashy, but that's all. There is something about carrying Jesus under a chopper that...well that has always somehow not quite been up to the parts of the film that really work: namely the three different soir\u00e9es, parties, near orgies. Each to his own, I suppose. But the last thirty minutes of the film are perhaps the finest thirty minutes in cinema. Only a few half hours of conclusion come to mind to even nearly equal it: Citizen Kane, Touch of Evil, the last fifteen minutes of Naked Spur, the last fifteen of My Darling Clementine; very heady company indeed, though pound for pound the last fifteen of both westerns I think are its equal, but good lord, out of all the movies ever made, La Dolces final moments are as good as a film can get.Anybody looking for any kind of depth to the Mastroianni character will do so in vain. He has none. In that sense he is like Kane: a cheap Rosebud kind of trick for the unannointed to pour their vapid dreams into: look at how his character wanders all over the place: he could almost qualify as a permanent depressive barely in disguise. But don't let that get in the way of taking the movie on its surface level. Those surfaces are just about the best that were ever done. In fact, after La Dolce the real Fellini began to emerge in all his idiocy. Film after film were just wild postcards sent from Surreal City. This film was a cross between the narrative ones of his beginnings and the madnesses of the ones after that, and for that reason, it is the one I can watch, in pieces at least, over and over: not so even with Vittiloni or Il Bidone, the more conventional ones before he really let himself go. And if it took those early constraints and the later wildnesses to coalesce into La Dolce, well, so be it. After all how many truly great films do any film makers ever chalk up. Most, not even one. For me, this is easily his best, and certainly up there with the twenty of thirty greatest ever made by anybody.",

            "review_title": "Steiner, and stress in a rapidly changing Italy",
            "content": "This is a minutely examined film, and part of its attraction is the depth of references and allusions Fellini incorporates; I've seen mentions that many of the scenes were drawn from news stories and reworked, such as the children & madonna scene, Steiner's suicide, and others. The depth extends to other aspects such as camera work and the amazing costuming of the actresses. Just trying to make sense of all these seemingly scattered vignettes and allusions invites all sorts of varied interpretation.I watched and read various reviews and interviews before watching the film -- the criterion disc itself has excellent ones -- including this interview by Studs Terkel soon after the 1960 release with Marcello Mastriani and a few other viewers or ancillary production figures (its on ytube) posing the question 'Why did Steiner kill himself and his kids?', putting it on a level with Citizen Kane's Rosebud mystery; their responses ran from 'he was too spiritual to live in Fellini's world and had to be destroyed', to 'he felt smothered and couldn't live coddled under a cradle-to-grave protective State', to Mastriani's 'he was too weak to reconcile his inner contradictions', to a muttered comment from Fellini that he was 'an angel living among the monkeys'.But replaying the scene a few times, it became stunning clear to me what the real reason was for the tragedy. Steiner is a highly refined intellectual, an accomplished and wealthy Renaissance man, who plays Bach, consults Sanskrit grammar books, opens his home as a salon for international artists; yet he says while watching his children 'a phone call can end it all' and anything is better than living in 'a society where everything's organized and planned for and perfect'. In what society would everything be highly organized, yet where a phone call can bring down a man like Steiner? A totalitarian one.Steiner kills himself and his kids because he lives in a fast-transforming Italian society which a short 15 years before was fascist, and showed signs of that same fascist tribalism rising once again to threaten both himself and his children's future, and he tries to lead Marcello away from 'writing for those semifascist rags'. Steiner is a Jew; in fact, the 'self-hating Jew' so familiar from Hannah Arendt's Origins of Totalitarianism and many pre-war novels. This one idea explains all his unexplainable actions, yet I've seen no hint of this possibility elsewhere so far.A couple scenes later we meet those who might indeed make such a destroying phone call: The decadent remnants of the aristocracy, praising the laying of 'flowers on the tomb of their beloved leader', with a dozen statues of Caesar (familiar as a Mussolini symbol from early scenes in Roma) lining the walls of the set. I find it breathtaking that, on the one hand, Fellini would put such a searing piece of social criticism as the centerpiece and focal point of his film; and on the other, that viewers and even central figures in the production would be ignorant -- perhaps even *willfully ignorant* -- of this social criticism.More interpretive confusion surrounds the 'sea monster' ending; Ebert calls it a Christ symbol, 'ugly but real'. My thinking is it's more akin to the stolid peasant life of wife and kids that his needy fiance wants from him, and which he rejects as boring (Mastriani relates talking to Fellini and his writer pre-production, asking for a script, and being handed a scrawled picture of floating men with massive dongs extending down into the depths to some feminine mermaid or monster -- I don't have the quote handy, it's in his Criterion interview). He also rejects the higher intellectual life from his beckoning good 'Umbrian angel', and we leave him wandering off on further Purgatorial fritterings. Yet even this could be subject to the whims of film-making; I've seen one comment that Fellini left it to Mastriani to decide whether to embrace the intellectual life, but Marcello just didn't want to cross the cold surf inlet that day and blew it off with a wave. Who knows! Shows you the power of editing I guess.",

I'm sorry, but the Emperor has no clothes. First of all, just because you hate this film doesn't mean that you only like vapid commercial studio films like Coyote Ugly. I've watched almost every movie under the sun from silent films, Bollywood musicals, little Independents at Cannes not released to the general public to a wide array of foreign films. Quite frankly, to even say this film is better than Coyote Ugly is an insult to Coyote Ugly and I thought Coyote Ugly was pure crap. Fellini takes 3 hours to tell a story that could have been told in 10 minutes. Gone With the Wind, the Godfather, and Titanic were movies that had a reason to be over 3 hours long and in my opinion left us wanting 3 more hours. This is the fourth Fellini film I've seen and it seems to me that Fellini is probably the most self-indulgent film-maker of his generation. He puts on these lavish busy sets in the background that have nothing to do with the plot. It only makes the movie look busy and annoying with irritating musical numbers that are mismatched. Some of the \"highlights\" that Fellini loves to show us: Marcello inexplicably throwing feathers at a woman on all fours, an endless tour through a castle, a bunch of dancing partygoers over a dead jellyfish while Marcello does sign language with a girl\u0085.ugh. Maybe that was shocking 45 years ago, but it seems really outdated today. Worst of all, this movie moves along at a snails pace with no plot whatsoever while subjecting you to smug pseudo-intellectual conversation about nothing. It's pretentious and smug and thinks that it's cooler than it really it is. The movie follows a bunch of boring self-absorbed people speaking in long pretentious dialogue. The type of people you'd want to avoid at a party but are forced to sit through 3 hours with in this piece of garbage. The male lead is wooden and completely uninteresting. The only redeeming quality about this film is the great amount of eye candy interspersed throughout, most notably Anita Ekberg and Paola the young actress in the empty restaurant scene. Honestly, I was so bored by this point it really didn't matter. I was so annoyed after watching this garbage that I had to cleanse myself with a good movie. Let's tell the truth.

To La Dolce Vita's Rome, the only matter is portrait, a shallow dimension you can peer straight through. Its people live in pain, trying to break free from their bodies, but they remain trapped within their porcelain figures. An actress yearns for love, and finds it in a stray kitten. Maddalena yearns for connection, and finds it in an echo chamber, disconnected from the other end. We wonder if Marcello ever found his. Fellini's closing shot is hopeful \u2013 everything before it isn't.Fellini's finger-waggle at Roman culture is soaked in now-termed 'felliniesque' trademarks; an object suspended in the air above, men in love, women in love, and a begrudging world that chews them up and spits them out. In 8\u00bd a visionary struggles to discover his muse, a 'perfect' woman who is ultimately underwhelming. In La Dolce Vita, Marcello's identical epiphany doesn't wait until the conclusion. He encounters the blonde and buxom Sylvia, a ditsy actress who relishes her time in the spotlight, only to follow her through the streets of late-night Rome. She howls in the wilderness, rescues a mewing kitten, and paddles into a fountain in a bout of rebellion. The water flows down the stone carvings, but as Marcello wades after her it runs dry, the still water cementing his hopelessness. Fellini's Rome is spiteful, kicking its fools when they're down. Marcello's eyes only continue to darken as Fellini's cynicism grips ahold.La Dolce Vita seems to celebrate the women who change the world and deplore the men who stand and watch. Actresses stroll from their luxurious private jets as a mob of journalist squabble and brawl like schoolboys on prom night; intellectuals observe an aboriginal singer strum and sing, only for men to fawn over her looks (\"foreign women are far superior,\" one announces before his wife); just as an army of spectators and journalists blindly gather around two children who claim to see the virgin Madonna. Many are skeptical, but one woman offers her wisdom: \"People find God wherever they look.\" Marcello's intellectual friend, Steiner, shares Fellini's insight. His son can accept the beauty of what is already there \u2014 he can observe a flower and laugh, for it is beautiful \u2014 but his daughter is captivated by invention, coining poetic phrases like \"Who is the mother of the sun?\" Rome's men are captivated by beauty, but oblivious to what lays behind.Marcello Mastroianni is a worldly actor whose figure is a canvass of emotion. He needn't open his mouth, lest it pile upon the magnitudes of emotion already plastered over his exterior. His smiles are lopsided and faulted, cold and cynical, grappled by the obligations of love and the heartless venom of his Rome. His romance struggles between the wealthy seductress Maddalena and the long love of his destructive lover at home, leaving him exhausted and trapped between the realms of loneliness. The Roman worlds are of tired love and plastic people, and the two can't resist headbutting each other into submission.It's Fellini's descent from neorealism which cements his confounding and disorganized world as an exquisite mass in the story, the essential planetoid whose gravity pulls everything inwards. La Dolce Vita is widely considered a hallmark in sharpened satire, a dagger piercing the heart of Roman 'caf\u00e9 society'. It is said Fellini was spat on, berated, and called communist and atheist outside of his theatre showings. Biting satire is a curveball which strikes once its audience is whipped into submission \u2013 it seems his audiences were wholly convinced by his cautionary tale, and no curveball could nudge them over its edge. Marcello's life may appear amicable and, to some, desirable, but the dark clouds beneath his eyes indicate otherwise. His life feels faulted and satanic, and Fellini's tale reminds me of a lecture from a protective parent so their teenage kid doesn't sneak out at night.The film begins with a statue of Christ above Rome, and ends with a leviathan being wrestled onto the seashore. La Dolce Vita confounds beauty with the snarl of a beast, mocking its existence with theatrics and showmanship. Fellini revisits his trademark obsession with the circus, but it is overshadowed by relentless melancholy \u2013 a lone performer trumpets solemnly, only to march out, the balloons on the ground following through the door. A fellow performer sheds a tear to his performance, just as we, the audience, should for Marcello. We're the performers that share his stage.La Dolce Vita gave birth to the term 'paparazzi', a contortion of celebrity photographer Papparazzo, who spends his days and nights stalking the upper-class men and women of Roman society, be it celebrity or royalty. But beyond etymology, La Dolce Vita has given us something more. In his era of Italian film, Fellini's audio is almost all post-production. It's a near-flawless conversion, but sometimes a word is spoken while a mouth is closed, or vice-versa. It's easy to collapse into Marcello's world, to live in it and to breathe its air, but only the minor details tore me out. La Dolce Vita doesn't ignore the small print, no, but suggests you draw back its veil and tear off the mask. It urges you to see through its facade. Of course, it's all a fantasy, mere images on a screen, but it's more: it's a film about men, about women, about the capitalist and the communist, about the saint and about the whore. Fellini captured a moment, and in it, all is laid bare.",

A journalist (Marcello Mastroianni) mixes in Rome's high society in 1960, and is alternately bewitched and sickened by the excess he sees.La Dolce Vita is an episodic satirical melodrama that was a ground-breaking film for Italian cinema, a critical favourite roundly condemned by the Vatican. It depicted a country arising from post-war humiliations, fascism, and poverty - and embracing new, materialistic, hedonistic valves that flew counter to the church's teachings. It has some astonishing set-pieces, most notably Anita Ekberg splashing alluringly in the Trevi fountain. Most significantly, it hints at a template for celebrity worship that holds good half a century later; this, remember, was the film that coined the word 'paparazzi.'

The story reveals a side of \"the sweet life\" that is often untold and unnoticed. It serves to remind us what is truly important, and to break up common illusions and misconceptions about the life of glamour. The final scene, in which the healthy young girl and Marcello, with his entourage of misguided celebrities, cannot communicate illustrates the distinction between the two and their value systems. The glamorous life is not the only thing about which Fellini reveals misconceptions: common understandings of love and religion are also shown to be ineffective and harmful. The scene of the planned \"miracle\" is one such instance that shows religious superficial and superstitious practices. In one instance, we are shown a group of the faithful ripping apart a sapling tree just because the Madonna was alleged to have appeared in its proximity. This story exemplifies many facets of humanity that are universal and timeless. The way the elements of style are used serves to increase the worth of the film and intensify the force with which its cultural value is presented. Many of the elements are used with such subtlety that we scarcely understand why we are feeling the way we do until the film is over and we have analyzed it. The dialogue is well-written and telling; however, the other elements of film style contribute as much to our sense of what the film means, if not more. The lighting, editing and sound present to us the aura of the film; alienation, loneliness, boredom, self-centeredness and misery.",

            "content": "I'd been out of school for two years when this film was released in Australia. The only reason I heard about was because of all the fuss from the very conservative press and pulpits, at that time. In fact, I think the film was severely restricted in where it could be shown; and, as I recall, many called for an outright ban. As things turned out, I couldn't make the time available to see it.Years passed, and I finally got to see this one when it arrived on DVD a few years back. And, just last week, I had another viewing, to refresh my memory.First, if you like Italian cinema, you'd find it difficult to dislike this narrative and film. But even if you do dislike it, it would be even more difficult to deny Fellini's genius for producing socially appealing and philosophically introspective masterworks.Beginning with the title \u2013 The Sweet Life \u2013 Fellini strips away, with heavy irony, all that is false and inconsistent about the human condition. This is an episodic narrative, in roughly nine scenarios, all designed to show the vacuity, hypocrisy and blatant dishonesty of our so-called civilization. The fact that the story is set in Italy is irrelevant; this is for everybody in any \"civilized\" city of the world.Is this anything new, anything you don't already know? Probably not. Because this story is simply a week or two from the life from a man, Marcello Rubini (Mastroianni), a tabloid journalist who's trying to find his place in an increasingly unpleasant world. We're not all journalists, but we've all been there, I think. And that's why this movie has such an appeal and why it's as relevant today, as it was in 1960.I won't go into the plot \u2013 the actual sequence of events in this story; that's for you to discover when you see it, or to refresh your own memory. What I'd like to do is comment on some of the more compelling metaphors, symbols and other narrative tricks Fellini used.One of the most striking scenes \u2013 and one that is often shown in film clips and in other contexts \u2013 is that of Sylvia (Anita Ekberg) at a party in her honour, as she dances with various people, including an actor (in the story) who's dressed up to look vaguely like a satyr. Now, it was George Bernard Shaw who said that dancing is the vertical expression of a horizontal desire. In this sequence, however, Fellini turns it on its head, literally, when the actor-satyr stands on his hands and lets Sylvia continue to dance in a suggestive fashion thus conjuring up the image of sixty-nine. Little wonder that there was much fulmination from self-righteous pulpits.Shortly after, Marcello and Sylvia scarper off in his Triumph TR2A (I think) sports car to finally end up near one of Rome's most famous fountains \u2013 the Fontana di Trevi \u2013 where Sylvia decides to take a swim, or shower, depending on your point of view. She invites Marcello to join her in her harmless frivolity, and as he approaches he murmurs words like, \"I see how wrong we all are; love is the answer.\" And, as he joins Sylvia, knee deep, she takes a handful from the surface and sprinkles it over his head, in a symbolic rebirth and baptism. Oh, my, more fulmination from certain quarters again, no doubt.Perhaps the most devastating of Fellini's indictments is the media circus that results from the supposed appearance of the Madonna at a certain tree on the outskirts of the city and where Fellini's satire spares nobody, reviling them all: the media for its crassness, the crowds for their greed, the church for its tacit complicity in the deceit and conceit. The final scene of the crowd tearing the \"sacred\" tree to pieces for souvenirs must rank as one of the best of its type on film. And, when the crowds are going or gone, only a lone woman \u2013 ignored, unseen - struggles to pray for her daughter's life nearby...Through all of this journey, Marcello learns much about what motivates him but fails in the one thing that should: like many men, he can't make any firm commitment to any of the women in his life. Of particular note is the long-suffering Emma (Yvonne Furneaux), Marcello's devoted girl friend who pines for marriage with him. Mention must also be made of the blonde and very attractive young waitress at the seaside caf\u00e9 where Marcello tries to rejuvenate his writing. Which makes the final scene all the more poignant...Produced in stark black and white and with a contemporary score of popular tunes, this is cinema at its best, with a cast that is about as perfect as you can get. Even Lex Barker's short appearance made the scene right as Sylvia's aggrieved husband, Robert.Oh, yeah: and this is the film that gave the bad name to publicity photographers and gave the world the term 'paparazzi' from the character Paparazzo (Walter Santesso).Finally, this is one of the very few films that, for me, rates a ten.",

            "content": "In many ways, this has to be regarded as the defining film of its era. It presaged a new style of cinema. It had a fluid, dreamy, symbolic visual and narrative form, and its resonance stems from its visual set pieces and overall ambience. It is also a fascinating exploration of the lifestyles and attitudes of an incipient, flash, indulgent and directionless generation.The film is mainly remembered for the iconic scene of Anita Ekberg ebulliently splashing her way into the centre of the Trevi Fountain, followed by an adoring Marcello Mastroianni. The scene is emblematic of the film in the sense that it represents characters who wish to break free from the constraints of previous generations but their efforts, while perhaps on the surface appearing daring and romantic, often lead to nowhere. There's a sense of searching but not finding: breaking free of one set of constraints only in order to meet another. Marcello, the film's protagonist and perhaps a representation of the director himself, wants to be free of his wife and he doesn't want to sell himself to the capitalist system, but what else is there to provide meaning to his life? He is failing as an artist and his romantic conquests seem empty and unfulfilling. He yearns for a time when life was more clearly defined and yet he loathes the responsibility and entrapment that that definition would impose. And so he drifts from party to party, a little less energetic, a little more cynical on each occasion.La Dolce Vita shows us the new hedonism and society's burgeoning obsession with celebrity. It is responsible for the word \"paparazzi\", which came from the name of one of the supporting characters, and it features a very young Nico, who would go on to achieve fame with one of the defining bands of the '60s. The film is a bold and brilliant exploration of life as it was lived by the upper-classes and the emerging chattering classes of the time. It's an enthralling experience which is both sweet and sombre.",

Maybe something got lost in the translation, maybe I'm low-brow and uncouth, maybe I expect too much.

            "content": "(I've only sat through this film once so this is based purely on the subjectivity of my experience as a first time viewer.) This film seems to me to be clearly about the moral decay of the \"respectable\" people of society; intellectuals, journalists, writers, musicians, actors, nobility, etc. Although these people live a lifestyle far out of reach for most, one can see how this moral decay has filtered down to the more \"common\" people. Look at the \"Papa\" episode. Where does Papa wish to go while visiting his son? Well, to the Cha Cha, to watch the loose ladies dance. He even attempts, it seems, to woo one of the dancers and have an affair with her, all in front of his own son! One of the more telling lines in the movie is near the end when the cross-dressing \"boy\" comments on the recent \"coming-out\" trend in Italy, \"More retire and more come out. If two retire, ten appear. By 1965, it will be total perversion. You see, it will be disgusting.\" This may be seen as a disservice to homosexuals, accusing them of moral depravity but I think in the context of the film homosexuality is seen as deprave because it is done by men who were formally straight. Heterosexuals turning gay and going against their nature because of the moral decay of society. (Note: The women in this scene are walking away from the camera before these lines are said.) That brings me to another point.The moral decay of this film seems to be intertwined with male/female relations. Our protagonist is unable to be with just one woman. The glitz and glamour, the temptations and pleasures, are all too much for him to pass up and since \"all is permitted\", it seems, that all must be tried. The scene in the car between our protagonist and his girlfriend where he says to her that she is suffocating him with \"maternal love\" is telling by the fact that he has rejected this unconditional love she offers him for \"love\" based on momentary passions.In the end our protagonist is damned. Damned to live this life of depravity, unable to turn away from it now that he is fully in the clutches of these pleasure principles. Even in the last moment with the face of the beautiful young girl that our protagonist earlier called \"an angel\" smiles out at us, the viewer, with pure, innocent beauty. Sadly, our protagonist is unable to communicate with her anymore. He has joined the mob and through his sins has painted himself into a corner. His rejection, and more largely, his segment of society's rejection of morality, and essentially, the family (the protagonist rejects marriage with his steady girlfriend; there are many affairs and mentions of divorce) has made these \"thinkers and doers\" a purposeless people and even with their outrageous parties and social \"experiments\" they wind up with a void that they can only attempt to distract themselves from.In the end this society becomes like the bloated, dead monster that washes up on the shore in the final scence, horrible to behold but difficult to turn away from.(Note: Rock and Roll is seen as the music of Satan in the dance sequence with the American actress; English speakers in the movie seem to be a part of this decaying world, almost seemingly ushering it in, perhaps that is why so many people seem to dislike the film; it can be seen as attacking American \"culture\", or more precisely, an attack on Hollywood.)",

Rarely do you see a film that can remain on serious terms and have fun at the same time. I said above that the film \"scopes a week\". Well, while most films that \"scope\" cover years and years, Fellini manages to create so many situations, introduce so many people, and address so many issues in the one week of La Dolce Vita that one would have to agree that it does indeed scope the life of this reporter. I won't dive into all of the symbolism here, because that's no fun to read about. However, I will say that my favorite scenes include the famous fountain scene and the situation when Anouk Aimee is speaking to Marcello from the room above through a hole in the basin, and as she is telling him how much she loves him, she begins kissing a passing partier.

To me, his worst film is Otto e Mezzo and as for La Dolce Vita, it is not one of his bests. The problem of Otto e Mezzo is that there was neither art, nor entertainment which make cinema. A movie does not have to have a solid story, but it should be dramatic. If it is not, is should be artistic. Luckily, La Dolce Vita is not like Otto e Mezzo, much more better than it, but still not dramatic, not impressive and visually well, but not beautiful. Some Fellini movies are similar each other and as I know, in an interview, he said the same thing. For example, some characters, characters's reactions, the way of story telling, frequent (sometimes excessive) conversations. La Dolce Vita has these characteristics, but interesting. The scene which Sylvia dances, the scenes after her performance, the scene which Sylvia and Marcello stroll in the street, it was still and reposeful and the scene which Marcello and his rou\u00e9 father go to a restaurant (the father character is very realistic) were unforgettable, but the rest of the film is not interesting and unforgettable. By the way, some people love La Dolce Vita so that it criticizes media, the bourgeoisie and catholic church. I won't say that no it does not, it might be true and this can be a reason for some people to give the movie 10 out of 10. However, I am not one of them and I will write two dated sayings. Firstly, La Dolce Vita is not a 'sweet' movie. Secondly, art is for art's sake.",

I was in high school when it was first released in the U.S. as a \"roadshow\" item at the Henry Miller's Theater in New York -- then a \"legit\" house that featured only live plays and musicals. It was clear from the very beginning (the arrival of the statue of Christ by helicopter) that \"La Dolce Vita\" was a film unlike any other. It ended neo-realism, made Fellini a star -- and made film directors as a class stars, not just \"names\" like Hitchcock and DeMille. It's vision of a world run by publicity and \"scandal\" is more timely today than ever. And it's as hard-edged as any of the films to which it should be appropriately compared: \"His Girl Friday,\" \"The Half-Naked Truth,\" \"Ace in the Hole,\" and \"Sweet Smell of Success.\" There are so many memorable scenes it's hard to pick and choose, but my favorite is the Bassano di Sutri sequence with Nico among the aristocrats.

The film identified and criticized a new world of media-created celebrity, a corrupt international culture where journalists, plutocrats, aristocrats, show-biz folk, filmmakers, and politicians meet and merge.  It is a world that has banished or been deserted by God, a place where all values have been abandoned, all personal relations severed, and the goal of life reduced to the fulfillment of desire.  As several references to Dante confirm, it is a form of hell, and it consumes Marcello, its observer and participant.  A good deal of the film's appeal, as with all late Fellini, is in the way it relishes that which it condemns.  Fellini found in the minor Italian movie star Mastroianni his cinematic alter ego who was to feature thus in a succession of films (most notably \"8 1/2\") and would become one of European cinema's most prolific stars.  When Fellini re-created the neon-lit, traffic-choked Via Veneto at Cinecitta, he brought the movies back from the streets and into the studio, challenging the polarization of reality and artifice. His film has a vibrancy and sadness that keeps it alive.",

            "content": "I must admit, I've had my reservations about this film for a very long time. First, I've been aware for a while that La Dolce Vita doesn't have typical story structure. Not altogether a bad thing but whenever that's the case, the film ends up being polarizing; I either love it or hate it and Fellini has not had a good track record with me I'm sorry to say. Thus far I have seen La Strada (1954) which I loved, Satyricon (1969) which I loathed, 8 1/2 (1963) which I found supremely overrated and Nights of Cabiria (1957) which was so-so. If La Dolce Vita was going to impress it needed to gear towards Fellini's neo-realist tenancies and less towards his vulgar costume filled meta-art.Yea, not so much. I appreciate the material and what it attempted to do (namely make an incitement of flaccid modern bourgeois culture) but each episodic scene became less and less convincing. The movie follows a passive paparazzo who woos his fair share of women while covering a series of subjects and attending multiple parties. The translation of the title means \"the good life\" probably mocking the mistaken notion that this guy has it all.While doing some research on the production of La Dolce Vita, I came across a common interpretation of the events in the film. Seven vignettes to represent the seven deadly sins or seven sacraments punctuated by a prelude and an epilogue. I'm not sure about this interpretation and neither was Ebert when he reviewed it in 1997; saying that breaking it down that way would treat the film like a crossword puzzle.Nearly every scene involves basically the same sin only with an increasingly unhappy protagonist passively waltzing in and out of drama. The tone is all over the place, the symbolism is at times prominent yet unclear and with no one to really root for the movie listlessly meanders along until it listlessly ends. For my money Vittorio De Sica is my personal pick for best Italian director. Even his derivative Sophia Loren sex comedies have higher entertainment value than La Dolce Vita. But hey, if Fellini's your brand of tea then bully for you.",

            "review_title": "Noise of helicopter vs voice of nature, life of sweet pleasures vs life of genuine joys",
            "content": "When people hear of Federico Fellini's films today, their thoughts go to the director's Oscar winners among which there is LA DOLCE VITA - partly an autobiographical movie about the people Fellini met in the two previous years (1957-1959), partly a sequel to one of his earliest movies, I VITELLONI (1953). No matter what lies behind the production, LA DOLCE VITA is one of the most unforgettable films one may see in a lifetime. Unforgettable but not the best...I ask you for a bit friendly attitude towards my analysis...The movie begins and ends with a very odd communication: people try to say something to themselves but cannot do that because their messages are mute. Yes, two lifestyles, two worlds cannot communicate: luxury vs simplicity, decadence vs decency, noise vs silence. There are not many movies where we get such an \"honest eye's\" idea of social and individual psychology. Fellini entails almost all major human struggles here: desire of love, friendship, dilemmas to cope with illusions. Here, we find the very fundamental idea of what it means to live in a society absorbed by noisy sensations, idolatry, class differences, fanatical religion.That is accurately executed through the characters Fellini generously allows us to study. Marcello (\"older Moraldo from I VITELLONI\") no longer lives in a small town but leads the full life in the very center of the country, Rome. There, as a photo reporter, he meets all kinds of VIPs and is really acquainted with the luxurious life of Via Veneto. Day by day, he gets more addicted to the magical world of hollow splendor and gets sunk in the \"Dolce Vita\" - \"sweet life\" no longer understanding the viewpoints of those who reject it. And who are those who dare reject such a \"profitable\" life chance? Emma, Marcello's girlfriend, who has a totally different idea of a relationship. Being a mistress and a \"mother\", she wants to be equally good in bed as in the kitchen. Her naiveness makes her think Marcello loves her entirely but the moments of disillusion bring her to despair. They stay together because...perhaps, they have to. Another character is Steiner, a symbol of Fellini's movie, a wealthy stylish man, very learned whose melancholy puts Marcello to confusion. Although his wife, Iris, considers him \"as primitive as a Gothic tower,\" he lives the inner life drowning into the classical tunes of Bach's \"Toccata and Fugue in D Minor\" and perceiving silence as \"a spot that hides hell.\" Finally, a total stranger to \"Dolce Vita\" is a simple girl who lives in Umbria, near Perugia (supposedly Assisi) whose blissful smile and pure beauty seem angelic and unavailable to Marcello.Who surrounds Marcello? Starlet Sylvia, an actress, who is bored with life and male idols galore, who takes a bath in Fontanna Di Trevi, for whom men are \"d*** bears with long nails\" and whose sole aim in life is to \"love, love and love.\" Also, his friends are the group of aristocratic decadent people with papal ancestry who own castles and organize orgies and spiritualist meetings there (consider similarity to Fellini's 1965 movie GIULIETTA DEGLI SPIRITI). Finally, it is coldly beautiful and elegant Maddalena whose style and wealth attract Marcello.But the character development wouldn't be so profound without the marvelous performance. All cast do outstanding jobs from Anita Ekberg as dolly sweet sex bomb Sylvia (consider her moment on the steps in St Peter's Basilica, for instance), through Anouk Aimee as Maddalena, Yvonne Furneaux as Emma, Alain Cuny as Steiner (consider the moment he plays the organ in church) to great Marcello Mastroianni. Mastroianni really rocks. Except for them, worth attention occurs to be Annibale Ninchi as Marcello's father with an exceptional performance as an elderly guy still so much after women and parties.There was, however, a time when LA DOLCE VITA was considered blasphemous and demoralizing. This was caused by two factors: openly immoral scenes of orgies perceived as \"promoting decadence\" and a very critical view of religion. Although the former aspect seems pretty exaggerated at least from today's point of view, the latter one still shocks. Fellini depicts a sensational event: Virgin Mary appears to two kids above a miraculous tree supposedly in March next year: crowds gather, communists arrest the children and set them free under pressure, photo reporters come to report a miracle, heavy rain and panic send people away but there is one victim of fanatical crowd at whose funeral the priest only says \"R.I.P.\" Controversial as it is, it may also be perceived as the criticism of not so much religion as a whole but using religion by means of sensational media. No matter what prompted Fellini to entail this controversial sequence, I think he shouldn't have done that. As a Catholic, I felt pretty uncomfortable about it and I am sure many Christians around the world would agree with me. By showing Christ's figure at the beginning of the movie and transferring us to the oriental dance, Fellini asks a rhetorical question \"Is the Eternal City really ruled by Christ?\" All things considered, there would still be much to discuss if not the word limit. LA DOLCE VITA is an important film, indeed; a movie of high class. It makes us realize what world we live in. The symbolic fish on the shore appears to represent what comes out from within. Do we all have something from Marcello? Do we lock our senses towards the pure? Is it too late to stand before the voice of innocence and communicate with it?",

            "content": "Fellini's masterpiece is not a meditation on the meaning of life, but rather it shows the lack of meaning in life for those who find themselves adrift in the modern world. The film itself seems to be adrift as we see the world through the eyes of Marcello, a tabloid writer who again and again experiences the night life in Rome among fading aristocrats and B movie- stars. He womanizes, he drinks, and at times expresses some vague ambition and flashes of genuine artistry and humanity. But mostly he floats from one episode to the next, and the viewer floats along with him.The highly episodic nature of the narrative serves to create a feeling of realism, and indeed it feels real to those who have ever had the experience of treading water in their lives, of waking up every morning without a sense of purpose. As the film travels with Marcello through wild nights that seem to fizzle into dawns it seems to pose a set of existential questions.Marcello's world is not black and white. His world is neither sacred nor profane, but rather it is mundane. Mundane despite the fact that his life of excess partying and seduction is what many in the modern world seem to crave above all else. Marcello is not a hero, he is the everyman and his is the human condition. He doesn't choose the life he lives, he simply lives. He is in a sense unaware of himself and unaware of the larger world. He is even unaware of what he truly wants and he doesn't know how to feel alive. The crushing final scene shows that he is so unaware that he no longer even recognizes true beauty and innocence when it is right in front of him, beckoning him to wake up.",

La Dolce Vita- Italy 1960This is the 8th movie on the list.Maybe, I know I keep saying it, but maybe I am just that really Americanized boy who can't appreciate the beauty of this movie. And trust me, I do see beauty in the movie. First with the extremely unusual story. Well maybe not that \"extreme\" but the story. I just saw no plots. I see that there is something like 7 or 8 subplots and little stories that take place in the life of out main character Marcello, but I can't appreciate it. Nothing... interesting happens. This guy lives, I wanted to see this movie so badly because so many people were raving about the new foreign film \"The Great Beauty\" and how Italy was reaching back to it's older roots with this film. I didn't like \"The Great Beauty\" very much, I liked it, but not too much. And I can only say the same about La Dolce Vita. I wanted so badly to like this movie, knowing it is an all-time favorite of Steven Spielberg and that so many modern directors take influence from Fellini, but the story just didn't work for me. I don't understand how one would write a \"Spoiler\" Review for this movie because there is nothing to spoil other than that this movie just follows the life of an aging journalist. Hell, the synopsis on IMDb is an extreme spoiler. I can't name the scenes and what happens, but I will say that the ending scene and the scenes with the actresses Anita Ekberg and Anouk Aimee and the young girl who plays Paulo are interesting. But this film is just, plain. I appreciate that the movie is the story of the life of an Italian journalist, and maybe it is a metaphor stating that no matter how interesting your title is (like Marcello) you really are boring.La Dolce Vita is a beautiful movie, the costumes are beautiful, well deserved Oscar there. And I can surely see the directing influence of Fellini in Spielberg. But other than the BEAUTIFUL Mercedes driven by Anouk Aimee and Marcello, I have nothing to say. It's good. I guess.SilverRating: 6/10",

            "content": "Yes, I too found this movie very engaging, intriguing and technically beautiful to watch. But, but, but.... not one of the best movies in the world, not one to take on a desert island with me, not life changing or as brilliant as people here (and everywhere) seem to think. Perhaps because it is now so outdated, and so much from a spoilt man of the mid twentieth century's point of view. I appreciate it and respect it for what it is, and I'm sure I don't get half of its symbolism. I love its mode of narrative, the large ensemble scenes which I can see have influenced Robert Altman and many other great film makers.But...methinks that those who rave so much about this film have been seduced as badly as Marcello. Who cares about the bloody lifestyles of the rich and famous? Is this really the place to find meaning? I would find a film about the life of the girl Paolo and her family much more meaningful and worthy of my attention. And like in \"8 1/2\" one has to wonder if Fellini himself would agree - what is the point of making such a film at all? I'm not against art about the aristocracy or the rich and their decline but would prefer something more complex - like \"Brideshead Revisited\" (the novel) for example. But ultimately it is hard to feel sorry for such people, especially Marcello. His utter contempt for himself at the end of the movie was well deserved and left me depressed and disgusted. I found his degenerate fall just too trite though, using the excuse of Steiner's murder/suicide as justification (a plot twist which while shocking, did not ring true for me). Maybe I'm just not an existentialist. I might have found this movie more enlightening if I had seen it ten years ago when I was in my twenty's when I was living my own (much tamer!) version of the sweet life, who knows. Certainly we have all been there when we realise that parties, sex, alcohol, beautiful people and sophisticated talk is not all there is to life. Duh! No, for a true, kick in the guts, life changing movie about the inauthenticity of our socially constructed world, and the struggle of the individual to wake up and break free, you can't go past \"American Beauty\" or \"The Truman Show\", or many other wonderful movies out there that I feel are far more deserving of the label \"classic\" and of the adulation that this film seems to inspire.",

            "content": "To even begin to speak of La Dolce Vita is a daunting task in and of itself. I found that days after viewing it I was left with a sense of awe that never once went away. Some might complain that it is long, or confusing, with no definite answers - but those who say that would probably not take the time to read these comments. For those of you actually reading this, you know better then to cast aside a work of art for such petty reasons. La Dolce Vita does not hand anything to you \"on a silver platter\" you do have to think for yourself, but the journey to that state of enlightenment is an awesome and supreme one.I always found the title of La Dolce Vita fitting, certainly, but ironic, in the utmost effective way possible. Translated, it means \"The Sweet Life\" and that is exactly what Marcello's character is supposedly mixed up in, but the sweet life is not necessarily a fulfilling one. On the other hand, it is a shallow, superficial one, perhaps easier at times, as one tries to avoid the truths, troubles, and vicissitudes of life - but in the end, one finds that reality is inescapable.Marcello is a \"semi-sleazy gossip journalist\" right in the middle of living the so-called \"sweet life\" and we follow him on many escapades with various friends and people as what slowly culminates in the final scene on the beach, where in a sense, all is revealed. Breathlessly beautiful, well-scripted, superbly shot, and just phenomenal in every aspect of the word La Dolce Vita \"dazzles and amazes.\" Without giving away any spoilers, I just wish I could stress the absolute beauty, tragedy, and majesty in this amazing film. La Dolce Vita is art at its finest. Throughout the entire movie I was in awe of each scene, each shot, each utterance - and then when everything builds up, as Marcello is faced with his final decision, we too, as the audience, realize that we have been where he is before, and perhaps we are still there today. We too must decide do we want to live La Dolce Vita or can we \"escape?\"\"Salvation doesn't lie within four walls,\" but beauty, entertainment, and magnificence do lie in La Dolce Vita.

            "review_title": "Hardly a classic, but a pretty interesting movie nonetheless",
            "content": "\"La dolce vita\" is a mostly Italian-language film from 1960 and it is among the career-defining works of director Federico Fellini, who is also one of the many many writers contributing to the script of this one. But as the film runs for almost three hours, it is not too surprising the screenplay crew includes so many names. By the way, one of them is another Italian filmmaking great, namely Pasolini. And if I say this is a career-defining work for Fellini, then maybe you know wht this means if you take a look at his big body of work that includes many truly successful films. It's maybe between this one here and 8 1/2, at least if we focus on what he did in the 1960s. There's works from the 50s and 70s too that could deserve the title most fammous Fellini movie as well. But yeah this one here and 8 1/2 even have some similar awards recognition. Both won Gherardi the Cosrume Design Oscar and for both he was nominated for Art Direction too and more Oscar nominations were included. The only reason why this one here perhaps did not win the Foreign Language Film Academy Award was that Italy picked another movie to represent the country at the Oscars that year, but I guess with 8 1/2 they did not make the same mistake. You could say it was a year for countries inspired by foreign cultures at the Oscars of course with the big West Side Story success, but also especially in terms of Italy with Sophie Loren winning Best Actress. Now she was not in La dolce vita. Actually, apart from Anita Ekberg, most of the female actors with a great deal of screen time were French, so no surprise that this is an Italian/French co-production. Aim\u00e9e, Fourneaux, Noel... and also Alain Cuny who plays one of the bigger supporting characters. Bit the star at the center of it all in this black-and-white movie is of course Fellini's regular Marcello Mastroianni playing another Marcello. And it is also not the only film where he played next to Anouk Aim\u00e9e for example. So yeah MM is in this one from start to finish and the action keeos revolving around him. He is a journalist himself, so sort of the interfact between the ruthless world of paparazzi and the posh world of stars and starlets. And he clearly enjoys the attention as we see him hook up with famous actresses more than once. His fianc\u00e9e clearly did not like it, but if wonderful sequences arise from that like the scene early on when they manage to hide away with the help of a prostitute or also when we get this still really famous Trevi fountain sequence starring the late Anita Ekberg (and a baby kitten before that), then I am all for it.I would generally say that I liked these early parts more that took us into Marcello's love life and this was when the film was even at 4 stars out of 5 I would say, but sadly it did get a bit worse afterwards being really more on the showy side eventually than delivering the substance like it does early on. Of course, it is a challenge almost impossible to master with this running time. However, the focus switches to religion considerably at some point, first with the priest then with the two children who (allegedly) saw the Virgin Mary. I mean these parts aren't horrible, probably not even weak, but still a decline in quality compared to the level before them. In-between there are always again scenes during which the film gets better again like the not too long one with the character of Paola (Valeria Ciangottini ) at the restaurant symbolizing goodness and innocence and who also reappears at the end again on the seaside, but overall they are not getting the greatness from early on back. Also the scenes with Steiner did not do too much for me and the horrible crime linked to him eventually did not have an impact on me at all. It felt very much for the sake of it sadly. For being as shocking and controversial as possible, but sometimes less is more. The way we see the paparazzi when they go fetch the wife was more memorable, but still this also felt really clumsy in terms of story-telling. It is already bad enough that the guy needs somebody to identify the wife, but when he tells her that the kids are just injured etc. like what is happening, this is not appropriate police work, also not back ober half a century ago, now 60 years almost actually, probably over 60 when you read this review. Still the film also lives through the individual scenes, actually more through these than as one piece as a whole. I won#t mention all the scenes I am talking about this way, but I called some already. Other examples would of course be the really big sea animal at the end that brings all kinds of metaphors and symbolisms to the table or if we are talking about the very end already, same is true for the very beginning when we see Marcello up there in the helicopter who takes down the statue. He says on one occasion that he is a big shot with great connections to everybody who matters, like the Vatican too, and this opening scene is pretty much the best example. He is where the action is and there is always many attractive women surrounding him, again not to the liking of his fianc\u00e9e. But it comes with the job I guess and his looks. Mastroianna sure gave a nice performance here too and I sometimes feel he is not getting the recognition really as he should for his acting in some of his works, especially the Fellini films. So overall, despite the decline in quality this was still a good movie and I was a bit surprised that I liked it a lot more than years ago when i saw it for the first time, so perhaps it really is a film that gets better as you grow older and perceive it differently. Who knows. I'm curious what my verdict will be perhaps at the age of 50 if I decide to watch it again then. And if I maybe also like that party scene towards the end then that honestly now did really do nothing for me at all. We will see. But for now, it is enough maybe for at least the next 5-6 years because there is just so much interesting other stuff to (re)watch, let alone all the new quality films coming out. This one here gets a thumbs-up from me, but not an enthusiastic one. If you aren't thrilled be the first hour, then maybe skip the rest. It's only going downhill from there.",

Perhaps this is the first time the world had seen some of these characters and situations, the dizzy 60s blonde (plus the husky variant), the paparazzi, and swinging - not shown explicitly, but only thinly veiled.Journalist Marcello (Mastroianni) is on a trajectory towards nonchalant decadence, the benchmark being set at the beginning by bored socialite Anouk Aimee, who wants to do it in a prostitute's bed while being watched. This is the first section of the film and must have knocked the audience off their seats. It is also perhaps the finest and most meaningful section, notwithstanding Anita Ekberg in the Trevi fountain (it's a pity Ekberg didn't keep the kitten on her head as it was beautifully symbolic).Each section reads like a portrait of the deadly sins of moral decadence: insincerity (Aimee), superficiality (Ekberg), unreliability (his father), weakness (Steiner), insecurity (his girlfriend), and, least effectively, irrationality (the crowd at the miracle site, a long barely relevant section that the film would have been better without). Individually these things may not bring a man down, but together - the message seems to be - they are enough to erode one's resistance.Actually, the film may not be about creeping decadence at all, but simply nihilism, the inevitable response to the ultimate meaninglessness of things. In that sense, every section here is not about a sin, a failing, but about meaninglessness, the impossibility, despite our best intentions, of being what we really want.As with many Fellini films, there's too much raucousness. There are too many parties populated by insufferable characters. Fellini got carried away here and someone ought to have reined him in. Almost all of these peripheral characters are over-the-top-pretentious which gradually dissolves the realism, and, with it, our sympathy. It's always the quiet moments that work best - perhaps that's a consequence of the dubbing technique, which makes the garrulous scenes unpleasant, but when the circus backdrop falls, the sudden serenity is startling and simple gestures take on extraordinary meaning - then it becomes sublime cinema.",

Decadence, sexual revolution, burnout, inability to commit, misogyny, relationship abuse, transvestites, and the culture of fame.  It's all here!  For you trivia buffs, this is also the movie that invented the word for Paparazzi, embodied in the prototype character Paparazzo.Modelled on the Decadence-of-Rome meets the Beat Generation, the story follows our comic-tragic hero, brilliantly played by Mastroianni, as he slips from a journalist covering the rich and famous and their hangers-on, to one of them.  Considered too \"adult\" a film to be shown to adolescents in its day, there is certainly not much in it which would make it inappropriate for a teen today.

He knows this, the celebrities he leeches on know this but it fuels their egos.The beginning of the film has Marcello Rubini played by Marcello Mastroianni flying a helicopter following a statue of Jesus being carried by another helicopter. This overt symbolism is a bit over the top but powerful nonetheless. He is sidetracked by some sunbathing woman on a pool rooftop. They make small talk about the statue and he is on his way again. To him the statue is just as much a celebrity as the people he writes about in his columns.What La Dolce Vita does so well is make something as stereotypically glamorous and alluring like fame, power and casual sex seem so depraved. Why is Marcello trapped? He has famous friends, disposable cash and drunken parties on end but he is lost. He is a chameleon to whatever trend he feels he needs to mask his true self under. He is a nomad with no home because he does not know himself and once he gets a glimpse of who he is, he runs.The celebrities he meets as a journalist are whatever his mind projects them to be. To him they are exciting, desirable and posses whatever he lacks. They fuel his insecurity by the very need of him wanting to assimilate and be part of something that he is not. What ultimately happens though is that plays an enemy to himself by being no more than an observer. He does not question what he sees and believes that nothing he sees could be an act. Like the mystery that allures people to another, he is enamored by their image and success. After spending so much time with these movie stars though he sees their cracks and weaknesses but is unfazed. He wants to believe the elusive lie that is their representation of happiness and not his own.The turning point of the film is when he is at the beach with the famous crowd he has leeched onto the whole film. He encounters an angelic looking girl who looks at him invitingly. She offers him self redemption but he falters. Instead he goes with his fake friends and ultimately kills any sort of self worth he may have ever had. He seeks the lie of something fake because it is much more exciting even though it offers nothing substantial. Her eyes trail off of him and onto us for falling into the same trap. It is hypnotic, haunting and unforgettable.",

            "content": "Perhaps hate is too strong a word, but it's no less one dimensional a reaction than the messages conveyed in this film. Perhaps I'm a sucker for a happyending or some sort of redemption, but I found this film relentless in it's cloying pretension and smugness.The film is not without it's merits. It's shot beautifully and it's sequencing of seemingly in congruous events keeps it at least a curiosity. But when all is said and done, it's as irritating and superficial as the people it arguably glorifies. Yeah, I know, in all likelihood Fellini intended to portray these characters as shallow and unlikeable, but  that doesn't mean that I can watch their frivolous, sadistic debauchery with any degree of enjoyment. It's not that I'm a prude, as there's plenty of titilating eye candy here, but perhaps that's one main problem I have with the film. Fellini's portrayal of women in this film is misogynistic, and women are meant to be conquered and submissive in this world. But whatmakes the film so unsatisfying is the fact that Fellini's opinion of this pretentious and ugly society isn't necessarily an opinion he shares as well. Instead ofconveying a clear message of how shallow and pathetic these really peopleare, Fellini borders on glamorizing them and insulting his audience, as if to say, \"look at how cool and happening we are and how dull and uninteresting you are for having any moral and ethical sensibilities.\" Of course, the great irony of all this is after watching 2 hours of people partying, they quickly become boring and dull. In this film, anyone capable of expressing love is quickly dismissed and made to appear \"weak\", i.e. the character of Emma, but this message caneasily be interpreted two ways. When Steiner murders himself and his child, the message we get is that he felt weighted down by his obligations andresponsibilities as a father/husband, as if to imply that marriage and fatherhood are a slow death to be avoided. Marcello comes to this conclusion, andproceeds to pursue his life of partying and debauchery even further. OK, I can accept that if not for the fact that the film from here on in shows him whooping it up and having a grand old time, seemingly no longer at war with his inner moral demons. I consider this a failure on the part of Fellini because this implies that Marcello was absolutely right in his conclusions, since happiness is ultimately what we're all looking for and he's seemingly completely comfortable in his own skin womanizing and sadistically mistreating people now.And that's not my idea of redemption.",

            "content": "The more I view \"La Dolce Vita,\" the more I'm convinced it's the best film ever made. It's ranked 6th in AFI's poll. \"Citizen Kane\" is ranked 1st.Yet the silly flaw that undercuts the entirety of \"Citizen Kane\" and renders it, finally, an exercise in technical dexterity and egotistical filmic artifice \u2013 breathtaking as all that is \u2013 or was at the time of its release \u2013 doesn't mar \"La Dolce Vita.\" Charles Foster Kane died alone. His last word was heard by no one. Yet the entire film is based on everybody \"somehow\" knowing his last word was \"Rosebud,\" and searching for the word's meaning.So fundamentally insulting is this shoddy premise that everything that follows \u2013 visually and histrionically thrilling as it all is \u2013 begs us to surrender to \"Citizen Kane's\" supposed brilliance when, in fact, the film says nothing and fails to resonate mere decades later. Even its concluding shot of the sled (\"Rosebud\") burning in the furnace was a direct steal from Hitchcock's previous (and better) final image in \"Rebecca.\" Yet \"La Dolce Vita\" still has the power to disturb and provoke (unlike \"Kane,\" which exists now solely as a pretentiously revered artifact). Unlike the derivative \"Kane,\" there really was no precedent for Fellini's wholly original and still unique \"La Dolce Vita.\" Even Fellini's earlier pieces don't prepare us for this. The opening sequence spells it out. A lifeless, almost comically smiling statue of Christ, arms mechanically spread, being choppered over Rome toward the Vatican. Immediately undercut by the sunbathing rooftop bikinied beauties and Marcello's and Papparazo's attempts to get the girls' phone numbers.What? A helicopter flying a statue of Jesus over ancient Roman aqueducts, pausing to score with some flirtatious rooftop babes? \"Look! It's Jesus!\" Perhaps the only more audacious image in cinema history was Kubrick's brilliant cut from the bone-thrashing murderous prehistoric ape to the silent bone-shaped space pod waltzing toward the Moon in \"2001: A Space Odyssey.\" Immediately, Fellini visually establishes his themes. Ancient Rome (cradle of Western civilization) in ruins after WWII and centuries of neglect, being overridden by horny tabloid journalists following a laughable schlock statue of the founder of Christianity as it choppers over Rome.Shocking in its day, the opening images of \"La Dolce Vita\" juxtapose a dead concrete \"Christ\" \"flying\" in the heavens (thanks to 20th Century helicopter mechanics) with all-too-living (and sensual) babes in bikinis.Soon we're treated to the then-most-voluptuous woman in the world \u2013 Anita Ekberg \u2013 girlishly ascending the Vatican's stairs \u2013 dressed, incidentally, as a Priest. Whereupon she loses her hat in the wind \u2013 \"nature\" stripping her of her \"habit,\" in other words.None of this \"sacred\" vs. \"profane\" theme registers immediately upon first viewing, necessarily, so visually exciting are Fellini's images and remarkable cast.We are, instead, seduced by Marcello's life as a Via Veneto tabloid reporter. We don't notice the impeccably crafted lyrical visual and verbal references.We don't notice the meticulous craftsmanship of cinematography, dialogue (dubbing) and performances until, finally, we're at the beach with the dead thing hauled ashore. The dead fish (ancient symbol of Christianity) that stares at us. The dead thing we laugh at and are repelled by and walk away from, like Marcello, uncaring.As a bookend for the \"dead\" statue of Christ that opens \"La Dolce Vita,\" we're alerted that something more is going on here than meets the eye. Literally.By now, in what appears almost cinema verite, we have witnessed the deconstruction of a human life from hope to resigned despair.In \"La Dolce Vita's\" final sequence, Marcello cannot connect with the innocent young waitress he (and we) met earlier, smiling and beckoning him across the ocean inlet. He cannot hear her.All she wants is to learn to type. To \"communicate\" with \"modern\" technology. To be a secretary instead of a waitress, maybe. Marcello, who can \"type\" and \"communicate\" has abandoned both, and walks away from her.Fellini leaves us with a close-up of the girl, her eyes and smile following Marcello (off-screen) as he leaves . . . embracing the dead, hollow, \"sweet life\" of shallow celebrities and hangers-on . . . until the girl, her gaze following the unseen (offscreen) Marcello, is finally looking at US.So much has been written about the structure of \"La Dolce Vita.\" The seven days and nights: the seven hills of Rome: climbing and descending stairs, etc.Yet what strikes one, after repeated viewings, is the precision of the script. Yes, I'm viewing it with English subtitles. Yes, I'm familiar with Fellini's vaunted technique of post-dubbing lines.Yet EVERY SINGLE LINE, EVERY WORD, resonates with the themes of Love (spiritual and secular), inability to connect, detachment, deceit, loneliness, isolation, self-destruction. Not a single syllable is extraneous.So much for \"La Dolce Vita's\" seemingly haphazard construction. It is anything BUT haphazard. Yes, it documents the aimless, hopeful, empty lives of its protagonists. Yes, it predates our current preoccupation with the lives of Anna Nicole Smith, Paris Hilton and P. Diddy over substantive issues like the war in Iraq and the apparent destruction of America's Constitution.Yes, it seemingly celebrates glamour over substance . . . until, finally, it doesn't.Every finely-wrought image, every word of post-dubbed dialogue, every cut, every sequence, every actor, every costume, every note from Nino Rota's score . . . leaves us, finally, with just the sound of relentless ancient sea waves and the understanding gaze of the girl . . . who'll someday be a mother? . . . the Virgin of the world? . . . staring directly at us, at Marcello, saying, \"Goodbye\" with her eyes.There are many fine films, from silents to sound.There is only one, \"La Dolce Vita.\" Nearly five decades later, this, above all, is what film is.",

But after two Tylenol and a nap to combat the headache I had acquired reading the poorly translated English subtitles by the second hour, I realized that this is yet another one of those so-called \"classic\" films that is actually nothing more than crap disguised as an insightful look into the pointless lives of rich people. Please! This is the same kind of garbage I had to endure while watching \"Breakfast at Tiffany's\". If you're the kind of person that thinks you're part of the special elite crowd that 'understands' this kind of 'art', I'm here to tell you that you're full of crap. If you need to see a movie that portrays rich people living pointless lives in order to feel better about your own life as common as it may be, I pity you. This movie, just like 'Tiffany's', is nothing more than a working class affirmation of the old saying, \"Money does not buy happiness.\" What a load of crap. True, money does not buy happiness, but the people in these films were defective before money became an issue in their lives. And by the way, money buys solutions to problems that make it easier to be happy. The happy part is up to you; regardless of the money. And for those who are warming up their lips, preparing an arrogant speech to inform me that I 'apparently don't get it', please. What's to get? This movie is completely bereft of a plot, has no cinematographic value such as you would find in a movie like Citizen Kane, and it's message can be distilled down from it's nearly three horridly long hours to a simple statement; \"Rich people are shallow too.\" I gave this movie a 3 out of 10. I rarely give a movie a 1 unless I simply cannot get through it, even for morbid curiosity. So, where did I find the extra two points? One point for each of Ekberg's breasts. Oh please! If this movie was about ANYTHING else, she wouldn't be so prominently pasted on the cover. She's a minor character, but her chest gets top billing. Yeah, I get it all right. Okay, I have to give some credit for the origin of the word \"Paparazzi\". And I will even admit that there seems to be something important that I missed with the big fish and the young girl at the end...or am I just desperately reaching for a point to this miserable movie. If you want to see a movie with a plot and point that will touch your mind and heart in a meaningful way, see \"American Beauty\". And if foreign films of the same caliber take your fancy, try \"Amelie\". Oh, and skip Citizen Kane too. That is unless you're really interested in all the amazing cinematographic trouble Orson Wells went to to film a pointless movie about yet another defective rich person.",

            "content": "Truth be told, I was pretty mad at La Dolce Vita.. for many years.\nA few snatches of it back in college had somehow soured me on Fellini.. until, to my great chagrin, I realized a couple decades later what I'd been missing. But lately (as nostalgic old hipsters are wont to do), I've been revisiting some of my youthful preconceptions.But no...., I can't say it rocked my world. And, as one reviewer said, it WAS dated -- like watching Mad Men with two fingers of Scotch and wondering why I stopped wearing my Brook-Taverner suits.\nBut, neither am I here to (as another reviewer said) \"cast dispersions\".., especially because Kirsten Dunst, MY HERO (for her music video, Turning Japanese, in downtown Tokyo) cast her vote in \"How To Lose Friends And Alienate People\" (the greatest\" movie ever made btw) that La Dolce Vita was.. uhn.. the \"greatest\" movie ever made. (IRONY!!)Fortunately for you.., you will not hear me say that La Dolce, like every movie in existence, is whatever the viewer (or Kursten Dunst) brings to it.\nI will simply tell you what I saw.., and what may not have been mentioned by other reviewers.First, I'll just say that the whole morality play thing didn't interest me at all -- the bored, empty, jaded, half-hearted, profligate consumers of dissipation and excess -- BECAUSE.., as any Bible-belt Christian can tell you.., this is old hat.\nThe semi-conscious awareness of ones miserable plight, by the spiritual zombie.. is nothing new to me. And, if Fellini can open with a feckless, concrete, flying Jesus.., I can certainly cite the prevailing spiritual subtext of this film..; not to mention the group scene -- the endless wandering through the deteriorating halls of some 16th-century castle, only to find that ALL ROADS LEAD TO (god help us) morning mass and confession.\n(Hey, don't blame Fellini. It's all he knew.)Another (possibly unique) observation.. has to do with the frequent appearance of a sort of \"Man-Versus-His Baser Nature\" theme -- where man's (and woman's) Inner Beast is never far from emerging -- dare I say, especially Woman's.\nAnd if I had to guess.., I'd say (especially after seeing Satyricon) that Fellini did NOT have a terribly high opinion of Women -- a MOST \"inappropriate\" p.o.v. currently.., WHICH might explain why La Dolce is nowhere to be found at Netflix or Amazon, etc etc., and is available to watch only on YouTube. (i.e., Censorship is alive and well.)\nThat is.., I think Fellini saw the vast majority of women as being very little different from cats or dogs, baying coyotes, witless barnyard foul, etc etc. (not to put too fine a point...)Lastly, I think Fellini may APPEAR to express HIS own artistic point of view, as transposed by Marcelo giving Steiner some thoughts on a rather dull painting -- a sort of compositionless bottlescape in Steiner's home.\nHere.. Marcelo declares that romance and abstraction are worthless.., and that only stark, relentless, unembellished reality will and should prevail.\nSuperficially.. it might seem like just more quasi-intellectual posing and party protocol, the urbane language of their profligate age (including the unbearable folk singer).\nBUT.., I tend to think it might just be our best clue.. that Fellini was actually being sly and tongue-in-cheek.. here and generally throughout the movie.., a lot more than people have given him credit for.All in all, one SHOULD see this film.., if only so that, at your next \"cocktail party\" you too can (as I do) pretentiously ramble on about it.. in the urbane, quasi-intellectual language of OUR profligate age.\ncheers!! \ud83d\ude07",

            "content": "Fellini manages to put together in \"La Doce Vita\" an impeccable feat. It suggests in parallel and through the fable, a trajectory of the journalist Marcello Rubini that unites and builds the story at the same time, does not present and does not pretend to be a concise narrative. A film structured from the perspective of a chronicler of life, with reflections, criticisms and comments elaborated through a poetic language, where Fellini wisely uses the symbolism, and presents clear references to German expressionism and \"noir\" cinema.In the credits that begin this work realized in 1960, already deserves attention the group responsible for the script, besides Federico Fellini himself who directed and co-written \"La Dolce Vita\", there are expressive names in the construction and expressivity of the Italian cinematography, such as: Ennio Flaiano, Tullio Pinelli, Brunello Rondi and Pier Paolo Pasolini. Told with such a diverse group of writers who were also thinkers, critics, directors, philosophers, teachers and journalists, the option of dividing the film in a prologue, seven episodes with subdivisions, and an epilogue becomes more noticeable.By accompanying for seven days and nights the trajectory of Marcello Rubini (played by the excellent Marcello Mastroianni), a celebrity journalist living in Rome who self-questions his craft and his life, mainly because he does not have the sensation of happiness , Nor so much of realization, who both (life and profession), projected or promised. So we have a protagonist who is basically driven by emptiness and the search to fill it, moreover, his search is crossed by the contact with several people, who basically only express the same feeling of Marcello, and when we have a figure of apparently life full , So we can visualize the facade of this appearance, as in the life of the millionaire, father and intellectual Steiner (Alain Cuny), a figure at first glance enviable, but who intimately lives under the despair and anguish of not being able to stand out, produce and Keep yourself in the position and level that arouses such admiration.This deceiving tone is very well represented in the various performances, as well as in the work of art direction and costume, which have in common the dimension of openness artificial and that tries to veil reality, as in large houses and even castles with beautiful facades, But inside that are real ruins, such as the very identity of its owners, who hide in makeup, lights and costumes of external and fragile beauty in the face of the decadent interiority of these people, this difference of exterior and interior was a stimulating motor for the Creation of Fellini, since the dress worn by the ladies of that time, whose fashion was dressed in bag style or \"dress bag\", aroused the curiosity of the director by its frame that can present and pretend the body, and a very beautiful woman, But it can also hide a skeletal being of misery and loneliness. Something that we can identify as common to all the characters, always attached to a beautiful fa\u00e7ade, highlighting the character of Marcello Rubini in another majestic work of Marcello Mastroianni, who can establish very well the subtleties and dramatic curve of the character, As well as the clear trace of graphic oscillations of a life that oscillates in times of peaks of a doubtful origin of both happiness and anguish and sadness.Curiously, the figure of the photographers of celebrities, that later and because of this film, happened to be called worldwide of \"paparazzi\", due to the personage \"Paparazzo\", interpreted by Walter Santesso, in fact, this group of photographers of the film, seem more occupy A position of parasite of the life of others, there are no reflections on their work, so little about their attitudes, only reveal themselves in the thirsty desire to invade the privacy of others and get the best photo, the best moment that arouses the curiosity of the public that will consume The printed or television newspapers, something that as a public of \"La Doce Vita\", we are in part, equal, since we are placed in a point of view that tries to deepen in the curiosity of those lives, and by the cutback realized by Fellini , Since in this film, his approach is dimensioned in the lives of a class in position and much more favorable condition, compared with the common life, even the photographer M Arcello Rubini, is in an economically privileged situation, which often appears to be a crisis that oscillates between the discourse of a privileged class who experiences dull moments in having their lives as material of interest by placing them in a model place or Another crisis of the age of the journalist in dreams and promises of life as a young man, and now, at maturity, they are unreachable. With this we have in the proposal made by Fellini, the registration and the use of a (privileged) form, which confuses and generates moments that makes his speech unfeasible.Having only this caveat, \"La Dolce Vita\" is a timeless film, of pertinent considerations to contemporary life and a flawless style narrative, which are true legacies for the history of world cinema, and that will be for generations, like forgetting the Famous scene in which Marcello Mastroianni and Anita Ekberg bathe in the Fontana di Trevi or the children who parody and criticize the history of the children of Fatima, fed by the search of adults for a way out, a solution to the harshness of life. \"La doce Vida\" is an exceptional film in every respect, but mainly because it confronts the spectator with the emptiness of our uncertainties regarding life.",

            "review_title": "La Dolce Vita",
            "content": "The movie that slinkily escaped my senses twice got caught the third time \u2013 La Dolce Vita is a deceptively vague movie that has led in several interpretations by critics, scholars and public. People brink forth in their analysis theories of old versus contemporary, faith versus superstition, loss of innocence, fickleness of love, meaning of life etc. Three different viewings of LDV and I observed it from different perspectives, each constituting a result that made me thump my forehead at the end \u2013 I realized that by scrutinizing it too much, I lost the crux of what Fellini wanted to convey - he puts LDV up like a painting and we the viewer's pick out what suits our understanding and interpret it accordingly. Therefore, I stopped analyzing the religious allusions too much. In the end, my way of understanding LDV is that it is a series of events in the life of a person, a journalist/paparazzi who usually take an apathetic interest in the life of their subjects (when Steiner's wife arrives, they shamelessly begin photographing her without caring two hoots about her agony) and are always on the periphery of any event no matter how beneficial it is for their subjects (Marcello, in spite of creating much publicity for celebrities, is treated like an inferior by many, with some refusing to acknowledge his presence), who isn't able to bring a semblance to his own life as he sees it drifting away hopelessly in front of his eyes. I differ slightly from certain opinions which state that everyone around Marcello was vain and artificial; I rather felt that it was Marcello's own perception that everyone around him was superficial because of their extravagance or high-spiritedness. Marcello is a man who spends almost his entire time at parties and events rather than staying at home, and this is perhaps why he must have developed such an opinion about everybody. The writers, poets, painters, dancers and other artistes may not be actually one-dimensional as Marcello suggests, in fact I feel that since Marcello must be attending parties more than the artistes themselves, he never fully understood them. Party is an occasion where people either i) discuss politics and current events ii) their own achievements iii) other people and their achievements iv) some highfalutin matter or v) gossip. People don't reveal their true selves in a public space and since Marcello did not get enough private space, he assumed everyone around him to be shallow. Another common thing at parties is that people behave differently, in an overtly excited manner, and try to obscure their true feelings behind masks; everyone acts like 'cool' teenagers and don't mind losing their self-esteem a bit in the process ( that's why they're ready to gossip, strip and trip). It doesn't mean they are crazy always- and that is what Marcello probably couldn't comprehend. We begin envying and deprecating those around us if we aren't satisfied with ourselves- I think it's got something to do with displacement in psychology. La Dolce Vita displaces Marcello from the sweet life, and this unearned satisfaction is drives him to the edge.I could empathize with Marcello because I too keep experiencing similar feelings of confusion, dissatisfaction and irritability. This affects my work, my family and social life and my writings; I am not able to write a single word of a play I'm currently writing the days I feel such discomfort. I become bored during conversations and feel the skin around my face feeling pale and disgusted and I extricate myself immediately to retreat into a corner. I haven't read much about Fellini but I got to know he suffered from depression, and this is the sole reason why La Dolce Vita is such a success. Only a depressed genius could pen the script with such astonishing clarity; had this been written by an ordinary genius or scriptwriter, he would've made this into a movie. La Dolce Vita isn't a movie and doesn't contain the inherent phoniness of most films \u2013 it is astoundingly real, to the point that it looks like a documentary. Take, for example, Revolutionary Road and compare it with La Dolce Vita; both tackle discontentment but the former doesn't seem like the director/writer's own story but rather a poignant tale of two characters, while La Dolce Vita could very easily be associated or substituted with Fellini's own outlook of life. Coming to LDV as a film, at last, I find it surprising it became a profitable venture in spite of its abstract narrative and despondent theme. As we are given insight into Marcello's life, love and work \u2013 his stagnant engagement with Emma, his one-night stands and romances, his burgeoning acquaintances, his father's arrival and his search for the center, we find characters \u2013 male and female, both straight and gay, transsexuals and bisexuals \u2013 flitting in and out of his life. Out of all the girls he meets and gets to adore, kiss, love and sleep with, the perfect choice to me would be one whom he had slept with but was now simply a great friend and an effervescent soul \u2013 Fanny. It's no surprise his father extols her when the three share the space at a club; Fanny also remarks how Marcello is just like his father. The climax is a zinger and it helps in jotting the fragments together. If one remembers, an actor asks Marcello at the last party what he would make him if he had a million dollars. And later lands a fish that must be worth a 'million dollars' as said by the fisherman. An actress throws in whether they can buy it but another says that they can't afford it. This implies that all of them will soon turn into monsters and the girl later implies loss of innocence. But I find it too bitter a catharsis and stand by my interpretation of this classic.",

In this movie, Fellini is creating a chronicle through the cinematic language using a fantastic cast, a brilliant script, costumes, music and etc. Also in the words of some characters we see how the Great Fellini became the prophet with prediction some shifts in the culture and its explosions in the students strikes of 1968 (scene on the beach after party, when the blonde gay says that everything will be changed soon). Those people who were in the students protests of 1968 are now leaders in their societies worldwide. His satiric vision still resonates through the culture of today's world (spiritual hypocrisy to achieve economical goals, the terrifying paparazzi, a promiscuity of \"high society\", superficial friendship). La Dolce Vita is an amazing movie that chronicles Italian hipster life in the 60s, and Fellini is a master of projecting this reality on the screen.",

The story is of a journalist name Marcello (played by marcello mastrioni who is thought to be fellini's representation of himself) who covers all these glamorous people around him, and in a sense imagines their life to be the one he desires.\nIn his mind he resolves to be part of this 'Good Life', though this is done very implicitly by the movie. The tone never gets allegorical, although on a deeper note, this movie is an allegory. As he moves towards what he thinks is his goal, we see events which ominously hint at the error in Marcello's perceptions.Marcello has a well respected affluent, intelligent, family-man friend, who he really looks up to, and feels like that he knows what he's talking about. Later, we find that he has committed suicide. Here a seed is sown. Perhaps all of life is not as it seems?The movie takes us from the outside of the avant garde society to inside it. And eventually marcello does, and doesn't achieve what he was trying to. How much he loses or gains along the way, i don't think even marcello knew.",

The only problem is, many Fellini fans won't understand, or appreciate the movie as much as others. For the \"Youth Audience,\" many won't appreciate La Dolce Vita as much as the older members of the audience. Anita Ekberg is perfect! Known as \"The Iceberg\" in her modeling and acting career, she is larger than life in the movie. She is seen on the box cover and the movie's poster as part of the main attraction. It is her and Marcello Mastroianni that make up the eye candy in La Dolce Vita. Although Rome is the backdrop for most of the movie, Federico Fellini uses his actors as part of the setting. I enjoyed the first 30 minutes of the movie, then, it drops off and enters a new chapter. Once Anita disappears from the story, many hope that she will return, she does not. La Dolce Vita is one of Fellini's best and considered one of the greatest movies ever made by fans worldwide. Still, it lacks as much magic that 8 1/2 has and the classic form that La Strada has. Overall, a good movie, but in my opinion, not his very best. PS...Marcello Mastroianni is a GOD!",

            "content": "I consider myself a film enthusiast. I love films in all forms: drama, foreign language, comedies, romance, etc. And I had never scene a Federico Fellini film. So I rented \"La Dolce Vita\" for the first time and watched a groundbreaking film of its time and forever. The film has no particular story because it is a series of misadventures of the life and loves of tabloid reporter Marcello Rubini (the great Marcello Mastroianni). He goes from parties to parties from story to story with hounds of paparazzi photographers at his heels covering the mundane and frivolous drivel of Roman high society and celebrity. He did not start out that way. He wants to be a serious writer but became lost in the glitz and glamour of the high society of Roman life. In his life there is Emma (Yvonne Frenneaux), his suicidal and possessive girlfriend, who he neglects and cannot stand but he goes back to her every time out of guilt or fear of loneliness. Then there is Maddalena (Anouk Aimee), a high class billionaire's daughter who is Marcello's friend and sometime lover. She is bored with her life and finds no contentment yet she enjoys Marcello's company. They understand each other and there is no pretense of romance between them. Marcello meets several celebrities and attends many parties and clubs to cover the latest dirt until he meets Sylvia, a Swedish-American actress (the beautiful statuesque Anita Ekberg): playful, child like, beautiful, fun, and free spirited. She is pretty much everything he looks for in life and in a woman but she is unattainable. She goes back to her abusive and neglectful boyfriend (a mirror image of Marcello). There is also his mentor and friend, Steiner (Alain Cuny in a memorable performance), an intellectual philosopher and writer who is successful and seems happy. He is married with two small children and a beautiful home. Steiner is everything Marcello wants in life until a horrible tragedy occurs and Marcello is slapped back into reality and afraid. The film is a statement about life and course we take. Marcello confesses to Steiner that he once had \"ambitions\" for his life and now is \"loosing and forgetting everything\". He is desperate to not fall into a life of superficiality and lies. He wants so much to live a respectful life where he is a successful serious writer with a wife and children and happiness. He struggles but it is so much easier to be superficial and unreal. \"La Dolce Vita\" is a ground breaker in film-making and a statement of the celebrity world and media. But more importantly it is a look at life and the direction we take. There are amazing moments with Marcello: the classic scene in the Trevi fountain with Sylvia where she jumps in with her stunning flowing gown and he joins her. She takes water and trinkles it over his head like a baptism. Just when it seems he is about to kiss her dawn has come and the moment is over. Reality has come back to Marcello. The scene with the two \"miracle children\" at the tree in the outskirts of Rome who claim they have visions of the Madonna (or Virgin Mary) and the crowds of media and people that tear the tree for souvenirs. But my two favorite scenes are the following: Marcello goes to a beach side restaurant where he tries to write and he gets into yet another fight over the phone with Emma. At this place he meets and flirts with a beautiful young waitress named Paola (Valeria Ciangottini who was about fifteen years old in her feature film debut). She is young, innocent, and untouched of the superficial life Marcello leads. She leads a very simple life without the complications and only wants to go home to her little hometown in Umbria. He compliments her beauty as an Umbrian Angel. He doesn't write and goes back to Emma. The scene was so sweet in a way that he almost wishes that he was her age again: to be young and start over and maybe even marry her. But that is not the case for Marcello. He would see her again at the very end of the film (a devastating scene and great acting on both sides by Mastroianni and Ciangottini): he is drunk and on the beach with his \"friends\" and is now completely lost of his ideals and ambitions. She is on the other end of the gulf asking him to walk with her. He doesn't hear her because of the loud waves crashing and he walks away with his \"friend\". She looks at him with such sweetness and no judgment but with hope. It is a heart breaking ending. This film is essential to future filmmakers out there today. Fellini and Mastroianni will be remembered and missed forever.",

The movie handles also with the essential question of redemption, a fundamental concept in our Christian form of thinking. The hero, Marcello, failed in his attempt of redemption along all the movie, but mainly in the magnificent final scene. The hero failure reflects the impotence of the modern man in surpassing the materialism and selfishness of the world we live.The character of Steiner, on the other hand, means the impossibility of Art and Philosophy by themselves get the redemption , one of the most estimated utopias of modern intellectual.The scene who shows his wife arriving at home after the husband suicide is one of the most impressive and touching in the film history.

            "content": "Some directors choose to direct films that are easy to watch, stories that expect us to be satisfied with a plot that leads exactly where we expect it to lead.  Thank god that Fellini is not such a director!Like the majority of Federico Fellini's work, \"La Dolce Vita\" is an aural attack, its dialogue is relentless, and often seemingly meaningless.  On top of that, at least 2 hours of the film seems to be composed of scenes that do not directly relate to the plot.  And what about the plot?  It seems uncertain, as if it had no intention of going anywhere.  So what, then, makes this, or any Fellini film, deserving of such praise as it has received?  The answer is: all of the above, and so much more.Watching this film for the first time can be excruciatingly confusing.  Had the ending been the first scene of the film, then perhaps it would be easier to watch for those with little patience.  Had he cut 2 hours of the film, then it would have been easier yet.  Fortunately, Federico's love for the cinema prevented him from committing such crime.  The reason, of course, is that there is, indeed, meaning in the confusion.  The film, from beginning to end, is saturated by symbolic images and words.  Some of the symbols are obvious, such as the dead fish for instance, others, like the white kitten, are rather obscure and require some knowledge to grasp the full meaning. Yet they all paint a canvas that leads right into the ending sequence, quite likely the most powerful image in the film.  The opening symbol of the virgin mary is an especially interesting theme that is revisited twice throughout the film, although it may take several screenings to understand how they all relate.  The onslaught of dialogue seems simplistic at first, but it, also, all leads up to the final conclusion, though some scenes must be played several times before their relation to the main theme becomes apparent.In conclusion, like all the great films, this is not something that can be fully grasped after just one viewing.  One can get the general idea, but it's not enough to be able to appreciate it for its true quality.  The symbolism is often vague, but it is there from start to finish, watch out for it, and only once it all comes together for you will you be able to appreciate the unparalleled genius of Federico Fellini.",

It may indeed be that for all I know but the fact is that I couldn't discern what on earth Fellini was trying to accomplish.The plot (what little of it there is) follows journalist Marcello Rubini (Marcello Mastroianni) as he lives the sweet life among the top tier of Rome's social strata. Yet, despite his carefree way of life he is unsatisfied and keeps searching for something more.The film plays out in a series of episodes rather than a linear plot. If they are meant to show a progression for the character I must have missed it. To me, Marcello at the end is virtually indistinguishable from Marcello at the beginning. Of course, the character doesn't necessarily have to change but otherwise the nearly three hour journey seems pointless.I can't complain about the acting, though. Mastroianni ably carries the picture when a lesser actor would have collapsed under the weight. The large supporting cast seems uniformly authentic though I can't help but wish that some individuals like Anita Ekberg & Anouk Aim\u00e9e had been featured more.On another positive note, Fellini's Oscar-nominated direction is practically flawless and is probably the film's greatest asset. Meanwhile, the film also sports attractive cinematography from Otello Martelli and a Nino Rota score (while also making use of mambo king Perez Prado's catchy \"Patricia\").Ultimately, I can see that there was great technical skill at work in the making of this picture but the storyline's obscurity is frustrating. When investing about three hours in a movie I'd like to be able to take away something from it. Instead I felt like Marcello on the beach as he tried to make out what young Paola was saying from across an estuary. I know that Fellini's trying to tell me something but he isn't making it clear enough for me to grasp it.",

He is stuck in the meaningless, dull, morally corrupt existence of a gossip writer who's life is one party and sexual conquest after another. He yearns for something substantial; a new life, a family, another job, anything to get him out of his rut. He idolized an older friend who is a professional with a majestic house and an adorable family, but is warned against such routes in life, being told that happiness and the life he wants \"doesn't lie within four walls.\" The tragic outcome of his friend's situation forces Marcello to make a decision and abandon his quest for meaning, falling back into a hedonistic lifestyle of debauchery and frivolous escapades. And, after reading other reviews, I understand the character of the girl on the beach and why she was there. Interesting, because at the time I was thinking 'what the hell is this about?'.

            "content": "La Dolce Vita has rocketed into my top five films of all time. I've watched the film probably 25 times and I'll watch it another 30. I originally rented the film because I made it a personal goal to watch all 100 of Roger Ebert's 100 best films of all time (rogerebert.suntimes.com). La Dolce Vita scores extremely well on many critics top films of all time and Federico Fellini is arguably Italy's greatest director. La Dolce Vita is the best known and loved of all Fellini's, works.I think I love this film so much, because I identify with it's main character, Marcello Rubini. For a short period in my life, I was a sort of Marcello. I lived my life at night, in seemingly exciting places, among the seemingly beautiful and interesting people. Each night began with the promise of excitement, adventure, and opportunity only to fade into the hard reality of the morning light.La Dolce Vita, literally translated into English means \"The Sweet Life.\" But the movie's enigmatic title is more a question than a statement. The main character, Marcello, lives his life at night patrolling Via Veneto, Rome's famous street of hip night clubs in the late fifty's and early sixty's. Marcello writes for a tabloid magazine and is caught in a revolving door, night after night, chasing the next big story, following the party trail, \"hobnobbing\" with Rome's \"big shots.\" He aspires to hearth, home, and serious, artistic work, but is continually \"pulled\" back into the hedonistic and seductive night life of Rome's jet-set. To outsiders, Marcello's life seems ideal. It literally seems like \"The Sweet Life,\" but Marcello secretly knows this is not true. His profound loneliness and chronic dissatisfied with his empty existence are obvious. Consider the scene in the caf\u00e9 by the sea with the idyllic young girl or his admiration of Steiner at his salon party. Marcello wants to be respectable and solid, but is not ready to \"turn his back\" on the excitement and uncertain adventure of Rome's nightlife.Interestingly, the film was made in 1959, the year I was born. It's a great \"period piece.\" It's interesting to see what the world was like in \"beatnik\" 1959 Rome. La Dolce Vita also introduced the world to the word \"paparazzi.\" (after Marcello's side kick, Paparazo (witch interestingly means sparrow in Italian).The film is filled with great symbolism. The opening scene in particular, is one of my favorites. Marcello, chasing a symbol of Christ (chasing virtue), but is distracted by the girls on the roof (sin, hedonism). I also love the scenes with the blond actress Sylvia, especially the classic scene in Rome's Trevi fountain. To me, Sylvia, represents every woman, and all of life's pleasures, so seductive, so alluring, teasingly close, yet unattainable. Notice how she keeps Marcello (and every man) off balance throughout her scenes. Notice how she reaches into the fountain and \"drips\" water (the symbol of life) on Marcello's head just before his dream of attaining her is abruptly shattered by the sunrise. But by far, my favorite scene is the last scene of the film. The young girl symbolizing stability, beauty, marriage, and virtue, calls out to Marcello from across a small tributary running to the sea. But because of the roar from the wind and waves, Marcello literately can not hear her. He is unready to \"cross the river\" and join her on \"the other side.\" He doesn't yet truly understand who she is or the value of her offer. Then, he is once again literally pulled back into his hedonistic group of friends and lifestyle.The film is long, and admittedly, an acquired taste - like good espresso. As much as I love foreign film, It took me two or three settings to get through it the first time. Then, after listening to the English commentary, I became infatuated with it. I finally \"got it,\" and couldn't quit watching it. Each time I watch it, even now, I see something else in the edges.But, I caution you, don't expect women to understand this film. My wife initially had a visceral aversion to it. Even after I explained in detail why it's not a lifestyle mature men aspire to, but a trap many young men fall into, she still has trouble with it. It's definitely a mans movie. It speaks to man's instinct to \"chase\" and man's love of adventure \u2013 maybe this night will be different, maybe the next woman I meet will be more beautiful than the last, maybe this party will be truly exciting, maybe this lover will offer the satisfaction I'm looking for. Especially with regard to relationships, many men, especially young men, would much rather live in \"empty uncertainty,\" than \"settle down\" to a stable life. Consider how the issue reaches a climax during Marcello's street lit, argument with his beautiful and loving girlfriend, Emma. Marcello sees Emma's unconditional love and devotion to him as a trap. He equates any acceptance of her offer to losing his manhood and becoming a \"worm.\" He sees Emma's unconditional love as a \"brutalization.\"The movie's uncertain ending is perfect. It's not a conclusion and is not meant to be. This confuses many movie goers accustom to a nice, neat Hollywood ending. The purpose of the movie, to me, is to communicate the loneliness and emptiness of a lifestyle that to outsiders seems ideal. It's a movie that conveys a \"feeling\" that the viewer either identifies with and understands or does not. Give it a chance and I know you eventually love it. I think Roger Ebert say it best when he writes: \"There may be no such thing as the sweet life. But it is necessary to find that out for yourself.\"",

You are mother, sister, lover, friend, angel, devil, earth, home. \" The main character of Fellini's La Dolce Vita says this to a movie star he has become infatuated with. Some say that La Dolce Vita represents the seven deadly sins on the seven hills of Rome: seven nights of sin and seven mornings of guilt and confusion. This theory is interesting. But either way, La Dolce Vita, almost three hours long, captivates you from beginning to end.\nAbout midway into La Dolce Vita, a character says: \"Don't be like me. Salvation doesn't lie within four walls. I'm too serious to be a dilettante and too much a dabbler to be a professional. Even the most miserable life is better than a sheltered existence in an organized society where everything is calculated and perfected.\" The main character of the film envies that speaker. He sees in the speaker everything that he has ever wanted to be: secure, and yet willing to admit his faults. By saying: `Don't be like me,' the speaker only sparks more envy. This speaker is a man who knows who he is, what he wants, what he likes and dislikes, where he is going. He's a man of humility and pride, of joy and sadness. The main character is never able to achieve what this man has. In fact, he finds no answers, only confusion. He spends long nights in darkness in sin, only to re-emerge with faded hope at dawn. Throughout his career, Federico Fellini made films in which he questioned himself, to know himself, to find answers. He strove to be that speaker with the soft, confident voice. He was never able to. His films were reflections on himself, and the main character was often just a form of him.      But most of the beauty of this movie lies in the images. A sea monster lying dead and open-eyed on a beach, two people talking to each other through a well in a wall, thousands of people flocking around two children who claim to have seen the Virgin, a blonde woman bathing in the Trevi Fountain, and a helicopter flying a statue of Jesus Christ over the streets of Rome.My grade: 9/10",

Even though Marcello declare this fact blatantly to Emma and refuses her, he turns back and take her. Then the life of for Marcello changes dramatically and Steiner suicides himself. ( to me Steiner and Marcello has a kind of shared life. Also at the airport when we see that the wife of Steiner looks like Emma herself). As Marcello had chosen the usual rules, marrying his unloved fianc\u00e9e, he had terminated his life. Marcello now is one of the bohemian peoples. With these people he lives the life as it comes, try to cheer themselves by perverts.\u0130n the movie, marriage is not good. It present a life between kitchen and the bedroom for Marcello. All the couples in the movie has problems. This very clear throughout the film. Marcello does not love her fianc\u00e9e and is cheating her. The American actress Sylvia looks very cheerful and flirtatious but is very unhappy and at loggerhead with her husband. Even we don't see the wife of the idealized Steiner. Last but not least the final party is about the celebration of a woman separating from her rich husband. The high society is chosen to show the contrasts of life, relations and classes blatantly. The army of freelance photographers which include the Marcello himself represent the lower class. Marcello with his talent and hard work had been able to raise his status and make strong connections with this class. He has his own flat and car, and he flirts with them a lot. the American actress, the parties in the chateaus, the cars, the borderline bohemians are the members of this very high society. The army of paparazzos, Emma, people gathered to listen to the story of little girls seeing Virgin Mary are member of the lower class. The media is good way to become a celebrity and climb to high society. we see this at the scene when two little girls tell that they see Virgin Mary and they try to catch the eyes of media, and people gather to watch this without regarding the heavy rain. As the alternative to marriage is not depicted in the movie, it implies that his is struggle of life.",

So I wasn't expecting to like 'La Dolce Vita' but thought I'd give it a go as I'd just come back from holiday in Rome. I was pleasantly surprised. Although three hours long, it didn't seem to drag, mainly because of the lyrical beauty of the photography which makes up for the lack of plot. (And as for beauty, Miss Ekberg has to be THE most beautiful actress of the black and white era, with the exception perhaps of Miss Bacall). While the film is about the nihilism of modern life, I would suggest Fellini is not completely against religion as a way of salvation. Although the gullible crowds at the shrine of the 'Madonna' come in for heavy attack, the no-nonsense priest refuses to accept it is a miracle, and the scene where the old man recieves the last rites after the crowds have departed is touching. And there is a suggestion that salvation can come in the form of the waitress on the beach, whom Marcello has previously described as 'looking like an angel from a church in Umbria'.",

Payne, PT Anderson -- it always surprises me how much this one film seems a template for much of their work. I do like the French auteurs of the same period and find many of their films fascinatingly complex works. But they rarely produce the same emotional response that this film does in me. This just feels more honest -- less caught up in being \"cool\" and promoting it's self as \"artistic.\" Something like 'Jules et Jim' just ages badly to me. 'La Doce Vita' feels so of our time, both in its style and plot-wise. Re-watching it this weekend, I was surprised how simple some of it came across. I always read about the complexity of structure, but there is still a bare bones character study at its core. The emotional core is brutal and honest, all the style and originality adds to that core as opposed to subtracts from it. That's what makes this film so damn timeless. With all the great style this film has, I never forget the shots of Mastroianni's face. (He gives one of the greatest performances ever put on film, by the way.) Requires multiple viewings. Also, it's fun to see the orgins of the word \"paparzzi.\"",

Thank god that Fellini is not such a director!Like the majority of Federico Fellini's work, \"La Dolce Vita\" is an aural attack, its dialogue is relentless, and often seemingly meaningless.  On top of that, at least 2 hours of the film seems to be composed of scenes that do not directly relate to the plot.  And what about the plot?  It seems uncertain, as if it had no intention of going anywhere.  So what, then, makes this, or any of Fellini film work, deserving of such praise as it has received?  The answer is: all of the above, and so much more.Watching this film for the first time can be excruciatingly confusing.  Had the ending been the first scene of the film, then perhaps it would be easier to watch for those with little patience.  Had he cut 2 hours of the film, then it would have been easier yet.  Fortunately, Federico's love for the cinema prevented him from committing such crime.  The reason, of course, is that there is, indeed, meaning in the confusion.  The film, from beginning to end, is saturated by symbolic images and words.  Some of the symbols are obvious, such as the dead fish for instance, others, like the white kitten, are rather obscure and require some knowledge to grasp the full meaning. Yet they all paint a canvas that leads right into the ending sequence, quite likely the most powerful image in the film.  The opening symbol of the virgin mary is an especially interesting theme that is revisited twice throughout the film, although it may take several screenings to understand how they all relate.  The onslaught of dialogue seems simplistic at first, but it, also, all leads up to the final conclusion, though some scenes must be played several times before their relation to the main theme becomes apparent.In conclusion, like all the great films, this is not something that can be fully grasped after just one viewing.  One can get the general idea, but it's not enough to be able to appreciate it for its true quality.  The symbolism is often vague, but it is there from start to finish, watch out for it, and only once it all comes together for you will you be able to appreciate the unparalleled genius of Federico Fellini.",

This film gave birth to the word Paparazzi.  And what do the paparazzi do for a living?  They follow celebrities and watch their every move....if \"you exist only in what you do,\" then the paparazzi exist only through other people; a very existential tone in this film.Indeed Marcello, the unfortunate hero of this la-la citta fairytale, who plays a celebrity/socialite gossip columnist, falls into the trap of \"other people.\" Hence the symbolic theme of imprisonment in the last party scene, in which everyone seems to be behind bars.\nI would not know about most La Dolce Vita fans, but I thought that Steiner was the real tragic hero of this film.  Here is a man at the top of the intellectual ya yas and the elite in this \"organized society, where everything is planned, everything is perfect,\" who fears nothing but his children, who valued nothing but the sounds of nature and were content. The American version of Steiner would be Holden Caufield, who wanted to be the Catcher in the Rye and save the children from falling into society's jungle. (at least that's who he reminded me of)If you like Fellini, I recommend watching this film. It's definitely at the top amongst the great neo-realist films.This is a movie you can simply watch and enjoy, but if you want to appreciate it a bit more, watch it again and look for all the symbolisms. Talent such as Fellini's is one I rarely see today.

Coming to a masterpiece this late brings out a strange mixture of emotions: you feel a little stupid to have taken this long to acquaint yourself with something so great (I felt the same when I finally heard Miles Davis's \"Kind of Blue\" in 1988 and Love's \"Forever Changes\" in 2000) but you feel fantastic because you've had that first rush, which would have faded if you'd seen it 30 years ago, that comes with discovering a great work. \"La Dolce Vita\" is like Antonioni's \"L'Avventura\" in that it's a compelling view of something that shouldn't be compelling: the idle rich, people whose lives are empty, the modern world's anomie. It's hard to say whether Fellini was trying to make a bold statement about the state of modern Italian society (he later made 'Satyricon': Rome, before Christ/After Fellini), or whether he was just trying to exorcise some of the demons of doubt that may have been tormenting him \u0096 whatever \u0085 he knows how to make something magical happen with cinema. There are bold juxtapositions of chaos and reverie, decadence and spirituality, ennui and innocence, all against the tableau of the Eternal City in all its glory and corruption and the unifying thread is Marcello, played by Marcello himself in all his glorious handsomeness. He's lost in this inchoate world \u0096 he's an impotent romantic and an idealist surrounded by cynics and finally he too is corrupted. But does any attempt to place a moral underpinning on this great movie make any real sense? Probably not \u0096 Fellini doesn't even really tell a story but there's so much great theatre in each of the set pieces: the pursuit of the buxom movie star, ending in the waters of the fountain; the children's vision of the Madonna and the madness that ensues; the journey to Rome's poor outskirts and the flooded apartment; the Jesus statue and the helicopter; the night out with Marcello's father; the little girl at the caf\u00e9; the weird fish; the striptease; the echoing room and Marcello's pathetic attempt to express love; the fight with the girlfriend; and so much more, that you're dazzled by this great artist at the height of his powers.",

Perhaps this film is Fellinis most profound work, it is certainly his darkest. And yet dark does not hit the mark, because his film is so full of life and hope.

With this, one may argue that Fellini \"lacked\" the kind of imagination that Antonioni and Tarkovskij displayed in their films;but then, it is in such \"directness\" that he was immediately able to drive home the point (many film critics brand \"L'Avventura\" and \"The Sacrifice\" as \"not suited to all tastes,\" but it is mainly because of the extremely difficult form of discourse the films have;\"La Dolce Vita,\" however, is not without something that may also repel the audience---no wonder it sparked controversy at the time of its first release).What could be more ironic for a film peopled with \"materialists,\" \"sensualists\" and \"fanatics\" than to be set in Rome, the seat of Catholic hierarchy ?      The main character, Marcello (performed by Marcello Mastroianni;even the character is his namesake, a way of \"living up\" to the role), is himself behaving and reacting in an ironical way.Coming to the Eternal City to do his job as a gossip/lifestyle columnist (key personalities are trooping over there), together with his buddy-photographer Paparazzo (again, a name that \"mirrors\" life), Marcello is gradually realizing that the life that surrounds him is \"full of lies, decorations and subterfuge.\"That he has to \"gift\" the Pope with a life-size marble statue of Jesus (brought hanging over Rome on a helicopter)before going through his job is a revealing proof of this.      As the reporter and the photographer scale through the city for the latest and juicy \"news,\" the fact that just about everybody else lives mainly \"for the moment,\" for what is immediately \"within one's reach\" only gains strength.",

The era in which the movie was shot was in Italy (Europe) Post-war, tracing painstakingly nonsense of a decadent life. At the beginning of the movie there was a helicopter flying out high carrying a statue of Jesus, in which the semi-naked girls reacted once they saw it by saying ''look look it's Jesus'' .Fellini is certainly subtle, but we can infer that Marcelo presence high on the helicopter was considered as a form of highness considered to be valuable and appreciated in the na\u00efve and materialistic eyes of his friends. Fellini is this movie breaks the rules of conventional narrative style, the film was told over Seven Days, the story follows a suave, ostensibly charming Journalist of the right-wing party tabloid, through his frantic yet boring nightlife. He is the epitome that Fellini chose to depict the meaninglessness of a post-war Italy, that have succumbed into social chit-chat caf\u00e9s and hectic boredom between the new rich and old aristocrat, prostitute, to single out the spiritual crisis that the society is suffering from despite all the superficialities that is shown off. Marcelo suffers from it as he goes from his faithful Emma that wants to have a stable life with him, to the American superstar Sylvia that has nothing but fame and plastic beauty to attract the attention of self-exhibitionist society. Marcelo realizes that his life is vapid and it lacks meaning ,that was his inspiration from his friend Steirein that he admired for the stability and he has a family , two kids, he organizes intellectual meetings with his friend. The latter poignantly said '' Sometimes at night the darkness and silence weighs upon me. Peace frightens me; perhaps I fear it most of all. I feel it is only a facade hiding the face of hell. I think, 'What is in store for my children tomorrow?' 'The world will be wonderful', they say. But from whose viewpoint? If one phone call could announce the end of everything? We need to live in a state of suspended animation like a work of art, in a state of enchantment. We have to succeed in loving so greatly that we live outside of time, detached....detached. Steirn on the contrary has a family, money, success, stability but still is trapped in the same turmoil as Marceliono. Thus the latter couldn't believe it when he knew about Steirn killed his two kids and then himself, therefore it affected him so much that he decided to Instead of moving from journalism to the higher realm of writing he contemplated, he sells out to become a public relations hack, a drunk, a decadent party boy, now within the milieu that he previously saw as the outsider, the reporter observing. He just couldn't settle himself down and think about; he nevertheless carried and continues with his glamorous but hollow life style. The film moved from the cabaret dancing and glamour celebrations to a somber dawn of day, the lights were dull, that Fellini hardly gives morning events much importance. His father would push us to think that he'll brings us some family feeling throughout his presence. This wasn't the case as his father easily plunged in the bitter sweetness of that exhibitionism night life, but it was ultimately his stamina that didn't afford him to. The film spans an era that seems not that new for us (now), it's a movie that struck me with its vividness and it still grows with time, that's one of the major marks of a truly great work of art. People don't believe in La dolce vita, they just join each other in a social-spectacular self-esteem, which is the symbol of decayed society. Something that society has built to undermine its own proper values. Marcelo our protagonist in la dolce greatly embodied all the questions that occurred in Fellini's mind, He was carried away by the greed and glamour and fictive-sophistication. He is the wasted-intellect in the middle of a boring yet spectacular irresponsible society. One of the marvelous scenes in La dolce vita is the orgy party, where there was different people from different ranks and stances in society, they tried to enjoy themselves, but none of that could happen, wherein our drunkard protagonist indulged himself in a series of disrespectful behavior towards the girls that nothing sensual nor affectionate could be felt from. Fellini juxtaposed the opening with a great final sequence, after the nasty party, the revelers poured out onto the beach at dawn, where a group of fishermen captured a dead big ugly mysterious Fish. At the same time an innocent young girl whom Marcelo had met early in the film catches his eye, she started to wave and mimicking to him to come to have a walk with her but Marcello either doesn't understand or refuses to understand. And if he did make contact to her he may have corrupted her too. This was an end from innocent eyes, an end asking for question to be asked, an end that is asking for honesty and true emotions, an end that has left us nevertheless somewhat clueless about what really Fellini wanted to entail by it. I'm leaving out so much more, including Marcello's relationships with his suicidal fianc\u00e9e and his strangely devoted relationship to his father, each of which only further underline Marcello's emptiness. This films is one that will need more than just one viewing to fully grasp its meaning, it'll keep dazzling you every time you watch it.",

            "content": "La dolce vita meant a lot for me. I first saw it while Mastroianni had just died some days before. I had never felt attracted by cinema before. This movie almost changed my life.I can still remember how three or four big scenes (I am sure everyone who really liked the film see what I am talking about: the helicopter flight, the Trevi foutain, the unreal argument between Mastroianni and his girl along an isolated road-just mark the surrounding sounds!- and of course the girl's farewell in the end) completely took me aback. All along the movie Fellini oppresses you by talk without any meaning or direction, it's full of sound and fury, but you know, it does not signify anything. Those big scenes come along then (always at dawn): they really are \"a bowl of fresh air\" (as we'd say in Belgium)and give you this strange feeling of getting liberated from the surrounding oppression. The last scene of the film is one of the most beautiful I ever saw. Its stylishness (look at Mastroianni's hands gesture)wins it all.Still, with time, and after seeing other of Fellini's films, I am struck by the Maestro 's lack of maturity. Ok, it's fine to tell a love story that goes nowhere and where none of the partners comes across the other. Still, you still have to be able to narrate the story. Fellini just can't. His characters rarely try to reach some mutual understanding: the only way Fellini manages to have his lovers together is by having them shout against the other (look at 8 1/2). There's no depth in his love stories (but that's perhaps an Italian tragedy): the way he tells them is much too stylish and stylishness, in this case, is, to me, one of the Maestro's biggest shortcomings.La Dolce Vita still haunts me. I forget the immaturity (just as I forget it with some of my favourite Fellini's movies) and just gape. This movie changed my life. After all it's cinema as well. I like maturity but when a genius tells you something you just bow and in this case: WATCH!",

            "review_title": "Happiness: It's a paradox.",
            "content": "Over the three hours of its run time, you will be drenched in the visual excesses of Fellini's extraordinary tale of a man who wanders around the streets of Rome searching for something that keeps eluding him well into perpetuity: happiness.And therein lies the glowing paradox of its title. As you can see, this was my second viewing. On my first watch a couple of years ago, I was left poker faced. Though, even then I was taken by its abstract elements such as the protagonist's aimless drifting, Steiner's philosophy and his undoing by himself, etc., but I didn't much understand its nuances. This time around, it gradually became clear to me: Marcello's desperate search for everything that he aspires to but couldn't so much as to reach for it. When the film ended I was thoroughly exhausted even to think of what had I just witnessed.Marcello, the protagonist, is a gossip columnist and his living is typically marked by running around celebrities, famous personalities and aristocrats for their stories and secrets. There is one thing I think in this film that will keep its flow interesting and over the years had made it to age exceptionally well: the characters in this film are always moving (not in the sense of your ordinary action movie); there is always something vividly happening on screen and it's sort of big. Marcello is endlessly after women and their little adventures. He follows Maddalena, who herself doesn't know what to do, who he picked up in a nightclub. In another sequence he's after the movie star, Sylvia (Anita Ekberg), who he considers to be 'everything'. He instantly takes a liking to her, imagining her to be the dream woman he'd been idealizing and fantasizing about. She, in turn, returns the compliment by leading him into the streets of Rome and there is that famous scene by the fountain. She sets herself free, does anything she wanted knowing that Marcello is behind her to take her home. Perhaps it may suggest the impulsive transition one goes through when their insecurity disappears albeit momentarily.The structure of the film is quite well known: a series of nights and dawns at when the sequences of the film happens one after another. There is another running theory that the film symbolically represents the seven sins and all that. It may and may not but frankly I find it analytically stupid.Though I don't know which way Fellini intended it but I found the sequence involving the sighting of Madonna to be perfectly satiric. Loads of people were led in the middle of night by two children who claim to have spotted Madonna (or Virgin Mary if you will). Blindly believing them, they bring their sick and terminally ill acquaintances to the spot hoping Madonna will cure them all. Of course, She didn't. Marcello in the meanwhile is there haplessly witnessing all this.And the sequence involving Steiner, the intellectual whose fa\u00e7ade is broken to pieces when he tells Marcello that he isn't really what he thinks so highly of him and the further proof the film provides are emotionally shocking. In fact, they represent two different and opposite extremes; it is singularly ironic that how Steiner insists on why he prefers the miserable, more insecure life of Marcello's and how Marcello envies Steiner's tightly knit community.Marcello's predicament, I suppose, is that he idealizes many things in his life but never gets around to stick with one and believe in it fully which constitutes his rather fruitless search. In other words, a man without a center as Ebert called it. He even tries to write hoping to alleviate his disillusionment. In the sequence with his father, watching him getting all pumped up with the help of champagne, Marcello even confesses to his friend that he never really knew his father and reminisces about his youth, basically pointing out (to us) the emotional disconnection from the world he'd been bestowed with right from his childhood days.My most favourite sequence is the one that happens in the car involving Marcello and his fianc\u00e9e, Emma. All throughout the film, she's been anything but a headache to him. This time it gets intense with him brutally confessing his fear of her 'maternal' love and selfish ideals. It's interesting in a way that all she ever wants of him is his love alone in return for hers and Marcello's tragedy is that he searches for love everywhere else except at the one who really loves him.I never knew this film contributed the term Paparazzi to the language. There are photographers literally everywhere in the film swarming in and around, snapping pictures mostly invading the privacies of individuals, be it covering the arrival of a movie star or getting the expression of the wife of an intellectual who is about to receive the news of her husband's death.It would be a sin not to mention Nino Rota's score. At once it's zippy, at times sad, and at others provides the perfect background for the Fellini's on-screen wanderers. The acting is simply all-embracing. Mastroianni lived the role of Marcello and he is one of the two reasons (the other being Fellini) why you could instantly identify with so disheartening a character.Original screenplays like this require a profound vision of life as one sees it. With the motifs and theme that are quite difficult to comprehend even in words, Fellini and his co-writers had brought us something phenomenal, the one that evidently transcends time. That is why it remains a classic to date.Of the handful of sequences this film is made of, I have described only a few, the ones that I liked and regarded with high admiration, and understood in its entirety. This film can be interpreted in many more ways, that I am sure, too, everyone will have some reading of their own.",

First of all, Mastroianni's acting is brilliant, no doubt about it. As for the film itself, I wouldn't go as far as saying that I loved it. Yet, I certainly didn't dislike it. The very fact that I sat through the entire 3 hours while enjoying myself and never a second feeling bored, probably speaks very much in favour of the film. And I'm certainly not easy to please and don't have any hesitations about switching a DVD off halfway through if I think the story is going nowhere, or if it actually threatens to put me to sleep.But no such worries here. I can understand that it's probably a love or hate thing, and while some people praise it, others are very negative about it. I'm sure I wouldn't have appreciated it at all only a few years ago. Now it's different. As a \"novice\" to this genre, I certainly couldn't claim that I understand the whole meaning and the message Fellini wanted to send his viewers. For that, perhaps, I would need to watch it again (and I very well may). But even if I may not fully understand it, at least it has left me with a sense of \"satisfaction\" of having sat through the 3 hours, a similar satisfaction I get from a lot of European films.

            "review_title": "Utter perfection!!!!",
            "content": "What makes a film unforgettable? What makes it transcendental? What's more, what makes it a stepping stone in cinema history for other films and what makes it a perennial classic that lives on and on, talked-about and never-endingly revered by cinema buffs and general audiences alike? Well, I believe it's a well-balanced combination of perfect directing, a practically flawless screenplay, entrancing acting, adequate music and a production design that compliments all of the above. In that case, Federico Fellini's \"La Dolce Vita\" fills all of the requirements.It's about a reporter (Marcello Mastroianni) for an Italian tabloid, who spends his days and his nights mingling around the high society and writing about what everyone comes to know as \"the sweet life\". Throughout the film, we follow him as he encounters a wide variety of these kinds of people, and has he traverses through their lives and their life styles. We see him befriending a famous American actress (Anita Ekberg), an insanely wealthy socialite (Anouk Aim\u00e9e) who's also his lover, we see his dysfunctional relationship with an overprotective and suicidal girlfriend (Yvonne Furneaux), his adoration for his cultivated and very wise mentor (Alain Cuny), his disinterested and estranged father (Annibale Ninchi) and a colourful cast of other characters who perfectly exemplify precisely that- the \"sweet life\" of the rich people we've all come to alternately adore and hate.As any truly great piece will do, this film isn't simply about telling a good story, but about making a point on various topics and using not only plot and dialogue, but settings, costumes and images to deliver a complete tour-de-force. I've also learned from expert film critics such as Roger Ebert about the symmetrical quality the scenes have of expressing said points.The first scenes, where Marcello, our hero reporter, meets with the witty and ninphomanous wealthy lover are charged with a sexual tension that's shocking in its openness and the lack of importance and obvious normality all the characters involved give the situation. These are people who are completely hedonistic and nihilistic, for whom nothing is sacred, for who immorality is celebrated and who seek amusement in what should probably be unthinkable to 'normal' society. We begin to establish our hero's personality and moral dilemma, as he strives to become a part of this renowned society but as he recognizes he's vaguely admitted but seldom noticed as a valuable member.Notice for example the scene with the American actress, her dull and certainly dim-witted personality, and how her looks and fame alone make people swoon and kiss her shadow, while her personality reveals an emotionally empty person and a tedious/boring character. She leads Marcello, our hero, in a wild romantic chase, seeming available but impervious to his obvious fascination for her.The next scene, where the people's boredom and disrespect for religion is mixed with those who's fanaticism and adoration for all this sacred clash, is yet another type of chase, where it's not Marcello himself who's led in a chase, but the whole idea of morality in itself.Basically, every scene makes a point on a certain area of society, subtly using images and dialogue to show the viewer the truth behind what the \"sweet life\" is idealized to be. The film begins with a statue of Jesus Christ being carried by helicopter to the Vatican City, and the film ends with a group of rich people leaving a crazed orgy at dawn and finding a sea monster caught in some fishermen's net. Roger Ebert will tell us that the beginning shows us something beautiful but fake and distant (the statue), while the end shows us something horrible but real and palpable (the sea monster). I completely agree with him. That's what Fellini intended to do: he showed the life of the rich and famous in it's entirety, and we begin by seeing it as something beautiful, amazing, something we would like to be a part of...but something that's far away and unobtainable. The ending sums up what we saw about the so-called sweet life, being monstrous and gruesome, but as real and as current as we live today.Each of the main characters Marcello encounters (the actress, the wealthy lover, the suicidal girlfriend, etc...) are perfectly developed and we can gather a great amount of knowledge from them. The actress with her lack of care and infuriating stupidity, the lover with no grasp on the term \"love\" and a constant seeker of sex, the girlfriend, exceedingly overprotecting and yet lovable in her devotion, Marcello's mentor (the wisest and most profound of these who we draw vitality from and who, by the end of the film, has destroyed the only hold on whatever sanity we might have found in this kind of people)...these are all people who reinforce and re-affirm the structure of the film.Nino Rota's score is perfect, a m\u00e9lange of musical genres adhering themselves flawlessly to each scene. The cinematography is epic, enveloping us in the moment, missing nothing and admitting into our view everything that goes on, at times in perspective, at times introspective. The costumes, settings, etc...well, they're amazing.And Marcello's character. It changes and turns around countless times, revealing this sad, sad man who can't possibly make up his mind about anything, and who has come to depend so much on this life that's taking his soul away. It's astounding, I tell you! I saw this film about three years ago, and while it shocked me and left two or three memorable images, I made nothing out of it. Now I see it again while trying to review it as fairly and as professionally as I can and I can fully claim it to be one of the greatest movies I've ever seen.Rating: 4 stars out of 4!!",

After the vision I think the title should be \"The bitter-sweet life\"; it's because the director shows us a protagonist (Marcello)living in a Rome full of V.I.P in parties, beautiful women, smart clothes but it's a fake world, a world where he can't taste a simple but essential feeling like real love, real friendship. Marcello is fought between the desire of a career as a novelist (a new life, a rewarding job) and his actual life of scandalistic-journalist. Moreover in the movie we can see the desperation of some characters as Steiner or Maddalena and the desolation Of Roman Aristocracy. Fellini conducts us with Marcello searching something, something he'll never find. We can follow the protagonist through his highs and lows and all this happens sometimes in a splendid Rome and sometimes in very poor quarters. Fellini makes the spectator meet a lot of secondary characters with their happiness, sadness, weakness and their own beauty. Yes this is the peculiarity of this movie, It says many things even if sometimes it doesn't seem. During the projection I felt a sensation of interest and curiosity grow up. A sort of magic took me and the atmosphere of this old movie seized me.I think you've realized that I liked this movie and the doubts of Marcello, and not only the doubts (I'm talking about his success with women for example eh eh).

Marcello (played wonderfully by Fellini favorite Marcello Mastroianni) is a tabloid reporter living temporary existence in the shallow world of high-class society. He is a man of emotional paradox who loves to flirt with pretty dames, a part of his routine life. He dreams about creative writing but he's so vague about it. He remains seduced by money, fame and prestige under the influence of decadent society where there's huge vacuum of moral values and everyone pursues pleasure. He's so much into the mud that even in the climactic moment of the film and his life; he couldn't recognize the pure last hope of his life. One can't think of any more realistic ending here. A beautiful symbolic metaphor by Fellini.Modern man has become so much disconnected from the natural world and now he's suffering from that conditioning only. In a way, Marcello is the great symbol of today's modern, urban human condition trapped in absurd mundane life without any significance. He's trapped in the world full of 'eat, drink and have a sex' kind of high society culture where everything is bizarre, duping and lacking any higher significance. Apart of Marcello's old intelligent friend Steiner who commits suicide is the voice of pure soul for him. Marcello adores him more than anybody and he's his idealized perfect version of what he wanted to be and we see plenty of irony when Steiner uttered anything in the film.Fellini was an artist par excellence. Watching every frame of this B&W film seems like visiting classic portrait art gallery. There are so many indelible images which stay in my memory for long time. The initial helicopter scene with statue of Jesus flying over Rome, famous fountain scene of Anita Ekberg (can any dame looks so erotic and voluptuous as this Swedish beauty!!!), the candlelit procession at castle, the man who can move balloons with his music etc. etc. The cinematography and background score are just awesome. It's Fellini's distinct style of blending fantasy with reality which made him adorable filmmakers of world cinema. Though the film is nearly three hours long, I almost enjoyed every bit of its artistic bliss and love to watch it another and another times till I die.The film won many awards including prestigious Palme d'or at Cannes and three Academy Awards including Best Director and Best story/screenplay.

            "review_title": "Fellini's 'Divine Comedy' !!!",
            "content": "'La Dolce Vita' is a film which very noticeably showcases Fellini's transition from his neo-realist roots to the outrageously surrealist style of filmmaking which became his quintessential style later labeled with the word 'Felliniesque'. This is a really, really interesting film. 'Interesting' in the way that although I absolutely understand its appeal, its richness and its philosophical depth, but I can't help but feel a sense of emotional detachment and sense of boredom every time I watch the film. The funny thing is, the emotional detachment is very much deliberate because Fellini clearly wants the viewer to be kept at a distance reflecting Marcello's constant sense of alienation from his surroundings.I read somewhere once (which I agree with) that 'La Dolce Vita' is a reverse retelling of Dante's 'Divine Comedy' since in this case, the protagonist makes the journey from heaven to hell in the thematic sense as is very overtly symbolised in the opening as well as the ending scenes which act as mirror images to each other in the way they both use Christian imagery as well as a gap in communication(in the opening scene Marcello can't be heard, while in the closing scene it is Marcello who can't hear someone else's words). 'La Dolce Vita' uses such Christian imagery and thematic expressions to reflect the hollow state of existence in the midst of the rampant consumerism and materialism during the economic boom of urban Italy during the late 1950s and early 1960s. The superficiality of the shallow life in urban Italy at the time is very explicitly depicted in the film, again very overtly symbolised by the constant presence of the paparazzi that suffocates most scenes. It is a film that clearly makes fun of the aristocratic class as well as the upper elites and socialites with the ridiculous loudness and extravagance, but every little vignette in the film also includes moments of silence which juxtapose the over-the- top loudness. It is in these moments of silence that Fellini spells out the loneliness and pointlessness of their lives. The central character of Marcello is a tabloid journalist who is leading his life in the most passive manner possible. He is constantly on the search for something or someone(Steiner or the women) that will show him that secret happiness and sense of fulfillment. But unfortunately that secret, that magical spiritual connection constantly eludes him throughout the film. The cinematography is absolutely spectacular. The black & white visuals are incredibly vibrant, the use of lighting is absolutely meticulous and the frame compositions are extremely visually appealing. Marcello Mastroianni's performance is brilliant as he perfectly captures the passive nature of his character with spurts of emotions from time to time. What keeps me from completely embracing the film is what I have already mentioned is actually deliberate. 'La Dolce Vita' deliberately uses excess. The debauchery goes on an on, one segment after another. Just like Scorsese does in 'The Wolf of Wall Street', Fellini uses decadence, excess and debauchery in a very repetitive, almost oppressive and unsubtle way. Now even though I can understand what it signifies and I can also understand why the 7 day sequence might have been essential in the narrative if the 'Divine Comedy' structure was being rigidly implemented, but every time I watch 'La Dolce Vita', I can't help but feel a little bored by the monotony of the circus- like visuals and the 3 hour length of the film adds to the overbearing boredom.",

Wealth and poverty, spectacular and mundane, beautiful and grotesque, spiritual and commercial, meaningful and trite---what we have vs. what we yearn for... what we are and what we could have been if we tried harder... Everything centers around Marcello Mastrionni, handsome but frustrated, loved but unable to truly love what he has in return, free to pass through all echelons of society, but forever trapped. After a party end in suicide, time passes and we find Marcelo older and single and the \"intellectual\" patron of younger party-goers. But the party has gone on a long time, the ideal attained is less sweet than when it was dreamed of.... nor as beautiful as Marcello and his paparazzi once promoted it. As the party goers step into the morning sun, they still smile but are separated from and no longer understand things natural nor innocent... they can only continue living \"the sweet life\" of the beautiful and the rich, that most people idealize for from their own mundane, working lives. 10 stars out of 10.",

            "content": "La Dolce Vita (1960) Glitz, glamour. Alakazam. A gorgeous opening scene; a helicopter flying over Italy with a statue of Christ. A great vantage overlooking the Vatican from St Peter's dome. A heavenly escape to Italy's Trevi Fountain. Nightclubs, parties, beaches, forests. A religious retreat that ends in tragedy. A lavish soir\u00e9e in a stately abandoned castle. A sudden turn to the serious with Steiner's murder of his children and suicide. More drinking. More partying. More socializing. Celebrities, models, prostitutes, and the best thing that came from this film- the word paparazzi (named after Marcello's most disrespectful, vexing photographer friend, Paparazzo). Favorite scene is not the obvious opening one, nor the night that Sylvia, followed by Marcello, wade through the Trevi Fountain. It was the trumpet player and his floating follower balloons at the Cha-Cha. Alright. Followed very closely by Maddalena's coquettish marriage proposal. I mean, it was via an echo chamber in a castle that could have been an art museum. How much more romantic can we get? (That is, until Fellini popped that bubble for us, with another man appearing out of nowhere to kiss her) Favorite character was Steiner. Erudite, insightful, sensitive, and real. Of course, in some of the most emotionally captivating shots, we see the tragic results of his suicide as he sits, bloody and forlorn, hunched over in his living room. Of course, geniuses are often the most unfortunate with mental afflictions. Some of his wisdom: \"Don't be like me. Salvation doesn't lie within four walls. I'm too serious to be a dilettante and too much a dabbler to be a professional. Even the most miserable life is better than a sheltered existence in an organized society where everything is calculated and perfected.\" \"Sometimes at night the darkness and silence weigh upon me. Peace frightens me; perhaps I fear it most of all. I feel it is only a facade. I think, 'What is in store for my children tomorrow?' 'The world will be wonderful', they say. But from whose viewpoint? When one phone call could announce the end of everything? We need to live in a state of suspended animation like a work of art, in a state of enchantment. We have to succeed in loving so greatly that we live outside time, detached.\" Marcello is not a very likable man, and most of the characters are not only pretentious but fake. That is what is at the heart of this film, after all. An examination of the lengths we all go to present ourselves in a positive light to others. As a psychological character study, this film has its strengths. A lot going on. Supposedly, we have seven episodes, representing seven deadly sins, seven sacraments, seven virtues, seven days of creation. The seven principal episodes are as follows (via Wikipedia): 1. Marcello's evening with the heiress Maddalena (Anouk Aim\u00e9e) 2. His long, frustrating night with the American actress Sylvia (Anita Ekberg) that ends in the Trevi fountain at dawn 3. His reunion with the intellectual Steiner (Alain Cuny); their relationship is divided into three sequences spread over the entire film: a) the encounter, b) Steiner's party, and c) Steiner's tragedy, 4. The fake miracle, 5. His father's visit/Steiner's Party 6. The aristocrat's party/Steiner's tragedy, 7. The \"orgy\" at the beach. Some liked the episodic structure; I found it made for a very confusing, formless storytelling. It is telling that the best parts of the film are also when the least is going on. His moments with Steiner, when Marcello becomes honest with himself and his friend, examining where he is in life and how he truly feels about it; and then when he is forced to at least momentarily cease the partying and women to face the facts of his unexpected murder suicide. The other scenes where this film is at its best are those between Marcello and his father. We are saddened to see his discouragement at the distance between father and son, cheer to witness them reconnect for the night, and despair ourselves as we watch despair surface on his face as his father rides away into the night, seemingly abandoning him on the dark, empty street. During an interview, Sylvia says, \"I like lots of things. But there are three things I like most. Love, love and love.\" That reflects this film well. An excessive film about excess. Many great scenes. Many not so great scenes. The listlessness of the famous. The pettiness of the rich. The ridiculousness of the religious. The iniquities of the everyday man. 3 hours long, 106 characters. Fellini could have had a real winner here, had he only not been so greedy. Ironically, that doubles as the moral of the film from Marcello's perspective. Marcello's character is actually based on Fellini. And we have come full circle. Maybe this is a genius masterpiece after all? #FilmReview",

I really appreciate this movie as art and as a vision of life, but I can't saw this movie impacted me in a positive way, I was quite down after watching this. For me it shows the decadence, emptiness, superficiality and lost of any meaning of our civilization. La Dolce Vita affected me so much emotionally that it might take me a while to watch it again, but touching me like that is surely the sign of a special movie.10/10",

            "content": "Man, I couldn't get through this movie.  I was watching a dvd I ordered through ebay.  I never saw the movie before and bought it based on recommendations.  The dvd was like seven dollars so I figured I might as well buy it instead of going and renting a vhs.  The dvd first of all is of horrible quality.  The image is jerky and blurry, but I've enjoyed movies with worse quality that this.  I watched it for about an hour and found myself immensely irritated by the lack of anything interesting going on. Anita Ekberg is gorgeous of course, but that's not enough to keep me watching a movie.  A problem I'm also facing with this one, but not as bad, is having to read the subtitles.  I watched 8-1/2 on the criterion dvd collection which was way better in quality, but that movie was very tough to follow.  I've never seen subtitles go by so quickly.  They were so quick I found that I couldn't even bring my eyes to the picture without another subtitle popping up to distract me.  Often I found myself rewinding it because I took a sip of pop and missed three lines of speech.  I like to absorb the images on screen and when I am reading more than watching it really takes me out of the movie experience.  Too bad dubbing almost always sucks though (can't recall if the dvd even had dubbing).  I suppose I don't really have the right to comment on this movie considering I didn't finish it, but if I'm unable to finish a movie I cannot recommend it.",

There would be showings every night at eight, plus matinees at two every Wed., Sat., Sun. This was nothing new. Several films, such as \"The Ten Commandments\", had done the same to great effect.

            "content": "Most films are usually filled with scenes that have some kind of relevance to the plot and the main theme of the film. Unfortunately, La Dolce Vita does not. First off, the good part about the film was that it was ofcourse wonderfully shot. Modern day Rome has never looked better due to the excellent black and white cinematography. It captures the sleaze and the filth of the place like no other since Sweet Smell of Succes did so for New York.The bad part is unfortunately that there is no story to speak of. Halfway in the movie you keep witnessing it going from scene to scene from characters to characters out of nowhere and you wonder how this is at all connected to the main picture? Our main character, Marcello Rubini is ofcourse well played by Marcello Mastroianni, but his character is immoral and selfish and this does not change over the course of the film. He goes to a family, some people seeking ghosts, parties, miracles, spends time with his dad and a lot of other things that are not related in any way. This causes the film to create new characters and abandon just established ones all the time. It just doesn't work. The only reasonably interesting character is probably Steiner, yet unfortunately with his storyline very little is done once again.Some people claim La Dolce Vita has depth. But what kind of depth is there to a series of non related events? I think one needs to have a very big imagination to see any kind of psychological depth in this film, because it didn't have any. Not to mention the obnoxious loud weather noises constantly being a pain to the ears. I am not particularly a big fan of for example Andrei Tarkovsky and his way of filmmaking without any kind of storytelling ( Usually ) yet i can see the depth and the art in his pictures, but in this Fellini flick, it just isn't there, except for the stylish way it was filmed in.In the end it is about a bunch of events that are not related to the main plot and there is just no character development in all these immoral characters whatsoever. Stylish, but devoid of a real story.",

            "review_title": "An interesting but overrated film that can get boring at times",
            "content": "This is a film about seven days worth of the adventure of a celebrity journalist played by Marcello Mastroianni, mostly about him chasing the tails of various women, but there is a lot more to it than that.This movie is a cynic. It keeps introducing a situation and then showing the somber dirty layer underneath it. The writing is pretty good in how it exposes the dirty drama and shows the contrast between sensations and real suffering. I can see why the church got angry at this film. There is a good bit of religious content in the film and it is treated with equal cynicism, with a whole scene dedicated to showing how a miracle is handled.The biggest problem is that the story is inflated and certain parts are hard to follow. The movie opens with a Jesus statute being transported to the Vatican. Why? What is the purpose of the scene? Who are these girls the main character is suddenly talking to and why? Never really explained. It has something to do with the religious symbolism of the film but does not feel very obvious or relevant . The fact that the movie covers 7 days is supposed to be meaningful but who is honestly going to notice that? Do you count things like the number of days when you watch a movie, unless someone told you about it in advance? Of course you do not, so it is useless.The movie is under three hours but feels more like 30 hours. Some conversations seem to go nowhere. There is a scene that drags on forever in which a bunch of people are exploring a haunted house. There are all these random people that start appearing towards the end. In combination with the style of dialogue, this movie can feel like a drag, especially towards the end.The dialogue has a slight poetic color to it, and as a result, there are sentences that will fly past the average viewer. But most of it is interesting and grabs attention.Acting is of mixed quality. For one, it has a specific sterile style to fit the aforementioned stylized dialogue and takes some time getting used to. At times it feels like two actors are having an abstract conversation on an avant-garde stage. Another thing is that, while most actors are good, some are not. Anita Ekberg playing a busty American actress made a mess of fakeness out of her role, with her dubbing in particular being very poor. The spoken dialogue in general is badly lip-synced.The movie is very Italian in its visuals. The actors are smoking as they are drinking and wearing sunglasses that look like they were the pinnacle of fashion of the time in which the movie was made.The cinematography is good when it comes to art, to transferring a message to the viewer, but can be quite bad when it comes to the technical aspects with a few glaringly obvious annoyances.There is this one scene in particular where two actors are standing in front of what is clearly a blurry movie screen rather than a real background. They speak something but their dialogue is poorly lip-synced. There is a very obvious glimmering wire attached the hat of an actress, which then gets pulled and the hat flies off simulating wind.Mind you, this is a movie that had enough money to shoot scenes with the helicopter carrying a big statue from above, a scene that was not even that important, but apparently could neither film on location nor find an alternative location that could work.In the past filming of people against a film background was common when shooting inside vehicles but in this movie it is overused and especially obvious. Movies usually attempt to hide the blemishes, for example by only showing the scene for a short time. In La Dolce Vita, the camera always takes its sweet time.La Dolce Vita is a curious bag of interesting scenes but also scenes that are overstretched, with over-the-top dialogue and technical issues. Nonetheless, La Dolce Vita has impact and is worth watching just for that.",

At that time (made 1959, released 1960) it seemed that all the new money was being made in America; all the hottest stars and starlet girls were in Hollywood; all the technology and new invention was in America (but Sputnik), and so on.However, America still did seem to be sexually uptight. As well there did remain and there was rebuilding, old and new wealth in Europe.La Dolce Vita was all about old money and Euro libertine/decadent ways reasserting themselves, in many ways as an exaggeration to find a way to counter American \"mindspace\" supremacy at the time.That of course made it very popular among American intellectuals who were themselves looking for ways to counter (and individual more brainy than rich or connected men to be alpha to girls in doing so) the American establishment.",

Marcello Mastroianni is superb, a beautiful exterior with an interior that is dying, slowly but surely. The term \"paparazzo\" was coined in this film. The hunters of the banal grew in numbers over the years but not in scope, Anita Ekberg became a symbol of the sixties and who was she? A fantasy, impossible to reach. Real is his wife, the splendid Yvonne Fourneaux. Real is his father, played with heart breaking resignation by Annibale Ninchi or the suicide of his close friend, the intellectual played by Alain Cuny.

            "content": "Fellini. The very word strikes fear into the heart of some linear film goers. But to others he is a God of film, people demand respect for him and follow his leads. La Dolce Vita is a film where there's no real plot, but the many misadventures of a writer Marcello as he travels around Rome looking for the latest gossip, story and fun.La Dolce Vita is a film full of strong opposites that blend themselves in together almost seamlessly. The infamous opening scene of two helicopters flying across Rome during the day, one of them carrying a giant statue of Jesus Christ, goes quickly from a pure and holy symbol to an older man, Marcello, hitting on some younger girls. The next scene opens up with a close up shot of a mask from the east and performance during night. The eastern religious event is seen as entertainment. Western religion up against Eastern religion. Day against night. West meets east happens later in the film when the Virgin Mary is seen in the tree by the two young children in the country side. The location which was once peaceful and run down quickly becomes a media circus and descends into absolute chaos showing off the greedy side of humanity. Perhaps it's social commentary about religion and how it feels like it is just a game or that people believe in whatever the seers see. This scene is followed by a more sober and calmer party after a funeral for a friend of Marcello. Here once again the east is shown with great appreciation.La Dolce Vita also focuses on the work of paparazzi who Marcello usually works with. The rabid dog like want to get the picture for the paper and get paid the most. The photographers chase after the statue in the helicopter in the beginning, they go after Italian royalty, to film starlet to high class socialites to the children who see the Virgin Mary. The paparazzi seem to be around just when things are going bad: the Virgin Mary tree being ripped apart, Sylvia and her boyfriend fighting at the club and at the hotel and the Italian royal being caught with another woman. But they are never around when Sylvia takes care of a small kitten, or when Marcello gets closer to his father, or when Sylvia reaches the top of the Vatican tower. Nothing sells like bad news.As Marcello is traveling around Rome he realizes that he is surrounded by people who are either happy: Sylvia is a carefree raising actress who enjoys a good time, his father as a man full of experience and is still having fun, his rich acquiescence has an easy going life, his mentor is married, has two kids and a loving wife and a good job. But on closer inspection: Sylvia has a jealous boyfriend who abuses her twice in the movie, his father lied to his mother and to Marcello about things he did, his rich socialite friend is bored with her life and his mentor kills his kids and himself. Marcello's own attempts at having a happy life by try having a few nights with his rich friend last just that, a night or so. He tries to woo Sylvia, but looses out. He tries to be a good boyfriend to his girlfriend but they don't work out. Marcello finds himself lost, looking for something he doesn't have and can't seem to hold on to for more then a few minutes, happiness. La Dolce Vita may not make sense to many people when they first see it. They may see it as a long boring movie with no real start or end, but it's after the movie is done and discussion starts and the movie sets in and the viewer realizes what they just saw. Fellini has earned his respect.",

            "content": "Federico Fellini's \"La Dolce Vita\", set in Rome, Italy of 1960 follows a gossip columnist, Marcello, through his engagements within the city's decadent high society. The film is widely viewed as a critique of modern morality and the frivolous concerns of pop culture, but Marcello, since he is the character of focus and the only character that consistently is followed in the film is portrayed with much more sympathy and redeeming value than the more shallowly portrayed passing characters.The film begins with a statue of Christ flying through Italy being delivered on a helicopter to the Pope signifying the fact that the country the film takes place is/was still considered a very religious and traditional country largely controlled by the Church despite the decaying sense of values within the richest segment of population. Even the lower-class workers, representing an older Italy, seem self-centered and sensationalist when around the middle of the film there is a media frenzy springing from a reported sighting on the Virgin Mary in a small town. The elderly pose for the media, there are near riots, and little attention is paid to any reality of the situation.As the film unfolds Marcello's actions become less and less rational, and his situation more and more hopeless. It is not clear whether Marcello is actually rich or upper-class or if he is just following the lifestyle of the rich and famous for his own pleasure and amusement, and for the purposes of his job as a writer meant to chronicle the lives of these people. It is clear however that throughout the film Marcello expresses deep disenchantment and discontentment with the life he is living, as do several other character in the film.Marcello's girlfriend Emma attempts suicide, possibly for Marcello's attention since he only seems to express any care or regard for her when she is near death, and once she recovers again he goes back to ignoring and showing contempt towards her. In one of Marcello's most irrational sequences in the film he repeatedly orders Emma out of his car, and out of his life only to invite her back and then out again, revealing his confused and apathetic state. It is not clear there are any real feelings between Emma and Marcello at all as portrayed in the film.Marcello's father visits him near the end of \"La Dolce Vita\", and he is quickly enchanted by the extravagance of his son's profession and The Via Veneto, the main street of Rome's elite chronicled in the film. However after only several hours living in \"the sweet life\" his father is sickened and depleted and wishes to go back to his home as soon as possible. Marcello is already desensitized to the perils of his environment and doesn't understand his father's apparent shock, and the people accompanying Marcello and his father on their night on the town just don't seem to care.Marcello's educated upper-class friend Steiner has parties of that consist of reading poetry, discussing philosophy, playing music, and listening to field recordings of natural sounds. He has a family who he apparently cares about, and a life of apparent luxury. It seems out of place and confusing in the scheme of the more prevalent careless and hedonistic Rome. Soon after the party Marcello learns that Steiner has committed suicide and killed all his children. Although it is obvious it is shocking to Marcello he doesn't have much reaction, and the rest of the Roman press just takes the story as an opportunity to sensationalize and exploit the situation.Immediately after Marcello learns of Steiner's suicide comes the final chapter in \"La Dolce Vita\" consisting of the most decadent, jaded, and outrageous party Marcello attends lasting until the next morning when most of the attendants of the party wander out onto the beach in a stupor to see a monstrous fish washed upon the shore, decaying and disgusting. They mock the fish and senselessly offer to buy it from the fisherman. In relation to the more superficial glorious and mighty images of the opening scenes, the final scene conveys a much more realistic hopelessness and disgust in the lives of Rome's rich and famous which is the reality \"La Dolce Vita\" successfully portrays and defines.",

            "review_title": "An Italian Gatsby",
            "content": "Fellini is possibly the greatest director to have ever graced Italian cinema, with films that capture the true essence of the culture and lifestyle of Italian life in way that is not only honest, but incorporating the culture as an integral aspect of the film. Without Italy, there is no film. The passion he has for Italian culture bleeds through the film, but he is not afraid to be critical of the history or society of it as well. It is the latter aspect that elevates his filmography into an examination of humanity; a universal message that could be felt by all. La Dolce Vita exemplifies this sentiment, and with films such as Nights of Cabiria that question what love can be for some and with Armacord portraying the dangers of nostalgia, it should not be taken lightly that I believe that La Dolce Vita is his greatest film.La Dolce Vita is essentially The Great Gatsby, where an examination into the high society reveals the levels of emptiness that they all face behind all the glamour and wealth. Where Gatsby explored the emptiness of the American Dream, La Dolce Vita shows that perhaps the sweet life isn't all that it seems to be. The protagonist spends most of his time attending parties with attendees that are as empty as he, participating in conversations with subjects that are vapid and involving himself in events that add nothing of value to his life. Depressing as it sounds, it is obvious that their lives are unfulfilling. The people he surrounds himself with do not fill that longing for a more meaningful life he desires, and we feel the weight of the realizations as he slowly realizes that what he has lived through his whole life ultimately amounts to nothing. He attempts to make connections through a gamut of girlfriends, but that hole proves futile to fulfill with high society.The cinematography keeps itself in line with the tone of the film, beginning with a focus on what he originally values: the cameras and stage lights. This is what he enjoys in life, even though it is manufactured and distant from what he should. It is as the film continues and we witness his ties to affluent society vanish, we begin to focus on the natural social situations we take for granted - he grows as a person and begins to talk to people in in-depth conversations. He attempts to form new relationships and tend to broken ones; he tries to rediscover himself and find something meaningful in his life. It is wildly episodic in presentation, shifting in tones even - but Fellini was never big on plots, but more on character driven works as this is no different. This is an intimate portrayal of a man who breaks his chains, and we get some beautiful shots in Italy - I'm tempted to say this this his most expertly shot work in his filmography. It captures the country in a way that has yet to be seen in any other film to this level of craftsmanship.La Dolce Vita is a sobering and dark take on a man simply drifting through life full of emptiness. We understand every step of the way the struggles of his yearning to have something more to his life than what he was given; he desires to live and not simply be alive. It is a patient film perhaps, but one that meditates on themes that shall resonate with the right people if given the time to think.",
