            "content": "Outstanding film. Star-studded with several fantastic performances. Highly emotional given the subject matter, but presented in a very intelligent, balanced way. I was struck at once by that, and by how well director Stanley Kramer gives us both sides of the argument \u2013 and avoids simply paying lip service to the defense of the German judges on trial. Maximilian Schell is brilliant as the defense attorney, well worthy of his Oscar, and is forceful and compelling in his arguments. There are also so many brilliant scenes. Spencer Tracy walking in the empty arena where the Nazi rallies were held, with Kramer focusing on the dais from which Hitler spoke. The testimony of Montgomery Clift and Judy Garland, both of whom are outstanding and should have gotten Oscars. Burt Lancaster in the role of one of the German judges, the one tortured by his complicity, knowing he and others are guilty. The devastating real film clips from the concentration camps, which are still spine tingling despite all we 'know' or have been exposed to. Marlene Dietrich as the German general's wife, haunted but expressing the German viewpoint, one time while people are singing over drinks. Her night stroll with Tracy, as she explains the words to one song, is touching. It just seemed like there was just one powerhouse scene after another, and the film did not seem long at all at three hours. Heck, you've even got Werner Klemperer and William Shatner before they would become Colonel Klink and Captain Kirk! In this film, the acting, the script, and the direction are all brilliant, and in harmony with one another.As for the trial itself, the defense argument was along these lines: they were judges (and therefore interpreters), not makers of law. They didn't know about the atrocities in the concentration camps. At least one of them saved or helped many by staying in their roles and doing the best they could under the heavy hand of the Third Reich. They were patriots, saw improvement in the country when Hitler took power, but did not know how far he would go. If you were going to convict these judges, you would have to convict many more Germans (and where would it stop?). The Americans themselves practiced Eugenics and killed thousands and thousands of innocents at Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The one small weakness I found was that the defense never makes the simple argument that these judges were forced to do what they did, just as countless others in Germany were, and would have been imprisoned or killed themselves had they not complied. Anyone who's lived under a totalitarian regime may understand, or at least empathize.I'm not saying I bought into these arguments or that one should be an apologist to Nazis, but the fact that the film presented such a strong defense was thought provoking. How fantastic is it that Spencer Tracy plays his character the way he does \u2013 simply pursuing the facts, and in a quiet, thoughtful way. It's the best of humanity. How heartbreaking is Burt Lancaster's character, admitting they knew, admitting their guilt, knowing that what happened was horrible and that they were wrong, and yet seeking Tracy's understanding in that scene in the jail cell at the end \u2013 intellectual to intellectual - and being rebuked. Even a single life taken unjustly was wrong. Had the Axis won the war, I don't know which Americans would have been on trial for war crimes for the fire bombings of Dresden and Tokyo, or for dropping the atomic bombs, but the film makes one think, even for a war when things were seemingly as black and white as they could ever be. The particulars of this trial were fictionalized, but it's representative of what really occurred, and it transports you into events 70 years ago which seem so unreal today \u2013 and yet are so vitally important to understand, and remember.",

            "content": "Beyond its compelling subject matter \"Judgement At Neuremberg\" revolutionizes the court room drama genre. The camera swings and swerves and dives between the lines of this exemplary Abby Mann script. Stanley Kramer conducts his orchestra of iconic stars with the precision of a Swiss watchmaker. The language barriers and the confinement of the action masterfully resolved. Spencer Tracy is simply magnificent and, as per usual, we believe every word that comes out of his mouth. His judge is an American monument of unsentimental humanity. Twentynine year old Maimilian Schell won the Oscar as best actor and his performance survived the test of time with the vigor of his conviction. Montgomery Cliff makes his short minutes on the screen, one of those memorable moments that nobody that has ever seen it will be able to forget. The man and the character merging into one chilling, shattering truth. \"I am half the man I've ever been\" Marlene Dietrich gives to her German aristocrat a legendary star quality. And Judy Garland, overweight and almost unrecognizable breaks your heart and gets her last Oscar nomination. My only troubles came with the stoic Burt Lancaster because I could never forget it was Burt Lancaster and with Richard Widmark's strident prosecutor. I have seen \"Judgement At Neuremberg\" more than a dozen times and it never ceases to amaze me that no matter the darkness of the subject it always manages to entertain and inspire.",

            "content": "This quote is one of the most shocking and yet truthful quotes I have ever heard. It is one of many shocking and intense quotes in the movie. Furthermore Judgment at Nuremburg is one of the most absorbing movies I have seen. Even though most if not all of it is dialog it is very much a haunting film. This film is loosely based on the trials in Nuremburg in 1948. Right from the start the movie captures your mind and never lets it go. The acting was collectively amazing. One of the best casts ever assembled which included Spencer Tracy, Montgomery Clift, Judy Garland, Richard Widmark, Burt Lancaster as well as international stars Maximilian Schell and Marlene Dietrich. It is not just the fact that this is a star studded cast that made it so great, it was the way everyone appeared to blend in together. Maximilian Schell gave the performance of his life in this film playing the defense lawyer for Burt Lancaster who give two superb narratives that will certainly stay in your mind forever. Schell's character use of logic is that of something which will mesmerize use you whether or not you agree or disagree with what he says. Richard Widmark playing the prosecutor gave the type of supporting performance that was necessary for Schell to shine. The way both actors fed off each other was a joy to watch. Then of course the tiny appearances of Garland and Clift were excellent and worth every second they spent on camera. I usually find myself frustrated with cameos and actors receiving recognition for them but this film used cameos the best way I have ever seen. Then of course Spencer Tracy and Marlene Dietrich provided such great presence were perfect for the lead.The direction of Stanley Kramer was spectacular as the film intensified more and more as it wore on. It was always engrossing and never let up. The writing of Abby Mann was great, filled up with great material and narratives allowing every actor in the cast to give a superb performance. There were many memorable quotes as well. The writing carried the film forward and allowed all the potential and talent to push this film to another level.Judgement at Nuremburg is not just another movie. It is a very thought provoking movie. More than that though it is haunting. Just thinking about the course of the events being talked about in the movie became subtly haunting in a way I really didn't expect. What was the most compelling though was the way we need to separate what we feel with what has to be truly done, with what is truly right.",

Unfortunately, what was done then, is being done by the leaders of our country in the name of protection from terrorists, and we, the people, sit silently by and let it happen just as the German people did seven decades ago.We need to watch films like this over and over to remind us of what is important and what we, as civilized humans, can be reduced to out of fear.This is another great film by the fantastic Abby Mann, who died last month. He won an Oscar for his screenplay, and it was well deserved.Maximilian Schell was simply fantastic, as was Spencer Tracy, Montgomery Clift, and Judy Garland. Director Stanley Kramer brought out the best in these actors, and others like Burt Lancaster, Richard Widmark, Marlene Dietrich, William Shatner, and Werner Klemperer.Don't look upon it as three hours of cinema, but as a class in humanity as only Abby Mann could write.",

            "content": "They say that time heals all heartache. In the case of the Third Reich, I'm not sure that the old saying is true. Out of respect for the Holocaust victims, and as an important history lesson, there's something to be said for not forgetting the evils of Hitler. Fortunately, we have this great film to help us not forget.\"Judgment At Nuremberg\" is a dramatization of one of the many real life post WWII Nuremberg trials of high ranking Nazis. Most of the film focuses on the 1948 courtroom trial of four judges who helped to carry out Hitler's decrees. As part of the prosecution's case against the judges, real life, graphic film footage showing the horrors of the death camps engenders a gut level impression that is both powerful and persuasive. The film thus educates viewers in ways that a dry textbook of facts and figures never could.But there's more to the film than the trial. In other parts of Nuremberg we see ordinary Germans trying to get on with their lives as best they can, three years after the war's end, in a bombed out and bleak city. One of these persons is Madame Bertholt (Marlene Dietrich), the wife of a dead German soldier. In contrast to the harsh and contentious trial, Madame Bertholt's kindness toward the tribunal's lead judge, Dan Haywood (Spencer Tracy), provides an example of the innocence and decency of ordinary Germans, and thus adds a softer, more contemplative perspective to the ordeal. In these non-courtroom scenes, the melancholy background music and the soft production lighting create a mood of depression and sadness.I find very little to criticize in this three hour film. Perhaps the plot could have been clearer in identifying the legal counsel of three of the four defendants. And maybe in those scenes wherein the four defendants conversed among themselves, the dialogue should have been in German, not English. But these are trivial points. Overall, this is a film that is well written and directed, a film with credible actors giving stellar performances, and most of all, a film that assures preservation of that era's historic significance, with a political and social message that has enduring value.",

            "content": "I once read a review of this film that criticized the fact that the American chief prosecutor as played by Richard Widmark was a less sympathetic and engaging character than the defending lawyer, Herr Rolfe as portrayed by Max Schell. Schell's Oscar winning performance illuminated the \"shattering truth\" that the film reveals about Nazism. Extremely able and educated men were able to rationalize what they did with an irresistible logic. They loved their country and, in a time of a national crisis, found it necessary to implement certain measures. As expounded by Rolfe, it all sounds so logical and reasonable. He also cites the fact that many world leaders actually commended Hitler upon his leadership in getting Germany out of the Depression as swiftly as he did.Widmark's character, Lawson, is understandably appalled by Herr Rolfe's defence of the indefencible and therefore he pulls no punches. He wants those responsible to be held fully responsible but he finds Germans who are ready to extenuate and rationalize. After he is told to tone down his demands for justice, Lawson acerbically retorts, \"There are no Nazis in Germany. It was those damned Eskimos.\" The moment that illuminates how pure reason without humanity is so dangerous is when Pohl, a right hand man for Eichman, explains how it was possible to kill millions of people in purely technical terms. His explanation as he eats his lunch is devoid of any hint of human empathy for the victims he has so blithely exterminated. His was a job that was the logical extension of a policy and he carried it out with a detached and technical logic.The key point that the film makes is that to be logical is not always to be morally right.",

            "content": "\"Judgment at Nuremberg\" is one of the great films of all time. This can be attributed to the excellent script written by Abby Mann, its skillful direction by Stanley Kramer and possibly one of the greatest casts ever assembled for a motion picture.The subject trial takes place in 1948 long after the trials of the major German military generals when most people had lost interest in such proceedings. Writer Mann chose to write about the trial of German judges, the people who above all, should have seen the evil of Hitler and his followers coming.Assigned to the trial as Chief Judge is Dan Haywood (Spencer Tracy) a low profile justice who by his own admission was not the original or subsequent choice. The prosecutor is Col. Tad Lansing (Richard Widmark) an \"army man\" who vows to convict the four ex-German Judges. Defending the accused is Hans Rolfe (Maximillian Schell) who must convince the court that the defendants were acting only for the love of their country.Among the defendants are respected Judge Ernst Janning (Burt Lancaster) who has written several books on law accepted the world over. Lawson accuses the defendants of signing orders for the sterilization of innocent men and the execution of those who opposed to the Reich and the extermination of the jews. He puts Rudolph Peterson (Montgomery Clift) on the stand as a victim of sterilization. Rolfe manages to expose the pitiful Peterson as mentally challenged. Later Irene Hoffman (Judy Garland) is put on the stand to explain her alleged affair at the age of 16 with an elderly jew. As his coup de grace, Lawson shows a film depicting the horrors of German concentration camps.In between the sessions, Judge Haywood strikes up a friendship with Madame Bertholt (Marlene Dietrich) the widow of a former German general, in whose former home the judge is staying. In spite of their differences they begin to grow fond of each other.The army pressures Lawson to ease up and suggests that acquittal or light sentences would best serve American interests since this was the time that the blockade of Berlin was beginning. Judge Haywood is also pressured to go easy on the sentencing.Maximillian Schell deservedly won an Oscar for his outstanding performance as Rolfe. Any one of the other principals could have easily won as well. Clift and Garland are simply outstanding as are Widmark and Lancaster. And Tracy, did he ever give a bad performance? The still beautiful Dietrich was also excellent. Others in the cast are a very young William Shatner as Capt. Byers, a court officer, Werner Kemperer as Emil Hahn the most militant of the defendants and Ray Teal as Judge Ives. Teal had long been a fixture in westerns and is probably best remembered for playing Sheriff Coffey on TV's Bonanza.The DVD release contains an excellent conversation between Abby Mann and Maximillian Schell plus an interview with Kramer's widow, the still beautiful former actress Karen Sharpe.A true cinematic masterpiece.",

Well let me just start out by saying that this is a very sad, powerful film. I was expecting it to be very boring and I guess I underestimated it. The film is also very well written, so well written that actually it makes you really think. I'm happy that it won an Oscar for writing. The best quality about the film HAS to be the acting. Judy Garland, I think should of won a Supporting Actress. This is her finest performance ever, and I'm sad she didn't win one. Maximilian Schell gives the performance of a lifetime in his role as the defense attorney for the judges. He truly deserved his Oscar because he was very powerful. Spencer Tracy also gave a quite exceptional performance as he always had. (He isn't a Two-Time Oscar Winner for nothing. As for Montgomery Clift he deserved his Oscar Nomination. I am kind of ticked off that Marlene didn't get an Oscar Nomination for Best Supporting Actress. I always feel she is underrated.As for Stanley Kramer (The Director) he had real talent and this film shows it. The 9-Time Oscar nominated Director should've of won an Oscar for Best Director for Judgement at Nuremberg. I hope his talent though will be remembered for many years to come.My Overall Consensus is that the movie definitely succeeds due to the Extraordinary Performances and the Quite Exceptional Writing.You Should see this Film. 10/10",

            "content": "I watched \"Judgment at Nuremburg\" on PBS the other night. I had never seen it before. I expected an empty-headed, Hollywood-style, quasi-melodrama, but I was pleasantly surprised. Even Spencer Tracy, that universally beloved actor whose appeal has always escaped me, gave an honest and heartfelt portrayal of a \"simple man\" who was also a deeply conflicted judge.What I liked most about this movie was that it didn't pull any punches, in the manner of other \"controversial\" films of its time. The defense attorney, superbly played by Maximilian Schell, weaves a simple, but undeniable web of logic: Sterilization of \"undesirables,\" one of the charges against the Nazi war criminals, was at one time condoned by the U.S. courts, and encouraged by none other than Oliver Wendell Holmes. - Numerous leading industrialists in the U.S. contributed to the development of the Nazi war machine. - Encouragement was given to Hitler's expansionism by both Russia and England. - Churchill is quoted as having admired Hitler. - The Vatican actively collaborated with the Nazis.Correct me if I'm wrong, but it must have taken major cojones to present that kind of message to American filmgoers in 1961. Would a film of that candor have a chance of being made today?I tend to doubt it. One further note. The film describes how the Nazis went about stripping the German judiciary of judges who were known for their objectivity, and replacing them with judges who were appointed based solely on their party loyalties.The mind boggles at the implications and yes, the prescience of this well-written, well-played masterpiece.",

            "content": "Following a trail first started by Marty, Judgment at Nuremberg is one of the first films to be taken from television. Abby Mann wrote this script for a live drama on Playhouse 90. Only Maximilian Schell and Werner Klemperer repeated their roles from the 1959 production. Others in that cast were Claude Rains as Judge Haywood and Paul Lukas as the defendant Ernest Janning.Stanley Kramer assembled a cast of some big movie names for his film and directed this film reverently as it has an eternal message. To get the film out of the Nuremberg Tribunal courtroom, the role of the widow of the German general played by Marlene Dietrich was created and the other German citizens were also created show that Kramer could get some dialog in about how the ordinary German felt. In the original play their only advocate is defense lawyer Maximilian Schell.Schell is some good advocate indeed. While not lessening the guilt of any of the four German judges in the dock, he does raise some disturbing questions about other societies and how very easily the slide into totalitarian brutality can happen. He also shows some of the worst aspects in German character in his cross examination of Judy Garland and Montgomery Clift.The Nuremberg Tribunal has been going on four two years now. The big Nazi fish have been dealt with and we're now trying four German judges who apparently forgot all about due process in their efforts to ingratiate themselves with the new Nazi regime. Clift and Garland are two examples of German everypeople who got caught up in it and their performances well merited Oscar nominations in the Supporting player categories.Richard Widmark is the lead prosecutor and this is probably one of the least complex roles Widmark ever played. He's identified as a New Deal liberal, a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of the late President Roosevelt. He was in at the liberation of concentration camps and it effected him. It made him the good advocate for civilization itself.In an original cast album of the film, the monologues with Burt Lancaster confessing his guilt and Spencer Tracy rendering the verdicts were included. Lancaster in a smaller way plays the part of Albert Speer who probably escaped the hangman by just throwing himself on the mercy of the court. He's the only one who shows contrition. His confession though is a textbook example of how a demagogue can come to power in a nation left without pride.Spencer Tracy and Maximilian Schell got Academy Award nominations for Best Actor with Schell winning. But Tracy's summation of the trial is devastatingly correct. The real complainant at the bar is civilization itself as he so eloquently states. No player before or since has ever done so many lengthy speeches in his films and done them so well. This is the best of them, a creed for civilization that we as humans should all live by.In some of the smaller roles take note of some good performances by Virginia Christine as Tracy's housekeeper, Werner Klemperer as the unrepentant Nazi judge, and Howard Caine as Judy Garland's husband who does not want her victimized all over again on the witness stand. A real cross section of the German public circa 1948.Judgment at Nuremberg should be seen back to back with Schindler's List as a portrayal of the brutality itself and how civilization tried to deal with the consequences. Judgement at Nuremberg is a film whose message will never not be timely.",

Tad Lawson but the film never feels small or confined by its devices as we explore the mental anguish and eye opening examinations of what the war meant outside of the battlefield, what it meant to those everyday people who were nothing more than pawns in a much bigger game of life and death.In this loaded ensemble we also get a memorable Burt Lancaster turn as German judge Dr. Ernst Janning with both the actors performance and characters arc making for an extremely moving examination of a good man caught in an horrific predicament while screen legends such as Marlene Dietrich, Judy Garland and a very young William Shatner all deliver great turns with varying degrees of screen time, ensuring Nuremberg is one of the era's most well-rounded examples of a collection of once in a generation talents.The whole production is beautifully constructed by the often underappreciated Stanley Kramer who alongside this effort and the likes of On the Beach, Guess Whose Coming to Dinner, comedy gem It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World and The Defiant Ones, established himself as a director of true worth that may not have received the plaudits of some of his era's peers but remains a director with a fantastic catalogue of films he managed to produce in a career that will stand tall during the tests of time.Final Say -Powerful and emotion packed without the need for any theatrics, Judgment at Nuremberg is one of the most stunning cinematic examples of a courtroom and World War 2 drama respectively and is a film that should continue to be adored by cinephiles for the years yet to come.5 Opa's out of 5.",

The focus isn't on Nazi atrocities (though they are here, in horrific images). But, this being a trial drama, \"Judgment at Nuremberg\" attempts to answer questions about humanity, beginning with HOW? \"How could this have happened?\" And, while only four mid-level Nazis receive justice, the film makes you wonder\u0085 Where does punishment for the Holocaust end? And, if you do not stop, don't you become the enemy? That wanders, of course, into subjective interpretation; and, there are certainly others. This only makes an already strong piece of work more relevant. Criticisms about it being fictionalized and too long are curiously incongruent. Fewer people would sit through the real trials. The actors seem to employ demons (two, nakedly) to give electrifying, all-time greatest performances. The film is repellent and manipulative, but necessarily so.

            "content": "Lacking the big names of what people normally think of as the \"Nuremberg Trials\" - the trial of Nazi leaders such as Goering, Hess and Speer - this movie focuses on the lesser known people who were tried for war crimes: the German judges whose responsibility it was to dispense \"justice\" in Hitler's Germany. Although the big names are missing, the movie is powerful and masterfully deals with the troubling questions around Nazism: how could normally good, decent people (represented in this movie by Ernst Janning, played by Burt Lancaster, on trial with three others) have allowed themselves to be sucked into the evil that was Hitler and National Socialism? How could the German people have turned a blind eye to what was going on and simply denied all responsibility? And the movie also considers a troubling question about the United States: if Nazism was evil enough to have warranted a war and then all the effort of the Nuremberg trials, why were the Americans suddenly so willing to \"forgive and forget\" with the onset of the Cold War and the threat of communism?The implication here is that the Americans never really took the secondary trials seriously. A second-rate judge (Dan Haywood, available only because he had been defeated in an election, and played magnificently by Spencer Tracy) was appointed to head the trial, the Army was putting pressure on the prosecution to go lightly. It's an amazing fact of history that within three years of the end of World War II, the feeling was so clearly against pursuing those who had played roles in the Nazi nightmare (and, of course, it's a question that still haunts us today as Nazi war criminals from time to time turn up and the response of the public is often, \"he's an old man. Why bother?\")Focussing largely on the trial itself, the movie is consistently gripping throughout, and even the diversions outside the courtroom (such as the relationship between Judge Haywood and Mrs. Bertholt -Marlene Dietrich) don't detract from the suspense, as they continue to push the question: \"how can you just sit there and deny knowing anything?\" Anyone with an interest in the puzzle of Nazi Germany should watch this. In the end, it raises a lot of questions and offers few answers, but that may be the legacy of Nazism. But the movie makes its point. As Judge Janning talks to Judge Haywood at the end of the movie he says almost pleadingly, \"we never knew it would go so far.\" Haywood simply responds, \"Herr Janning, it went that far the first time you convicted a man you knew was innocent.\" Powerful stuff.10/10",

            "content": "A stimulating portrayal of the Nuremberg trials in which members of the German judiciary were brought to response their crimes in the immediate post-war period.The movie initiates with scenes of Nuremberg, Germany, 1948. The destruction of the war is clear everywhere. Judge Haywood(Spencer Tracy) is driven through the rotten buildings. Judge Hayward along with two other judges (Ray Teal, Kednneth Mackenna), to preside over the trial of Ministry of Justice, judges and Nazi prosecutors for their complicity in Third Reich. Hayward is helped by his assistant Harrison (William Shatner). In its opening declaration , the prosecution (an excellent prosecutor played by Richard Widmark) calls these defendants to account not for violation of due process or other constitutional violations but for killings, tortures, and cruelties committed during WWII. The accuser statements that the accused cannot claim ignorance that they should have known better for their high position and knowledges.Defender Hans Rolfe (Maximilian Schell) counsel's opening statement he declares that the aim of this judgment is the reestablishment of the code of justice with honor and innocence, because of judges don't make the laws . He argues the disobedience to the Fuehrer would have been choice between patriotism and treason for the justices with the subsequent firing squad. Finally the defending explains that not only are the judges on trial, so are the German people.One of the more dramatic portions of the film centers around Judge Janning's (Burt Lancaster) performance during the Feldenstein case (in real life, the Katzenberger case). Fedlenstein was charged with race mixing, of having relations with an Aryan, Irene Hoffman (Judy Garland). The trial was to be used as a showcase for National Socialism. Emil Hahn (Werner Kemplerer) had been the accuser and he was determined to find Feldenstein guilty despite evidence that he had merely been a family friend to Irene Hoffman. Hahn had told Irene that it was no use to deny having relations. That if she protected Feldenstein she would be arrested for perjury. She said she couldn't lie and was arrested. She said that Emil Hahn mocked Feldenstein, ridiculed him. Janning had been the presiding judge and he took no action to prevent the injustice. He had been the only hope for the defense since he had a reputation for being fair. Feldenstein was found guilty and executed.Prosecutor Lawson (Richard Widmark) submitted documents by which the judges and prosecutors had sent thousands to their deaths. A film was shown , a short-documentary is based on real events by means of photographs and stock-footage. As appears work camps are transformed into extermination centers to implement the policy of genocide thought at the Wannsee Conference . At the concentration camps was some minor industrial activity linked to the war effort but the main work was the execution of inmates.Millions of prisoners died in the concentration camps through mistreatment, disease, starvation, and overwork, or were executed as unfit for labor. More than six million Jews died in them, usually in gas chambers, although many were killed in mass shootings and by other means . As the documentary showed a gas chamber at Dachau , but it is a mistake because of it was never used, prisoners died from mistreatment or from execution by means other than gas. The archival footage shows tattooed skin , but Buchenwald prisoners with unusual tattoos were killed , then their skin was preserved for the tattoo collection of convicted war criminal Ilse Koch. Defense counsel speaks to the content of the films shown the previous day. He states that there is no justification for what happened, but, that it was wrong and unfair to show such films in court against these defendants. He claims that the extremists are responsible, not the defendants. He says that very few Germans knew what was going on. He claimed that the defendants stayed in their positions to keep things from getting worse. The defending then calls Irene Hoffman. In this unseemly portion of the defense, the defense counsel tries to portray Irene Hoffman as a law breaker and Judge Janning as merely doing his duty. The hypocrisy is evident and seems to bother even defense counsel Rolfe. Yet he continues to badger Irene, trying to break her down, to show that she did in fact have an affair with Feldenstein. Janning interrupts him and stops him from continuing.The next day Janning testifies about the Feldenstien case. He tells that there was fear in the country. That Hitler told the people to lift their heads. That once the gypsies, Jewish, and others were destroyed all would be well.Janning was content to sit by during his trial until he realized the same arguments were being used in this trial in his defense that had been used in the Feldenstien trial. Janning denies that Germans were unaware of the exterminations. He says that all were aware of what was going on, maybe not the details, but only because they did not want to know the details.Judge Hayward affirms the value of a single human life, and the responsibility of the justices, and by implication the German people, for their actions and inaction. This graphic account of the Nuremberg trials were immediately brought to book and subsequently adapted by Stanley Kramer in \u00a8Playhouse \u00a8 style. Judge Haywood is perfectly played by Spencer Tracy, he gives us the uneasy feeling that the German people never really came to terms with their innocence or guilty. This film takes the point of view that Germany, at the time of the picture was realized, was moving beyond the war a little too fast, and was doing so with the help of the US and other allies because of the Cold War. For his passionated acting of the defending advocate Maximilian Schell won an Oscar as the years's best player and special mention Montgomery Clif, also uncredited as screenwriter. Rating : Excellent, better than average.",

            "content": "JUDGMENT AT NUREMBERG was adapted from Abby Mann's TV play and turned into a masterful piece of work by director Stanley Kramer. His sterling cast included SPENCER TRACY and RICHARD WIDMARK (American judge and prosecutor, respectively), German defense attorney MAXIMILIAN SCHELL in his award-winning Best Actor role, and such impressive defendants as MARLENE DIETRICH, JUDY GARLAND and MONTGOMERY CLIFT, all giving deeply felt performances.As every student of history knows, there were trials after World War II held in Nuremberg, Germany for Nazis who committed crimes against humanity during the war. This story concerns some fictional German defendants who were more like second tier when it came to atrocities committed since the primary leaders had already been judged. Nevertheless, their part in the war crimes is investigated as the trial proceeds to occupy most of the film, giving the whole story a claustrophobic feeling, the kind one always gets from a real-life courtroom setting.Tracy has some marvelous speeches to make--and Maximilian Schell has his moments where the viewpoint of an intelligent German defense attorney is seen as opposed to the violently opposite statements of RICHARD WIDMARK as the American prosecutor. The audience is forced to view both viewpoints and, having heard all the evidence presented, make up its own mind as to the outcome.It's an important film historically and one can certainly understand why so many of the actors were honored with Academy Award nominations or winners of Golden Globes. They all play an important part in keeping the film grounded in reality and not given to melodramatic outbursts.Summing up: Honest and thought-provoking, it serves as a valuable history lesson as well as a solid piece of entertainment.",

            "content": "At the end of the Second World War in 1945, the world was dealt the final blow, with the discovery and liberation of the Nazi death camps.The human race who had already faced up to and who had become hardened to nearly six years of murder and violence, found this level of barbarity and cruelty unlike anything the world had witnessed before or since.For four years after the war, the heads of the former Nazi state were gathered and put on trial for their crimes. This film tells the story of these trials at Nuremberg.Richard Widmark, plays an American army officer, one of the unfortunate few who marched in to liberate a concentration camp and was sickened by what he saw, a man who is now hell bent on prosecuting the culprits and bringing them to justice.Spencer Tracy, without doubt one of the greatest screen actors of all time plays Judge Haywood, the man who is to sit in judgement over the proceedings,a man trying to remain impartial, despite his own personal views of disgust and hatred.Burt Lancaster, in probably his finest performance, plays Dr. Ernst Janning, a former German lawyer, a man who had worked for the Nazis and had been responsible for sending many innocent men to their deaths in the interests of Hitler's Reich. A man now eaten away by his inner torment and feelings of guilt. A man who is now on trial for his own life just as his victims had once been on trial for theirs.Maximillian Schell, deservedly won an Oscar for his portrayal of Hans Rolfe, the German defence lawyer, trying to defend these men he knows are guilty, while at the same time trying to salvage some threads of dignity for the people of his defeated and war battered nation.Other notable performances come from Judy Garland, who showed us what a fine dramatic actress she could be when give the opportunity, and Marlene Deitrich as the widow of an already executed German officer...both performances, especially that of Garland were in my opinion Oscar winning level.It is however Lancaster's performance which gripped me most. He takes the stand against Rolfe's advice and speaks to the court of his crimes, his guilt and his repentance.He says that for the German people to rebuild their self respect, then they need to face up to the terrible things they have done. He lays mention to the fact that most Germans are saying that they didn't know of the death camps, and his speech is both heartfelt and moving.'When train loads of women and children past through our towns, crammed in like cattle on the way to their extermination.....were we blind? When we heard those children crying out to us in the night and did nothing to help them....were we deaf? We didn't know because we didn't WANT to know.' He mentions how he thought Nazism was a good thing in the beginning, but how he had become too heavily involved and was too scared to back out once he realised the levels to which it had risen.A poignant speech and one that still leaves a lump in my throat.Spencer Tracy has the most accurate and thought provoking line in the whole movie.Jannings tells Haywood, that he was shocked and appalled at the figure of six million victims....he explains how he never knew it would go that far.Spence looks down at his shoes and says with neither hatred or kindness, 'It went that far the first time you ever sentenced someone to death whom you knew was innocent.' A truer word could not have been spoken.It is my belief that every person in the entire world should be made to watch two movies as part of their education of life. Schindlers List and Judgement at Nuremberg. In no other film has the horrific and sickening crimes of the Nazis, been described or portrayed more vividly or graphically as in these two productions.It is only by keeping this fresh in the mind of future generations can we ensure it can never happen again.",

It recreates the complex feelings and issues of the era with care, and it goes out of its way to be fair to all of the characters and what they stand for.Between the difficult decisions involved in determining responsibility for the outrages that took place under the Nazi regime, and the diplomatic worries of the era, there is a lot of emotionally charged material, and yet \"Judgment at Nuremberg\" uses an excellent cast and well-conceived characters to create a movie that is both worthwhile for its themes and interesting to watch.The characters are well-chosen so as to allow the opportunity for each major perspective to have a hearing, and the cast members do quite well in bringing their characters to life. Spencer Tracy gives one of his finest performances as the judge in the center of it all. Very few other actors could have been so believable in portraying the character as he carefully weighs so many different viewpoints, knowing that he must come to a decision.Burt Lancaster is very effective as the most interesting of the defendants, and the one whose case is the hardest to evaluate. His character is contrasted effectively with the other defendants, and Lancaster makes the character interesting and his case significant. Maximilian Schell also succeeds in a challenging role. Marlene Dietrich works well in her role, which represents yet another aspect of the general situation. The other characters likewise all have a purpose, and are all portrayed believably, with Montgomery Clift and Judy Garland in particular standing out as two traumatized witnesses.Even within the lengthy running time, it would not be possible to cover every significant point involved in the discussion. But this dramatization is one of the best depictions available of the dilemmas and challenges that had to be faced in the aftermath of the Second World War.",

The plot is written by Abby Mann who won best screenplay Oscar from that and quite deserving one. The story based on Nuremberg trials held after fall of Nazi's in Germany but this movie is nice blend of history with fiction as the major characters were fictional but the evidences and indictments presented in the trial ever authentic and truly depicts the conditions of Nazi occupied Germany. The most intriguing thing of the movie was the true representation of aftermaths of Nazi's occupation in Germany and the feeling of German toward the trial and immaculate direction of Kramer made possible to convey these types of sentiment on cinema for the very first time. The cast was also fascinating with big names like Tracy and surely he did justice with his role as he was very compelling and humble as Judge Haywood. Maximilian Schell was at his best as a compassionate enthusiastic zealous and patriotic attorney to defend the dignity of Nation. He won best actor Oscar for his role. Montgomery Clift was also the one who made this movie special as he played a role of feeble minded sterile man who was nominated for best actor in supporting role though he only played for 9 min in the movie. Burt Lancaster gave one of the most extraordinary cinematic performances as Ernst Janning. This is one of those movies which provokes our mentality and also our morality and is a treat to watch.",

            "content": "This 1961 film is just about as close to timeless in its impact as you can get, in its searing treatment of the universal themes of law, justice, and humanity. This far downstream, it's worth recalling that the movie was made just 15 years after the end of WWII when the aftermath of the war was still reverberating. It's set during the \"Nuremberg Trials\" of 1947-49 during which high-ranking German generals, judges, politicians and others responsible for the atrocities of the Nazi regime were tried against still-evolving standards of international law. The movie takes us through just one of these, the trial of four high-placed judges, and I was actually surprised to learn that there was an earlier, much shorter version of this drama shown 2 years earlier on the prestigious old TV series Playhouse 90. But the movie carries a wallop that no TV show could have given.I had to check the history to be sure, but though the bare bones of the time, place, and setting are accurate, all the characters and details are entirely fictional. I think maybe this was the correct choice, because it could allow the script to concentrate entirely on two major themes in its 3-hour run time: first and foremost, the courtroom drama, and second, a look into German postwar society when most were desperate to forget and try to get back to normal living. The side plot is kind of disposable -- some of those scenes drag -- but the courtroom scenes that are the spine of the movie are intense, claustrophobic, and utterly absorbing. Because of the imbalance of the two parts of the story, I rate this as \"only\" 9/10, but my bottom-line message is simply to see it, any way you can. There is lots here that resonates with what is happening now all around us.The cast is flat-out astonishing: Spencer Tracy, Maximilian Schell, Richard Widmark, Marlene Dietrich, Judy Garland, Burt Lancaster, Montgomery Clift. None of these giants are still with us, but if you want to see what the classic Hollywood stars were capable of, this is just about the best place to go. (Schell won the Best Actor Oscar for this, which is hard to argue with once you see him work.) Each one of these multiple leads has at least one powerhouse scene -- always in the courtroom, where all of the true interest of the film takes place -- that is guaranteed to stick in your mind. Tracy and Widmark were in lots and lots of movies, and they tended to play every role in much the same way: Tracy played the aw-shucks average guy you could imagine as a next-door neighbor, Widmark always seemed to have that flat delivery with an edge of menace -- but here they stretch themselves. Widmark's narration of the horrors revealed in the concentration camps (which in the setting of the film were uncovered just two years before) accompanied by hard-to-watch film records is impressively spare and restrained, and Tracy as the leading tribunal judge gives a summation speech that has real weight.Even among all these leads, however, Burt Lancaster stands out. Playing a respected and even renowned German judge who inexplicably stepped into the dark side, late in the film he delivers a long, uninterrupted testimony that is electrifying. Up till that point he had been only a looming Presence lurking at the edge of the proceedings, but he is the key defendant everyone mentions repeatedly. When will he speak? What will he say? The dramatic tension pays off handsomely. Lancaster was an amazingly physical kind of actor, and by that I don't mean just physique or action-hero roles. But the camera is drawn to him in a way that is hard to explain: he can get your attention just by standing up from a chair. I think much of it is due to a kind of stillness of posture, an utter spareness of movement. I can't think of a single modern actor like that.It's fun to note that one of the supporting actors in this stellar cast who IS still with us is William Shatner. As the military aide to Judge Haywood (Tracy), he's there from beginning to end, and he does very nicely. Several years later, he'd move on to become Captain Kirk.Maybe understandably for the time, all the speaking roles for the \"German\" characters, except for Maximilian Schell and Marlene Dietrich, were played by Americans with fake mild accents. Today that wouldn't work . I'm visualizing a re-mounting of this piece with a true international cast, but I'm not sure anyone wants to revisit the Nazi era in quite so unsparing a way.",

Focusing on the Nazi trials after WWII, it shows how the prosecution sought to remind people that complicity extended to every segment of the population. Indeed, there were people in the courtroom who thought that Germany should forget about what happened and just move on, but the prosecution reminded everyone that forgetting about what happened could lead to a repeat of the atrocities.There is also a scene that is of particular interest to me. The defense attorney (Maximilian Schell in an Academy Award-winning role) notes that it was not only Germany that was responsible for the Nazis' crimes against humanity. There was the Vatican's Reichskonkordat, the Soviet Union's treaty with Germany setting the stage for the latter's invasion of Poland, and there were a number of US corporations supporting Hitler. In other words, many different countries abetted the Nazis actions as much as the German citizens did.This is probably one of the most important movies ever made. It reminds us that justice might not move quickly, but must eventually come.

And, it has quite a few reviews already, so I don't intend to write an exhaustive review. Bkoganbing from Buffalo has already written a very nice review explaining the background for the movie that I might normally discuss, so in order not to be so repetitive and dull, I'll just be brief.The film is about one particular set of trials that followed the end of WWII. It is not THE trial--just one of many. Unlike the well publicized early trials of the obviously evil (most of which were hanged), many other sets of trials followed. In this case, four jurists who knew better but complied with the Nazis are on trial. To learn about the rest of the trials and the outcomes, do an internet search-- it's out there and I've read about the other trials. But this one is a fictionalization of the actual Nuremberg trials of these jurists and it has a lot to offer.First, the acting is absolutely superb. The film is filled with great actors who were great at seeming natural. Oddly, Maximillian Schell got the Oscar among these other greats and his performance was quite different--extremely florid and loud. I preferred the quieter parts played by Spencer Tracy, Marlene Dietrich*, Burt Lancaster and others. I think Montgomery Clift and Judy Garland were also quite good--mostly because they were emotional wrecks off-screen as well and they seemed to tap into this (particularly Garland). Regardless, you can't find movies with a better cast. Second, Abby Mann's script is exceptional and you can easily see how Mann took home an Oscar. And, the great camera-work and direction made his script seem all the better.Third, the film faces the Nazi atrocities without flinching AND poses a question most films about the Holocaust rarely pose--about guilt of the common man as well as the leaders. Not the obvious leaders like Hitler, Himmler and the like but everyone else.Overall, a very, very impressive film from start to finish.",

            "content": "This is a fine film by a fine director, but I can only hope that Stanley Kramer, in committing to full length film a television story, knew at heart the message his movie was trying to say. Because this is truly a message movie, for all mankind, but if the reviews I've read on this site are any indication, the message has been lost to some degree.I've entitled my review \"Revelation of Horror\", but the horror revealed was not the Holocaust. That had already been revealed, although Kramer's film certainly lent its emotional impact. The revelation was a deep, true insight into how it happened, and the horror is that it happened in a civilized country. Few on this earth can imagine the true horror of Nazi Germany--I've read criticism of Widmark's Colonel Lawson as too preachy, but the character and the acting conveyed the mission of one who actually saw the horrors, beyond any scope we can identify with.Kramer's achievement is that everything in this movie reminds us that the Nazi's used every facet of civilization, no matter how minute, to foster their extermination of their enemies, to inculcate it as an ordinary part of life. That was why judges were chosen to portray the issue of \"obeying orders\" versus \"human decency.\" Herr Rolf is \"forced\" to defend the worst criminals imaginable, and yet his very defense and the principles behind it are abused in the process, used as a weapon against the very law they represent. Thus did the Nazis prevail with the willing acquiescence of the German people, and the abominable disregard of the rest of the world.The other horror revealed in this film is the incessant excusing of it. Beyond the obvious pleas of the guilty (\"We didn't know\", or as one judge says to another, \"Was it possible to kill like that?\") are the multiplicity of subtle excuses: the reminder of centuries' old German culture, Rolf's plaintive cry of \"unfairness\" at the showing of the death camp films because of their inflammatory nature, the invocation of \"Lili Marlene\" throughout the film, to name just a few. While the song evokes sadness, a guilty German society meant for it to invoke sadness. Long before Germany had its country destroyed by bombs, it had its soul destroyed by Hitler.Because this is a courtroom drama, respecting the sacred role of the Rule of Law in safeguarding humanity, almost every scene, every line is a statement that Nazi Germany perverted the Rule of Law, as did the very defense of the war criminals. But what is principle on a small scale of a single man being judged by society becomes outrage when used to defend the indefensible on an impossibly massive scale. Tracy's character at the film's end has a realization that this is so, as well as an awareness that what happened in Germany during the Third Reich was an Aristotelian tragedy for anyone touched by it, even remotely, so that any personal considerations (such as Mrs. Berthold) are made utterly impossible.Rolf's speech about the guilty responsibility of the rest of the world was valid--but he was indicting the world to save one man. Where have we heard that in our own time? This quality about \"Judgment at Nuremburg\" makes its message forever fresh--and its warnings.",

The chief Allied judge, Dan Haywood (Spencer Tracy), has been sent to Germany after failing to be reelected to the bench in New England, a political payoff that does not go unnoticed by his adversaries. Prosecuting attorney Tad Lawson (Richard Widmark), an Army colonel, indicts several Germans who have committed war crimes in enforcing Hitler's mad mandates. Defense attorney Hans Rolfe (Maximilian Schell) roars that his clients were merely upholding Hitler's laws, and that to place them on trial is to judge all of Germany. Meanwhile, Haywood, in his off hours, wanders the ancient city of Nuremberg trying to understand what went wrong with a whole people and a great culture.Tracy delivers a performance of great intelligence and intuition. He creates a gentle, but towering, figure, compassionate but realistic, warm but objective.Maximilian Schell the role , acts with electric effect and he brings to the film a fierce vigor, sincerity and nationalistic pride.The rest of the cast in this three-hour-plus picture is equally distinguished: Marlene Dietrich is the widow of a German general who was executed for ordering the slaughter of captured American soldiers at Malmedy.Burt Lancaster is an intellectual German judge who unwillingly aided the Nazis.Montgomery Clift is a dim-witted victim of sterilization who testifies for the prosecution.Judy Garland is a woman who \"polluted the Aryan race\" by having sex with a Jew.Though unrelentingly bleak, JUDGMENT AT NUREMBERG is absorbing from beginning to end. Dietrich and Tracy contribute polished, seemingly effortless work; at the other end of the thespian spectrum are Clift and Garland, who turn in harrowing, nakedly emotional performances. These are star turns, to be sure, but the Hollywood-style interplay between image, portrayal, and reality is fascinating to behold.Awards & HonorsJudgment at Nuremberg received Academy Awards for Best Actor (Maximilian Schell) and Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium (Abby Mann). It also garnered nominations for Best Picture, Director (Stanley Kramer), Actor (Spencer Tracy), Supporting Actor (Montgomery Clift), Supporting Actress (Judy Garland), Art Direction-Set Decoration, Black-and-White (Rudolph Sternad, George Milo), Cinematography, Black-and-White (Ernest Laszlo), Editing (Frederic Knudtson), and Costume Design, Black-and-White (Jean Louis).

Richard Widmark plays the prosecuting attorney as if he were a holocaust victim. He was superb.Phenomenal in Oscar nominated supporting roles are Montgomery Clift and Judy Garland, Christian victims of the Nazi regime. Their testimony during the trial is chilling and shows what hate caught up in a society gone insane could produce.Marlene Dietrich, a real life refugee from Nazi Germany, is perfect as the wife of the executed Nazi army official. Knowing the wrongs that have occurred, she is nevertheless dismayed by the pictures of holocaust victims shown by the Widmark character at the trial.Stanley Kramer did a masterful job in directing a film that should be shown to students of the Holocaust and to all.",

            "content": "I am actually humbled by this film, and I am unusually grateful to have seen it, finally, 45 years after its making.There are some superficial aspects of *Judgement at Nuremberg* that are dated: some of Stanley Kramer's camera-work is unnecessarily showy or gimmicky. Some of the sets are noticeably fake, and some of the dialog is stilted, especially in early scenes outside the courtroom. The music goes momentarily over the top in the climactic confrontation between the key defendant, played by Burt Lancaster, and the chief judge (Spencer Tracy) after the trial.Much more striking, however, are the film's strengths, and how unusually well it holds up. I usually think of Kramer as an overstated liberal autodidact, but here the acting is, for the most part, admirably restrained and authentic. Even *William Shatner*--no kidding--is subtle here. After an unpromisingly sensational opening salvo by Richard Widmark as the chief prosecutor, this movie settles into a gravity, balance and rigorous honesty (both intellectual and emotional) that are utterly necessary for a serious treatment of a subject as overwhelmingly important as the origin and expression of Nazi evil.Balance is a key to this film's greatness. It is not insignificant that it was Maximillian Schell, who played the Nazi judges' defense attorney not as a slimy shyster but as a powerfully rigorous advocate determined to hold the *world's* feet to the fire rather than let his clients become patsies for a vast breakdown of moral responsibility with astonishingly widespread implications. By looking courageously into the teeth of the reality of German society and politics leading up to and during the Second World War and the reality of American, European and Communist moral failings, Abby Mann's great screenplay creates an extraordinarily persuasive context for the extraordinarily powerful thematic statements against Nazi atrocities with which it concludes.Two scenes near the movie's conclusion struck me most powerfully. First, I have never been more sickened, enraged and humbled by visual evidence of the Holocaust than I was when it was presented in the context of the trial at this film's center. Second, I was chilled--frightened in a very contemporary and immediate way--by the great speech of judgment given at the trial's end by Spencer Tracy's Chief Judge Dan Hayward. I urge anyone that is concerned about the erosion of civil liberties in America today to watch this film to better understand how insidiously evil may overtake a modern nation in crisis. More important, I urge anyone that believes that America is today in a crisis that requires extraordinary measures to watch this movie, listen with an open mind to this speech, and consider its implications for the direction of our own country today.Stepping down now from my soap box, let me say more clearly: Do yourself a favor and watch this movie. Never mind how old it is or how long it is or how dreary the subject may seem. If you care about the fate of humanity, you too will be grateful.",

He points out that the defendants were people of ability and intelligence- some were even remarkable.  If all of the people that helped this terrible thing along were depraved criminals and monsters, then these events would have no more moral significance than an earthquake or a flood. That good, even remarkable people in a time of crisis can delude themselves into heinous crimes against humanity is something to remember, to be guarded against. Personal morality is more important than the good of the state or going along with someone else's idea of right. The movie is a bit long, it actually takes the time to go into depth with the characters. It is definitely a powerful statement about personal responsibility. In one of the closing lines, Burt Lancaster's character (a defendant) tells Spencer Tracy's character (a judge) that he never knew it would come to that- all those people, he never knew. Tracy's character tells him that is came to that the minute he sentenced a man to death that he knew to be innocent.",

Judy Garland really surprised me . I never knew she had that in her and Richard Widmark is good as prosecutor Tad Lawson but the outstanding performance is from Spencer Tracy . His portrayal of Judge Dan Haywood is fantastic. A more measured performance you are unlikely to see.\nA criticism I do have is of Burt Lancaster. His accent was shocking . He sounded more Irish than German .Maximilian Schell won best Oscar for Hans Rolfe and while his performance is great it's a travesty that it didn't go to Spencer Tracy .It does feel Marlene Dietrich was squeezed into the cast to add a bit of glamour but her acting was very stiff as was her cosmetically enhanced face .I read recently that William Shatner is the last living member of the cast of Judgment at Nuremberg which is extremely sad .",

            "content": "SPOILERS.I watch this once in a while if it happens to be on TV because the performances are as good as they are. Tracy is the epitome of rock-ribbed Republican rectitude. Widmark is good. Maximilian Schell is nothing less than great. He deserved his awards. Burt Lancaster should avoid any part that calls for an accent unless the movie is a comedy. But Garland and Monty Clift are truly pathetic, for more reasons than the script gives them.But that's the problem with the movie -- the script. The trial is a court set up in such a way that we must fight the values behind World-War-Two Germany all over again. Except for Lancaster's character the defendants are inhuman caricatures. Werner Klemperer is compelled to be a malignant version of Colonel Klink. The others are plain nasty. And Schell must try to get them off by defending their actions, which is impossible. The best he can do for Lancaster is to argue that Lancaster knew the justice system was rotten but was determined to minimize the harm it did by working against it from the inside, occasionally letting rotten things happen because the rottenness was prescribed by the law. If you think about it, that's kind of what a judge is supposed to do, isn't it? See that the law is carried out? Here's how two analysts posed the dilemma: \"The criminal law usually punishes people that break laws, not carry them out. The responsibility imposed by such a standard requires a judge to choose between resigning immediately or becoming an international criminal if he enforces an unjust law or becoming a German criminal if he refuses to enforce it. This is a lot to ask of anyone.\" (Bergman and Isamov, \"Reel Justice,\" 1996.)But it's best not to think too hard about this movie. Some idea of its self-congratulatory and self-righteous nature is given by Abby Mann's speech when he won the academy award, accepting it not only for himself but \"for all intellectuals everywhere.\" Really. He's very mistaken if he actually believes that this movie is in any way \"intellectual.\" It doesn't invite analysis. It invites judgment based on hatred of the Nazis. Or, let's be honest about it, hatred of Germans. There isn't a good German in it. Tracy's butler and his wife seem compliant and obedient but \"we knew nothing of what was going on.\" Then there is Marlene Dietrich, cultivated and intelligent and helpful and friendly towards Tracy. When the guilty verdict comes in, her true nature reveals itself and she refuses to answer his phone call, sitting alone in the dark, filled with the kind of anger that brought Hitler to power. (The Germans will never change, not even the best of them.)Tracy has a last jailhouse conversation with Lancaster, at Lancaster's request. Burt has been mute throughout most of the trial, refusing to speak in his own defense, but here he tries to tell Tracy, as one morally upright man to another, that he, Lancaster, didn't know Germany was going to turn into what it did. Tracy sneers at him and says, \"You knew what was going to happen the first time you sent an innocent man to jail.\" That's judgment at Nurenberg for you.The movie never asks what a moral person might do in Lancaster's circumstances. Mann and Kramer don't bother to ask because they already know the answer. The rest of us may not be quite so sure what we might do because we are aware of our moral flaws, our weaknesses, our desire to get along trying to do well without stepping on too many toes or striking useless heroic poses. But the writer and director haven't really thought about it. The worst scene in the movie, perhaps, among so many, has Schell grilling Judy Garland (Judy Garland!), who as a young girl had some innocent dalliance with an elderly Jew who was then convicted of consorting with Aryans and was disappeared. The most damning evidence was that she'd been seen sitting on the man's lap. She stutters neurotically while Schell bears down on her and he finally shouts at her -- \"DID YOU -- SIT -- ON -- HIS -- LAP???\" Enough is enough, finally. I really dislike this movie for its fake humanitarianism. The victims were innocent, but does that make all of their countrymen evil? That's the kind of stereotypica, digital, black-and-white thinking that will lead to the next war, the next genocide. If the Nazis hadn't existed we would be almost forced to invent them because as a society we need bad examples. Without evil, how can we possibly convince ourselves that we are good? So we can all leave the theater or switch off the TV, eyes brimming with tears at the tragedy that has been brought to our attention again, cheapened though it is by this film, and go to bed glowing with self satisfaction.",

            "content": "The first reflection is a musical one, as I suddenly realize how Stanley Kramer liked to use hauntingly beautiful songs to enhance scenes. \"Lili Marleen\" is already itself a languid, melancholic song and the effect it has in \"Nuremberg\" is plain to see. Really ingenious however is the transformation of \"Waltzing Matilda\" into a dreamy a cappella background song that takes the dancing scene in \"On the beach\" (between Gregory Peck and Eva Gardner) to an emotional height.On a more serious plane, it's uncanny how this movie, 45 years later, is still right on its mark about American occupation of foreign soil, as of today. Defense attorney Hans Rolfe's (Maximilian Schell) biggest challenge is not in convincing the tribunal that his client Ernst Janning (Burt Lancaster) is innocent, but in convincing the client himself. The arguments he put before the court were the best he could marshal under the circumstances: (a) his client was obligated to carry out the law existing in his country at the time, no matter how evil these laws were; (b) if his client, and also the German people, were guilty of condoning Hitler's rise to power, the rest of the world must also be guilty; (c) his client was not aware of the atrocities going on under the Nazi regime, so chillingly depicted by prosecuting attorney Col. Tad Lawson (Richard Widmark). None of these was very compelling but he did the best he could, as even Judge Dan Haywood (Spencer Tracy) admitted.Rolfe's biggest challenge was to convince Janning that it's up to them both to be the last defense of the dignity of the German people. Without that dignity, Germany could never be rebuilt. But it was Janning, after all, who had better insight and foresight, to be able to see that to uphold the dignity of the German people, he must honestly admit his guilt rather than deny it. Janning was of course right. It's the German leaders who have the courage to admit the Nazi crimes (even when they were not part of it) that enable the country to be raise its head high again, cleansed of atrocities committed by a minority of extremists.The 4 key roles were superbly acted. I realize that it's quite meaningless but if I have to rank them, I would have to put Tracy first, followed by Widmark, Schell (even when he won the Oscar) and Lancaster. Not to be forgotten are the 3 marvelous actors in the supporting roles, played with no less excellence than the key roles \u0096 Marlene Dietrich, Montgomery Cliff and Judy Garland (not in any particular order).",

It's strange for a history teacher to hear that many want to forget the past, the pain and agonizing suffering inflicted on the innocent. For those who were actually there, or had friends, family or loved ones murdered by the Nazis, there can be no erasing the past. Occasionally a courageous film arises which endeavors to bring to light the black memories which so many wish would go away. In this black and white film called \" Judgement at Nuremberg \" the audience is offered a dramatic depiction of the War Crimes trial of the German Judges who themselves sent so many to die to appease their Nazi leaders. The star power of this movie is what makes it a monumental triumph and a fitting tribune to the victims of the Germanic court. In this story, based on the courtroom dockets of the Nuremberg trials, we have Spencer Tracy playing Chief Judge Dan Haywood, an American judge who makes an obvious observation and says, 'I've been here for some time now and as far as I can tell, No one, knew what was going on.' Burt Lancaster is Dr. Ernst Janning, the most senior judge on trial, who tried to explain the fervor of the times, the 'passing phase', saying, \"I never meant for things to go that far.\" Richard Widmark plays Col. Tad Lawson, who's despite his serious and sober evidence, is asked to show leniency. Maximilian Schell is brilliant as Hans Rolfe, the defense attorney. Werner Klemperer is Emil Hahn and William Shatner as Capt. Harrison Byers. True there are other stars of great distinction, but you must see the movie, to see how each contributed to make this incredible movie into a film Classic. ****",

            "content": "I saw \"Inherit the Wind\" not long ago without realizing that it's director and lead actor are also the principals in this film. Some of the thoughts I had about that picture I would second here as well. Neither one of these movies has made it into the American Film Institute list of Top One Hundred films, and only \"Judgment at Nuremburg\" cracks IMDb's own list of Top 250 films. That is an oversight I can't really understand, given some of the films that have been accorded such rank. Though I thought Spencer Tracy was a tad better in the earlier picture from 1960, he's superb here as well, portraying a judge with the thankless task of presiding over a World War II trial of civilian judges who promoted the Nazi cause by their own judicial decisions.At the heart of the picture is the decades old argument over the average German citizen's knowledge and/or complicity in the atrocities of the Nazi regime. The question prompts the expected direct confrontation in the courtroom drama, and is presented with much more subtlety in those scenes with Judge Haywood (Tracy) and Mrs. Bertholt (Marlene Dietrich), as well as the German housekeepers, the Halberstadt's (Ben Wright and Virginia Christine). All throughout, one has a sense that the shame of the Nazi regime has tainted all Germans, even though for most of it's countrymen, their main objective throughout the war was simply to survive.Yet the question of moral relativism offered in the picture is an important one. Where does one draw a line in the sand relative to absolute right and wrong? As a moral dilemma the question should be a simple one to answer. However when faced with an ethical choice to make, we know that sometimes expediency wins out over rationality, or in other words, do I choose life or death for myself and my family? It's easy to make these judgments with the 20/20 hindsight of sixty plus years gone by; not so easy when faced with that decision as a judge, a shop keeper, a soldier, a government official - all just doing their jobs and facing a brutal retribution if they don't.I've seen my fair share of World War II documentaries and movies using real footage from the death camps, as well as having visited Dachau on a European trip in the late Seventies. I'd have to say that the images shown by virtue of Colonel Lawson's (Richard Widmark) summation are by far the most horrific ones I've ever seen. Yet there are those, even today, who deny that the horror of Hitler and Nazi Germany ever occurred. It is one thing to bury the past, as Mrs. Bertholt attempts to convince Judge Haywood - \"We have to forget if we are to go on living\". For present and future generations, I would change a single word in that sentence to 'remember'.",

            "content": "Stanley Kramer's \"Judgment at Nuremberg\" is a courtroom drama based on the Nuremberg trials for war crimes which were held in the years following WWII. In particular, it was inspired by the Judges' Trial, which focused on a group of jurists.As producer, Kramer saw to it that his film was populated with an enviable cast. The performances of Spencer Tracy, Judy Garland and Montgomery Clift all resulted in Oscar nominations, while Maximilian Schell, reprising his role from an earlier television production, took home the Best Actor Oscar. Also starring were Marlene Dietrich, Burt Lancaster and Richard Widmark. Given this lineup, it is unsurprising that the acting is likely the picture's strong suit.However, that is not to say that the other elements of the film are unremarkable. After all, the picture did land eleven Oscar nominations, which suggests (accurately, in this case) that the film's production was a well-rounded one. While Kramer's direction gets somewhat repetitive over the course of three hours the cinematography and art direction are quite attractive throughout. All were awarded with Oscar nominations but, strangely, Ernest Gold's evocative score wasn't.Besides Schell's victory, the only other Oscar win went to Abby Mann for his adapted screenplay. To my mind, it's pretty good but not entirely successful. My main complaint is that Mann tries to do too much. While I give him credit for tackling the thorny subject of the guilt of the German people at large I don't think that it was handled particularly well. Bringing this angle into the film only made it seem more like a glib condemnation of the entire German people, which I hope was not Mann's intention. For me, consideration of this bigger picture only hurt the main thrust of the narrative, which, while not exactly clear-cut, was more well-defined.Ultimately, even though the script is the film's chief weakness, Kramer & company manage to hold the viewer's attention for the full three hours. While the film has several good points it also has the potential for coming across as self-righteous, so your appreciation of it may owe as much to personal factors as to filmmaking craft.",

A thrill because Stanley Kramer has directed this cast (Clift, Garland, Widmark, Tracy, Lancaster, Dietrich) with such finesse and high drama. Horror because it makes so clear the atrocities of World War II in Europe.There is documentary footage at the core of the film--views of the terrifying destruction of the city as seen just after the war, and actual concentration camp footage that will curdle your blood. And also at the core of the script, and the overall feel of the film, is a documentary truth. The trials really did occur in the city of Nuremberg, Germany, in 1948 and 1949. The Americans ran the judicial aspects because it was in the American sector of occupied Germany (Spencer Tracy is the presiding judge, brought in from Maine for the eight month ordeal). In the background is the contemporary and explosive crisis of post-war Berlin itself to the north. Berlin, the largest city, was in the Soviet sector, but the city itself was divided into four parts among the allies. If you don't quite follow the map and strings toward the end, it showed the famous Berlin Airlift. Because the Soviets closed off the roads in an aggressive attempt to claim all of Berlin as their own, the other three allies started flying everyday goods (from coal to food) to the city in an ongoing and expensive determination to not let the Soviets get away with it. Eventually access roads were reopened through East Germany, and Berlin remained accessible. The final evidence of this Soviet toughness was the Berlin Wall, not built until 1961--the year of this movie, and probably not a coincidence.All of this makes this three hour movie essential viewing--historically critical, visually terrific, amazing acting. But what gives the thing larger appeal over the decades is a bigger and trickier theme. How much is a criminal government and evil military the responsibility of its citizens, both the ordinary folks and the ones higher up in power but no directly responsible for the worst crimes? The four men on trial here are jurists from the Nazi years. They claim they had to go along with the regime or lose their jobs, and maybe worse. Some claimed they tried, from the bench, to soften the Nazi unfair and inhumane laws as best they could--better than if they resigned in protest and moved to America. But prosecutors argued that everyone has to maintain a legal and moral truth, that sending people to their death or to sterilization is a crime, no matter what the pressure from above. Watch to see how this man from Maine decides what kind of morality is truly just in the long run, in the big picture. The movie might look long on the poster, or on the package, but it will be gripping all through. It's a rare one.",

When we forget what it means to be human and when we negate the value of one human life, we set in motion the same terrifying sequence that happened in Germany.An excellent cast gives us powerful performances in a film that should be a lesson to everyone about what the worst elements of human nature can create.",

I become filled with an overwhelming urge to smack the next local who dares look at me askance. This uncontrollable reflex certainty that all the people around me had a part in atrocities of Naziism just completely takes over. It's ridiculous, but I can't help it. If you can't get to Europe, see this film. It does an absolutely masterful job of exploring the question of universal culpability, not only by Europeans, but by people everywhere. Techincially the film is flawless, the acting must be seen, no justice can be given to it here. I want to know when Hollywood stopped making quality films like this, films that examine the question of Truth without slipping in the idiot politics of the all too often idiot filmmakers.

There is considerable doubt about Janning's guilt; many of Janning's decisions as a judge were no different than those made by similar authorities in the US.Judge Haywood approaches Janning with a degree of fascination. Janning was no avid Nazi but a man of intellect and distinction.What is the responsibility of a man of integrity in a world gone mad?In occupied Germany, the Germans still bristle with hatred and resentment to their American conquerors, but the hatred is not quite so white hot as once was. The new Germany or at least West Germany would like to join the Western powers. Certainly a political figure like Judge Haywood is not immune to the pull to render a decision motivated by a spirit of reconciliation but one which integrity cannot sustain.The movie is a classic for having presented this inner conflict through multiple levels of ironies and without preaching.",

We don't get a simplistic presentation of them as monsters. They were men who were forced to make decisions that may not be moral but which put country first. There is a real sense that we are the flies on the walls of Spencer Tracy's office. He is determined to make the correct decision and decide whether these men should be executed. Their crimes are pretty black and white. The screenplay is remarkable. It took into account the realities of the time and the aftermath of the German people.

            "content": "I'd been meaning to see this movie since I can remember but never made it happen until it was on PBS last night. What makes this movie a classic is the message it conveys as well as the way it conveys it. The screenplay has many layers and makes it's points very subtlety-As a first generation American of parents who were both concentration camp survivors, the message had particular meaning for me. It's a message especially poignant as Americans today better understand the pitfalls of confusing constructive political criticism/dissent with not being Patriotic -and putting political party before country.\"The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing\", is a quote attributed to Edmund Burke- and is entirely what \"Judgement at Nuremberg\" is all about. What happened in Nazi Germany is not confined to the German people, it could happen in almost any country of the world, given the right circumstances. The defense \"I was just following orders\" is without merit.... -that is, if we are serious about wanting to live in a society we can be proud of.Spencer Tracy is so good in this movie it's difficult to put into words. His role is a very delicate one and he pulls it off like few actors in history could ever hope to. Tracy's role is all the more impressive in the company of scores of Hollywood stars that grace this film.There are weaknesses in the movie. I was surprised that, even given the subject matter, I found \"Judgement at Nuremberg\" too often melodramatic- the pacing and dialog often so slow that it bordered on comical. In this regard Director Stanley Kramer overdoes it IMHO.Spoiler: The full weight of the story is brought to bear at the end when the guilty verdicts are given. Spencer Tracy, as the lead judge, pronounces the sentences on the Nazi government officials. Many of the accused officials are unrepentant and antagonistic to the idea of being judged by the American court, but Burt Lancaster plays the role of a German official who takes shame in his actions during the war.Lancaster was a Nazi court Judge who allowed himself to take orders from party officials. His testimony shows that he did things against his better judgment and we see him as a relatively good man who got caught up in the political momentum and Nazi system.When Tracy pronounces life sentences to the hard core Nazi's, he does so in a voice that betrays little emotion or anger. When he gets to Lancaster's character you're expecting Tracy to be more lenient on him, but instead he raises his voice in great anger and emotion as he also sentences him to life imprisonment. Tracy was angrier with him because he expected more from Lancaster -because he knew better yet didn't act.In the last scene Lancaster is a broken man seeking some form of forgiveness from the man who sentenced him, and asks to see Tracy in his cell-room. Tracy obliges and takes his time to listen. Lancaster expresses his sorrow and pleads for the judge to understand that no one could have predicted the incredible evil that resulted from the Nazi regime... as the times were so chaotic it was impossible to not get caught up in it all. \"I couldn't know\".As Lancaster is broken and repentant, one is tempted to forgive him for his actions. The camera goes to Spencer Tracy- he pauses and, with a soft voice, respectfully states... \"you should have known as soon as you sentenced men to die who you knew were innocent\". Understanding the point is inescapably true- Lancaster's face falls, Tracy leaves and the movie ends.It's powerful stuff and a poignant lesson for all of us who like to think of ourselves as \"good people\".",

            "content": "This famous film from 1961 features some of the most familiar faces of the period, most of which are recognizable by viewers who are old enough. (I only first saw it several nights ago on PBS.) The star of this film is, of course, Spencer Tracy as chief judge Dan Haywood soon after he played, in effect, lawyer Clarence Darrow in \"Inherit the Wind\" a similar role. Others following are Burt Lancaster whose stature as an actor was rising as he stretched himself more and more and eventually played the starring role in Visconti's \"The Leopard\" ( Il Gattopardo\"). Richard Widmark played the prosecutor Tad Lawson and Maximillian Schell played the defense lawyer, Hans Rolfe. Montgomery Clift also appeared as a victim of the Nazi enforced sterilization law.The growing friendship between chief Judge Haywood and Frau Bertholt (Marlene Dietrich) seems to defy judicial protocol but it does give Dietrich, (In reality a noted enemy of the Third Reich), a chance to remind people of her association with the World War II song \"Lili Marlene\".At one point the character played by Richard Widmark introduces the familiar, still upsetting, graphic photos taken by the Allies at the liberation of the concentration camps.Towards the end of the film we get some appearances by, of all people, Judy Garland which should remind of us of her acting ability in addition to her stature as perhaps the greatest entertainer of the 20th Century! She plays a woman involved in what was a real case of an elderly Jewish man executed on trumped-up charges of defiling the \"racial purity\" laws of Nazi Germany.The first of the many real Nuremberg trials had many defendants but director Kramer concentrates only on four fictional criminals. Still, this film is a notable indictment of those who evaded their responsibilities towards humanity during one of the biggest blots on human history!",

            "content": "Out of all the movies I've seen that pertain to the second world war, Judgement at Nuremberg has got to be one of the best. It does have some problems, but for the most part, this is one of the most impressive and important movies ever made. It doesn't really concern world war 2, but involves itself with it in an indirect way. The year following the end of the war (1946) saw many of the remaining leaders of Hitler's Germany rounded up and made to stand trial before an international tribunal in the city of Nuremberg. The defendants included such men as Albert Speer, Hitler's architect and armaments minster, as well as Karl Doenitz, head of the german navy, and Hermann Goering, leader of the luftwaffe. The defendants were made to watch horrible footage of the \"final solution\", which was Hitler's plan to rid Europe once and for all of people he said were racially inferior. After the trials, most of the former leaders were convicted of crimes against humanity, basically meaning what they did was so atrocious it was offensive to everyone, and then they were executed. Goering committed suicide before he could be hanged. This movie's title is a bit misleading, because it's not about those trials done right after the war. It concerns itself with different trials later in the 40's. Spencer Tracy plays judge Dan Haywood, who is the leader of the judges overseeing the trial against former nazi judges. It soon becomes clear that the former nazis are not going to be the pushovers the tribunal is expecting. One of the defendants (Janning) is a highly intelligent and imposing man, and he's unwilling to go down without a fight. One of the movie's highlights is the lawyer Hans Rolfe, played by Max Schell. He is probably one of the best things the movie has to offer, since he tries to defend Hitler's actions several times in the courtroom, saying how America did things just as bad as the germans (if not worse). He brings up eugenics programs conducted in the US and the nukes dropped on Japan at the end of the war. Horrendous exhibits are shown to the court, including USA serial number \"254\"; a shrunken human head used as a paperweight. The trouble is, it's easy to show the evil of the nazi regime. Even the men who used to wear swastikas on their way to work each day can't defend what was just shown, but none of this is enough to connect them to a major crime committed during the war. Later on, Judy Garland appears as the character Irene Hoffmann, who is accused of having a sexual relationship with a non-aryan. It shows how the average german also had to be complacent and accepting of the reich's laws, no matter how absurd they seemed. Near the end, the Soviets blockade Berlin, and Americans are forced to fly in food and supplies to them in what would eventually become known as the Berlin Airlift. By now, Judge Haywood knows he has to do what he has to do, even if he doesn't feel it's right. He understands the importance of giving the former nazis a light sentence, because it will help bolster german support against the USSR. At the same time, he can't turn a blind eye to the things these men did during the war. All four defendants are found guilty and receive life imprisonment. At the end, the movie says as of 1961, none of the 99 defendants tried at the second Nuremberg trials were still serving jail time. This is an excellent movie. There's some things to nitpick, like how Marlene Dietrich plays Tracy's love interest but mostly disappears towards the end, but this one's got it where it counts. Burt Lancaster as Ernst Janning is one of the most believable characters in the movie, and as a former nazi, he understands the shameful past his countrymen wants to put behind them. He barely speaks in this movie, but his actions speak louder than words. Schell is without a doubt one of the movie's strong points, and he really starts to lose his temper several times during the trial, even screaming at Garland when she doesn't admit to being in the \"blood defiling\" relationship. It is a very long movie, but that's just because there are a lot of things to experience in it. It was made so we may never forget what that horrible conflict 80 years ago did to everyone who was involved, and those who forget history are forced to relive unpleasant events. Schell also walked off with the oscar for best actor due to this film, which is hardly surprising.",

            "content": "Every now and again you see a film that you think needs to be seen by everybody. This is such a film. You really are depriving yourself of a life-enhancing experience if you miss it.It is essentially a courtroom drama, exposing the true horrors of the Nazi regime. While many of the leading Nazis were indeed tried at Nuremberg for war crimes in the late 1940s, the co-accused in this case are fictional characters, which allows the actors and writer the luxury of concentrating on emotions and themes rather than impersonations.Spencer Tracy excels as the world-weary American Judge brought in to preside over the case. He is a man on a journey, trying desperately to discover a rational basis for what has happened to a once great people. His quiet style contrasts with the fiery passion displayed by both the Defence Counsel Maximilian Schell, a proud, intelligent young German determined to establish that not all his countrymen are to blame for the brutality of the Nazi regime, and lead Prosecutor Richard Widmark, a bitter military man who is set only on vengeance and retribution.Schell's character deserves some explanation. This is no Nazi. His love for his country is based not on the Germany of Hitler but of Bismarck and before. Impressive and eloquent, he battles doggedly against the odds because he genuinely believes that the interests of Germany and the wider world will be better served by forgiveness and absolution, rather than Widmark's brutal, indiscriminate revenge. Schnell rightly won the Best Supporting Actor Oscar for conveying all this. The only wonder, for me, is that none of the other players joined him on the Academy's lists.The most impressive of the four defendants is the noble law professor played by Burt Lancaster. But for me, one of the best performances in this film of great acting all round is that by Werner Klemperer, as the only truly unrepentant Nazi, exuding menace and resentment from every pore. The female interest is provided by Marlene Dietrich, the aristocratic widow of a leading Nazi official, whose house has been confiscated and given to Tracy's character for the duration of the trial. The two strike up an unlikely friendship, the tenderness of which contrasts starkly with the harsh reality exposed in the courtroom. One of the best scenes in the film is Dietrich's sad translation of the words of 'Lili Marlene' as it is sung by sombre passers-by as she is walked home by Tracy. It turns out to be an even more tragic song than we had imagined, and as such stands as a poignant symbol of the case as a whole.I like courtroom dramas. They provide claustrophobic settings which seem to breed great performances and tense, dramatic conflicts. There is no love lost between the two young lawyers in this film, and their exchanges are explosive. Nor is there any camaraderie between the four defendants, lurking in the dock in their varying degrees of denial and repentance. An array of tragic witnesses proceeds through the trial - the most notable being played by a troubled Judy Garland - and Tracey's quest for understanding puts him at odds with his fellow Judges on the case. It is a film therefore of individuals. Apart from the faltering liaison between Tracy and Dietrich, few partnerships are formed. Its bleak structure in this sense mirrors the tightly drawn courtroom setting and the ruined, desolate streets created by Kramer to evoke the post-war reality of German misery and shame.We share the shock and horror of the court as the full extent of the atrocities are revealed for the first time. And just as we think the film can't get any better, Tracy makes his final summing up speech: an 11-minute masterpiece, eloquently written and perfectly presented (allegedly in a single take). It stands up even today as a flawless exposition of uncompromising humanity. It is not the final scene of the film however. That comes a little later, between Tracy and Lancaster, and the closing line is - quite simply - devastating.You must see this film. It is the kind of cinematic experience that truly changes lives.",

And if you're a movie geek, you know what I'm talking about: movies that creak under the weight of their own artistic, social, and moral pretensions, movies that act like they're two-hour long editorials for the filmmakers' views rather than cinema. JUDGMENT AT NUREMBERG could have fallen into such a trap. Its subject matter is no doubt important, but the movie never feels dry or self-important, if that makes any sense. The whole thing is packed with interesting characters and heightened by engaging direction. It never feels a minute of its three-hour runtime.JUDGMENT AT NUREMBERG is about more than just a historical event. It's about the ideas of collective guilt and how people use the apathy of the majority to justify going against what they believe is right. This is all illustrated by some fascinating characters and performances. Everyone is utterly human. It's hard to judge most of these people, if only because the movie makes it clear that most people will sell their morals for a quiet, undisturbed life-- though the price is indeed, very high, as we see in the character of Jannings, a once-idealistic judge who essentially sold his soul to the Third Reich, condemning an innocent man because he was Jewish only because not doing so would have sent him to the camps.The last scene in particular is just stunning.

            "content": "I've seen this film many times, and it still can affect me powerfully,with small, previously unnoticed details of performances and direction. Spencer Tracy has the job of carrying most of the movie, aided by strong performances from the other actors. Most of the story line is seen through his eyes, with frequent opportunities for ordinary Germans to try to explain that, as Marlene Dietrich's widow tells the judge, \" we are not all monsters.\" Judge Haywood studies the writings of defendant Jannings in a serious effort to understand the man on trial, who seems apart from his unrepentant colleagues.Maximilian Schell, as the German advocate for Jannings, gets equal time with the impassioned, righteously angry prosecutor Richard Widmark. It would have been easy to let this character become a one dimensional villain, but Schell achieves the difficult task of showing Herr Rolfe not as a Nazi apologist, but a patriotic German trying to clear his country's name, and doing the best he can in a very difficult position.All of the cast are excellent, with particularly fine performances from Montgomery Clift, Dietrich and Judy Garland. The writing is taut and disturbingly effective, in showing the ruins of a once civilized nation trying to rebuild itself ,while haunted by war guilt and the shame of defeat. The only weakness is an occasional tendency to get a little too preachy, or some scenes perhaps being a little too neatly dramatic, with the result that the movie is a little stagy at times. But its strengths far outweigh any minor faults.Perhaps one sequence might best sum up the historical reality, in a small but brilliant scene. Judge Haywood is shown attempting to maintain order, apply justice fairly, and combat his own prejudices, as well as those of many other Americans. He has befriended the widow of a German general, and they are having a quiet drink in a tavern, when the crowd of revelers breaks into a cheerful old folk song, sung with great gusto by all present. Haywood looks around the room at the merry making Germans and his face tightens into an appraising frown.He clearly is thinking that the people are a little too eager to put the war and its memories behind them. It is an extremely powerful moment in a very dramatic film.Highly recommended as both history and a compelling courtroom drama, with some unforgettable performances by a great cast.",

Spencer Tracy, Montgomery Clift, Richard Widmark seem at the top of their game whilst that of Burt Lancaster is sublimely remarkable. Maximilian Schell maybe overdoes it occasionally but within the context this seems appropriate enough whilst the utterly controlled performance from Judy Garland is a sensation. Marlene Dietrich is a welcome participant if not quite a match for the others but the real surprise is William Shatner.

            "content": "One rarely finds a movie that works on as many levels as Kramer's famous JUDGEMENT AT NUREMBERG. The film concerns an American judge (Spenser Tracy) sent to Germany to preside over a war-crimes trial at a point when American politicians are less concerned about justice than about securing German support re the Cold War. As such, the film concerns not only the Nazi atrocities on trial, but the American government's willingness to become accomplices after the fact if such will buttress America's own military interests. The film repeatedly raises questions concerning the price of such deliberate, feigned public ignorance--both as it was manifest in Nazi Germany before and during the war and as it is now becoming manifest in America and its allies after the war.The action of the film divides between the courtroom and the judge's personal experiences in Nuremberg. The courtroom scenes are quite powerful, with Maximillian Schell as the attorney for the defense who argues that his clients knew nothing of the holocaust and Richard Widmark who argues that one could not live in Nazi Germany without being aware of the holocaust. At the same time the judge finds the same battle in his social life when he meets Marlene Dietrich, widow of a Nazi officer, who insists that the German people (herself among them) were completely ignorant of Nazi atrocities and who clearly feels judgment of the German people should be quietly set aside now that the war is over. Ultimately, of course, Tracy must pass judgment both in the court and in his personal relationships on the degree to which claims of ignorance can be accepted as truth--and must accept responsibility for the result.Tracy and Dietrich's remarkable performances are equaled by Widmark and Schell. Indeed, the entire cast--which includes Burt Lancaster, Judy Garland, and Montgomery Cliff--is particularly fine. The script is remarkable for its directness, the cinematography is quite basic, and the score is both discreet and atmospheric. The film's conclusion, which includes a confrontation between judge Tracy and accused Lancaster, is extremely memorable. Although some may find the film a bit long or a bit too intellectual, most will be impressed with virtually every aspect of JUDGEMENT AT NUREMBERG--and most particularly with the casual restraint with which it tells it story and makes it powerful point. Required viewing. Highly recommended.Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer",

In this movie, the issue is the leadership of the country and its accountability for the war, and how that accountability will be handled.  No one escapes criticism as the protagonists try to assign blame.  Stunning performances all around (even from William Shatner!) and cinematography that proves why b/w films were art.  In the end, though, it all comes down to the moral decisions we each make as individuals and our willingness to live with our choices.

            "content": "Directed by Stanley Kramer, this movie is the story of a great courtroom drama involving judges of Nazi Germany. The judges, including a great jurist who became the Minister of Justice, administered laws aimed at imposing racial purity and mandatory sterilization. Human beings were treated as pawns in the hands of these men in the name of the Nazi state. The presiding judge, played superbly by Spencer Tracey, is a model of integrity. In the role of the former minister of justice is Burt Lancaster, a cut above the other small-minded tyrants who had no conscience in carrying out their cruel sentences to produce the master race. Despite his character and his great legal mind, he too was complicit in the tragedy. In fact, his sharp sense of revulsion about these crimes, made him even more repellant as he went against his own conscience and training. The other cast members include Maximilian Schell as the defence attorney, Richard Widmark as the prosecuting attorney, Judy Garland and Montgomery Clift as key witnesses as well as victims, and Marlene Dietrich as the widow of wartime criminal already executed. All the cast are outstanding. While the story is overly long, we get a strong sense of the characters and how Tracey as a judge lived and mingled with the people of Nuremberg during his time in the occupied post-war country. The director, Stanley Kramer, made movies that showed people of conscience in conflict with the established order. He made use of great acting talents like Burt Lancaster and Spencer Tracey to issue strong statements of principle. This movie is a prime example of his great legacy as a director.",

However, Abby Mann's grave and somewhat verbose teleplay is never particularly entertaining. Spencer Tracy is a Maine judge sent to Germany to oversee the trial of four German judges accused of crimes against humanity. Tracy is quite stoic and the film offers a number of great parts for a number of great actors: Montgomery Clift; Burt Lancaster; Marlene Dietrich; Judy Garland. Garland in particular is astounding in the role of a German woman forced to relive the horrors she endured under the Third Reich. Richard Widmark is the American prosecutor and he's well matched against Maximillian Schell as the fiery German defense attorney. Filmed both on location and on a Hollywood sound stage, the film is decidedly non-cinematic; as though Kramer did not want to present such a serious subject in any way that may seem too flashy. Werner Klemperer, Edward Binns and William Shatner are in it too. The music score is by Ernest Gold and the B&W cinematography is by Ernest Laszlo. Clift, unable to remember his dialog, reportedly improvised much of his part. Director Kramer would lighten up considerably with his next film (IT'S A MAD, MAD, MAD, MAD WORLD).",

            "content": "\"Judgment at Nuremberg\" chronicles one of the most shameful periods in human history, one that some have not only forgotten but even dismissed as ever existing. Thanks to Stanley Kramer and Co. we are presented with a cathartic and engrossing take on the actual trials that took place between 1945 and 1949 that is as memorable as it is enduring. When four Nazi judges are tried for committing crimes against humanity, it is up to Chief Justice Haywood to carefully examine the evidence presented by many to come to a verdict.In one has to be one of the finest courtroom dramas ever filmed, the 3 hour run time really feels like much less and much can be attributed to the tour-de-force direction of Stanley Kramer. His minimalist filmmaking and innovative camera angles almost instantly brings to mind the engrossing camera-work from another treasured courtroom drama in \"12 Angry Men\", directed masterfully by Sidney Lumet. The camera is so subtle and swift in its movement that it becomes a kind of conscious onlooker of the case \u2013 this technique almost eliminates the feel of a screen between us and the film and inexplicably thrusts you right into the court with all of the other attendants. It also keeps your eyes absolutely glued to each nuance and detail that arises in the courtroom.Spencer Tracy gives a fantastically understated performance as Judge Dan Haywood, the morally conflicted and kindhearted judge. Tracy's character is able to appeal to both our ethics and emotions by playing his role with complete conviction and honesty. As the trials progress, we find ourselves wondering how we would operate in his authority \u2013 and he makes it clear throughout the film that every decision he makes affects not merely the soldiers on trial, but an entire country and even generations to come. Consider in the concluding trial scenes the way he shows a palpable struggle to declare Lancaster's character (Ernst Janning) guilty, masterfully demonstrating an imbalance between what his head and heart want. Also fantastic in their roles, albeit short-lived, are Judy Garland, Montgomery Clift and William Shatner.Maximilian Schell plays Hans Rolfe, a German defence attorney, who argues that the defendants were not the only ones to assist in, or turn a blind eye to, the crimes. This too is a morally conflicted man (one of many prominent themes in the film) who is determined on preserving the dignity of a nation. And his arguments are centered on the notion that these soldiers were trying to act in the best interest of the country. Schell is compassionate, astute and compelling in his role and makes each time he sets foot on the podium a memorable one. It's also highly entertaining to watch his back-and-forths with Richard Widmark's Colonel Tad Lawson in the courtroom.This film is impeccably written, acted and directed. I am hesitant to use the word 'film' here because a creation of this kind, that tackles this kind of subject matter so perfectly, is so much more than that. It shows how pervasive and damaging an ideology can become in a particular context. It's devastating to imagine these times actually existing and it takes something like \"Judgment at Nurembourg\" to remind people that they did indeed happen. This is powerful filmmaking at its finest, whose merit far exceeds its mere entertainment value. Masterpiece.",

Spencer Tracy portrays the chief trial judge on a three-judge panel; Burt Lancaster is defendant Ernst Janning, a legal scholar and an exterminator of lives; Marlene Dietrich is the widow of a German general who had been executed by the Allies; Maximilian Schell is Hans Rolfe, the German defense attorney who suggests that U.S. forces committed acts that were as bad as those of the Nazis. Producer-director Stanley Kramer and screenwriter Abby Mann, adapting his \"Playhouse 90\" presentation from 1959, cook up an intense (if long-winded) verbal sparring match in the courtroom, and each of the actors is given a solo moment in the spotlight to sound off. While the material is certainly gripping, Kramer's presentation is so baleful and lumbering as to seem occasionally inert. This was the social message drama of its year, so naturally the Oscars came calling (the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences loves prestige, and this anguished epic ups the ante by casting A-list actors in every key role). Nominated for 11 Academy Awards (winning two, for Schell as Best Actor and Mann for his writing), the picture served its purpose and brought a devastating chapter to light--but, in the end, it's a Hollywood light, and there's a smug, self-congratulatory air about the film that keeps it from being a truly emotional document. **1/2 from ****",

Nuremberg, like the rest of Germany, is to a great extent still rubble but people are already starting to try to forget the whole thing and frequent bars and restaurants again, along with members of the American occupying forces. Most seem to be relieved the war is over and to get on with life. The last of the war crime trials against lower-ranking Nazis are taking place.                                  In this setting we meet several characters: Madame Bertholt (Marlene Dietrich), the aristocratic German lady who disliked Hitler but is now nevertheless suffering the consequences of the war, having lost all including her military husband; the American Col. Lawson (Richard Widmark), the prosecutor at the war crime trials who, in a moment of drunkeness, admits his discomfort in occupying a country with an older and grander history than his own; Hans Rolfe, defense attorney for the defendants, who just might feel an underlying guilt over the ruthlessness he'll have to show in the courtroom but which nevertheless is required by him to best serve his legal calling; and the great Spencer Tracy as the presiding American Judge Haywood. The judge has been given Madame Bertholt's grand house to live in for the trial, and a perfect example of how this film shows the wide range of emotions in most human beings is his obvious guilt of invading this fine lady's house (even though she was the enemy) and the instant attraction between them. The wide range of emotions are so well portrayed in this film, which probably accurately represent the spectrum of people in Germany at this time. Nothing is black and white, no one is a total villain, everyone is a complicated human being. The dialogue is always electrifying, and this isn't even taking into account the courtroom drama (which is about half the film's time); which is genuinely disturbing..though this is primarily through the acting: Judy Garland as a woman reliving her past nightmare of inprisonment for having associated with a Jew; and Montgomery Clift as a man who underwent forced medical sterilization for being a Communist (Clift's portrayal of this wreck of a man is one of the best most heartbreaking pieces of acting you'll ever see). There's also an incredible speech by defendant Ernst Janning (Burt Lancaster) at the end which just might be the greatest insight, perhaps,  into why the Third Reich was so successful at sweeping Germany.

However, the rise of Hitler not only improved people's livelihood, promoted economic development, solved the problem of employment, increased national strength, but also greatly cultivated national self-confidence and pride. Can such a man be unpopular with the people? He took the germans out of the shadow of the first world war and inferiority, gave Germany strength and hope, he hoped to lead all the people in Europe can develop like Germany, so he did not stop using force to achieve his grand goal. As far as Hitler's rhetoric is concerned, it would be good news for europeans if his dream came true. Under the efforts of Hitler and the Nazi party, the iron fact made people believe that everything Hitler did was for the happiness of the whole nation, and there was no reason not to support him. The servants in the film also said that Hitler did a lot of good things for the germans, such as building roads.\nIn such a situation, even the judge has lost his judgment, let alone ordinary people? And he didn't like Hitler himself.\nMrs Berhalter defends her husband: he does not like the nazis, he does not like Hitler, but as a soldier it is his duty to obey orders. But in the end her husband was executed;\nAt the same time, many people did not know about the camp because it was carried out by the ss, the stormtroopers and the secret police.\nIn this trial, the defense of janine's lawyer was brilliant, asking the right questions:Janine said, 'our achievements are based on our lofty ideals.' why are we successful? What about the rest of the world? Don't they know the intentions of the third Reich? Didn't they hear what Hitler was saying around the world? Did they publish in all the countries of the world what mayne canaveri had to say about his intentions? What was the role of the Soviet union, which had signed an agreement with Hitler in 1939 to encourage him to wage war? Can we convict the soviets? What is the Vatican's responsibility for reaching the height of Hitler's prestige by signing an agreement with him in 1933? Can we convict the Vatican? Is the world leader Winston Churchill to blame? 1938! 1938! In an open letter in The Times of London, he said that when England had suffered a national catastrophe, I should pray to god to send a wise and resolute Hitler. Can we convict Churchill? Where is the responsibility of those American industrialists? Can we convict these American industrialists of helping Hitler make weapons and profit from them? No, Sir, no, only the germans are innocent, and the whole world is responsible for Hitler and Germany. It is easy to convict a man on the bench, it is easy to say that the German system and people were at fault for Hitler's rise to power, while at the same time turning a blind eye to the institutional and national errors with which the soviets had signed the agreement with him, and Churchill praised him and the americans for helping him.\nJanin said he was wrong, and if so, janin's sin was the sin of the world.\nIf they are all guilty, the russians, the British, and the americans are also guilty, why are the others/countries not tried, and why should the americans judge only them?\nBut the story of a winner and a loser.\nIf the americans had lost the war and the germans had won, perhaps there would have been a change in the dock and the bench, and in this trial the American judge who had won the war said that the German judge who had lost the war had not presided over the execution of the law. In this sense, the trial of these judges is a political game, because the law in such cases is not neutral, but victorious. The law here is not the representative of justice, but the puppet of politics. As the movie says, the men were sentenced, but they were eventually released for political reasons.\nIt is conceivable that if the United States fought Iraq, and the United States lost, and Iraq occupied the United States, instead of saddam hussein being tried and hanged, bush being tried and hanged. Consider judge Hahn's closing statement: germans fight for their lives and must take specific measures to ensure it is not invaded by foreign enemies. How similar this is to the rhetoric of the United States in the war on terror.\nThrough this film, it is very good for the so-called victors to reflect on what role we played in the tragedy of the world. We have always said that justice will prevail, is the story of the world are eulogizing the victory of justice, but saw this film, but I felt the victory are just. That is to say, not to say that justice will prevail, but victory will be justice. Which reminds me of another sentence: evil is to win, because just stand by.I wonder if that's what the Chinese government means when they keep saying that most Japanese are innocent? Are ordinary good people victims of a system, an idea, a propaganda voice and a machine?\nIt is easy to condemn others, but difficult to reflect on oneself",

Can one be absolved from guilt by appealing to authority, as in \"I was only following orders\"? Do we blame a select few, or is there a larger guilt, that perhaps extends beyond national boundaries?Those curious about this dark period in human history will find this story's attempts to answer these questions both interesting and thought-provoking. The defendants are not those who actually carried out those diabolical orders, but the enablers, judges in the Third Reich's judicial system, such as it was.  While cast in the format of a military tribunal, the judges forming the triumvirate of justices are civilians, seemingly plucked from the backwaters of jurisprudence.  The defense counsel is an admirer and student of one of the defendants, and he must do his utmost to defend men that he knows, deep down, are monstrously guilty of crimes the rest of us can only experience in nightmares.The cast of this film is extraordinary.  It is one where even the supporting players are superstars in their own right.  Spencer Tracy heads the list, and his performance is its usual top-notch best, but his character is surprisingly low-key except for several powerful moments, especially when he pronounces his devastating personal judgment on Herr Janning (in private). Schell won the Best Actor Oscar for his role as defense counsel and deservedly so.  Burt Lancaster as the focal figure of the defendant judges is also remarkable, and his acknowledgment of his guilt allows his character some measure of personal redemption, and he holds his own in the face of the backlash from his fellow defendants.  Montgomery Clift, Marlene Dietrich, and of course Richard Widmark round out a cast that must be considered among the best ever assembled for a film of this type.  Movie fans will appreciate seeing Werner Klemperer in a serious role as one of the defendant judges, and a youthful-looking William Shatner as the military aide to Tracy's character.  However, the dialog doesn't allow for any trademark Shatner \"dramatic pauses\".  Alas.The filming is in black and white and this adds to the starkness of post-war Nuremberg and the dreariness of a defeated nation.  The haunting scene of Tracy's character's lonely walk through the stadium at Nuremberg that was the scene of many Nazi party rallies, and the famous balcony from which Der Furher harangued his audiences, evoke powerful emotions and memories of those dark years.  Likewise do the desperate appeals of the domestic help serving Tracy at his residence, begging him to believe that they \"were not political\".  You know that they knew, but are still trying to live the lie.This is a must viewing for those who have a historical interest in post-war happenings, as well as those who value dramatic filmmaking at its classic best.",

            "content": "(First of all: My English isn't that good - I hope I can express what I intend to say. Maybe I've invented a few new words?)Just two weeks ago I saw the \"Reichsparteitagsgel\u00e4nde\" at Nuremberg, where the Nazis celebrated their Military Parades. Spencer Tracy also walked there in the film, and so I watched the film once again the day I came back home. It impresses me every time I see it. The actors are brilliant, and the characters seem very realistic to me. There are no only-good-men or only-bad-men. Even the accused ones seem in a way like ordinary people, and I think this is the big unbelievable thing about WWII: That people went to their working place, decided about life or death of innocent men and women and went home in the evening to take their meal and play with the children.I like the film, because it also shows the difference between the german people, if you compare the Burt Lancaster character with the still fanatic accused man and the servants at Spencer Tracy's household. The Marlene Dietrich character is also very interesting if you know that a lot of germans regarded her as a traitor, when she left Germany to support the USA fighting against Hitler. I don't like Maximilian Schell's acting as much as other commentators of this site do, but maybe it's because I only know the German version of the film, and maybe Schell isn't very talented in synchronizing his own voice: He always shouts as if he sells something on a market.I have two problems with the movie: The first one is when Lancaster stands up in court like a hero because Schell is talking to Garland in the way the Nazis always did. In my opinion ths scene is to dramatic. The second problem I often think about is about the witness Montgomery Clift (who plays incredibly good): His character is so touching, and everyone in court thinks that his sterilisation was an act of cruelness - unless Schell proofs that Clift came from a weak-minded family and was weak-minded himself. And suddenly the opinion about his case seems to change. And this is something I can't understand. For me it doesn't matter if a person is very clever or  a real fool - sterilisation is against the human rights.But once again: It's one of my favourite films! And at last one tip for those who like \"judgement...\": Stanley Kramer's \"Ship Of Fools\". Watch it and think about which of those fools on the ship you are...?",

            "content": "JUDGEMENT AT NUREMBERG (1961) :The Most Powerful and Justifying Courtroom Drama Ever ! Among all the court room dramas i have seen from 50s 'Witness For The Prosecution', '12 Angry Men' (very much an exception) to 90s 'A Few Good Men' and then many Bollywood films made post 2000, the former held the top spot until today. Judgement At Nuremberg has just surpassed Witness For The Prosecution to become the Best Court room drama i have ever seen. The fictionalized version of the true story didn't lose the essence and moral values and that's something was not there in Witness For The Prosecution. As a thriller it was better film but as a Film, as justice and as impact, Judgement At Nuremberg overtook comfortably. The film is about the trail held by American Judges at Nuremberg against Nazis for their crimes during World War II. The long runtime of 180 minutes doesn't bother at all because you are in the Courtroom in first 30 minutes and there is nothing sort of cold or mild things in the beginning, rather the aggressive nature helps it to catch the momentum very early. It explores sickening truth and the cover up, it shows the politics and cruel unjustified facts and then it ends on a strong note where Justice Triumphs and the right thing is done against all national pressure made through beneficial politics. I love this man Spencer Tracy already but now i love him more after watching this terrific performance as Judge Haywood. Burt Lancaster does it again with conviction, he's always fantastic in such roles. Richard Widmark came as a complete surprise for me and as far as the surprise is pleasant i don't mind having it. Now, the best man in the film Mr. Maximilian Schell. He was just phenomenal, a deserving Best Actor at Oscars only if i care for Oscars much. I was disappointed that Marlene Dietrich didn't get much to do in this Court room quarrels because her performance in Witnesse For The Prosecution was Top Class. The dialogues in the film are impactful and teases you to accept bitter truth. Here it goes, \"To be logical is not to be Right\" and the last one stays in memory as Haywood says, \"Herr Janning, it \"came to that\" the first time you sentenced a man to death you knew to be innocent.\" An awkward silence followed. Cinematography of this is an achivement in itself. The long shots, camera pan, circular angles and then sudden zooming on the characters everything is Absolutely High Class. Stanley Kramer is one of those director who i think doesn't lose the essence and main motive of the film. He doesn't add any useless typical stuff in his films. I liked his \"Guess Who's Coming To Dinner\" because the film successfully explored the taboo subject of cultural hypocrisy and in 'Judgement At Nuremberg' he elaborated things from the both the sides and made us silently confused on which side to choose because we are part of this world which is at stake. Kramer kept the film intresting, he kept the USP factors alive and the best thing he did is he didn't add any unnecessary bytes like Romance, Love, Dramatic Sacrifice etc. He knew what he wanted to make what he wanted to show and what he wanted to achieve and he did it without losing a single bit of vision. Judgement At Nuremberg is one of those rare films where you realise that the Justice and Right thing must be done even if the entire world is against it. Undoubtedly the Most Powerful Courtroom Film ever made on Justice. A MASTERPIECE !RATING - 9/10*By - #samthebestest",

            "content": "Stanley Kramer was more active as a producer rather than a director, but, when he stood for something, he would often take up the reigns himself. Kramer made no apologies for producing \"message films,\" and, though his transparent motives have the potential to age poorly, there's no doubt that he had the stature to approach controversial issues \u0096 such as racism {'The Defiant Ones (1958)'}, religion {'Inherit the Wind (1960)'} and the Holocaust \u0096 with confidence and dignity. 'Judgement at Nuremberg (1961)' wears its pretensions on its sleeve, a film so utterly convinced of its own importance that Kramer must surely have already known about the eleven Oscar nominations before he opened production. Fortunately, much of this self-importance is quite justified. The epic 186-minute courtroom drama tackles some of the fundamental issues in the aftermath of WWII, such as the accountability of higher citizens for the Holocaust and how patriotism has the ability to corrupt human morals. With a mighty cast of Hollywood stars, Kramer impartially dissects the Nuremberg trials, exposing tragedy and hypocrisy.Courtroom dramas have remained such audience favourites because they are a showcase for emotional outbursts and impassioned monologues. 'Judgement at Nuremberg,' in keeping with the tone of its subject matter, is largely gloomy and subdued, only occasionally reaching the thrilling highs of Sidney Lumet's '12 Angry Men (1957),' Robert Mulligan's 'To Kill a Mockingbird (1962)' or Kramer's own 'Inherit the Wind (1960).' Any speech by Maximilian Schell {who won the Oscar for Best Actor in a Leading Role, despite being billed fifth} keeps you fixated on the screen, and, likewise, Burt Lancaster's confession and Montgomery Clift's interrogation are must-see moments. The remainder of the film occasionally falls in stagnation, perhaps an inevitable consequence of its format and length, though the drama remains quite watchable, even if I wouldn't fancy a re-viewing until several years from now. The performances are impressive across the board, though Judy Garland, who somehow still retains the rosy cheeks of her childhood, seems terribly out-of-place in such a grim drama.When he isn't in court, American Chief Judge Dan Haywood (Spencer Tracy) experiences the post-war German lifestyle, as its defeated citizens attempt to reconstruct their shattered lives amid the humiliation of being branded \"evil\" by the rest of the world. Screenwriter Abby Mann has it both ways on this issue: on the one hand, he represents the ordinary German civilians as proud and resourceful people, who could never have known the true extent of Hitler's regime. However, Judge Haywood later lambasts this perception, asserting that this argument is merely a self-made delusion, and that their inaction \u0096 and, indeed, the inaction of the whole world \u0096 was just as contemptible as the acts of those who physically committed the atrocities of the Holocaust. In stating what he believes to be the truth, Haywood invokes the ire of the American government, and severs his close friendship with Mrs. Bertholt (Marlene Dietrich), whose husband was executed for his leadership of the German Army. The truth, it seems, was not something that most people wanted to hear, but Stanley Kramer said it, and we listened.",

            "content": "Judgment at Nuremberg is a standard court-case drama that focuses on the trial of four Nazi judges in Nuremberg following World War II. The importance of the trials from the Allied viewpoint remains contested throughout the film; most people are indicated to have little interest in it since the political and military figures have already been tried, while the actual people involved in this case strongly believe that justice must be achieved. On the other hand, the German people see this as the last chance to retain some dignity. As might be anticipated, Judgment at Nuremberg delves deep into the moral questions regarding the German citizens under the Third Reich.The acting is one of the most powerful aspects of the film. Spencer Tracy makes a sympathetic aged Chief Judge Haywood, who pursues the morally correct verdict by closely considering both sides. Richard Widmark is an admirable but shortsighted American colonel who carries out the prosecution. Burt Lancaster is Dr. Ernst Janning, an enigmatic Nazi judge on trial, who appears to be the only one that realizes the extent of the crimes. Judy Garland also deserves some praise in her role as a witness to the central case. The role that impressed me the most was Maximilian Schell as Hans Rolfe, a formidable and proud German defense attorney. He has such a commanding voice and vivid personality that makes him perfect for the role. A small role that pleasantly surprised me (being a Star Trek fan) was a young William Shatner as Capain Harrison Byers, Haywood's aide. You must admit, he fits right in!The plot is very interesting. There are several moments that will sway your opinion of what is right and wrong. The real message seems to be that we cannot know for certain what the proper verdict is, although the film hints that in the future we will be able to look back and decide. The ending was perfectly executed, and the last scene was somewhat of a surprise. The historical text at the end indicates the irony of the matter.The only significant flaws of the film were that it was a little overlong (even if I hate using that as a criticism) and didn't seem to have much to offer in terms of a second viewing (although I might be wrong). Occasionally it repeated ideas, but never to the point where it got repetitive.Overall, Judgment at Nuremberg appears to be one of the best American court-case dramas, right up there with 12 Angry Men. The themes it deals with are still relevant today. The point of the film is basic, even if it has some complicated consequences, but oftentimes people tend forget these things. If you are looking for some trial action or a loose historical film, then this should be near the top of your list.",

            "review_title": "An historical film of significance with strong performances, especially by Spencer Tracy",
            "content": "This film suffers from not being \"exciting\". That is not to say it is boring. It answers -- or perhaps raises -- questions about international law and morality that go far beyond the typical bounds of motion pictures. One of its particular strengths is that it includes powerful performances by a number of outstanding actors.Spencer Tracy is old and somewhat frail in this film. Yet, his acting is as strong as ever. Although the story line is much different, comparisons to his performance in \"Inherit The Wind\" are inevitable. It is Tracy, who received top billing, who holds the core of the movie together. His performance while he presents the findings of the tribunal is brilliant.I very much admire the very controlled performance here by Burt Lancaster. Lancaster has never been one of my personal favorites, although I do recognize him as a great actor. Perhaps it was that I didn't care for the films or roles he appeared in. But here, he is perfect in an understated performance that some say was influenced by the understated acting of Spencer Tracy. As strong as his soliloquy in the courtroom is, it is at the end of the film when the Judge (Tracy) visits him in prison that is the strongest, and brought me to tears. The look on Lancaster's face as Tracy dismisses his excuse is remarkable acting.Richard Widmark has one of the best performances of his career in this film. Regrettably, Widmark was sort of type-cast in many films because he was so good at playing the villain, or at least dark characters. Interestingly, two of my favorite performances by Widmark are in films where he played against type -- \"The Tunnel Of Love\" (a romantic comedy with Doris Day) and here, where he plays the prosecutor of the German judges. Widmark's role is so strong that there are times you can see the spittle fly from his mouth as he accuses the German judges of crimes against humanity.Other than this film, when I have seen Marlene Dietrich in other movies, I always thought, \"I just don't get it.\" I never could see the attraction. Here, however, I enjoy her performance and the way in which she interacts with Spencer Tracy.I am not quite sure what to make about the performance of Maximilian Schell. He won the Best Actor Academy Award for this performance, but I'm not sure I agree with that decision. Usually I'd be routing for Spencer Tracy, but I think the strongest performance in this film was that of Burt Lancaster. Schell was, in my view, sometimes over the top in this role...or is that what director Stanley Kramer wanted? As I sat watching one of his main soliloquies late in the movie, I thought how easily he could have played Hitler with his rants. If Tracy and Lancaster presented understated performances, Schell did quite the opposite.There is a particularly strong performance in one scene by actor John Wengraf, playing an ex-judge, and being questioned by the prosecutor. Interestingly, Wengraf fled to the West in 1933 -- an important year in this film -- just as the Nazis began their rise to power.Ray Teal is one of the judges, and he gives a very solid performance here that is usually overlooked. Perhaps he suffers from his association with television. It was about this time that he played the sheriff on \"Bonanza\" for many seasons. But in terms of cinema, this is one of his strongest performances.I am not particularly impressed by the performance here by Montgomery Clift. I'm not saying it's a bad performance, but I just don't see it as outstanding, as most critics do. I feel there was (and is) a lot of sympathy for Clift by this time in his life, and that that accounts for the reviews he gets in this film. Make no mistake, I think Clift was an excellent actor, and in the later moments of his brief work here he is quite good, but the early parts of his performance here seem rather static to me. I am also not impressed by Judy Garland's performance here. She looked right for the part at this point in her life -- a little fat and dumpy -- but I don't think she added much to the cast, other than name recognition. This was filmed around the time she was suffering greatly from hepatitis.The film is long -- over 3 hours, and because of its length and seriousness, I find it best viewed over a couple of nights. But this is a great film, and one of the few I award a \"9\" to. For serious moviegoers, well worth a place on your DVD shelf.",

            "content": "While I seem to never tire of the Holocaust as a subject...it's both grotesque and fascinating for me to read accounts (especially first hand) of the way in which humans treated other humans during this war...I am tired of Holocaust movies. Most of them are terribly slanted to make the enemy evil and the victims righteous. I take exception to films that make all Germans look bad. I have German relatives and friends from both sides of the war and their story is so much more complex than a single movie or book could ever portray. Like most middle class Americans, genocide is a difficult phenomenon for me to comprehend. It terrifies and upsets me but at the same time I am overwhelmingly compelled to find out why and how it actually happened(s.) I grew up in New York and have friends who's parents are camp survivors. Most of these people do not talk about the war. Nor do my relatives and friends who fought on the American side or my husband's relatives who were imprisoned or almost starved to death surviving against the grain of Hitler's regime. Also, I know from first hand experience most Germans do not talk about this war either. I think because it is so unbelievable painful that it's easier just to try to forget it. But of course, forgetting it is the very thing people should never do! I really hate the recent Holocaust denial sub-text going on around the world. It frightens me to think that people actually believe the extermination of millions of people never happened! And film is the perfect media to insure that genocide...be it Jews and Gypsies, Cambodian and Laotians, Tutsis in Rwanda, Serbs in Kosovo, and history's indigenous peoples every where...is never forgotten or tolerated. Therefore, I am recommending this movie with aplomb, as I think it was well made and has been sorely overlooked for too long.Born in 1952 , I was not alive when these events took place and it is my guess that this particular rendition of The Justice or \"Nazi Judges\" Trial Case No. 3 is only partially based on fact. Still, 'Judgment at Nuremberg' is really worthy of our attention. Like 'Schindler's List,' another good holocaust movie, it is filmed in black and white. This falsely gave me the impression it was made right after the war, when in fact, it was filmed in 1961. It is 3 hours long and maybe should have been edited but I am glad it was not. Although, it did drag... I liked the sequences in which an older Spencer Tracy (Chief Judge Dan Haywood) walks around the city (scene of the crime as it were) trying to 'assimilate' the era in an attempt to understand culpability. I also felt the documentary footage of actual camp and street violence while painfully inevitable...was highly educational. Especially for those of us who were not around when it all happened.There are so many note worthy actors in this movie! Made back in the days when studios tried to get as many big names in a movie as possible...you will be amazed at the talent. Oscar winning Maximillian Schell creates a magnificent achievement as the defense attorney for Dr. Ernst Janning played very subtly by Burt Landcaster. There are numerous other well know actors involved in this court room drama...Judy Garland and Montgomery Clift give somewhat deflated performances as witnesses for the prosecution...which is kind of ironic because both of their careers were also pretty flat by the time this movie was made. Judy looks drugged, which she probably was and Montgomery Clift actually got an Oscar nod for playing a crazed bug eyed idiot...which IMHO is not really acting on his part. Also, there is an incredible role with a straight Marlene Dietrich portraying a once prominent member of German nobility and a war widow,who tries to enlighten Spencer Tracy's character to the fact that not all Germans were monsters. I loved just having another chance to see her on screen. There's even a small but funny...in a hind sight kind of way...bit part in which a much younger and less arrogant William Shatner plays Judge Haywood's Aide. Like I said...what a cast!In the end of the movie as in the end of the war...it all comes down to culpability! Some of the worst Nazi offenders were never put on trial(The Fuhrer, Heinrich Himmler, Bormann, and Joseph Goebbels) which is felonious given the tremendous human suffering they instigated. But this movie is not about the big gun offenders...it's about the every day complacency of folks just doing their jobs...which was then and now the culprit for many a crime against humanity...not to mention full scale genocide.",

It's such a Weighty Subject and the Philosophical, Legal, and Hindsight Lens that is put on the Thing is Better Served in Lengthy Scholarly Books and Serious Intellectual Debate. Despite the Fine Acting by all the Seasoned Pros, the Writing and the Direction of this Film really does Nothing More than Confirm a Non-Conflicting Court of Public Opinion whose \"Verdict\" is not Likely to be Persuaded Otherwise.Just in Case there may be some Doubt, Parade out some Concentration Camp Atrocity Footage with Emaciated Bodies of Women and Children...Cased Closed. Now all Movie Goers and Home Theatre Watchers can feel Self-Righteous and Sleep Better. Ultimately the Film is a rather Mediocre, Middle-Class Stroking of a Self-Serving Public.",

            "content": "The great television dramas of the 1950's and 1960's lead to full-length movie versions, and one of the best was Abby Mann's \"Judgment at Nuremberg\", a re-creation of the infamous Nuremberg trials where Nazi war criminals were forced to re-live their great evils and face the judgment of the world. It is the late 1940's, and Germany is in chaos. Remainders of great arenas where Hitler once spoke to the masses to refrains of \"Seek Heil!\" echoing in his ears were now piles of rubble, destroyed by Ally bombers. American judge Spencer Tracy arrives in Nuremberg to lead the proceedings at the trials, and as the echoes of Alex North's brilliant score fills the viewers ears, he sees the sites of many of these gatherings which lead to Hitler's children becoming excited of following every evil order he planned with the help of the S.S. and other evil Nazi organizations.Defending the war criminals on trial is emotional attorney Maximillian Schell, giving the performance of his career for which he deservedly received an Academy Award. He had played this part on television and added even more detail in his characterization. What makes his performance so riveting is the fact that you don't hate him for the job he is doing, even if you hate the people he is trying to defend. One of them is a slightly over the top Burt Lancaster, complete with German accent, as a Nazi doctor accused of some heinous crimes. More subtle is Marlene Dietrich as a deceased German general's wife whom Tracy befriends, showing the human side of people involved on what was obviously the wrong side of the war.Supporting Oscar nominations went to Judy Garland and Montgomery Clift who both play victims of the Nazi atrocities. While some Hollywood press representatives considered these parts cameos, both actors really put some depth into making their characterizations stand out. Garland, plump and blowsy, shows that she really had what it took to move from musical diva to character performer, and her accent is totally believable. Clift, still emotionally wrecked after his scarring car accident, uses the sadness within himself to convey the inhumane treatment he went through under Nazi tortures.For a subject so glum and a film of extreme length, \"Judgment at Nuremberg\" never drags, and becomes more fascinating as the plot is developed. Perhaps it is because the subject matter still touches us to this day and we feel for each of the characters as they try to go on with their lives even after the horrendous experiences they went through. It is also a reminder to the world that we've been through this before, made the villains pay, and future villains will pay as well.",

I know that is a lofty sentence but I do feel All American Spencer Tracy was and still is the greatest of Actors. Inherit The Wind, Judgement at Nuremberg, It's A Mad Mad Mad Mad World and Guess Who's Coming To Dinner are the 4 films in the Kramer-Tracy partnership. Tracy died as a first billed star, and never reduced himself to \"cameos\"Judgement At Nuremberg is a brilliant film and stars Burt Lancaster, Richard Widmark, Montgomery Clift,Judy Garland and Marlene Dietrich. All give superb performances of this film recounting the Nazi terror and the trial of those who perpetrated this evil. Judy Garland was nominated but lost. Applause goes to Dietrich in particular for her bravery as a German -born woman who challenged the Nazi's. Above all is Spencer Tracy and his monumental acting at the end of the picture in particular is worthy of acclaim as one of the greatest sequences. It is legend that Tracy delivered his speech in one take to the resounding cheers of many at Universal where the film was shot who watched from the set and others who came over from their stages to watch the consummate actor in action.Max Schell won the Oscar for this superb work and thanked Spencer Tracy for his support. I would have voted the Oscar to Tracy.I highly recommend this movie.David Barra Los Angeles",

            "content": "Burt Lancaster is my favorite actor.Having said this,my thoughts and feelings on Lancaster playing the role of the aged German Jurist\"Ernst Janning\" are mixed.Clearly,Lancaster was not the best suited actor to portray the role of Janning.Lancaster,was i believe 47 years old when he made \"Judgement at Nuremberg\".Some may think he was to young. The character of Janning was probably 15 or 20 years older than that.However i believe that The age make up on Lancaster was at least fairly effective.In addition,The German accent that Lancaster employs is sometimes OK but mostly only fair.i have read that Larry Olivier was considered for the role of Janning.Perhaps Olivier,who was several years older than Lancaster and who later employed thick German and Jewish accents in films like \"Marathon Man\" and \"The Boys from Brazil\" would have been better in the role.I believe that Lancaster was cast in the role for the reason of star power,in fact \"Judgment at Nuremberg\" may have been one of the first or the first movie to have the so-called all star cast banner to it.Lancaster is just on several big name stars in this film.The all star cast movies were popular in the 1960s and the 1970s.Less than 2 years later, Lancaster would be cast in the \"The Leopard\",playing the role of an Italian Prince.He was cast because 20th century Fox,who was assisting in financing the film, wanted a big named actor for the lead role for box office draw.Once again, Olvier was considered for the role,but he was not considered box office draw by 20th century Fox-Lancaster was, so he got the role despite not even attempting to speak with an Italian accent.Most reviews of Lancaster in \"The Leopard\" were very good and in fact,he looks great in the movie.He is a towering physical figure of machismo and he emotes so well.I believe the same can be said of Lancaster in \"judgment at Nuremberg\".Lancaster's Janning is not a wimpy, small statued,chair bound, pencil pusher of a man.In Lancaster,Janning is a big,,powerful man,but also a man of great intellect.In the final scene between Lancaster and Spencer Tracy in Janning's cell,Lancaster towers over Tracy.During The lengthy speech by Janning towards the end of the film,Lancaster's intensity and passion is true, and if you want to see great acting without saying a word, watch Lancaster's facial expression when Spencer Tracy states his final words to Janning.I have great respect for Burt Lancaster as an actor because he attempted to stretch himself as an actor,he took risks by making unconventional films but also conventional films.In the end, his good films far out number his bad films and his good performances far outweigh his not so good ones.",

            "content": "JUDGMENT AT NUREMBERG is a tense and provocative courtroom drama, which on a powerful and realistic way shows the nature of a war crimes trial.Four German judges and prosecutors stand accused of crimes against humanity for their involvement in atrocities committed under the Nazi regime. A military court convened in Nuremberg. A prominent lawyer and scientist has condemned so many people to death. Residents of Germany have, at the moment become blind and deaf to the crimes of the Nazi regime. However, each individual has a different view of the war and killings in the war. Each of the warring forces carries a certain part of the blame...Simple questions give quite confusing answers. Moral and responsibility of important people are faced with interests of their state. Civil servants have to respect inhuman and immoral laws!? Then and now. Nothing's changed. However, some people still have to answer for war crimes.This movie is full of strange contrasts. The main judge is generally a very curious. German defense counsel is an emotional person, who is concerned about the fate of his own people. The prosecutor is a very sharp and theatrical. Witnesses (ordinary people) are scared of both sides. Two words have emerged between curiosity, accusation, defense and emotions - an interest and compromise. There is no room for justice and right in these words. That's the point in this movie.Mr. Kramer has mostly focused on a legal access and political philosophy. Characterization is very good. The horror on the faces of the protagonists is a very disturbing and compelling.Spencer Tracy as Chief Judge Dan Haywood is a curious old judge, who wants to reveal the truth. However, he has realized something else - political logic. Maximilian Schell is a quite convincing as defense counsel Hans Rolfe, but his intentions and his attacks on witnesses are somewhat destructive. Richard Widmark is unscrupulous and decisive as prosecutor Col. Tad Lawson. Policy has cut off his wings at the end.Marlene Dietrich as Frau Bertholt is a sad and sensitive woman. Her character is an interesting view of the German aristocracy after World War II. However, she was closely related to the war and her perspective is truly amazing.Montgomery Clift (Rudolph Peterson) and Judy Garland (Irene Hoffmann-Wallner) are real tragic characters in a malicious court game. They are victims in the true sense of the word.Burt Lancaster (Dr. Ernst Janning) is an unusual serious defendant. His face reflects sympathy with the victims of the war. He is the voice of reason that nobody wants to hear.All actors have offered, more or less, impressive performances.This story is sketchy. Wars are, unfortunately, part of our everyday life. Innocent people are dying trapped between interests and compromises. A trashy trial will not open our eyes.",

One of the most interesting things about it is that it doesn't concern itself with trials of the 'big boys' -- it instead concerns itself with what might be thought of as 'small fry' -- legal functionaries, carrying out the will of (nazi) government. These men might not be thought of as war criminals, and therein lies the brilliance -- this movie isn't about Nazis, it's about how easy it is to just 'go along', hide one's conscience, and cause massive evil. Its about how easily the machinery of civilization (specifically, its legal system) can turn from protecting to destroying parts of the citizenry, merely with some bits of paper to hide behind.Great performances by pretty much everybody (anybody could be great with words like these to say, but they're well acted anyhow) -- Mongomery Clift positively shines as a less- than-brilliant man who reminds us all that dignity isn't just for the best and the brightest. Max Schell does too as a man trying pretty much anything to avoid a guilty verdict he knows is all but inevitable. Widmark is relentless as the legal eagle prosecuting the case, and of course Spencer Tracy as the conscience is the gravitas of the whole thing.A long movie, certainly, but worth your time.And oh by the way, reviewers who try to fit this movie into their tiny-minded political of- the-day worldview should just leave off.

This is a film everyone should see, because it shed some light inside the twisted minds of the Nazis. The film is very relevant to the situation that America is currently in with the war in Iraq. We went to war because we thought that Saddam had WMD's, as Lancaster said in the movie, \"we didn't know, because we didn't want to know.\" Some people in the Bush administration knew that Saddam didn't have WMD's and they stood by in silence, because they thought they were doing this for the \"good of the country.\" Sounds familiar huh?",

            "content": "An exploding swastika over Nuremberg's Palace of Justice heralds the start of this blistering true-life courtroom drama, adapted from a television play and filmed in the Bavarian city itself - as uncomfortably evidenced by the ruins beyond the court steps.By 1948, Hitler and his chief cronies were history - by their own hands or those of the Allies. No less important a trial than those that condemned Goering et al in 1946, this one concerned America's \"judging of the judges\" - four facilitators of Nazi rule - to ask: were these bureaucrats any more or any less accountable? Or were they, in that clapped out-excuse, \"only following orders\"? It's clear Chief Judge Dan Haywood (Tracy) has an awesome task on his hands.A former provincial district attorney, we learn Hayward has been \"retired forcibly by the electorate\" and, in accepting his unenviable role, been handed something of a poisoned chalice. \"Now we're down to the business of judging the doctors, businessmen and judges\" he tells his aide (a youthful William Shatner). \"Some people think they shouldn't be judged at all.\" Tracy imbues Hayward with great integrity and searching intellect behind his Southern hick, self-effacing persona, along with a weary demeanour, as if he carries the entire weight of history on his back. Confidants are found in unlikely places - Madame Bertholt (a poignant Dietrich), the proud widow of an executed Nazi general, whose house he has borrowed for the trial's duration, lends him unlikely succour.\"I wish you understood German\" she says at one point, translating Lili Marlene for him. \"The words are very beautiful. Very sad. Much sadder than the English ones. The German soldier knows he's going to lose his girl and his life. 'The lantern burns every night, it knows your steps and the way you walk. It burns every night, but I've been long forgotten. Should harm come to me, who will stand with you? Under the lantern, with you, Lili Marlene?\" She also insists all the while that the German public knew nothing about the Final Solution. \"As far as I can make out, no one in this country knows,\" Haywood counters, with barely-concealed disgust.Foremost among the wretched judges on trial is Dr Ernst Janning (Lancaster), whose face, at first an impassive blank, becomes a tragic mask as his self-justification finally crumbles away. Richard Widmark plays presiding zealot Colonel Tad Lawson, the Prosecuting Attorney obsessed with extinguishing every last ember of the Third Reich, but whose finest scenes are actually those outside the courtroom. He certainly makes a convincing drunk. \"There are no Nazis in Germany\" he rails at one point. \"The Eskimos invaded Germany and took over, that's how all these terrible things happened. It wasn't the fault of the Germans - it was those damned Eskimos!\" A pair of real-life Hollywood casualties, Judy Garland and Montgomery Clift respectively, also turn in memorable cameos as prosecution witnesses, despite being ravaged by drink and drugs by the time of filming (Clift ruined take after take by forgetting his lines). Despite his chronic alcoholism, Clift hits the right notes here, with his pitiful portrayal of a mentally-subnormal Communist sympathiser, sterilised by the Nazis as part of their eugenics policy.But it's Schell as Leading Defence Attorney Hans Rolfe, who produces the greatest performance here, and one for which he deservedly won his Best Actor Oscar over fellow nominees Tracy and Clift. Loathed by Janning yet desperate to protect his clients at all costs - and Germany even more so - Rolfe's hypnotic and blistering rhetoric neatly articulates the world's complicity in Hitler's ascendancy.",

This film does a fine job pointing out both sides of the argument. On one side, you have people who may be guilty of atrocities because of what they did not do but could have. And on the other side, you have the argument that it is not a crime to follow orders.Indeed, the real question is why were the Germans on trial with the answer being they lost the war. One defendant says that next the Soviets will judge America. Of course, this did not happen, but could have. Was the atomic bomb justified? Was it legal? Is it legal to have a trial where the laws are written after the crimes are committed? These are big, important questions and the film tackles them excellently.",

            "content": "Historical drama. I never thought that one day I myself would want to watch this three-hour court drama, where there is practically nothing but dialogues, but it happened. In general, pictures in the genre of \"court drama\" were very popular in the West in the second half of the twentieth century, and before this picture I saw several of them - and they did not really impress me, but not this picture. All three hours I watched as if I was under hypnosis, unable to take my eyes off the screen. Looked - and now I'm ready to beat myself with sticks for not having appreciated this masterpiece earlier, which has earned several Oscars, deservedly belongs to the classics of world cinema, and has a cult status both in the West and in our country. And here's my brief opinion - Judges judge judges. I want to say right away that I did not find any shortcomings in this picture, but I have a small comment, which I will express in a separate paragraph, but for now, let your humble servant focus your attention on the expressive merits of this masterpiece directed by Stanley Kramer.\nSo, here they are:\n1. The story told - the script of the picture is based on the so-called \"Little Nuremberg\" - a trial in the American occupation zone in post-war Germany, where judges appeared in the dock, who enforced the monstrous laws and policies of the Third Reich and Adolf Hitler personally. Of course, the real names were changed, because this is an art picture. For three hours we have to watch a loud trial, where all the horrors and atrocities of Nazism will appear before us, the duel between the chief prosecutor - the American colonel and the defense lawyer - who has no less weighty arguments, and the judge - an ordinary provincial who arrived in Nuremberg in order to deliver an honest and just judgment. Each of the heroes presented in the picture (both primary and secondary) are bright and interesting personalities, for one can see competent and high-quality script work. Even if the hero has only a few lines, you can still see his essence, no matter how hard he tries to hide it.\n2. Nazism - or fascism, whichever pleases more (I am used to calling fascism). This picture is very detailed about this phenomenon, its causes and consequences. Both sides of this ideology are shown. After all, for example, in the Soviet film \"Ordinary Fascism\" director Mikhail Romm considered only one side, while Stanley Kramer described and showed it in full. Who is to blame for the establishment of fascism? Who brought Hitler to power? Is it true that the German people knew nothing about the mass extermination of people? Of course, the German people are to blame for fascism (to one degree or another), and of course the Germans knew about the monstrous atrocities. But we never learned anything, which is why Hitler and other leaders of the Reich have long been dead - and their ideas are alive, and will live on until we understand what this phenomenon is - fascism, and why he won in Germany. Only after learning this lesson of history, society is able to develop a strong antidote to this, because we are waiting for a repetition of this nightmare (even in Russia, which is especially offensive).\n3. Politics - during the trial, the Cold War and the first Berlin crisis have already begun, which can greatly influence the court's decision, and this is bad when the political situation prevents the establishment of the truth and the passing of a fair verdict. The atmosphere of those years is perfectly conveyed, you can't even argue here. And how difficult it is at this moment for people who want justice, and nothing more. Post-war Germany, all in ruins, the aspirations of the German people, foreign soldiers in their native land, hope for the mercy of the victors - all this is also present.\n4. Music - a lot of German songs from the Second World War, some of which I know. They fit perfectly into the atmosphere and perfectly dilute the tension in the courtroom.\n5. Timing - the picture runs for three hours, but it looks in one breath, and this is a judicial drama, where the basis is dialogues and a competition between the prosecutor and the defender. This is what a great script means that doesn't let the viewer get bored. Learn, modern screenwriters!\n6. Final - I confess to you that I was looking forward to the final of this trial, because I found reasonable arguments from each of the parties, and politics also put a lot of pressure on the judge, but he delivered the only possible sentence in this situation, although I was strongly disagree. I have no right to describe it, so as not to spoil the viewing for those who have not yet had time to get acquainted with this picture, but I will say only one phrase that accurately describes both the final and the whole picture \"We have not learned anything!\"\n7. Thoughts - the picture makes you think, reflect, ask yourself questions. Not only about fascism, but about human existence, society, state, politics. This sounds especially relevant, given that a year after the release of the picture, the Caribbean crisis happened - which almost led to a nuclear war between the USSR and the United States, which would be the end for humanity. And only at the last minute was it possible to save the world and millions of lives from this threat. The United States is shown honestly, with its laws and the atomic bombings of Japan. This movie makes you think, and not just catch delight from explosions, like most modern films.\nComment. The fact is that in one of the scenes the Munich Agreement was not mentioned, which gave Germany the Sudetenland of Czechoslovakia (without the participation of the latter). It was signed by Germany (Adolf Hitler), Italy (Benitto Mussolini), France (Daladier) and Great Britain (Chamberlain), this is for reference. This is a small addition, and nothing more.\nA little about the main characters:\n1. Dan Heywood, played by Spencer Tracy, is a former district court judge who arrived in Nuremberg to pronounce an honest and fair verdict on the German judges. An elderly gentleman, keenly interested in this process and all its materials, for the sake of which he studies Nuremberg and its inhabitants. Spencer splendidly played the role of the venerable judge, for whom truth and justice are above politics and momentary goods. Bravo!\n2. Colonel Ted Lawson, played by Richard Widmark, is a US Army officer, a prosecutor who wants the defendants to be punished for their heinous crimes. Harsh, honestly, he is driven by exceptionally high motives, despite the tense political situation. Richard played this role equally convincingly and superbly. Bravo!\n3. Ernst Young, played by Bert Lancaster, is a Juris Doctor and one of the defendants in this trial, who is kept separate from the rest. His fiery speech was so strong and convincing that one wonders. I even developed respect for him, because he showed himself as a real person who realizes his sins. Bert perfectly portrayed this image on the screen. Bravo!\nI would like to mention Maximillian Schell as the lawyer of Hans Rolf and the famous beauty with a cold look Marlene Dietrich as the widow of the executed general.\nThe picture has earned its place in the history of cinematography, and what a pity that mankind has not learned anything! Despite my tiny remark, I can only give the picture the highest rating.\nAs a result, we have an excellent historical drama about the trial of fascist judges, with an excellent script, excellent music and atmosphere, analysis of the phenomenon of \"fascism\" and great acting work.",

            "content": "Judgment at Nuremberg (JAN) is an award winning teleplay by Abby Mann that was originally directed for TV by George Roy Hill. It was first presented to the public during the Golden Age Of Television in a live 1959 Playhouse 90 broadcast. Two years later, it was produced and directed by Stanley Kramer as a major Hollywood motion picture that eventually has achieved something approaching classic status. JAN continues to interest us, provoke us to serious thought and discussion, and motivate us to question the meaning of responsible behavior during a time of national crisis. The fact that we can still be drawn into its challenging issues after over 60 years of exposure is certainly a testament to the relevance of Mann's vision about a very difficult and distant chapter of post-WWII history.The Playhouse 90 presentation was brilliant, provocative and thoroughly entertaining. It featured a spectacular cast, and is all the more remarkable when we realize that the telecast was a live event actually happening while we were watching it. When the play was later produced as a movie, Mann took his story and expanded (some believe overexpanded) it to include other plot elements that had not been considered in the television version. Three of the actors from the Playhouse 90 production were allowed to recreate their original roles for the movie---Maximilian Schell (who was lead defense counsel Oscar Rolfe in the TV play, and then renamed Hans Rolfe in the movie version), Werner Klemperer (Nazi prosecutor Emil Hahn) and Torren Mayer (Nazi judicial official Werner Lammpe on TV and Werner Lampe in the film). Schell won the Best Actor Oscar for 1961 because of his remarkable supercharged performance----beating out (among others) Spencer Tracy who was also nominated for his own lead role in JAN.Because the Playhouse 90 episode only consumed 90 minutes (including commercial broadcast messages) while the film ran 190 minutes and was therefore over twice as long, it is difficult to compare the performances of the three different principal roles common to both presentations. With that caveat in mind, here is one person's view of the matter:Chief Judge Dan Haywood (Claude Rains In the Playhouse 90 version v. Spencer Tracy in the film)---Rains and Tracy were two of the most gifted actors in cinema history. Rains's career was marked by the ironic underachievement of having received four Oscar Supporting Actor nominations without a win, while Tracy was a multiple Oscar Best Actor winner. Both are justly considered to be master acting craftsmen of the highest order. Rains played Judge Haywood as a solemn, dignified, principled man with a serious moral compass. It was a subtle, controlled and understated performance. Tracy seems to have borrowed much of the Rains' approach to the part in the way he also brought it to life. Because Rains was first, he should get the nod.Minister of Justice Ernst Janning (Paul Lukas in the Playhouse 90 version v. Burt Lancaster in the film)--Lukas was a veteran romantic/character actor with numerous film credits. Lancaster created many different memorable roles during his long career. Both were previous Best Actor Oscar winners. However, Lukas delivered the better and more nuanced performance. Lancaster seemed stiff and ill at ease in trying to project a good man caught up in evil activities that he personally disapproved of but nonetheless supported. Lukas seemed to show us more clearly the pain and suffering such a man had to go through to face the dawn of each new day.Chief Trial Prosecutor (General Parker-Melvyn Douglas in the Playhouse 90 version v. Colonel Ted Lawson-Richard Widmark In the film). Douglas enjoyed a long and varied Oscar-winning acting career extending from sophisticated gigalos and screwball comedians to distinguished public servants and interesting senior citizens. Widmark was a workmanlike performer, but his range as an actor was more limited---although he did develop a unique capacity to convincingly play giggling psycopaths. Douglas seemed to invest the part of the Prosecutor in JAN with more substance and a greater sense of controlled outrage than Widmark did.As for Schell, his defense attorney in both versions of JAN was the quintessential breakout role---one that began his long trip to celebrity and stardom.",

            "content": "The movie actually is so rich with contents that tackle mainly the human nature and how we all tend to judge each others while we have crimes of our own that are no less inhumane than of those whom we are judging.I like most the scene when the lawyer (Maximilian Shell) says that Americans were not less brutal and merciless than the Nazi's when they bombed atomically Hiroshima and Nagasaki during the world war II in 1945. In the movie, there was a focus on the issue of applying such cruel measures against humanity under the excuse of \"it was our duty and we had no other choice\". This is exactly what Margaret Thatcher said in her book \"The Path to Power\". She said: \"We don't regret bombing Japan and if we go back again in time we would do the same thing all over again\". Just look at the wars of today, so many crimes in the name of duty are being committed but there is no judgment anymore! Anyway, another scene which I liked so much in the movie is when Maximillian Shell the lawyer is talking to the witness Judy Garland and he shouts to her face in a psychological way and forces her to crack down, cry and confess something which was not true! Psychologically speaking, this is very true and needs certain skills to be done.The movie is just amazing and there is no single second in the movie that gets you to be bored. It's long but too entertaining with so many great actors Tracy the judge, Lancaster the lead character among the Nazis being judged, Marline Dietrich, Richard Widmark, and Montgomery Clift.",

The acting is most intriguing, Spencer Tracy delivers a very fine performance while Burt Lancaster enhances his character with both disgust and empathy from the viewers. But the most astounding performance in this film is given by Richard Widmark who profoundly enchants the viewers and actually is able to persuade them, at least to a point, and creates a cloud of doubt amidst the thought provoking premise of the film. The story of the film elopes with a distorted ethical and moral thought provoking atmosphere that leaves the viewers in total awe. It brings out questions of morality and surpasses boundaries that even the most disturbed people find repulsive. It is simply one of the best courtroom dramas. The cinematography is simple yet sophisticated. Most of the film takes place in a courtroom but there are scenes that add to the elegance of this films such as scenes around post-war Germany. The film also shows us original footage in concentration camps during the war that inclines the viewer to explode emotionally either with disgust or pure horror. The final lines in the film truly change every perspective of human morality that might have been conceived by the viewers. To summarize, Judgment at Nuremberg is a thought provoking courtroom drama with moral and ethical questions that pushes the viewers understanding of humanity to the limits. It is comprised by beautiful acting, great directing and fine cinematography. The film ends with a moral message that many interpret differently. As such and with nothing further to add this film deserves a 10/10.",

            "content": "It took me a long time to get around to seeing this multi-Oscar nominated film from 1961, but man am I glad I finally did.Since Stanley Kramer produced and directed, I expected an earnest social message movie with its heart in the right place but its foot planted squarely in old-fashioned Hollywood. I was not expecting something as nuanced, complex, and thoughtful as this movie, one that examines the Nazi atrocities from all sides and finds blame to lay on everyone's doorstep. No one is let off the hook in this movie, and it clearly makes the point that collective humanity lets things like the Holocaust happen, not one-off aberrations of it.Spencer Tracy is a total boss as the judge who must decide the fate of five men accused of war crimes, themselves judges. He plays the role as only Tracy can, without a hint of self-congratulatory liberal back patting. Instead, he plays it with the world weary air of a man who would rather be doing anything else but recognizes the weight of the responsibility he must carry. Maximilian Schell is blistering as the defense attorney, and Richard Widmark is equally good as the prosecution. Montgomery Clift is on screen for about 17 minutes, but hoo boy what a 17 minutes those are. And Judy Garland also gets a couple of brief scenes and makes a memorable impression. I can't remember the last three hour movie I watched that flew by as quickly as this one did.I didn't enjoy the subplot involving Marlene Dietrich's flirtation with Spencer Tracy as much, though it did provide a glimpse into the psyche of post-WWII Germans and explain how they were able to shuffle Nazism and the Holocaust into the closet and get on with their lives. And Burt Lancaster feels miscast as one of the German defendants, and his is the only monologue in the film that teeters over into melodrama.But in all respects this is a powerful, devastating film, and it made me nostalgic for a time when Hollywood could produce these kinds of movies.Schell received the Best Actor Oscar for his performance, surprising not because he wasn't worthy, but because I would have expected the Academy to recognize Tracy's good guy over the bad guy if they were going to go for either. Tracy received his eighth Best Actor nomination. He would be nominated one more time, posthumously in 1967 for Kramer's \"Guess Who's Coming to Dinner.\"Abby Mann won the Best Adapted Screenplay Oscar, a no brainer. The film was nominated for a whopping 11 Oscars total, picking up nods (in addition to those already mentioned) for Best Picture (lost to \"West Side Story\" -- what a choice!), Best Director, Best Supporting Actor (Clift -- oof, that scene!), Best Supporting Actress (Garland), Best B&W Art Direction, Best B&W Cinematography, Best B&W Costume Design (nominee Jean Louis was credited with Dietrich's gowns, so I think this Oscar nomination was expressly for Dietrich's wardrobe), and Best Film Editing.Grade: A+",

Spencer Tracy as lead Judge Dan Haywood presides over the trial of four judges who have been charged with war crimes as they implemented the laws of the Nazi regime. These include enforcing laws of racial purity and sterilising undesirables such as the feeble minded.Burt Lancaster plays a renowned jurist Ernst Janning whose activities baffle Dan Haywood as his work on the law is so well respected.In the background of rising tensions between the Americans and the Russians with the developing Cold War, there is a ferocious courtroom battle between prosecuting attorney, Colonel Lawson (Richard Widmark) and Hans Rolfe (Maximilian Schell) who relentlessly badger the witnesses.Lawson who liberated one of the concentration camps holds the entire nation responsible for the atrocities, yet his own actions at the courtroom are cynical. Rolfe is more pragmatic about any other nation trying to claim a moral high ground. As he tells Janning, the Americans dropped a nuclear bomb in Hiroshima that killed countless women and children.Judge Haywood tries to understand himself about the German people during the war, he mingles with locals and gets to know a widow, Frau Bertholt played by Marlene Dietrich. Her own husband was executed by the Nuremberg trials but she insists that many Germans had no idea about the holocaust. However Haywood is troubled about the Nazi atrocities, those who were enablers and other who turned a blind eye to it.Director Stanley Kramer keeps this long film enthralling, some of the court cases are vignettes allowing actors such as Montgomery Cliff and Judy Garland to give short memorable performances.Maximilian Schell gets the more emotional role as the defence lawyer and at times he gets to chew the scenery but he also won a best actor Oscar. Burt Lancaster is more restrained as Janning, he hardly speaks for most of the film but his face is solemn and stern. A man who has realised he did wrong by condemning some of his own people to death and now has to pay the price for just following orders.",

Chief Judge Dan Haywood (Spencer Tracy) has just arrived at Nuremberg to preside over a trial against various defendants including former Minister of Justice Dr. Ernst Janning (Burt Lancaster) who was a well respected jurist before the Nazis. The big names are all gone. It's not a much sought after job to judge the lesser known names. He's staying at a house owned by Mrs. Bertholt (Marlene Dietrich). The prosecutor for the case is Col. Tad Lawson (Richard Widmark). The defense is led by Hans Rolfe (Maximilian Schell).This is an important movie of historical value. At a running time of over 3 hours, its rather slow prodding pace takes away much of the drama. The acting from the leads are superb. I give this movie an extra point for a realistic slice of history.

It was a display of integrity that we have witnessed very rarely in history. I had the privilege of seeing her a dozen years later in concert in London.

            "review_title": "The Bright Line of Guilt, Blurred",
            "content": "In spite of the outstanding cast, their captivating performances, and the expert direction of Stanley Kramer, this film is very disturbing for many different reasons. I sat down and listed at least a few of the reasons. 1. It reveals the indisputable fact that so many high level officials in the Third Reich eventually were allowed to enjoy the carefree lives of retirement from which their millions of victims were deprived by the most cruel and inhumane means imaginable. In fact, how many of these high level Third Reich officials were even tried in the first place? We should not expect any true sense of justice in our world, which is very unsettling by itself.2. Defense Attorney Hans Rolfe, played forcefully by Maximillian Schell in an Oscar winning role, is correct. The guilt for the genocide that occurred in Europe during World War II extends far beyond Germany alone. The human race itself is guilty not only for directly committing unspeakable acts of cruelty against itself but for allowing others to exercise such brutality when it was clearly known by so many all over the world at the time. The situation exists today while hundreds of thousands of people, including many innocent civilians, are dying in the Syrian civil war, for example, while certain so-called \"leaders\" of the world not only refuse to stop it but consciously support and promote its barbarity. We're not talking about the distant past in this case. It's happening today.3. As the established laws of the Third Reich were in themselves cruel and inhumane, how much should we expect from the average person in any official position when the prevailing law of the land is intrinsically evil as well as enormously powerful? When I look around me today, how many respectable Americans in the place of Ernst Janning, played brilliantly by Burt Lancaster as a renown legal scholar of his time, would actively resist such a formidable system of malevolence? Who among us would be strong enough to fight such an overwhelming, sinister establishment without fear of dire and deadly consequences? Ernst Janning surely did not resist the Third Reich as he willingly and knowingly carried out its despicable laws.4. In spite of the huge sacrifices of so many Americans on and off the battlefield of World War II, many Americans also believed, as Judge Curtiss Ives (Ray Teal) did, that these high German officials, in this case very influential judges, were \"merely\" applying the prevailing laws of their government as they were supposed to do, regardless of how nefarious those laws were, and therefore should not be punished at all. Chief Judge Dan Haywood, the no-nonsense and often very blunt Mainer, played very sagaciously by Spencer Tracy, reminded Ives that mere logic and the professional duty to enforce evil laws did not overrule the need to do what is right before an even higher authority or to one's own conscience. Unfortunately Ives, who obviously resented the inconvenience of his appointment to the tribunal from the very start, totally rejected Haywood's prudent observations. Was he even listening to Haywood? If Teal, the actor, was supposed to annoy me to such an extreme, he certainly succeeded.5. The war caused immense physical and psychological suffering, not only to the brutalized victims of the Third Reich but to the German people themselves. If they had starved and deteriorated as a society to such an extent following the first world war, wasn't there another path to their recovery than the one that they had consciously chosen as a nation?The fact that Nuremberg was the site of huge, enthusiastic rallies led by Adolph Hitler never escaped the mind of the director, Stanley Kramer, and he very effectively reminded the viewer of this irony. Kramer also emphasized that Schell's and Lancaster's speeches were the most important in the courtroom by dramatically zooming in and out of them. Under the circumstances, I wonder if this technique was even necessary.Aside from the first-rate performances of Schell, Lancaster, and Tracy, I was especially impressed by Marlene Dietrich's portrayal of Mrs. Bertholt, the refined widow of an executed German officer. To me, Mrs. Bertholt, of noble stock, effectively symbolized a shattered, post-World War II Germany in more ways than one. As she sat in the frozen silence of the last scene, what could have been passing through her embittered mind as the phone continued to ring unanswered? Although Mrs. Berthold felt an unbearable, personal sense of injustice as a result of the war, did she even begin to understand her own responsibility as an upstanding German citizen while atrocities on a mass scale were being committed in her name and from every direction around her? Did she not know or did she choose not to know about them? For Ms. Dietrich, who actively opposed the politics of the Third Reich but never abandoned a deep love for her native country and culture, this was a very important and emotional moment in her career. I could feel her quiet intensity, veiled in social correctness, throughout her performance.Not all great movies have happy endings with clear resolutions. This movie, truly a great one, may not have had even one genuinely happy moment within it, but it must be seen by all who seek to understand the circumstances behind one of the most traumatic periods in human history. If there are no clear answers, we still need to ask the many, necessary questions. If we don't ask them, we risk repeating the mistakes and the horrors of the past.",

            "content": "I'm very wary of films with a three hour runtime, they often wind up boring and bloated. This film manages to captivate me each time I watch it for the full three hours, and it has a deceptively strong, simple premise to thank for it.I can make no better recommendation than to simply describe one of many impactful scenes that demonstrate how this film uses its premise to masterfully create scenes which demonstrate its points and arguments with no shred of doubt about what is meant or why.There is one of four defendants who was a state prosecutor for the Nazis during the war. He and the three other defendants sit around a prison cafeteria table after having been shown video proof of Nazi atrocities taken during the liberation of a concentration camp. One expresses that he believes it was not his fault what his countrymen did, while this defendant states he simply could not believe such atrocities could ever happen, him having been far removed from the camps in his courtroom of employ. He turns to a prisoner at a table behind him, the old commandant of a concentration camp, and asks if it was possible to kill that many people. The man turns and with an emotionless, bored tone, states factually that with two gas chambers housing thousands of people each and each gassing cycle taking only half an hour, it's not the killing that's troublesome, it's disposing of the bodies.It's incredible how this and so many other scenes take the time and place of the film, and the lived experiences of its characters, to create a tapestry of events recent, extremely recent, present, events which happened near, and far, that paint a portrait of morality grey and troubling.It is not the Nazis that are troubling, their atrocities are well known, and the film spends its time showing the lesser known evils that allowed the greater evils to happen. It speaks of Churchill lauding Hitler in 1938, of people unwilling to see obvious threat for what it was, of the evils of the Reich existing in broad daylight stateside, behind the very walls of the arsenal of democracy. It speaks of a willingness to ignore justice for practicality during the cold war, and a common hatred of communists that binds the US and fascist Germany on a level deep enough to be used as a viable legal defense. The film speaks of mercy, the honeyed words of forgiving and forgetting so that all may go on to make something of their flawed lives, and it couples this with the fear of being just as bad as the Nazis in sentencing the defeated of war to death for political points. It raises all of these valid arguments, gives them fair due, makes them all compelling, as said from attorneys at law, judges of the tribunal, widows of the executed; It takes all of these arguments and yet proudly and confidently chooses what is right, and makes the proper arguments for why the film believes what is right is right in this case. This is what makes it worthwhile, the depth that makes this film something to be studied while watched.",

            "content": "This three hour epic film masterpiece, directed by the great Stanley Kramer, won a best screenplay Oscar in 1962 for writer Abby Mann. Young Maximilian Schell won a best actor Oscar for his portrayal of German defense attorney Hans Rolfe who uses logic in a cunning way to argue that if his client(s) were guilty, it was the guilt of the whole world. No more, no less. Marlon Brandon had wanted this role, but Schell did such a stellar job in the play, the producers went with him.The story is a fictionalized version of the Judges' Trial of 1947, one of the U. S. Nuremberg Military Tribunals focused on the non-combatant war crimes of four Nazi judges. During their regime, the Nazis stripped objective judges and appointed judges based on party loyalties.We see the trial and hear the testimony through the steady, compassionate eyes of Judge Dan Haywood, (Spencer Tracy), a circuit court judge recently defeated for reelection in Maine.Both Tracy and Burt Lancaster as Dr. Ernst Janning, a remorseful German judge and law scholar, (based on Franz Schlegelberger), are masters of showing depth in what might otherwise look like an impassive gaze. Both actors deliver highly impactful monologues too.The story is set during the Berlin Blockade. Judge Haywood is pressured by many, including but not limited to Colonel Tad Lawson, chief prosecutor, (played by Richard Widmark), to weigh considerations of justice versus that of world safety. He is told to let the German defendants off lightly in order to gain German support in the Cold War against the Soviet Union.During one of Tracy's monologues he says, \"this trial has shown that under a national crisis, ordinary, even able and extraordinary men can delude themselves into the commission of crimes, so vast and heinous that they beggar the imagination.\"Haywood uses his time off to tour Nuremberg, stopping at a pulpit where Hitler used to give speeches. He befriends Mrs. Bertholt, the widow of a Nazi commander, played by Marlene Dietrich, who shows him around. Dietrich, who had been an outspoken supporter of the American war effort, was repulsed when she uttered her character's claims that German civilians did not know of the atrocities the Nazis committed.Making the most of their short time on screen, persecution witnesses Montgomery Clift, (as Rudolph Peterson, a supposedly feeble-minded man, sterilized for his political affiliation), and Judy Garland, (as Irene Hoffman, a teen that was friendly with her Jewish landlord, Fedlenstein, who was just a platonic, supportive, family friend), knocked out raw performances that moved me to tears.Clift was a mess at the time of filming. He was drinking, forgetful, and had an odd cropped haircut. Director Stanley Kramer thought it worked for the character. The desperation in his eyes is gripping. At one point Peterson holds up a photo of his hardworking mother and demands that Hayward tell him is she is feeble-minded. Hare - farmer - field. Sigh. The whole scene - the whole film - is brilliant.Eugenics is based on hatred, ignorance, and lies. Sadly, these beliefs haven't died out. Herr Rolfe was correct in his logical contention that those in other countries are also guilty. This idea of eugenic cleansing was created in the United States and gained steam in California, a state that in recent times allowed doctors to sterilize poor women and women of color in prisons against need or consent.The Fedlenstein case in the film is based on the Katzenberger case in actuality. Fedlenstein was charged with race mixing and he and Irene were used as examples for National Socialism. This was the first film in the sixteen years since the end of WW2 to deal with issues of responsibility for the war atrocities. By 1961, none of the 99 that were convicted in the American War Tribunals were still in jail.Judgment at Nuremberg is an essential must-see classic. 10/10. It is a powerful script and perhaps the best ensemble cast I've seen onscreen. There were other movie stars that strongly delivered their parts that I didn't mention here. The last scene between Judge Hayward and Ernst Janning is staggering. I saw the film as a child. It was a good call to rewatch it now.Warning: there is real footage of piles of skeletal corpses being shoveled into the ground. The footage is both harrowing and effective.",

However, in the end it presents an incredibly rhetorical and propagandist perspective on these trials. For instance: there is a serious legal question as to the authority by which the US puts the Nazis on trial. Of course. what the defendants did was horrific, and they ought to have been held accountable for it, but was it illegal? By what law? By whose law? Shouldn't there be a distinction between acting against a Nazi law and acting against a moral law? Aren't we really looking at a sort of self-righteous 'victor's justice'? Shouldn't these questions be settled politically or by force, rather than with a veneer of pseudo-legalisms?At the beginning of the movie, it seems sensitive to this question. The prosecutor seems over-zealous. The defense lawyer seems earnest. By the end, any opponent of the procedure of the trial (like the dissenting judge) is racist Nazi or an equivalently immoral patriotic American. Any subtle thought that, for instance, there is something funny about holding someone responsible for enforcing the laws of their own country is assimilated to racism and Nazism. To add insult to injury, the movie can't even bear to have a heroic German figure. Janning, who gives the crucial testimony in the case, ends up trying to excuse himself in the end--in a way entirely inconsistent with his earlier speech and everything we know about his character.Don't be taken in by this movie. It doesn't want you to think. It wants to bully you, with all the heavy-handed tricks a movie-maker has, into thinking that all patriots are Nazis and that legal niceties can be run roughshod over if some pure vision of morality demands it. It's really too bad, because the moral and legal issues connected with the trials are very serious and very relevant today.",

            "content": "There have been many, many court room films made since 1961, and each have made advances in pacing and tension.  This is perhaps why \"Judgment at Nuremberg\"--though a good movie--feels achingly slow at times.  It reminded me of the type of thing you'd see in an intro to law or ethics class as an undergraduate.  The aged instructor would see it as a meaty source for generating class discussion, and the room of teenagers would find it duller than dirt.What I liked about the movie, what I found to be its strength was it's attitude of fair play.  Everyone in the film is allowed to gain sympathy from the audience because their motivations are given.  Colonel Lawson is only self-righteous because he has witnessed first hand the horrors of the concentration camps.  Hans Rolfe is ashamed of himself and of his countrymen for what was done during the war but trudges ahead with his defense of the judges because he hopes to give Germany some sense of dignity through the trial.  And Ernst Janning did what he did during the war because he hoped to make a difference from within the system rather than resigning from it in protest.  This easily could have been a film in which the triumphant Americans put the smug and arrogant Nazis in their place (maybe if it had been made ten or 15 years before it would have been), but instead it concentrates on very grey issues and the people behind them.",

            "review_title": "A definitive, if ponderous, courtroom drama",
            "content": "This dour and lengthy (3 hours) courtroom drama deals with the tail end of the Nuremberg trials of 1946-48, when many of the Nazi leaders were tried for their part in the totalitarian nightmare which engulfed Germany between 1933 and 1945. By 1948 the chief villains had been dealt with and the Tribunal had moved on to the supporting players, in this case four of the judges who had worked for the Nazi state. The particular trial, based on an earlier TV film also written by Abby Mann, is fictional, but founded on fact. A very high quality cast keeps the viewer engaged. How was it that many high officials, let alone ordinary Germans, did not admit to knowing the true horror of the \"final solution\"? How was it possible that eminent lawyers would co-operate with the Nazi regime despite their distaste for it? How could their conduct be defended, let alone be excused?As Hans Rolfe, the youthful defence counsel for the most prominent judge, Ernst Janning (a noble-looking but rather wooden Burt Lancaster), Maximilian Schell gives the Tribunal of three American judges plenty of histrionics. It is evident that Germany, and not just the judges is on trial. But the scriptwriter does not allow the defendants off the hook. One, played by Werner Klemperer, is unrepentant, another is befuddled. Only Ernst Janning puts up any kind of defence, to the effect that he thought he could ameliorate things by playing along with the Nazis. This did not stop him from ordering sterilization of mental defectives and the execution of an old Jewish man for allegedly having sex with a 16 year old non-Jewish girl. The problem, of course is a very large number of Germans approved of repressive policies towards Jews. The Nazis were overtly anti-semitic from the start and it needs to be remembered that in the election in January 1933 which brought Hitler to power the Nazi party got the largest proportion of votes cast, 43%. Hitler brooked no opposition, and anyone who got in the way was disposed of summarily. Only the aristocratic army officer corps offered any real resistance, and then only late in the piece because they saw Hitler as ruining Germany. For someone like Janning exile was not an option \u0096 it was either play along or go to a concentration camp for opposing the regime. He admits his mistake, but of course it's cold comfort to the victims.Spencer Tracey could make just about any character likable, and our sympathies are soon captured by the affable and apparently fair-minded Judge Hayward. But he proves incapable of getting to the bottom of the matter. Justice of a sort is done, and the defendants have their day (actually several months) in court, but the whole proceeding has some of the elements of a show trial. Ironically, both the prosecutor (a relentless Richard Widmark) and the Tribunal members are for political reasons pressured by people in the military who should have known better to go easy on the defendants. Currently we have kangaroo court style US military tribunals set up by the late unlamented Bush regime to deal with people picked up in the invasion of Iraq and elsewhere. Fortunately it looks like the regular courts will wind up disposing of these cases. However, the Nuremburg Tribunal, victor's justice it may have been, can be defended on the grounds there was nothing else. In retrospect it was an imperfect exercise. This film remains a worthy attempt to give an account of it.",

            "review_title": "Kramer's Brilliant All-Star Masterpiece",
            "content": "JUDGMENT AT NUREMBERG is a cinematic masterpiece that has everything: a brilliant, Oscar-winning script by Abby Mann, sure-footed direction by Stanley Kramer, astonishing camera work by Ernest Laszlo, and a heaven-sent ensemble of superb actors who breathe such life into their characters that it is hard to believe that this is not a factual account of the Nuremberg Trials, but a fictionalized story based on facts. Or to put it another way, the people in this film never really existed, but they damn well should have.Briefly: Nuremberg, Germany, 1948. The Nuremberg Trials are nearing their end; the only defendants left are four German judges who served under the Nazi regime.The broad range of acting styles is of particular interest here. Spencer Tracy brings his usual direct, no-nonsense approach to the role of the upright, soft-spoken New England judge in charge of the proceedings. Maximillian Schell makes an astonishing American debut as the defense attorney who feels it is his mission to defend not only his clients, but the entire German people. Schell's performance is pure dynamite; he won the Best Actor Oscar for his work here.On the other side is Richard Widmark as the prosecutor, an Army Colonel who was present at the liberation of the camps and is so sick inside at what he saw that he would indeed like to convict the whole German people. Widmark brings a deep anger and sense of moral outrage to his character that plays brilliantly off of Schell's righteous indignation.Marlene Dietrich, in what may be the most difficult role in the film, plays the widow of a Nazi general who was executed for war crimes; she tries to engage Tracy's character, to influence him to realize that, in her words, \"we are not all monsters.\" Dietrich, in real life a passionate Nazi-hater, delivers one of her best performances in this film.Judy Garland and Montgomery Clift have devastating cameos as victims of the defendants. Clift is a slow-witted man who was sterilized under the Nazis. Clift was quite ill at the time, and he uses his illness for all its worth; his performance is so agonizing it is hard to watch. Likewise Garland is equally brilliant as a broken woman, trying to rebuild her life after being accused under the Nazis of having an affair with an older, Jewish man (who was executed for the crime of \"racial pollution\"), who is forced to relive her memory of her ordeal on the witness stand in a tour-de-force performance that builds and builds until Garland breaks down, screaming at Schell, \"STOP IT! STOP IT!!\" and Burt Lancaster stands up and roars, \"HERR ROLFE! Are we going to do this again?\" Lancaster then delivers a long monologue that sums up everything that has gone before. Lancaster subdues his usual physicality here; his shoulders stoop, and his whole affect is one of dejection. His final speech on the witness stand would have brought the house down in a theatre.Werner Klemperer is also on hand as one of Lancaster's fellow defendants, an unrepentant monster of a Nazi who stands firmly by everything he did. This is not Colonel Klink; be warned.The rest of the ensemble is equally flawless; I did not see a single bad performance.The other star of this film is Ernest Laszlo's camera. This film takes place mostly in the crowded courtroom of the Hall of Justice. The camera is fluid, always moving in, pulling back, panning the room, even moving over the backs of people's heads. It is the essence of great cinematography, and makes what could have been a static courtroom drama into an exciting cinematic event.This is a long film at just over three hours, but there is not a frame of film wasted.",

            "content": "At the closing scene, Herr Janning has called Judge Hayward to this cell. Janning tells the judge: \"Those millions\u0085 I never knew it would come to that.\" And Judge Haywood responds: \"\u0085it came to that the first time you sentenced a man to death you knew to be innocent.\" The Nazis had sentenced 6 million innocent Jews to death; the first time one innocent person dies, a person known to be innocent, the Nazis were on the road to mass murder.Judgment at Nuremberg is an excellent movie. By its acting, by it topic, by its theme, by its presentation. It records a fictional judgment in Nuremberg of four Nazi Jurists in 1948 after the Nuremberg Trials of Goebbels, Goring, Ribbentrop, et. al. These Jurists were relatively small cogs in the Nazi machinery of death.There are huge metaphysical questions involved in any aesthetic of the Holocaust. The ones discussed in this film: to what extent did these small cogs know of the massive machinery of death? At what point does one overlook the past\u2014what's past is past\u2014forget the past and move on? What is the appropriate punishment for being involved in this machinery of death, no matter how apparently tangential? How many murders can be committed before one loses the right to call himself human: one, two, three murders? Should the entire nation\u2014each and every individual\u2014be to blame for evils of the Nazi State? And those are just a few of the metaphysical questions raised in the film.But judgment is not about metaphysical questions; metaphysical questions belong to the audience watching the trial unfold. A trial is about the exact nature of the crime, whether the right person is under judgment, whether the evidence is sufficient beyond reasonable doubt to convict, and meting out appropriate punishment. In the film, documentation for an atrocity so large was provided by eyewitness accounts and by raw film footage of camp liberation.These four defendants did not operate the gas chambers. But so long as they convicted one innocent person\u2014Feldenstein\u2014than they were participants in Mass Murder. John Donne said it many years ago: \"No man is an island, entire of himself. \u0085 Any man's death diminishes me, because I am involved in Mankind\u0085\" But there is another reality a film about the Holocaust must have: psychological verisimilitude. The film must accurately portray within a brief scene what is often sub rosa: attitudes, mind-sets, hidden agendas. The judges are in the mess hall, dining. After seeing film footage from the liberators, one of the judges asks: how is it possible to kill that many people; how can that many people be killed in a day. He turns around and asks Oswald Pohl. Pohl and Eichmann were in charge of concentration camp operations. Pohl responds, with 2 gas chambers 10,000 could be killed in half-an-hour. And then he adds: \"It's disposing of the, bodies that's a problem.\" The way the scene is played out, creates a moment of chilling accuracy about the mindset of these people responsible for cold blooded technocratic murder. Pohl is viewed in profile and from a distance, a touch of cinematic genius.",

But, watching it today, I wondered if it overreached itself. The final words of the judge to the convicted Nazi judge are, roughly, \"You became responsible for the millions of victims the first time you sentenced a man to death whom you knew to be innocent.\" It's a fine sentiment, and one we hope we would try to live up to today. But how realistic is it? Is it anything more than poetry, high-sounding phrases? If it is truly meaningful, then I don't think the lessons have been learned, because similar things are still happening. While they are not comparable to the atrocities of Nazi Germany, the same kind of corruption is still with us. When America feels threatened by terrorists, its justice department finds legal justifications for torture. In Texas a governor refuses to save a man from execution even when DNA evidence proves his innocence, for political reasons, as the public, frightened by crime, cries out for blood and a scapegoat. The Nazi era came to an end, thank goodness, but its venality, corruption, even traces of its brutality, are still among us today. And, sad to say, they probably always will be.",

The film was made in 1961, a scant twelve years after the trials. Okay, as someone has pointed out, one of the 99, Rudolf Hess, did remain in prison but even so we are faced with the question why hold the trials at all if, as it turned out, they were largely meaningless. Bleeding-Heart Liberal Extraordinary to the House of Sunset and Vine Stanley Kramer was the ideal, if indeed the only person to send celluloid messages to the world as he had demonstrated time and again and here he sends a doozy. This is a Great film from whatever angle you like beginning with a fine script by Abby Mann (and an uncredited Monty Clift), equally fine direction from Kramer, the whole crowned by excellent ensemble playing with two Beyond Outstanding performances from Monty Clift and Judy Garland that lift screen acting to another dimension. It's perhaps just as well that these were cameos because it's hard to believe either could have sustained such a level of intensity over the long haul. It's always the mark of a great film when 1) the time flies by and 2) you don't want it to end and here the two hours fifty nine minutes are up and away in a trice. For an essentially downbeat subject with virtually no light relief but just enough non-courtroom footage to leaven the trial itself the film keeps you both watching and involved and it's hard to praise anything more than that.",

Although both movies hang their hat on historical events, neither film is actually about the surface events in the film. Directed by the same man and released within a year of each other, their purpose was to get audiences rooting for the forces of reason, and oppose the irrationality of the herd mentality Judgment at Nuremburg is about a fictional trial of German judges who let themselves be swept up in the ethnic hatred promoted by the Nazis, delivering verdicts that they had decided upon before the trials over violations of racial purity laws had even begun. The film was written as a reaction against McCarthyism, which had gripped America for a decade and burned out just five years before the film. The film intended to show the danger of movements of mass hysteria, and how easy it is for an entire society to commit atrocities in the name of defending their country. The movie's tactics are heavy-handed. You can almost see the defense attorney getting rabid as he uses the same vicious illogic to attack the prosecution's witnesses as he used to shred the defense's witnesses when he prosecuted defendants on behalf of the Third Reich. If that weren't obvious enough, the movie drives the point home with a monologue from one of the defendants about how the judges lied to themselves -- first to protect their country from the Russian threat, then to save themselves at the expense of innocent people. A modern American audience might be entitled shake their heads at the absurdity of Nazism and McCarthyism, if it weren't for the same phenomenon taking place today, with Muslim terrorists being the scapegoats and justification for a range of brutalities and civil rights restrictions.Inherit the Wind is, on the surface, about the famous Scopes evolution-teaching trial in Tennessee in the 1930's. The movie paints a stark portrait of those enlightened by science and the ability to think for themselves as oppressed by those caught in the mindless vise-grip of fundamental Christianity. There is some sparkling courtroom dialog between the two leads, but the point was clearly to portray the fundamentalists as idiotic buffoons. While I'm all in favor of putting facts ahead of faith, caricaturing opponents of your viewpoint may make good propaganda, but it's terrible drama. Despite this, the movie is instructive about the constancy of this particular struggle, since it continues today, using the same arguments on both sides. In fact, the divide between the rationalists and religionists is arguably worse today, as both camps diverge on a growing number of fundamental values.My reactions to these movies was not so much to like them or dislike them, but to despair over the fact that as a nation and as human beings, we continue the insanely destructive patterns depicted 45 years ago. It seems that we have learned nothing from our past, or perhaps, as human beings, we are simply locked into a limited set of behaviors that doom us.",

            "content": "Stanley Kramer's 3-hours historical courtroom drama about the trial of four distinguished German judges after WWII in Nuremberg by an American court which is presided by Judge Dan Haywood (Tracy), the defendants are not direct participants of neither the combats nor the Holocaust, but do they hold the responsibility of condoning Hitler and the Third Reich's atrocity without interfering with their own divine and authoritative power to forestall all the ensuing heinous horror during the WWII, or before, when Nazi's racial persecution was striking the minority population within Germany under the patronage of law? Are they responsible for the killing of those millions of innocents during the most horrifying genocide in the human history? Based on Abby Mann's meticulous script and a powerhouse cast. Some of the defendants are avid advocates of such wanton injustice, but the sagest among them is Judge Ernst Janning (Lancaster), a prestigious law-maker, whose confession in the third act comes as the most powerful introspection with remorse and grievance of a patriotic German's viewpoint of Hitler and his empire, deluded by Hitler's saviour image, German people are desperate to believe he can save the troubled nation and blindly follows him, even conforms to his radical policies a passing phase for a victorious future. Lancaster is taciturn almost entirely up to his big action here, it is a greatly harrowing confession. Judge Haywood is from a provincial background, rarely gets out of his own country, he is an amiable and easy of approach, Spencer stands out in bringing out a lifelike personage of his character with gravitas and charisma, culminating in the scenes where he pronounces the judgements, understated but each line is so puissant and mind-blowing. Obviously the whole task is a hot potato for him, during the time, political influence is also in the game to sway his verdict, when the impending Cold War is looming large. While getting to know the truth, he befriends a German widow Ms. Bertolt (Dietrich), whose husband is a general and has been executed in a trial and Dan lives in their house which is confiscated after the war. Ms. Bertolt cunningly indoctrinates her innocent identity and persuades him that the most important thing is to look upon the future, as life must go on no matter what. Dietrich is in her early sixties, but radiant in her passive manipulation under the surface of kindness and aplomb. She represents another type of the post-war German mentality, they cannot face the truth, and deceive themselves with oblivion, but the torture is persistent plaguing, her final scene where she is sitting in the shadow when the telephone is ringing, she knows it is Dan to say goodbye, yet her dispassionate silhouette tells everything, her scheme founders, and all the dignified facade is removed, to her Dan is just a chess she fails to manoeuvre, no heartfelt farewell needed, may alcohol can save her soul. The prosecutor is Tad Lawson (Widmark), a US colonel who witnesses firsthand the utterly inhuman savagery in the concentration camps, he is vehement to condemn the defendants and obviously is carried away by implicating the whole nation as the sinner, the perpetrator, his indignation can be vicariously felt by viewers, but for once we can not all stand by his side, which denotes a different irrational extremity. Perhaps, the most formidable performance comes from the then unknown Maximilian Schell, who plays Hans Rolfe, the German defence attorney, and he wins an Oscar for it. Rolfe is very good at his job and over-confident in his professional acuteness of logic to serve his own assumptions. His aggressive but impassioned eloquence can tactfully penetrate the loopholes in key witnesses' testimonies and elicit compassion in the most unlikely scenario, he is a patriot too, he has a clear vision of what Nazi has done, but for him, the only redemption is to save the last remnant of dignity for his homeland, no matter how improper and difficult it will be. Schell invests a great deal of passion, resolution and wisdom in his superb line-delivery of his star-making role. Apart from Dietrich, the film also marks two other Golden Age mega-star's twilight career, it is Dietrich's penultimate screen presence, but for Clift and Garland, their more troubled personal downward spirals are woefully apposite for their characters as two key witnesses here, Clift is Rudolph Petersen, a slow-witted victim of Nazi's sterility operation and Garland is Irene Hoffman, a German woman who is involved with a Jewish man and claims he is only a father figure to her. They galvanize consummately in their very rare foil roles, both are enormously compelling and drastically stirring to watch, especially when audience can detect the traces of their own traumas which can be vividly reflected on screen, alas, both would die prematurely, Clift in 1966 at the age of 45 and Garland, three years later in 1969 at the age of 47. Apart from Schell's win, Tracy, Clift and Garland are also Oscar-nominated, but that year the Academy was adamant to acknowledge new blood, Tracy is trounced by Schell, Clift and Garland and the film itself lost to WEST SIDE STORY (1961), only Mann's writing added a second Oscar to this significantly illuminating lesson one can learn from the most horrifying man-made catastrophe and a telling evidence that law system must not be compromised by political agenda under any circumstances. Although Kramer's directorial endeavour could be comparatively overlooked as the story mostly takes place in the courtroom, and it is the battle of tongue that captivates its audience, his innovation of 360- degree interior shots still can alert one's attention of the mastery behind. In one word, the film is a vociferous diatribe towards all the warmongers among the human race, the scum of the earth!",

            "content": "\"Justice at Nuremberg\" took on the matter of the post WWII military trials that took place in Germany with many of Hitler's associates as the defendants. In this film, those jurists that administered justice in the name of the 3rd Reich are brought to answer for their roles in the legalizing of Nazi atrocities. It is a difficult subject, to be sure, because they were acting, in the statement of the defense attorney, for the benefit of their country, right or wrong. Patriotism, an American virtue, is to be practiced by German patriots who felt that Germany was correct in its quest to rid the world of certain undesirable groups. In the end, the viewer has to discern all the questions and thoughts that arise, which can make this movie a bit tough. However, it is a film to be viewed with an honest, clear-thinking mind that makes one think and recall those times of sheer horror and torment.The cast is top-notch; Spencer Tracy plays the American judge who ultimately has to deliver the verdict to four former judges, and he plays it with quiet dignity and integrity. Burt Lancaster plays one of the four defendants with silence and intensity, which erupts when his attorney, played by Oscar-winner Maximillan Schell, tries to make the actions of the judges both acceptable and correct, for the times of occurrence. Lancaster delivers a very moving soliloquy in his time to finally testify which rivets the viewer to heed all that is said. Richard Widmark plays the prosecuting attorney with a fierce determination to see justice done, no matter what, and Judy Garland,along with Montgomery Clift, contribute moving scenes during their time as witnesses to recall horrors inflicted upon them during the control of the 3rd Reich.All said and done, this film needs to be recognized as one of Stanley Kramer's directorial masterpieces, but viewers need to realize that these events did occur, and hopefully, are now prevented from ever occurring again.",

The Germans acted exactly as portrayed in the movie in the post-war era. No one knew anything, and no one saw anything. Millions disappeared, no one noticed. OK. That's believeable. Additionally, the interactions between the Americans and the Germans was perfectly depicted in the film, and as to Klemperer's character being a joke, it should be remembered that many Nazis acted exactly like that--totally defiant--during the trials. Meanwhile, to say that the Germans were not well defended by Schell's charater is totally wrong. Perhaps that is where this reviewer was wrong more than any area. Schell quotes Oliver Wendell Holmes and laws from the Commonwealth of Virginia to show that German laws portrayed as immoral were ones in force in America. Additionally, he quoted Churchill's positive statement about Hitler which was made before 1938. This movie is extraordinary. Tracy and Schell are beyond compare.",

He's noted as the most brilliant, and the character gives the \"crocodile tears\" approach, pretending to be super remorseful.However, this guy blows his act to any savvy viewer, when he demonstrates a superiority complex over the other three defendants.It's quite clear to the savvy person that Burt Lancaster's character is the absoloute worst of the four, the most sadistic and evil. Burt plays it to the hilt, and no doubt fools many people into thinking this is a remorseful character. In the end, the truth is revealed, though.Does the presiding judge, played by Spencer Tracy, get fooled? What is the final sentence for the four men?",

            "review_title": "When will the guilty admit their guilt?",
            "content": "This is a great film.  It tries to tackle one of the most difficult periods of history ... and it contains some of the best performances on the silver screen:  Spencer Tracy (as a seasoned judge in the twilight of his career), Burt Lancaster (as a respected scholarly jurist who cooperated with the Nazis), Maximillian Schell (as the young German defense attorney trying to prove that Nazi racial discrimination was no different from US racism), and Richard Widmark (as the jaded prosecuting attorney).   This movie is about shame.  It is about the shame that some people should have felt right after the war when the US decided that it was politically necessary to forgive Germans for their criminal conduct in order to obtain their help in fighting communism.  The major Nuremberg Trial (of Goering, Hess, Speer et al) was over.  The subsequent trials were not prosecuted by Justice Robert Jackson, but were handed over to other prosecutors.  The American public and US Army were more frightened of Russia than Germany.  Many people were sick and tired of hearing about the concentration camps and the horrors.But this 1961 film foreshadowed the future Nazi revisionists and Holocaust-deniers.  It dealt directly with the need and desire for many Germans and some Americans to refuse to face up to the many daily instances of injustice, cruelty, inhumanity, depravity and murder committed by ordinary Germans -- clerks, railroad employees, bankers, --- as well as the German military, courts, and industrial complex that relied upon slave labor.It is a shame that Germans thought of the Nuremberg Trials as being unfair because the defendants were simply obeying their legal responsibilities during an ordinary war.  But this was no ordinary war.  This was genocide and everyone in Germany participated in it.  As the film points out ... even the ordinary people who claimed that they did not know about the death camps were fooling or lying to themselves.  They knew what Hitler had said about the Jews and promised to do to the Jews.  They knew that their Jewish neighbors were taken away ... and with Jewish property taken by the state... the Jews were not coming back.  If their crime was merely their willful ignorance of murder ... refusing to acknowledge it and refusing to prevent it ... then the continuing shame exposed by the film is that so many in Germany (as well as Austria, France, Ukraine, Poland, Belgium and other countries where many collaborated with the Germans) would continue to refuse to learn the full extent of the horror.In addition, the film went further when Lancaster (the former Nazi judge) warns Schell (his defense lawyer) that his defense tactics are once again cruelly persecuting the defenseless.  Perhaps it is too shameful for him to admit it, but Lancaster eventually does.  He admits that he perverted justice and disregarded the rules of law and morality in collaborating with the Nazis and applying their discriminatory racial laws.  Very few Nazis admitted their culpability.  Albert Speer did.  On the other hand, many Germans preferred to follow Goering's example:  to argue that Germany was merely fighting an honorable war, not conducting a genocide.\nMy father was an interpreter with the US Army during the war.  He had assisted in the interrogation of hundreds if not thousands of German prisoners of war.  And he told me that not a single German soldier admitted being a member of the Nazi party.  So who committed all the crimes?  Who ran the death camps?  Who arrested the victims and put them on the cattle cars? Why was it so hard to capture these culprits and bring them to trial? How did so many successfully hide in South America and even Europe?  And how can it be that over fifty years after WWII anti-semitism is still prominent in Russia, Poland, France et al?Judgment at Nuremberg is great because it doesn't focus on the Nazi leaders and the death camp commanders.  It focuses on the judges who administered the laws, so it deals with the question whether there are laws that are so unjust that no judge should apply them.  But is also focuses on the ordinary Germans ... the domestic servants, the Army widow.  You could see that they felt some degree of shame ... but they were more concerned with trying to preserve some dignity and some love for their culture and heritage.\nThe final shame is felt by us ... the viewers ... when we identify with Spencer Tracy's character as he returns to (the normality of) the US.  He can turn his back on Germany, the evidence of atrocities, and the need to prosecute any more criminals.  Similarly, we turn our backs.  Even Lancaster's admission of guilt is not satisfying in the face of so many who deny it.  It took a million brave soldiers and workers in the US, Britain and other Allied countries to defeat the Nazis.  It would take thousands to continue to prosecute the criminals for their barbarity.  Unfortunately, the Allies did not have the stomach for that in the 1940's, 50's or 60's.  It was not until 1983 that Nazi hunters were able to find Klaus Barbie.  It was not until the 1990's when Swiss banks were willing to discuss claims they had been harboring gold and other valuables that the Nazis had stolen from their victims.  There are still many unprosecuted claims against Germany for slave labor and against insurance companies for failing to pay claims. In 1961, as we see in Judgment at Nuremberg, there were many people who felt that enough had been said about the Holocaust.  But the reason the subject seems inexhaustible is that we -- the courts, the politicians, the nations, the businesses, and the ordinary people -- have failed to deal with the full scope of criminal and immoral conduct.",

When you commit an immoral act, the fact that it is legal, or in keeping with the law at the time, is not a good enough excuse. This point was driven home by the script of \"Judgment\". When Spencer Tracy tells the Nazi judge that he destroyed his creditability the first time he sentenced a man to death that he knew to be innocent, the power of this movie comes into focus.

Stanley Kramer makes the most filming 2 1/2 hours in a courtroom with interesting camera angles, zoom ins and zoom outs, and other camera tricks.But what really makes this film so great is the incredible acting. Maximillian Schell gives an astoundingly remarkable performance, one of the best performances I've ever seen, as the German defense counsel.  Spencer Tracy, while more or less an onlooker for most of the film, is superb in his closing address to the court.  Judy Garland and Montgomery Clift also have great memorable supporting roles.

            "content": "Tracy channels a refreshing patience as a humble Maine judge exported to don the gown of chief justice in a tribunal comprised of judges facing judges. Clearly, the scales should balance. He and his fellow adjudicators sit across from an even number of other adjudicators. One'd think they'd all see eye-to-eye. And yet, Judge Haywood finds himself indecisive of how four respected judges like himself could've passed sentences resulting in genocide, castration, ethnic cleansing and ultimately, how an entire country could be permissive of these atrocities. The film's his teeming, deliberate process of making up his mind.The black-and-white cinematography emphatically reflects the courtroom environment's utter formality and procedure. Each and every shot's perfectly balanced in equal terms of space, overlapping planes, converging focus. One shot's repeated constantly, the slowly revolving camera fixed on its subject then crash-zooming into that character at a point of rising vigor in his/her monologue. It's very effective, but the sudden crash-zoom's repeated use, rather than once, twice at most, begins feeling rather arbitrary. Why this point in a speech rather than that? Lancaster, though sounding quasi-transatlantically staccato rather than actually German, has the still, silent ferment that brings his symbolic purpose to full impact. For two hours, he's essentially silent, motionless; in the third, he accosts us with one of the most telling, socially aware, discomfortingly honest monologues ever performed. I suspect his character's a symbol because his omnipotent speech condemning himself and his fellow defendants for complicity in the Reich, that it's not that they didn't know the truth but that they didn't want to know, is something that must've been, probably still is, a feeling running to the existential core of many Germans. Yet it doesn't stop there: Why do we Americans support our leaders in punishing minorities, preemptive attacks, an ever-deepening divide between classes? When Lancaster's finished, in another of Kramer's blatant demonstrations of balancing scales, Schell follows his defendant by raising Churchill's premature praise of Hitler, the Vatican's platform of approval. He also mentions earlier an American Supreme Court justice's support of eugenics.It's difficult not feeling a strong connection to Garland as Schell cross-examines her. She bares such pitiful vulnerability, nearly crumbles before our eyes. In a movie constructed mainly of extensive monologue, this scene's comparatively short, yet provokes an impact unique to any of these other powerhouse scenes. The point, seemingly, in the film's larger scope, is not merely her agony but Schell's ruthlessness. In even broader terms, we find that despite Schell's brutally controlling provocation of witnesses, he's not a monster but a great defense attorney, as well as a man of logic fully aware of his courtroom function and as a human being battling his inexorable personal stakes in his defendants' guilt or innocence.Indeed, no central character's either hero or monster. None entirely understand the macrocosmic fulcrum in which they're entrenched. One may find the scenes outside the courtroom dull by comparison, that they could be omitted to streamline the action, mainly where Haywood befriends Dietrich's level-headed German war-widow, who gives him her perspective on the war. But in a film constructed completely on counterweight and parallels, there must be Germans causing suffering, and Germans caused to suffer. Just as there are evenhanded Americans like Haywood and vengeful Americans like Widmark's prosecutor.The nature of Clift's posture, his utter wariness against the past, his debilitating anxiety and feebleness, the texture of his accent, is entrancing. Perhaps it's distasteful to suggest that his deteriorating health and looks resulting from his mid-1950s car wreck was a perk in his later performances, but here, I believe because we associate him with the sublimely handsome young man of I Confess and A Place in the Sun, there's something so tragically off-kilter about him here. But it's not merely the physical post-accident impact, it's equally the devastating vulnerability he carries from a truly pain-filled life that he dauntlessly brings to his astonishing early scene as a truly sympathetic character.The movie's massive in the breadth of its questions of individual complicity in government crimes. Where's the end to the blame? There's no doubt that the men on trial here are guilty. They supported a bigoted, oppressive war machine. But then that must mean that those who supported the men on trial are guilty, and also their supporters' supporters, and so on. What we find at the roots of these apparent sometime advocates of Hitler's regime is altogether a stockpile of rationalization and justification deriving straight from nationalistic pride. \"Above all, there was fear,\" Lancaster's Ernst Janning defiantly divulges. \"Only when you understand that can you understand what Hitler meant to us\u0085What about those of us who knew the words were lies and worse than lies? Why did we sit silent, take part? Because we loved our country! What difference does it make if a few political extremists lose their rights, if a few racial minorities lose their rights? It's only a passing phase. It's only a stage we are going through.\" And so on.It isn't just mammoth monologues that gush with subtext, it's also single-sentence replies, such as when Haywood's told, \"Those millions of people\u0085I never knew it'd come to that,\" to which he responds, \"It came to that the first time you sentenced a man to death you knew to be innocent.\" That the film ends on that line is a clear alarm bell that this film's not merely an indictment of the Nazis, but the severest warning to all human beings of judiciary positions everywhere. I know that it's become a tired hat-trick to compare any political state of affairs you don't like to Hitler's Reich (I'm talking to you, Beck), but let's be realistic here: What will happen if a government's legal system secures patriotism and nationalism as higher obligations than pure justice?",

Thus, the Allies chose to try them.People remember \"Nuremburg\" as holding up the holocaust to view---with actual concentration camp footage shown during the trial, and the prosecuting attorney testifying (here as a witness---as his zeal was fueled by what he saw when liberating the death camps) BUT Judgment at Nuremburg shows us about other Nazi war crimes we have forgotten about... there were victims even amongst the so called \"aryans\"; the so called master race, as the Nazis had a burning passion to \"purify their race by sterilizing those who were retarded or even \"slow learners\" or who possibly had some other kind of genetic based defect. Montgomery Clift is great as the tragic mildly retarded man forcibly sterilized by the Nazis, tho the prosecuting attorney quotes US sources (even the venerable Oliver Wendell Holmes) to show that the US in the early 20th century favored forced sterilization to \"protect\" the race. And the Nazis sometimes executed non \"aryans\" for sleeping with \"aryans\". Judy Garland is also great as the woman accused of sleeping with a Jewish man, defined then as a crime with jail time for her and death for him because of \"race defilement\". This is based on a real life incident.Tho the film only mentions in passing the murder of others, maybe Nuremberg will entice people to research the so called science of racial \"purification\" i.e. of eugenics that the Nazis practiced. Search under the word \"eugenics\" or \"eugenics watch\" and be amazed... As the German defense attorney correctly says, the Nazis did not invent these practices...but copied them, especially from the US!.We today are making more and more decisions concerning who is disabled, and who should live or die. For instance today the Netherlands are boldly practicing euthanasia, partly like the Nazis practiced...only the Nazis were more discreet.In memory of Terri Schiavo, and the adult stem cell versus embryonic stem cell battle...and the battle over abortion on demand (a crime in the actual Nuremburg trials) I say this film is extremely timely.",

Did the people REALLY know what happened? And if they did, did they just close their eyes and pretend it didn't? Or, were they truly left in the dark? I'm betting on the former, but we can never know for sure.I visited Dachau back in the early 2000's and noticed houses surrounding the complex. These were not newly built homes either. There was definitely some age to many of them. Well before the time of Hitler and the Nazis. Someone had to be living there at that time. So to say that they had no idea what was going on is a bit of a stretch.It's amazing how the herd mentality can affect what would be considered intelligent and civilized people. It's something that we all should consider while listening to a smooth-talking politician from EITHER side of the aisle. They may say all the right things, but do something completely different.

            "content": "First I was worried about the bumpy start. The first trial scenes show constant translating between English and pseudo-German (most actors are obviously not German speakers). Thank god this stopped after 15 minutes where they switched all to English! A weird artistic decision, as subtitles would be much more elegant.The execution is probably influenced by 12 Angry Men, which came out a few years prior. The movie could have been more focused by centering on fewer characters, also trimming the running time. Performances are outstanding at parts but sometimes heavily overacted. And you have to suspend disbelief sometimes, look beyond bad fake German accents, which are put on by some actors while others don't even bother.OK, now to the subject matter, which raises hard questions of guilt.In many aspects the movie feels very much like a product of it's time (1961), six years after WW2 ended. Later works, for example by Bernhard Schlink (\"The Reader\"), demonstrate a more distanced, insightful and complex way to judge guilt within the inhumane, cruel regime of the Nazis. Who was guilty, who simply followed orders to protect himself? The world is not always as simple as black or white.Generally speaking, this movie aims mostly for emotionalizing. To an audience of the 21st century, this movie, however, has a different effect as it had on audiences in 1961 (especially with the dawn of the cold war being right there). Some scenes address that the USA needed Germany against the Soviets, which influenced the judgement and whether the USA should \"go easy\" on them.One key moment is when the prosecuted former judge admits guilt of himself and his country and acknowledges it as an important move to look forward. Watching this movie in 20xx, one has to understand, that this admittance of guilt (symbolized by certain characters more than others) is a major part of modern German identity and forever will be for any generation born after WW2.Like the judge had to make a decision from his point of view (right after 1945), a today's reviewer has to review from today's perspective. Therefore I'll have to say, the emotional impact this movie aimed for in 1961 is slightly dated by now.",

They have been caught up in something beyond their control although there is a hint that they were at least passive supporters of Hitler. \"I won't say that Hitler didn't do some good things. He built the autobahn,\" says Mrs Halbestadt. The pair are now caught up in another situation (The American occupation) in which they feel that passive subservience is the best strategy to survive. They have lost a son in the army and a daughter in the bombing and now they must feel the unease of being under the control of people they don't know and who do not understand them. Both actors do a great job of portraying an apprehensiveness that the whole nation must have felt.2) Schmidt as played by Paul Busch. He is a driver for Judge Heywood and the first German we see. He is relatively young and stares straight ahead and beeps aggressively at the sparse traffic as he drives the American judge and senator through the bombed-out ruins of Nuremburg. We are sure that Schmidt feels much more than he is prepared to reveal as he drives on and follows the commands and answers the questions of his new superiors with a stiff obedience.3) Otto Waldis as Pohl, a right hand man at a concentration camp. His emotionally detached response to the question of how the extermination of millions of people could be possible tells all. \"It's possible. It all depends on your facilities.\" The response answered the question of the logistics but also the mental approach that could make it possible. Otto Waldis as Pohl is chillingly matter-of-fact as he eats his lunch and repeats what were the actual words of a real Nuremburg Trial defendant - Rudolf Hoss.4) Howard Caine as Hugo Wallner. He plays the husband of Judy Garland's character, his wife who is being persuaded to testify against fellow Germans. The couple have a very modest shop as a new start after the war and fear retribution should Mrs Wallner testify. Caine's performance again gives the ordinary person's sense of despair and frustration at having the repercussions of the war continue to impact on their lives. The couple have obviously suffered and are now being asked to sacrifice by people who move in circles far above them. It is easy to say they have a moral duty to testify against injustice and evil but it is they who will bear the consequence and Hugo Wallner's response is not totally indefensible. \"I say to hell with them and to hell with you.\"5) Olga Fabian as Mrs Lindnow. A brilliant portrait of the dangers of giving ordinary, powerless people power over others - the basis of why Nazism was so popular. She, even years later and after a devastating war, enjoys another chance at being party to the cruel persecution of Mrs Wallner. Nazism had given Mrs Lindnow her moment of power and importance. The power to be cruel to others and have it legitimized by law and government has never been better depicted than in the person of Mrs Lindnow.There are others but I will let you look for them.

Plus, the movie goes far to accuse those who knew and did nothing. It reminded me of the excellent book Hitler's \"Willing Executioners\". That book proved that many knew, few acted, and most did nothing. Who is to blame, maybe everyone maybe no one, you decide. Historically, the movie is accurate in that the prisoner's actions and attitudes were similar to the defenses used by many of the accused. The movie also tries to show the historical place within which the later trials were held. This should be an excellent movie to open up discussions of post-war Germany. The movie is a good example of the lost art of word play and powerful understatement. The movie has very good acting.",

Still, there is much pressure put on Haywood to show leniency, which is difficult to do when the witnesses(played by Judy Garland & Montgomery Clift, among others) are so sympathetic, and the defense attorney(played by Maximilian Schell in an Academy Award winning performance) is so harsh.

            "content": "It took more than a decade for Hollywood to handle the most painful aspect of World War II, the most difficult to watch from a cinematic perspective: the Holocaust. George Stevens made \"The Diary of Anne Frank\" and Otto Preminger made \"Exodus\". Stanley Kramer adopts a different angle converging with the streak of courtroom dramas that started in the late 50's: \"12 Angry Men\", \"Witness for the Prosecution\", \"Anatomy of a Muder\" or \"Inherit the Wind\", actually you have a dozen of classics made between 1957 and 1962, and \"Judgment at a Nuremberg\" is one of the high points, dealing with the German perspective, it can be subtitled: \"Anatomy of a Holocaust\".The film asks fundamental questions about the responsibility of German judges and prosecutors who sentenced to jail or sterilization, many civilians, out of obedience to the Third Reich regime. Set at the end of the Nuremberg trials in 1948, the film is a powerful documentary-like drama questioning the roles played by men who were not Nazi officers, who never pulled any trigger or activated any gas chamber, yet there's no doubt that their law-abiding attitude cautioned an evil ideology. And the real challenge is to ask ourselves a similar question: what would have we done, today, if we were to be ruled by a shamefully evil law, or at least, unethical.A look at the context: by the time these trials were conducted, all the Nazi top-management was wiped out but while Germany was turning the page of World War II, some people still had to answer for their crimes. Stanley Kramer deals with the trauma of the war without adopting an inquisitive tone and that's worthy of appreciation, the performance of Maximilian Schell as the lawyer of the four judges is pivotal, because this is a man whose competence is undeniable and inspires tacit admiration and obvious concerns from the prosecutor played by Richard Widmarck. Spencer Tracy as Judge Haywood observes the trial with impassible eyes, and from his rugged Yankee look, you can tell this is a man who's really asking question and wants to be convinced.The film is never as powerful as when you stop watching it from a collective aspect and see it from one individual perspective, one that makes things less black-and-white and more complex than they seem. Modern audiences are a few steps ahead of \"Judgment at Nuremberg\" but we can appreciate it as a serious drama full of passionately riveting exchanges especially between Schell and Widmarck who, in their own right, manage to have a point even if they stand for diverging opinions. And within a run-time of three-hour, a few other scenes emerge from the judicial routine. Montgomery Clift's awkwardness culminating with his broken voice confronting the impassible Haywood and asking if his mother was feeble-minded, Schell with the passiveness of a cold-blooded bully putting the final nail on his coffin by telling him that all he got is his word and facts can't speak for him.Schell can be rather destructive and finally loses his temper with frail and plump Judy Garland portraying a former Jew's mistress, but the scene works less than Clift's because it is to melodramatic proportions. It is interesting though that Kramer picked Clift and Garland to play worn-out characters, at a time where their career was already declining, and they were broken souls to some degree, there are many artistic licenses taken by Kramer, his loose handling of 'languages' issue, some flashy zooming, all create a rather bizarre self-conscious aspect. Even Burt Lancaster, as accused judge Emil Janning, chooses a pose that gives him a strange solemnity and makes his character uncomfortably sympathetic, oddly enough, the opposite happens with Marlene Dietrich's character that seemed to exist to give Haywood some German insights from a civilian perspective.It comes down to some banal scenes being brilliant, one in jail where a former Nazi camp worker explains it in the most casual way how gas chambers work. I love the fact that he's talking while he's still chewing as if the subject wasn't serious enough to speak with gravity. His casual tone made the point. And in the shot, you have the face of Werner Klemperer (known for Colonel Klink in \"Hogan's Heroes\"), he plays a despicable Nazi judge but his face is devastated, either this is the Nazi realizing the extent of the horror, but you can also see the man who survived Nazism and stopped acting in character. In both cases, it was a brilliant moment.\"Judgment at Nuremberg\" is a dense movie that questions the extents of responsibility, by confronting the Americans to similar issues, how can they condemn German people while avoiding diplomatic complication at the dawn of Cold War? Schell is also the voice that allows pointing a finger on the complicity of the Allies, the application of eugenic laws, the bombing of Hiroshima and many items of discussion suggesting that Germany doesn't have the monopoly of horror. Still, the film manages to find the powerful ending by mentioning that it's not a matter of logic but of fairness. Schell might be 'right' in the absolute, but there comes a time where you've got to think with your heart. Which takes me back to the opening point about the evilness of law.I remember an interesting quote from \"A Man for All Seasons\": \"This country is planted thick with laws, from coast to coast, Man's laws, not God's! And if you cut them down, do you really think you could stand upright in the winds that would blow then? Yes, I'd give the Devil benefit of law, for my own safety's sake!\" The accused judges would have used this line as a defense; they did what they did for their own interest, because as legal scholars, they believed in law.But if in the name of Law, you give the Devil the benefit of the law, what if the Devil is the law?",

            "content": "It is set in Nuremberg, Germany, in 1948. It provides a fictional account of the \"Judges Trial\" by the United States Military of German Judges who willingly served during the Third Reich. This is a long three-hour movie that takes place mostly in the courtroom.Chief Judge Dan Haywood (Spencer Tracy) is a self-effacing recently-electorally-defeated judge from Maine. Judge Ives (Ray Teal) and Judge Norris (Kenneth MacKenna) are also part of the judge and jury tribunal. The chief prosecutor is Col. Tad Lawson (Richard Widmark), and the defense attorney is Hans Rolfe (Maximilian Schell). The four defendents are the well-known Dr. Ernst Janning (Burt Lancaster), Emil Hahn (Werner Klemperer), Friedrich Hofstetter (Martin Brandt), and Werner Lampe (Torben Meyer).Key witnesses include Rudolph Peterson (Montgomery Clift), a baker's helper who was sterilized because the National Socialist court found him to have mental incapacities. Another is Irene Hoffman (Judy Garland), a teenager in the 1930s who had a relationship with her much older Jewish landlord, Feldenstein, who was sentenced to death because of the relationship. There are also explicit films of death camps made at the time the Allied troops discovered those camps.\"Judgement at Nuremberg\" is a remarkable film that airs a variety of perspectives about the guilt of the \"average\" German and allows the defense to quote Oliver Wendell Holmes on the appropriateness of sterilization of some persons or note the number of civilians killed by the U. S. nuclear bombs in Japan in 1945.The film was made as the Cold War was heating up and notes the changing dynamics brought about by the 1948 Berlin Blockade.I have nagging problems with the American exceptionalism that undergirds the movie with the assumption that the U. S. justice system is vastly superior to the rest of the world.Nonetheless, I would say \"Judgment at Nuremberg\" has aged fairly well.",

Kramer's direction is obvious with lots of zoom shots and close-ups and is also terribly stagy and slow. Maxmillian Schell in a very overrated performance plays the defense lawyer, and his work is no where as good as Paul Newman's stunning performance in \"The Hustler.\" Schell won the Oscar that year over Newman, but his performance is all one note or two. Judy Garland and Monty Clift give some depth and feeling to their small cameos, but both also have done much better work through the years. I will say that Dietrich was terrific in her small role and Tracy was also fine and low keyed as he usually was. The worst performance was given by Burt Lancaster who was way to young to play this part with any conviction and had to depend on his badly done hair and make-up to give any feeling that he could come up with. You can see how bad he is in his big confession scene at the trial and also his stance,posture and walk are all wrong, and way too young. I also had trouble with the static camera work and the poor art direction and process shots, and the throwing in of actual concentration camp footage was a cheap shot and the only real emotional moment in the film and points up to how badly directed the it was. The view outside the courtroom never changes and the trees and foliage look way to fake I know this is minor criticism but it makes the film look tacky and cheap. At times the film resembles a television drama which in fact it originally was. The film was a big critical hit in 1961 and received an amazing 11 Oscar nominations include one for best costume????. This was serious stuff with a capital S back then, and was the verso of the other big reserved seat film of the year \"West Side Story.\" If you couldn't get in to West Side you went to see Judgment which made you feel like you had done something good and worthwhile with your 2 bucks.",

But after watching it at last, I've got one thing to say; the 3 hours simply fly by.Inspired by one of the cases that took place during the Nuremberg trials, Judgment at Nuremberg concerns the trial of 4 Judges who served before & during the Nazi regime in Germany and who either passively or actively abused their offices to conduct Nazi's racial policy which eventually resulted in the extermination of millions of people across Europe.Ingeniously directed by Stanley Kramer, the film as a whole is one of the most important works in cinema that goes through both sides of the same coin where the prosecutor wants to blame the entire nation for Nazi's crimes against humanity while the defense attorney is fighting for the little glory that he can abstract for his country which is already going through a lot of humiliation, suffering & guilt.Over the course of its 3 hours of runtime, the film raises some interesting questions about the social or political nature of the crimes these judges were being tried for, the factors that may have influenced or affected their decisions, the geo-political complexity of the whole ongoing trial, the understanding required about Germany's own state that led to Hitler's rise in power & the secrecy with which the entire extermination process was carried out.The script is masterfully written by Abby Mann who wisely weighs the arguments of both sides & let the viewers come to their own conclusions. The camera-work is equally fascinating, especially in the courtroom sequences where it would pan around continuously but then instantly zoom & focus on a particular character, thus alerting its viewers to pay more attention during that vital moment. Editing paces the story so well that the 3 hours of runtime is never felt & the music gets its own moments to shine as well.Coming to the performances, the quality of work done by its ensemble cast is of the highest order & every single actor ends up giving his/her best shot. Even the tertiary cast ends up packing a punch for the mere small details like shivering of hands or lump in throat while talking or fear or embarrassment in their eyes end up providing an immense amount of authenticity to the whole narrative. And the performances from its main cast effortlessly takes it to the next level.Spencer Tracy plays the Chief Judge presiding over the trial & in a way, he depicts us viewers because just like him, we're supposed to hear both sides of the case & come to a decision that's not an easy one to make. And Tracy perfectly balances kindness, charm & authority to deliver an admirable performance here. Burt Lancaster is a silent spectator for the most part but when he gets to speak, he leaves a lasting impression. Yet it's actually Maximillian Schell who completely steals the show with his highly energetic performance as German defense attorney Hans Rolfe.On an overall scale, Judgment at Nuremberg isn't an easy film to pass a judgment upon. The subject matter it deals with & the points it brings on the table really makes you question both justice & fairness and leaves many things to ponder about even when it's finished. Thought- provoking, deeply affecting & profoundly moving, Judgment at Nuremberg is one of the most significant works in cinema history that's strongly, extremely & essentially recommended.",

They think they are merely fulfilling their duty as judges.

Perhaps the most important statement in the entirety of the film was presented at its end, when viewers were informed that NONE of those defendants who were convicted by U S Tribunals as Nazi criminals was still incarcerated at the the time the film was released.This only proves that what is justice for one period of time does not remain justice for future periods of time. One only needs to ponder upon The U S Supreme Court's decisions of the past decade. The Court's position has become the most political body of jurists since its inception. Jurists at this elevation should never be concerned with politics of any nature - it should rule ultimately and solely from The U S Constitution, not at the favor of a president. That august document has been twisted and misinterpreted to render judgments to favor the few, while leaving the majority without proper due cause.Spencer Tracy (the chief tribunal in \"Judgment at Nuremberg\") delivered a monologue in which the ultimate truth is stated - no one is above the law and must suffer the consequences of his guilt......an award-winner role if there ever were one. Yet, how do you determine his performance as being a notch beneath the stunning performance of Maximillian Schell who rightfully won it, or the mesmerizing performance of Montgomery Cliff, or the against-his-character of Burt Lancaster, or the wrenching performance of Judy Garland. ALL of the main characters in this movie should have been nominated. I don't even remember what other films were nominated in l961, or what they were about, but they certainly must have been blockbusters - or the winner must have been by a popularity contest with the academy voters. As we know, they are not always right.\"Judgment at Nuremberg\" was robbed - the only nomination it couldn't have won was for costuming. Oh, it looked right - there just wasn't the need for extravagant costumes. Costuming, make-up, lighting, special effects, music certainly add to a film's impact: however, serious film-plays should be judged just as legitimate theater-productions are, by its impact of the actors' performances. The acting by every cast-member of \"Judgment\" was flawless and portrayed every human emotion we know of. Just as prominent members of the motion-picture industry who were by-passed in the year they were nominated - or were never were nominated - but are given \"life-time\"-awards years later, there needs to be an award for movies that SHOULD have won, but did not. This film should be a part of every history-class in every school - but, how many schools' itineraries, today, include a class on history? Please read some of these other commentaries on \"Judgment at Nuremberg\" to get the full information about the film.

Perhaps the strongest point made by the movie is raised by Maximilian Schell as the defense attorney when he reads the majority opinion of the US Supreme Court written by Oliver Wendell Holmes in the Virginia eugenics decision where he justifies the sterilization of women, and it is rejected by the court. The justices at Nuremberg, both in reality and in the film, exercise the legal argument of tu tuque to reject the defense. (What we have done doesn't count - what you have done does count.) This is further exemplified many years later in the US military court's handling of the My Lai massacre in Viet Nam. We are left to ponder whether the Nuremberg trials advanced our humanity in the way we adjudicate war crimes or whether Hermann Goering was right when he said that all the trials proved was that the victors get to judge the vanquished.The performances given in the film are both powerful and moving.

Instead, he focuses on a lesser known, but historically-and philosophically even more interesting trial, the trial of the Nazi JUDGES.How was it that German judges-some of whom were, cultured, liberal, sensitive men, like the Burt Lancaster character-became collaborators with the Nazi regime? this film features fantastic performances by Tracy, Lancaster, Schell, Dietrich, Widmark, Clift, and even Judy Garland. This is an interesting film, because it is a film about Moral and political dilemmas. Each of the major characters faces a moral choice. Lancaster was a liberal Wiemar intellectual/Judge, who thought he could \"work with' the Nazis, and became corrupted by them. Dietrich plays the widow of a German general, who claims to have been a \"good\" German. Tracy plays an American judge, who is under political pressure to go easy on the Judges, and who is also fascinated by the Dietrich character. Widmark is the American prosecutor, a military officer who is under pressure from his superiors to \"let up\" in prosecuting the Germans( the cold war is getting underway,and the American high command does not want to antagonize a potential ally.).The most complex-and fascinating-character is played by Maximilian Schell,as Lancaster's brilliant, sometimes frighteningly. convincing, defense attorney. Clift and Garland play two victims of the Nazi \"legal system\". Underlying the whole narrative are two profound philosophical questions. 1.Is the law merely a set of commands by the sovereign, or should it reflect moral imperatives? 2. Why do liberal societies-like Weimar Germany-succumb to totalitarianism? In short, a very powerful, interesting film. I should add one comment in response to a previous reviewer.Let me say that even though I am a conservative-and a reluctant Bush voter-I am highly critical of many aspects of the current administrations policies.Still, to draw some sort of facile parallel between The Bush administration and the Hitler regime is more than an exercise in poor taste, it is absurd. Bush has many, many faults but he is no Nazi. The People who constantly make facile comparisons between modern America and the third Reich are utterly irresponsible.",

Rather it is about the aftermath, as the victors wrestled with the question of how far down the totem pole the burden of responsibility should or could extend.None of the defendants (all German Judges) ever murdered anyone with his own hand, nor did they participate, in any direct way, in the mass-murders of the Holocaust. They committed individual injustices against individual victims, like the labourer forcibly sterilised for failing and IQ test, or the young woman forced to testify against a dear friend, and so sending him to his death, under threat of herself being tried for complicity in his \"crime\". They authorised the sterilisations and passed death sentences under the unjust laws. Yet the laws had been duly enacted and they could no doubt have claimed like so many others o have been just \"obeying orders\", though unlike military personnel they had at least the option of resigning but chose not to.Maximilian Schell takes a good part as their defence counsel, correctly pointing out that sterilisation of the backward had been allowed even in some of the democracies, with he approval of as eminent a jurist as Oliver Wendell Holmes - an uncomfortable reminder that activities later stigmatised as \"nazi\" enjoyed an alarming degree of respectability until Hitler gave everyone a wake-up call by starkly illustrating where they could lead. But the savage way that he badgers a prosecution witness illustrates all too well the horrors he is trying to defend. It even provokes his most eminent client, Ernst Janning (Burt Lancaster) to get up and make a public confession and recantation. Janning is a famous jurist who stayed o under Hitler because (like some foreign observers) he believed that a stricken Germany had need of a \"strong man\" at the helm.And all of this takes place against the background of 1948, as the Berlin Blockade and imminent air lift is setting the stage for the Cold War. For many, the crimes of the Third Reich ae already \"old hat\" and the priority now should be enlisting the German people as allies. Spencer Tracy, as the senior judge, finds himself under increasing pressure to go easy on the defendants, as does the Prosecutor, (Richard Widmark).Tracy takes a great part as he wrestles with these questions, as well as more personal ones, and at the end he gets the most memorable line. When Janning begs him to believe that \"We ever knew it would come to that\" (presumably meaning the Holocaust) he curtly responds that it \"came to that'' with the first unjust death sentence which Janning handed down. Even had that been his *only* crime, it would, alone, have amply justified his sentence. Janning's words only serve to show that, despite his eloquent \"repentance\", he still hasn't really got the message. He still believes that had the Nazi regime been responsible only for six thousand deaths (or however many eggs he deemed acceptable to break in making is national \"omelette\", then his actions would have been excusable - that the end could perhaps have justified the means. Despite his recantation of them, the moral defect that led him into those actions is with him still. Prison is where the belongs, though as Schell presciently foresees, the politics of the day ensure that he doesn't stay there long.",

            "content": "After World War Two a number of trials were conducted in Nuremberg, Germany. International courts came together to judge Nazi war criminals. It was decided that Germans alone could not judge their own criminals and that the crimes of the Nazi regime were crimes against humanity itself.The most famous of these trials tried and sentenced 24 Nazi leaders in the years 1945 and -46. But there were a series of less famous trials, conducted mostly by Americans in the occupied West Germany, that aimed to judge and sentence Nazi judges, merchants and other influential figures that were seen to be at least partially responsible for the holocaust, for example. This movie is a fictive version of one of those trials.There are four accused judges. The prosecution is demanding life imprisonment for all of them. But the defense tries to argue on their behalf by saying that they could not have possible have known about the horrors of the concentration camps, among other things. The movie, through the trial, also discusses things such as following orders, loyalty to one's nation, one's homeland, the meaning and concept of justice, the slippery slope of lesser evils, and just what it took to survive under Hitler's rule.The movie was filmed some fifteen years after the war and thus I believe it had enough distance to look at the whole thing at least with something approaching objectivity. It acknowledges the political atmosphere in Germany after World War One, and also during the actual trial, at the brink of the Cold War. It is a heavy movie that forces you to think. And while it is passionate about its message and its take on the whole issue, it doesn't paint the situation as black-n-white. It acknowledges the complexity of the whole thing and preaches caution against something like it happening again. And for that it has my respect.One of those movies I wish was shown more often on TV. Or in schools. Because we should remember what it was like back then, during the days of our parents and grandparents. If only so we don't end up making the same mistakes all over again.",

The emotions of the participants portrayed by very powerful performances clearly show that there are no clear cut, black and white issues when it comes to a war fought in the name of nationalism. Watching this film, I wonder if any lessons have been learned, and are we doomed to repeat mistakes made in the past by people \"defending our way of life\". No easy answers here.

As with every other movie these two American icons have ever made, they are both impeccable in this classic as well.Although this movie is 'very loosely based upon' the post-World War II Nuremberg Trails; and, doesn't mention real (names of) judges, lawyers, and/or, Nazi defendants (all characters are fictitious, although, the crimes are not) - this is still a great cinematic achievement starring miracle-working actors.William Shatner (Captain Kirk from \"Star Trek TOS\" (1966), before he was Captain Kirk), is in this; as is Werner Klemperer (Colonel Klink from \"Hogan's Heroes\" (1965) before he was Colonel Klink - and, he's 'not funny' in this movie). Other greats are Richard Widmark, Marlene Dietrich, and, Maximilian Schell, whom need no introduction at all; Judy Garland from \"The Wizard Of Oz;\" Montgomery Clift from \"From Here To Eternity\" (where he also starred with Burt Lancaster); as well as great character actors like Ray Teal (the sheriff from \"Bonanza\"); and, Karl Swenson (\"The Birds\" and \"Little House on the Prairie\").Another noted detail of this movie is the highly-versatile director, Stanley Kramer. Can anyone believe that he directed Spencer Tracy in this 'very serious' movie in 1961; then, two years later, directed Tracy in the 'very funny' \"It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World\" in 1963; then, again, in the highly-popular and controversial \"Guess Who's Coming To Dinner\" in 1967 (Spencer Tracy's last movie)!?!?

It is a work of art that sadly depicts that although we've come far as a world in so many respects, we've barely moved in others.

            "content": "I am not a Historian so I really can't comment on the historical content of this film in terms of accuracy or details, but I can say that it is a terrifically involving courtroom drama, and easily watchable despite it's 3 hour running time.Spencer Tracy plays the small-town American judge assigned to the trial of several important German judges and lawmen in Nuremberg a few years after the Allied victory in World War II. It's a perfectly judged performance of a man of great experience and wisdom, who is genuinely open to all arguments and only wants the truth. The other performances are a little more mannered with both Maximillian Schnell and Montgomery Clift slipping to melodrama occasionally.For the most part, both sides of the coin are very fairly represented as the defence and prosecution attorneys argue their cases. The atrocities and horrors of Hitler's regime are shown in newsreel footage, but the voice of the everyday German people is also represented in the various characters Judge Hayward encounters outside of the courtroom. The film allows for much intelligent discussions investigating the conflict between social conditions and pressures, and the personal morality of the Judges who signed orders on the execution of innocent Jews and the sterilisation of unwanted members of society.Unfortunately I found the film to be let down by a nagging sense of great self-importance. The big speeches are all delivered as if they were the last words ever to be uttered, which I found became tiresome. Although largely the film presents both sides of the argument strongly, I found the final important moment of the film a let down, as Judge Haywood has the last, critical word against Dr Janning. Understandably given it's makers, the film does ultimately bias itself firmly with the American view on proceedings and the aforementioned self-important tone goes a bit far in this respect. Technically the film alternates between some fine deep-focus cinematography by Ernest Laszlo and some effective, if dated and slightly clumsy, crash zooms and editing techniques at particularly dramatic moments.Despite these few misgivings which don't quite allow me to rate the film at quite the level it seems to aspire to, it's still an engrossing, perfectly paced courtroom film with great performances and some highly intelligent discussions on war, government, leaders and society that still resonate in today's climate.",

The message of the film helps to weigh the circumstances of the human side and the consequences of the Nazi regime, but with the duration of 3 hours, after a while it becomes tedious. On the other hand the performances are very good and all are delivered with vigor to their characters, which always helps to maintain interest.

This movie, however, presents a different slant. Here it is the defense that is outraged, and with good reason. Did the defendants actually break any laws? After all, were they not respected judges? Is somebody to be found guilty for being a mere hack? And what right did the court have to try these judges anyway? Okay, the judges may have been Nazis, but was being a Nazi a crime? Indeed, was the trial itself a sham? Montgomery Clift and Judy Garland give powerful performances as victims of Nazi persecution, yet was their testimony sufficient to establish guilt, and of what? This is one of the most powerful movies Hollywood as ever produced. It explores themes that warrant close attention and pulls no punches in presenting issues that deal with such fundamental concepts as right-and-wrong, responsibility, culpability and expediency.",

            "content": "Screenwriter Abby Mann and actor Richard Widmark died within a day of each other just this past week, which makes a revisit with this eminently powerful 1961 courtroom drama all the more appropriate. At an epic-length 186 minutes, the movie is a fictionalized account of one of the many trials held after WWII before the U.S. Nuremberg Military Tribunal, this one the 1948 trial of four Nazi judges who used their power to enable the Third Reich to conduct experiments upon Jewish prisoners, and had accountability for murder, brutalities, torture, and other atrocities directed toward the Jews. Directed by Stanley Kramer (\"The Defiant Ones\", \"Guess Who's Coming to Dinner\"), the king of socially conscious cinema in the late fifties and sixties, the film digs deeply into the ethics of assigning war crimes responsibility to individuals.The heavyweight cast is the primary draw here. With his quiet authority, Spencer Tracy plays Chief Judge Dan Haywood who has the unenviable task of presiding over the tribunal. For the prosecution is attorney Col. Tad Lawson, who shows actual footage from the devastating remains of the German concentration camps when they were liberated. Widmark plays Lawson with equal parts grit and petulance. Defense attorney Hans Rolfe is portrayed by a young Maximilian Schell in a volcanic performance as his character raises valid questions on the degree of the defendants' accountability. As the trial moves along, two key episodes dominate the proceedings with two icons playing near-cameo roles. A fidgety Montgomery Clift plays a mentally unstable victim of Nazi sterility measures, and a downcast Judy Garland is an Aryan hausfrau accused of having sexual relations with a Jew, a crime punishable by death for the Jew guilty of \"racial pollution\". Kramer draws out brilliant turns on the stand by both actors.Burt Lancaster plays Ernst Janning, the only one Among the four defendants who shows a trace of a conscience given his aristocratic background and known early resistance to the Third Reich. Even with aging make-up, the strapping actor appears physically wrong for the mostly passive role, but he manages to deliver his final testimony with knowing conviction. One of the other judges is a surprisingly vituperative Werner Klemperer memorable later as the befuddled Col. Klink on TV's \"Hogan's Heroes\", and also in the supporting cast is a young William Shatner, well before \"Star Trek\", as Haywood's aide. The legendary Marlene Dietrich plays a somewhat ancillary role as German widow Frau Bertholt, whose husband was put to death by Haywood for war crimes. In their key scene together, she and Tracy provide the film's most humane moments amid the unrelenting tension of the trial.Mann's script is superbly drawn out even if Kramer's ponderous direction can get a bit sluggish at times. The extras on the 2004 DVD are most worthwhile. First up is a twenty-minute conversation between Mann and Schell (\"In Conversation with Abby Mann and Maximilian Schell\"), where they talk extensively about not only the film but also the earlier \"Playhouse 90\" TV version and the 2001 Broadway production (in which Schell played Janning). There are two other shorts \u0096 a six-minute dissection of the script by Mann (\"The Value of a Single Human Being\") and a 14-minute featurette about Kramer consisting primarily of interviews with his widow Karen (\"A Tribute to Stanley Kramer\"). There is also a photo gallery and the original theatrical trailer. I wish the DVD included the original TV version, but this is a superb telling of a most devastating episode in mankind's recent history.",

            "content": "An American judge hears the cases of German judges who collaborated with Hitler. The cases are pretty simple except for one of Janning's. Janning is known for his love for justice and has written books on the same topic which is read as text books by the lawyers in Europe. Janning became a part of Hitler mafia unwillingly because he thought that things will get over soon but as things grew thicker he found himself more engaged and guilty. Rest of the cases are simple and doesn't need great imagination to be termed as Hitler's accomplices. A judge, a convict, a prosecuting lawyer and a defendant lawyer are the main characters of the film. Judgement at Nuxemberg talks about a lot of things other than of course patting America's back for bringing Hitler to his knees.Lots of arguments are extremely relevant and interesting. What's more interesting than a courtrooms drama? JAN is almost as good as 'Inherit the Wind' except for last five minutes. It would have a fantastic film if Janning was not shown begging for sympathy from all white American judge Dan Haywood. It just killed my admiration for the film. Rest of the film is just remarkable. It was nice to see Hans Rolfe talking about Hiroshima and Nagasaki with Janning trying to convince him that America has no right whatsoever to give anyone a guilt trip. That was I think the most powerful and relevant scene. I think I gave 8 for that particular dialog otherwise rest of the film is more-less a propaganda. JAN got 2 very well deserving Oscars. Maximillian Schell was just mind blowing one of the few performances like Vincent D'Onofrio in Full Metal Jacket, JAmes Stewart in 'Mr Smith goes to Washington' etc. Rest of the cast is just as good as it gets. I think its a fine film provided you know about Americans spirit (saying something else and doing something else) and you can laugh it off when they seriously try to fool rest of the world. 8/10.",

            "review_title": "Nuremberg trial and the impossibility of not taking sides",
            "content": "The feature film Judgment at Nuremberg (Stanley Kramer, 1961) can be considered one of the best historical dramas about court trials - perhaps the most satisfactorily produced in favor of such aspect. Soon, being set in 1948, the film wins with primacy the demonstration of personal pretensions of each character presented during the film in a direct correlation with what was happening at the time, that is, the development of the proceedings against four judges accused of committing war crimes during the Nazi Regime (Third Reich).From the above, it is undeniable to state that Abby mann's script and the weighty cast are the two crucial points in the achievement of the beautifully developed interrelationship between the terrible facts leading up to the trial, their effects on the German and world population, and the reverberation of the consequences of the jury's results for the nations as a whole. In this way, each scene was certainly constructed for each of the characters to externalize their opinions and, rather, their judgments about the role of the German people in the Holocaust.In general, as for the cast, I leave here my admiration to the austrian actor Maximilian Schell, responsible for constantly playing the defense attorney Has Rolfe. Moreover, the magnificent conduct of the trial was magnified by both him and the actors Spencer Tracy (Dan Haywood), which delivers a magnanimous and perceptibly tired U.S. judge, Tad Lawson (Richard Widmark), which is dedicated to transmitting an american lawyer simultaneously immersed and inexorable in his ideals, Rudoph Petersen (Montgomery Clift), responsible for delivering a defense witness notably disturbed by the horrors experienced and Burt Lancaster (Dr. Ernst Janning), giving life to a bitter and melancholic german judge, in addition to actresses Judy Garland (Irene Hoffman), in charge of the second witness of the case, doing this with dexterity to give himself to the transmission of a resilient woman and still haunted by what experienced and Marlene Dietrich (Madame Bertholt), tasked with granting a haughty and gullible widow in a better Germany.Having said that, I cannot neglect the way in which the long guide the viewer, transforming him into an inert being on both sides of the defense in the step that calls him to make a choice, being presented amid the dichotomy of the courts, that is, to consider guilty or innocent those who are being judged. It is in this way that the plot convinces us that the prosecution is correct as it captivates us, however, in taking the defense's statements for truth. So here is the Judgment at Nuremberg trial as a scar tester - forgive the euphemism - of the tragedy of the Holocaust, rspecially in the film's most striking scene, which shows actual scenes of the concentration camps where more than six million jews were massacred.Finally, the Judgment at Nuremberg trial promotes what can be described as the excellence of the representation of human rights on the screen. Furthermore, the reflections that germinate ina highly rich character development, especially with regard to the positioning of the camera that neely approaches the viewer ina profile image of the characters, bring with them the following question: Are we humans trying desperately to pretend not to know about the social ills that crop up around us, just as the germans depicted in the film readily claim to have no knowledge of what was happening to the jews? Moreover, should we be judged by such a vague perception of the suffering of \"others \"?G.E.C.A.FE - GRUPO DE ESTUDOS DE CINEMA, ARTE E FENOMENOLOGIA (STUDY GROUP CINEMA, ART AND PHENOMENOLOGY)",

            "content": "\"...The compassion for the present torture of his soul must not beget forgetfulness of the torture and death of millions.\" There are moments in history when humanity should stop for a while and reflect upon its destination: what aim have we taken up? Hatred and destruction or respect and development? There was no better moment for such reflections than the period when the hell on earth's swastika was at its downfall but everyone still suffered WWII's wretchedness of pride, monstrosity of ideologies and perishing respect for fundamental human dignity. What is there left if not the judgment for the sake of 'some justice?' The events at Nuremberg after the WWII have become a symbolic scale for justice, a symbolic inspiration for the theme of this movie written by Abby Mann and directed by Stanley Kramer... indeed as the tag-lines proclaimed it: \"an experience in human emotion.\" The movie can boast of unbelievable tension, unforgettable images (even shocking actual footage after the U.S. liberation of concentration camps), great camera work within the courtroom....you see the shots from different angles and the highlighted details of the drama. Finally, the movie is an example and the model for the flawless performances by all the cast, those very famous ones and those who were still inexperienced. Moreover, the cast with their performances bring out the unique psychology of the film's theme and characters, which makes the movie 'an experience in human emotion.'Burt Lancaster is breathtaking as Ernst Janning, one of the defendants whose change of heart may touch the very core of judges, may address the depth of human soul, yet justice must remain and the final verdict has its own, justification and its own logic. What Janning did with the innocent man affects everything that is being done upon him...Burt beautifully portrays the awakening conscience which seems to reveal much truth. He is the only one among four accused who is tormented by the torture of his soul. But, his character does not fully capture catharsis. Why? Is there any catharsis in the face of crimes against humanity? Is there such a thing like being 'justified' before humans, before victims? Wouldn't we mock the very nature of justice and, consequently, the civilization? Janning's catharsis is to come, perhaps; but it does not realize itself fully. Hard theme, indeed, where heart has to be replaced by the feeling of justice, the concept of justice and... that is what Spencer Tracy's character depicts. Mr Tracy does a terrific, breathtaking job as chief judge Dan Haywood who leads the tribunal. He walks the streets of Nuremberg to feel the glimpse of the past he is bound to judge; he travels to the families to get to know them and their motives; he gets to know a German woman who is 'no monster' but speaks of forgiveness; he is kind in his heart yet strict in his job. He understands... The flawless performance is also given by young Maximilian Schell whose character aims at leaving the German people a shred of dignity...His character is very sympathetic at certain moments and yet....we sometimes get angry with the way he questions certain witnesses but he is no fraud, he speaks with the power of the man who loves his nation, on behalf of those 'better' in the nation. I think that the best job done by Mr Schell is the moment of questioning Irene Wallner (Judy Garland) about the Feldenstein case based actually on the true 1942 Katzenberger Trial. Schell's character is memorably opposed by Richard Widmark's Col. Lawson who does not get into tricks of justification...who bravely sneers the 'myth': 'we did not know! We were forced!' But the actress everyone waits for, dreams to see is Marlene Dietrich, who, as a life long anti-Nazi heroine, was proud to take part in this historic movie. The 60 year old Marlene still filled with charm and charisma, a great portrayal of a German Madame Bertholt, who is a good German. Her scenes with Spencer Tracy are masterful. The moment she walks the streets of Nuremberg with the Judge who represents a good American for her is unforgettable. She understands that it is impossible to live on hate...and in order to go on living, we must forget. That is her message and her songs are not those glorifying the Third Reich nor the march but \"Lili Marleen.\" Ms Dietrich's first and last moment is marked by no words...just silence...just indication.But there is one character who needs a special note because he holds a certain depiction of undying evil. It is Emil Hahn played by Werner Klemperer. He still represents the Nazi man who can be characterized by two features: open sarcasm and vain pride. His pride does not allow him to look at the truth because he blindly follows the haunting voices of \"Mein Kampf\" and the ideology therein incorporated... His sarcasm makes him a very unsympathetic person but also allows him to think that he was in the hands of mighty group who were close to smashing all sheer toys, all the rest to gas chambers. He mocks everything that is not his: justice, love, goodness because those abstracts stand for weakness and sheer failure. \"Gott Mit Uns\" (God with us) appears to be his motto - a dangerously created god...Great film to see for the new generations that perceive the events in a different light, perhaps by a different lantern...Yet, such films are treasures and remind us of what may become of the world if people manipulate reason and allow themselves to be ruled by hateful ideologies.The lantern is still there though those people are gone... yet it waits for the meeting of people, mature people who stand there in forgiveness letting the Light not expire \"Wie Einst Lili Marleen.\" (like once Lilli Marleen)",

The self-righteous character in this movie, for me, was Richard Widmark's prosecutor.  Maybe it was because he had the easy job, (How hard was it going to be to convince everyone that these Nazi war criminals should be convicted?) but he was just too preachy for me.  I really couldn't stand him.  Apparently all Stanley Kramer dramas have some amount of preachiness to them, and it's there in here, all right.  But there are still great performances from Tracy, Burt Lancaster as one of the defendants, Montgomery Clift and Judy Garland as two of the witnesses, and Marlene Dietrich as a German woman who tries to convince Tracy \"that we're not all monsters.\"  As for Maximillian Schell, who plays the German lawyer defending the criminals and won the film's only acting Oscar, he's pretty good, too, but doesn't particularly stand out among such a great cast.  Yes, the film is overlong and has a few draggy, boring spots, but is also has several effective scenes, such as several testimonies of the witnesses and the scene showing (most of) the greusome details of the Holocaust.  That really does get to you, even with Widmark narrating.",

These include not only the finely etched performances of Dietrich and Schell, but also the deep irony that dogs a passionate prosecution of crimes that America itself committed then, and commits today; crimes to which America was indifferent in the shadow of the cold war.  Schell's invocation of Oliver Wendell Holmes for the defense should (but undoubtedly doesn't) give pause to the seemingly innumerable contemporary supporters of eugenics. It was my first exposure to the filmed records of Shoah (I was about 12 when I first saw the movie) and those images can never, I hope, be erased.  And yet, and yet--it is so dull, it is so cut to fit the formulae of Hollywood; and, as other commenters have pointed it, it has Tracy at his pompous predictable liberal worst, rehearsing Guess Who's Coming to Dinner.  His best scenes are as Dietrich's foil; the very best when he is the excuse for her commentary on Lili Marlene.This is painfully close to a great movie; its failure is especially sad because its subject calls for greatness.",

As well as this film featuring Spencer Tracy, Burt Lancaster, Richard Widmark, Marlene Dietrich, Judy Garland, Maximilian Schell, and Montgomery Clift all in superb performances. The film is loosely based on the 1948 Nuremberg trials which originally had 99 defendants but with this film only having four of five, the movie stars Spencer Tracy as Chief Judge Dan Haywood who presides on the case against the defendants Ernst Janning (played by Burt Lancaster), Emil Hahn (played by Werner Klemperer), Friedrich Hofstetter (played by Martin Brandt),and Werner Lampe (played by Torben Meyer). Abby Mann's very suspenseful screenplay is also a very intense one because we don't know whether the four defendants will be found guilty or not because of the reasons that the prosecution and the defense bring to the table all because of the rivaling performances from Richard Widmark (who played prosecutor Tad Lawso)n and Maximilian Schell (who played the defense attorney Hans Rolfe and ended up winning an Oscar for his performance), this is Kramer's absolute best film as a director and also one of 1961's 10 best films.",

            "content": "What could I possibly say in this meek review that does any justice to this amazing movie? Let's consider the cast to begin with: Spency Tracy, Burt Lancaster, Maximilian Schell, Montgomery Clift, Richard Widmark, Judy Garland, Marlene Dietrich. When was so much talent together in a single movie? Then there's the enormity of the plot: a movie about the Nuremberg trials of Nazis involved in war crimes. It's a testament to Stanely Kramer and Abby Mann that this movie rather than being a simple condemnation of evil by a victorious country over a conquered country, is a complex, challenging analysis of morality, responsibility, duty, and patriotism. In fact the movie is downright cynical in its presentation of justice.This marvelous courtroom drama follows Hans Rolfe (Schell) as the defense lawyer of four judges charged with collaborating with the Nazi regime in the perversion of justice for political reasons. Rolfe puts up an amazing defense, one that pulls no punches. As wonderfully as Schell plays him, there's something repulsive about Rolfe in his use of logic for saving his clients. One watches him in awe, wondering whether the passion he exhibits is genuine or not.His opponent is Colonel Tad Lawson, a man who witnessed the atrocities of the concentration camps and is personally committed to having the four judges sentenced. Richard Widmark plays him like a man possessed, driven by the horrors he witnessed and disgusted with the idea that they may yet walk free. The acme of his performance is when he describes a movie shown in court, depicting the horrors inside a concentration camp. His chilling voice is so filled with anger and sorrow, one believes Widmark was really there.Of the four defendants stands out Ernst Janning. Burt Lancaster plays him with restraint, in fact he barely speaks in the whole movie until he breaks it in one of the most dramatic moments of the movie and then gives one of the best speeches in the entire movie. For the most part he plays his role with his eyes, expressive and full of pain and remorse. How he (and Widmark) missed an Oscar nomination is beyond me.Spencer Tracy was nominated for Best Leading Actor, eventually losing to Schell for his passionate performance. Tracy doesn't seem to do much but that's his role as Judge Haywood; he's a mediator, the voice of reason and order when Rolfe and Lawson go over the top. His role is to show restraint, up until the end of the movie when he has to give out the sentence. Then he outperforms everyone in the movie.Great supporting actors waltz through this movie and leave amazing performances too. Two that can't be forgotten are by Montgomery Clift and Judy Garland. I'm not sure if I'd ever seen Clift in a movie before, but the few minutes he was in this movie held me in thrall. I was in awe of the way he used his voice, hands and whole body to show the psychological marks left on his character, an innocent German who was sterilized on grounds of being mentally retarded.Judy Garland, whom I knew only from The Wizard of Oz, plays Irene Hoffman, a woman who in her adolescence becomes indirectly responsible for the Nazis killing a Jewish man she had befriended. Her testimony and confrontation with Rolfe mark one of the high points of the movie.In fact I'd say this three-hour-long movie is one long series of high points. There were so many amazing moments in the movie I pretty much lost count. It makes a good case of questioning the role ordinary Germans had in the Nazi atrocities, but also shows how easy it was to sympathies with an ideology that promised to save a country in ruins. More importantly, it's a chilling portrayal of what Hannah Arendt called the banality of evil - Eichmann, the subject of her book is ever mentioned in the a disturbing scene in which a man in charge of a concentration camp explains in a very casual way how easy it was to burn thousands of victims in ovens. As Judge Haywood says, what makes the four men on trial special is that they weren't maniacs or sadists, but ordinary men. This movie was quite ahead of its time, when we think that Hollywood is always criticized for making simple good vs. evil stories. What makes this movie so incredible is that the defendants weren't evil, they were just people doing their job. Even today some movies would be afraid of being so honest.So Stanley Kramer and Abby Mann not only deserve credit for having made a superb movie, perfect in pretty much all its aspects, but also for making one of the most interesting studies of the nature of evil in the history of cinema.",

His character is not a Nazi but a proud German who believes that Germany needs to move on from the past and these terrible atrocities which in his mind those truly responsible have already been tried in order to get back to where it once was.Burt Lancaster as one of the defendants finally cracks and gives a great speech firstly about getting caught up in the hysteria of Hitler and then how everybody either knew and turned a blind eye or if they didn't know it's because they didn't want to know.Then Schell who just looks like he has nothing left responds with a great speech about how the entire World knew what Hitler was all about long before the war and nobody did anything.",

The decision to shoot the film in black and white adds to the impression of absolute authenticity. Very, very few motion pictures can even approach this movie's quality.

Maximilian Schell is brilliant as the German defense attorney. Spencer Tracy, Montgomery Clift, Marlene Dietrich, Burt Lancaster, Richard Widmark, Werner Klemperer, et al give extremely competent performances. 10 stars!",

The trial accounted for most of the film, but many of the most intense and exciting confrontations occurred outside the court. There are many elements in this world. Although I am not willing to admit it or believe it, sometimes you have to compromise for reality and make sacrifices. When the American judge listened to the consideration of his colleagues and looked at the German judge outside the window, he found that the one outside the window was the same fellow who cherished his sympathy. He had the same justice execution ideals and the same cynicism. It is a pity that not all questions have an accurate answer. From the perspective of hindsight, everyone can become a saint. This is a ridiculous world. Justice is at most a pursuit and never a state, not a second, because this world is not black and white, or either. One judge goes to judge another, and looks at the world from the standpoint of another person. This is the virtue of man, because the world is full of people's evaluation and judgment of others, but no one comes from the future. Comprehension and love are the solutions of this world, not the answers. The trial is just a conclusion, not justice, and the answer to justice does not exist. After receiving the harsh verdict, the German judge realized that he was trying himself, so in the end he thought that he had received a fair trial and asked to meet with the American judge. Here is the last sentence the American judge said to the German judge, It is not only the concentration of the whole film, but also the most subtle turning point.",

            "content": "This film shows all the grey in life, and how it truly is almost never black and white. This movie shows the sickening display of people that we are suppose to respect, trust and show a high regard towards, but it also proves that it's a mean and deceptive world, but what can make it right is you, the individual, you have the control to do what's right because it is right. A fantastically acted movie, so many things going on here, but I'll just point out one, the true irony of the fact that the American Judges are judging the German Judges on Trial. Now, there's so much grey going on with the judging of the German Judges and whether the German judges cause was just or not. But Spencer Tracy's character brings up a great and universal point about Criminal Law, and what that definition means universally, whether you're going off of orders or not. And I think we can all agree with what Tracy's character says there about Criminal Law. But the fact that the U.S. Higher Ups start to give the American Judges and the American Lawyers a tough time about finding the German Judges guilty or not, because the U.S. now needs the Germans as America's allies against the Russians, is the true irony. The American judges almost become exactly like the German Judges, just in different circumstances. But Tracy's character stood up for the injustice, and he stood up for the true morals and values of not just the United States, but for mankind and for what he, the individual, believed was right. Tracy's character was the best of them all because he had true moral fiber, and remembered what 'life, liberty and justice for all' really meant. That's why Lancaster's character had such deep respect for Tracy's character at the end of the film. A great movie to see, but not a good movie for viewers who only look and see things as black and white because there will be very many good points on both sides during the duration of this film. So it's good to have an open mind when viewing this one. I'll end this review with a quote from Tracy's character in the movie(a quote of a few great quotes from Tracy's character in the film). \"...It's what it stands for, when standing for something is the most difficult! Before the people of the world - let it now be noted in our decision here that this is what we stand for: justice, truth... and the value of a single human being!\"",

            "review_title": "It wasn't just Nazi Germany to blame.......it was the world! A cinematic triumph!",
            "content": "Since the Holocaust of World War II that was responsible for the deaths of more than 6 million Jews, there have been numerous films made for the purpose of showing and educating the world about the genocide, most powerful and famous of which being \"Schindler's List\" which captured the intense atmosphere of what it would have been like to be a Jew in those times. Its graphic imagery, its superb character development, its powerful symbolism and its epic true story shocked the world upon its release. It is THE definitive Holocaust film and a masterpiece beyond all proportions. Long before \"Schindler's List\" however, there was a film that was just as controversial, a film that didn't so much emphasize on the struggle of the Jews during the holocaust, but more so on the war criminals who butchered them close to extinction and the trials that sent them for life imprisonment. But unlike a lot of films regarding this era, this court room drama didn't just pin it on the Nazis, but questioned the world about the tragedy. It turns out, that the three hours \"Judgment At Nuremberg\" ran for were some of the most engaging, hair-raising and heart-wrenching experiences of my life.In the final stages of the Nuremberg trials, four men stand for trial surrounding their crimes against humanity - particularly based around the Nuremberg laws in which people were being sterilized to prevent them from continuing their blood line and where people were sent to their deaths for having sexual relations with anyone other than Aryans. Most of the controversy lies around Dr. Ernst Janning, a pioneer in the study of law and a humanitarian who dedicated his life to justice, who gave the executive decisions to send the people to their graves. The film starts as an evidence based trial with its witnesses and official documents, but becomes a moral play for the audience.The film may have cost a tenth of the budget of \"Schindler's List\". Most of it is in a court room, but you will witness here a film that can manifest visuals more powerful than any you've ever seen before just from the dialog that is spoken. It is in a court room, but your mind is not. The questions of humanity seep through like a torrent of raging bulls.It's brilliant, haunting and inspiring. Like \"Schindler's List\", black and white photography was crucial for creating a feel of the time on which it was based. Perfect casting enabled the intense drama to take its toll.Maximilian Schell as defense attorney for the war criminals and Burt Lancaster as Ernst Janning give the performances of their careers. Everybody in the cast, including Spencer Tracy as the 'Justice', Richard Widmark as the prosecutor determined to find it and Marlene Dietrich as an emotionally tough widow gave their all. The chemistry in the court room is combustion at its best. Everybody has a commanding presence. You feel like you're there! Little music was played throughout, but what was played was there to enhance the authentic German surroundings. What particularly impressed me was a scene where Spencer Tracy walks the streets of Nuremberg and find his way around the Roman inspired 'Luitpoldhain', the famous venue for a lot of Hitler's rallies. As Tracy admires the Roman Architecture, he then looks at the balcony from where Hitler once stood to yell out his nationalist and genocidal speeches and imagines what it must have felt like, a sample of one of his speeches is played in the background and we imagine how powerful this man must have been - he was an emperor and a very sick man. The most surprising and mind boggling aspect of the film was the use of real footage from the concentration camps to which the Jews were sent. For the time in which the film was released, this must have been shockingly controversial.While most of the film surrounds the conviction of the war criminals, the film also points its finger at its audience. WE ARE ALL RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT OCCURRED. I totally agree, and the film makes strong emphasis on this towards the end. Whilst the war criminals were directly responsible for sending the Jews to their deaths, we are nevertheless responsible for letting it happen. The new generation may not be responsible for what happened 60+ years ago, but it's responsible for what's currently happening in the world. \"Judgement at Nuremberg\" is a film not only about the holocaust. It is universal and is just as relevant today as it always was. That's the power of the film - that it makes you think.It is a perfect companion to \"Schindler's List\" and a true classic.With an all-star cast, colossal performances, a mesmerizing script and a great story, this is one tour-de-force you can't miss. Thank you Stanley Kramer for this triumph of cinema!",

After all, I was every bit of 8 years old at the end of that decade. But having watched Nuremberg I say unabashedly that the art of film has not risen since.OK. By today's standards, if not those of 1961, Nuremberg's morality was too obvious. Its acting too good. Its actors too fragile (Montgomery Clift and Judy Garland, both past their careers and very near the end of their lives... embarrassingly tragic.) But then that's really the point isn't it? At least for me it is. I mean, as human beings, what is it that we survive for? To what true purpose? To what great end? I was taught: for the advancement of our species -- for its highest principals and noblest aspirations.So how does torturing human beings, simply because, given the opportunity, they would torture and behead us, fit this model of Western idealism?

I am not the biggest Tracy fan but here he is perfect. As are allother actors with one exception. Richard Widmark the prosecutoris absolutely believable in his crusade. Marlene Dietrich, finallyshowing some signs of age, represents the proud, art-loving\"good` and noble German. In one of the most beautiful subtleromances on screen she and Tracy are strangely attracted to eachother. She is trying to convince Tracy that not all Germans were evil, thatnot all Germans even knew what was going on. She is very goodin it, probably believing herself even so far as to think that her latehusband,  who was a General (put to death by Widmark) wascompletely innocent. Tracy seems moved but in the end isunconvinced. Great the beer-drinking-song scene where the uglyGermans in the background seem to contradict Marlene's words.In an exceptionally great scene when Tracy is about to leave thecountry he calls her. The telephone rings again and again then thecamera moves and you see Marlene sitting just in front of it - justbeautifully filmed. Montgomery Clift is amazing. As a witness of the practice ofsterilization he easily wins our sympathies, especially by admittingthat he was not interested in knowing the birthday of Hitler. Butthings are not quite as simple. He is slow-witted and MaximilianSchell must cruelly demonstrate this. Schell won the Oscar for this role, and as the saying goes, welldeservedly so. He is arguing forcefully and yet humanely. Verynice, the way he puts his forefinger in front of his lips, seeming tosay I have thought about this thoroughly - trust me.  In one scenehe reads a passage from a law book that argues in favour ofsterilization with the conclusion `Three generations of imbecilesare enough'. It sounds like cruel Nazi jargon but was actuallywritten by Oliver Wendell Holmes and was the basis for law inVirginia. (Here is a bizarre coincidence: when I went to bed afterwatching the movie I took up the book I am reading right nowwhich is `The Flamingo Smile' by Stephen Jay Gould. The verynext chapter I was starting to read was about sterilization practiceand exactly the same passage by Holmes was quoted! Gouldinvestigated in the case of the woman who was sterilized by thislaw because she was imbecile and the daughter of an imbecileand mother of an imbecile, thus three generations. He found outthat her daughter - diagnosed to be imbecile at age 8 months(!)turned out to be an at least average pupil at school.)Now, the exception I was talking about, was Burt Lancaster. He allbut ruins the film. It is not entirely his fault since the role was verybad. All he has to do is sitting there stone-faced watching the trial.He is supposed to be the tragic character who is the noble goodguy who by accident became a Nazi judge. Then at one point ashis lawyer `goes to far' he makes his statement, saying that hewas indeed guilty. Unbearably bad lines badly performed. The film has been criticized as being preachy, and it is true tosome extent. But I have no idea how it could have been avoided.Lancaster's part is absolutely crucial. (I just could not stand it). Atleast in the final scene, when Lancaster expected to morallypardoned by his judge, Tracy tells him that the number ofinjustices or murders are not the point but that one knowinglyspoken unjust judgment for whatever reasons is enough to sellyour soul. And that is the point. As he himself has demonstratedwith his judgment. Under political pressure (because of Cold War)he still puts the judges to jail for life. It is all about integrity. Eventhough all were released within a couple of years, his judgmentstays. &#0;",

While most of the convicted are partisans, Ernst Janning is a highly-educated and revered man who had no choice but to approve the bills as stated by the law and pleads 'Guilty' while the other men plead clemency.

So not only is this movie a classic, I would rank it among one of the best films I have ever seen. This movie has twists and turns like a suspense thriller, but is very subtle in those twists and turns, they are neither obvious nor are they possibly even intentional. This film is brilliantly written, it is brilliantly acted, was wonderfully cast, and directed by a master. This film is both unflinching at times, and surprising at other times. These surprises aren't typical surprises in the traditional sense, these are the twists and turns you feel. Every moment you feel is building to some sort of sympathy by the head Judge played by Spencer Tracey for the German's particularly one of the defendants played stoically by Burt Lancaster, but he is pragmatic and unforgiving without being angry or vengeful in the end. I personally think his performance was better than Maximilian Schell's, which garnered him a well deserved Oscar. In addition to these brilliant roles, there are strong roles played by Marlene Dietrich, Judy Garland, and Richard Widmark. Additionally, there were roles performed by iconic characters of the small screen, by Captain Kirk in one of his first film roles, and Colonel Klink from \"Hogan's Heroes\" (Werner Klemperer). So basically this movie is moving, surprising, exquisitely acted, wonderfully written, perfectly cast, classic in every sense of the word, and award winning. So yeah I think it is one of the best films of all time, even if you don't agree with that sentiment, I would be surprised if you watch this film and don't love it. if you like concise reviews of interesting films please read my other reviews at http://raouldukeatthemovies.blogspot.com/",

We can not truly be sure what is happening in Iraq until the damage is done.Every actor in the ensemble is stunning. Truly stunning. In just a scant amount of screen time, Dietrich, Garland and Clift give the performances of their careers.When Schell presents his reaction to the showing of the films, I can only imagine how he, as an actor is truly defending himself as a German. I wonder if it was painful for he and Dietrich to play these roles. Hitler made victims of everyone. The guilty and the innocent.

            "content": "Judgment at Nuremberg is a 1961 film directed by Stanley Kramer and starring Spencer Tray, Burt Lancaster, Richard Widmark, Marlene Dietrich and Maximilian Schell. Based on the homonymous novel by Abby Mann, which is based on true events, it portrays the events following the World War II in Germany, focusing on the trial of four Nazi judges by an American courtroom.Much can be said about the technical work and the acting of this movie: Kramer's camera work explores the confined space of the court (stage to 90% of the movie), managing the plot development in a masterful way. His way of solving the language issue of the plot may look strange at first but it gradually turns into the most natural and simple option. As a whole, the brilliant direction places the viewer directly into the courtroom. Once there, one of the strongest casts in the history of Hollywood does the rest. There is no less-shining star on this brightful constellation, one can almost feel that every actor realized the genius of the script they had in their hands and gave it a life that a thousand of years of cinema won't surpass!And this takes us to the writing. To tell you about how much the whole premise and the writing meant to me I have to tell an episode from my own life: Last year I had the opportunity to visit Anne Frank's House in Amsterdam. After 2 hours of waiting under a cold rain to enter the house, I finally started what would become one of the most terrifying and unforgettable experiences I ever had. I left completely overwhelmed by the whole atmosphere inside those walls, practically bursting in tears and I had to walk for hours to ease my mind. I still have a poster with Anne's face on the wall of my room - so I won't forget it. This movie made all those memories come back. Made me have to pause a lot of times to take a deep breath, made me want to scream of frustration and of hate for all that made so many deaths possible. I have to think really hard if I want to think of any movie better written than this one, and being me a huge fan of great scripts, that says a lot. This is what cinema is all about, in my opinion - create situations and atmospheres that resonate inside oneself like as if they were real. I am not German nor Jew. I wasn't born when World War II took place. My country didn't take part in it. But I felt like I was ageless and countryless. I felt like all mankind should feel about what happened in Europe during the Third Reich. The fact that the Europe is slowly going in that direction again is as frightening as is infuriating. Another reason this masterpiece should be exhibited world-wide \u2013 so they won't forget.Thank you Stanley Kramer",

            "content": "In the finest tradition of great courtroom dramas, this qualitative movie occupies a paramount position. This fictionalized trial is based on the real trials against Nazis, which took place in various parts of Europe, soon after World War II. The trial circumstances are extremely delicate. The four accused did not commit any crime, nor were they a part of the upper-echelons of power. They were in fact judges, middlemen; just assigned for the task that Hitler desired them to do.In this boiling situation, American Judge, Dan Haywood (Spencer Tracey), reaches Germany to lead a tribunal to determine their fate. While the whole world is watching the trial with bewildering raw emotions, he must confront his own notions of good and bad, right and wrong. Col. Tad Lawson (Richard Widmark), prosecution attorney, places his convincing arguments, by showing sorrowful holocaust visuals. The equally salubrious Hans Rolfe (Maximilian Schell), a defense attorney, appears on behalf of accused, with his emotionally touching arguments.As the arguments cross, phase-by-phase, the on-lookers on the dais are shell-shocked about their upsetting past. Above all, the prosecution witness Rudolph Petersen (Montgomery Clift) and defendant judge Dr. Ernst Janning's (Burt Lancaster) emotive testimonies makes it a difficult task for the judges, who are already overwhelmed by the proceedings.On the other hand, the Cold War is heating up and no one wants any more trials and everybody wants to forget the past. But, whether that's the right thing to do, is the question that the tribunal must decide\u0085 Nominated for 11 Categories, the movie won 2 Oscars and 2 Golden Globes out of 3 nominations.They say big actors need big theaters to showcase their fullest potential. Undeniably, this is one such stage and the artistes too excel. The Nuremberg trials were the first war crime trials in modern history, and later they were published as blue series, green series and red series, by the US.A scene, where Spencer Tracey walks in the ruined city and at one place visualizes the Hitler's speech, is a master touch. Abby Mann's script was built upon no ostentatious word play, but sensitively constructed evocative arguments. The effective black and white photography and highly rated set pieces are the other factors that make this an eternal classic.This seminal work of the master craftsman gives hope to the marginalized people, who are suppressed, oppressed and therefore depressed.",

            "content": "I did not think much of Kramer's previous courtroom drama, \"Inherit the Wind\" which also starred Spencer Tracy. But the mere premise and ensemble starcast of \"Judgment at Nuremberg\" was reason enough to rent this film and give it a shot.Inspired by true events, this fictionalized account of the trials stars Spencer Tracy as Judge Dan Haywood who is supposed to give judgement in the trial of four Nazi judges who have been charged with crimes against humanity. They have been accused of twisting the law during the Nazi regime and helping the government to put away some socially undesirable individuals and also advocating and permitting the forceful sexual sterilization of some others. One of these judges is Ernst Janning, played by a sad-faced and silent Burt Lancaster, who has once been a much respected figure in the ministry of justice. Books published by him, still being used in some universities, Judge Haywood is baffled about how a man who values justice so much, can be responsible for such heinous acts of brutality.What follows is a gripping courtroom battle of wits between the prosecuting attorney, Col. Lawson (Richard Widmark) and Hans Rolfe (Maximilian Schell). Amidst all this courtroom chaos, Judge Haywood himself has some experiences of his own, when he is not sitting on the judge's chair, getting acquainted with German people who have lived to see the ghastly past of the Nazi regime, yet seem to be completely oblivious to most of the details, including the holocaust.Stanley Kramer does a great job of directing this film written by Abby Mann. Ernst Gold's original music nicely complements some other German traditional music used in this film, particularly the group singing in bars.The performances: Great..all of them. Special mention, though, about: Spencer Tracy: Excellent as Judge Haywood who is clearly taken aback on how some of the \"good\" Germans he has come to be acquainted with in his short stay can claim to not have any knowledge about the war crimes and holocaust in the Nazi regime.Burt Lancaster: Wonderful portrayal of the sad-eyed Dr. Ernst Janning full of regret for the acts he has been accused of committing.Marlene Dietrich: Great as the widow of a German soldier who was executed.Maximilian Schell: The most scene-stealing performance of them all. He gets some of the most powerful scenes to chew on and pulls it off brilliantly! Last but not the least, the \"single-scene stealers\" as I call them, these actors took my breath away in their very brief appearances: Judy Garland as Irene Hoffman and Montgomery Clift as Rudolf Petersen. Splendid performances, both of them! Academy Award nominations, well-deserved.This film runs more than three hours long, and may require some patience on part of the viewer for all the verbose courtroom proceedings. But once the \"Exit music\" starts playing, you know that you have just had the pleasure of viewing one of the most powerful courtroom films out there. This is also one of those films that will ensure that you have as much the same dilemma, about who to root for, as faced by some principal characters in this film! Recommended!",

As we ignore the cries of a suffering world be it the unwanted of Africa's war torn continent or the voiceless who find themselves but chess pieces in a power struggle over oil in the middle east or those who have no worth to a world which only finds worth in one's ability to consume, the simple truth that all of the world's ills and guilt can be found in the degeneration of a single human life is as sadly true today as it was when the world's first victim's cries went unheard by the \"decent\" who watched on in silent self satisfaction.Judy Garland's is a stunning portrayal of a victim whose voice speaks for all victims, her character's willingness to stand for the truth both in the past and to stand for the decency and innocence of a decent human being in the present is not only an example of courage but one of true gratitude to a person who extended to her, benevolence. Hers was a performance which has helped in its small way to make me a better person and to truly appreciate what a wonderful actress she truly was. The pain we see in her character is also her pain as a human being. Burt Lancaster's acceptance of responsibility for his crimes and Spencer Tracy's bottom line belief that while the world may all share in the guilt that was Hitler, in the end, it is each one of us who must give account for what we did in the face of evil.Today, as my voice remains silent in the face of so much despair, suffering and depravity, I must share in Janning's condemnation of his participation in what was Nazi Germany. My life has become excrement for having walked with them, for having known the truth and stood silent finding excuses in the face of the shadows of hate and greed which will one day consume the light I have basked in.The horrors of Nazi Germany continue to this day. Someone, somewhere is being beaten, killed, starved and oppressed for one or all of the things the good people of Nazi Germany found abhorrent in a human being. The fact that a movie such as this has 107 comments and Iron Man has too many to count, the fact the Hulk can be made twice in a decade and this film couldn't in today's America is a sad commentary and does not bode well for the fate of the world's dispossessed. Perhaps the best that can be done is to try to show this movie to our friends and loved ones and to in some small way try to make a difference. At the very least we can lift our voices with those who cry out from the present and the past and realize that we are not immune to scourges that made Judgment at Nuremberg necessary.",

My father and I often watched and commented on movies that delved deeply into character and ethical issues. It was his way of sharing and discussing his most fervent beliefs and values - and I did the same for 40 years of teaching: using film to augment literature and life issues.I was struck today by the fact, not terribly original of me to say so, that human beings who have surmounted periods of incredible destruction, sorrow, hatred, intolerance and devastation - like The Great Depression and World War II - seem now to me to be larger than life. I'm now in a Prayer Group that includes four ladies who range from 76-95. Conversations with them are flesh-and-blood history lessons.We have good actors and actresses today. But we do not have a Spencer Tracy, a Cary Grant, a Marlene Dietrich. Perhaps movies are the artistic repository not merely of art on film - but of a particular epoch, a particular ethos of a society or even of a civilization.I think it is that set of viewpoints that \"Judgement at Nuremberg\" managed to capture. It is a movie that each succeeding generation should view, consider, discuss and incorporate in their thinking.The film made me grateful that, in the 1930's in America, we did not have a figure like Adolf Hitler emerge to cause the \"fever\" and the \"disease\" that Jannings refers to in his long somber speech. But when I hear some of our leaders and would-be leaders telling Americans what they think we want to hear - instead of what we really need to hear -not quite so pleasant to be told to (a) live within your means (b) save and (c) invest - Add a potent mixture of intolerance,hatred, and especially rampant, pervasive fear - and where would America be? When power and winning surmount truth, the national cauldron, the crucible of politics, economics, education, all that we devote our lives to could curdle, fester and poison; and that process would be most terrifying and most dramatic in the minds of our youth, the Jungen Hitler turned into vicious tattle-tales spying on, ratting on and sending even their own parents to the gibbet or the concentration camp.The movie gave me a chill.

The film's masterstroke is setting up a delicate balance of characters whose backgrounds, perspectives, and guilt (even their own perception of their individual contributions to the war) are left shrouded in doubt - painted as real, but small indiscretions that contributed to a larger event that was only guided by a select few, like a house of cards or a champagne tower - before showing a devastating montage of true atrocities looming over the defendants and their excuses that is simply of a different magnitude, coming to bring it all crashing down in one fell swoop. Tracy's brow-beaten judge feels nuanced and well-realized, and Schell's award-winning take on the patriotic, pragmatic defense counsel is certainly vivid. That said, the slowly rotating camera whenever someone gives one of the film's many Oscar-baiting speeches is a bit much, and the final hour feels rather simplified that calls the film's entire direction in question, putting too explicit a justification for the action of Lancaster's Janning (and by extension, the entire German collaborator class).

            "content": "An engrossing courtroom drama for the ages!\n\nStanley Kramer's historical courtroom drama Judgment at Nuremberg (1961) is a poignant masterpiece of creative direction, brave writing, and daring performances from an all star cast! Kramer's direction features long held wide shots of the entire courtroom bearing witness to the difficult subject matter, devastating close-up shots for stirring emotional testimony, quick zoom in shots for dramatic emphasis, and mature slowly turning panning shots around a speaker to help hold the viewer's attention. For a film that's over 3 and a half hours, Judgment at Nuremberg barely feels like 2 hours.\n\nErnest Gold's music is magical only playing at very specific emotional moments or revealing cues to depict a certain American or German sentiment. Gold's score is highly effective and deeply affecting. I love Frederic Knudtson's stellar editing of splicing together real documentary Holocaust footage, post-war Germany's ruins, and the dramatic recreated courtroom drama. Judgment at Nuremberg feels swift and concise thanks to his editing. Ernest Lazslo's cinematography is fascinating as the courtroom always feels alive due to his moving camera placements, interesting viewpoints, and impressive tracking shots. Robert J. Schiffer's make-up is brilliant as several characters look older or specifically designed with subtle details that convince the viewer a certain actor is older.\n\nAbby Mann and Montgomery Clift's script is perhaps the greatest, most timeless, and utterly relevant screenplay ever written for film. Their words shake you to the core as you get every perspective with nuanced detail and honest viewpoints. The witnesses testify with shattering honesty and riveting emotion. The judges speak with clarity, earnestness, and dedication to justice like you desire judges to aspire to always maintain. The prosecutor delivers his evidence with swift justice and undeniable purpose. The defense holds steadfast to his principles and his client's innocence as far as they see it. All while Mann and Clift's writing demonstrates the genuine want of the German people to be perceived as innocent of knowledge or participation in The Holocaust. Judgment at Nuremberg asks the audience to imagine each perspective with an empathetic open mind and a realistic lens. Abby Mann and Montgomery Clift write Judgment at Nuremberg to convince every audience member that the Nazis were guilty of war crimes as well as crimes against humanity aided by a complicit, hateful public and an uncaring world.\n\nI have to commend Stanley Kramer for assembling one of the most apt casts of legendary actors and actresses ever to grace cinemas. Spencer Tracy is so humble, thoughtful, gripping, and entertaining as American Judge Dan Haywood, who is  designated to precede over The Nuremberg Trials with a fair hand and swift justice. Burt Lancaster starts out as the stoic sycophant named Ernst Janning, but breaks down in one of the poignant and breathtaking supporting performances you'll ever see. Judgment at Nuremberg is full of riveting side characters brought to life by great actors and actresses giving the film their full potential.\n\nFurthermore, Montgomery Clift is heartbreaking and tear-jerking as the simple witness Rudolph Petersen, who pours his heart out over the course of his cross-examination. Likewise, Judy Garland's witness Irene Hoffman Wallner will bring the tears as she expels all her character's pain out during her testimony. The use of real Holocaust footage will surely move you if these two character actors do not.\n\nBy the same note, Maximilian Schell arguably steals the show as German defense attorney Hans Rolfe. He passionately orates his client's side with a shocking zeal and ungodly lack of concern for the witnesses' feelings as he brutally cross-examines them. He is engaging, entertaining, and inspired in Judgment at Nuremberg. Schell earned his Best Actor Oscar several times over as he recites massive volumes of dialogue with a nuanced realism befitting a more senior actor. Maximilian Schell establishes himself at a first rate actor of the highest caliber just within Judgment at Nuremberg. Similarly, Marlene Dietrich is alluring in her charming charisma playing Mrs. Bertholt, while also disgusting the viewer as a remorseless liar making excuses for the countless Germans that stood by allowing Hitler's Germany to attain power. Dietrich's casting is intriguing as she was the greatest German actress of her era, playing a notable socialite and patriotic symbol, much like her own life. She is simply marvelous and unforgettable.\n\nOn the other hand, Richard Widmark goes full on prosecutor emboldened by the righteousness of his cause in sending Nazis to jail. His passionate opening speech and intense presentation of his evidence is all consuming as you can only look at him while he speaks. Would you believe Judgment at Nuremberg even boasts an early appearance from a young William Shatner with rare coherent delivery and striking charisma? Well it does as Stanley Kramer compiled many of the finest artists of his era for Judgment at Nuremberg.\n\nIn all, this film should be seen by all for its important messages and fine craftsmanship.",

            "content": "Stanley Kramer's \u2018message movies' tend to grate me with their puffed up self-importance, thinly drawn characters and belief that they are saying something novel but of the films he has made this is probably the most successful. This is largely due to the impressive ensemble cast he works with who make their characters appear vivid and full of life even when working with a subpar screenplay. Kramer's direction often gets in the way of the film as his showy camerawork and refusal to cut down certain scenes distract from the fascinating discussion of guilt in relation to war crimes and responsibility to the law. The film does earn it's Best Picture nomination as for a \u2018prestige' picture it achieves what it sets out to do.\n\nAmerican judge Dan Haywood, Spencer Tracy, is assigned to prosecute Nazi judges who committed war crimes during World War II. The main defendant in the case is respected German judge Ernst Janning, Burt Lancaster, who is represented by Hans Rolfe, Maximilian Schell, who wants to defend the actions of everyday Germans through his defense of Rolfe. Controversial issues are discussed as sterilization and sex between a Jewish man and a gentile woman are brought to light through the characters of Rudolph Peterson, Montgomery Clift, and Irene Hoffmann-Wallner, Judy Garland. Haywood is forced to examine his own morality as he becomes close to wealthy German widow Frau Bertholt, Marlene Dietrich, who claims that the majority of Germans were not aware of the atrocities that occurred under the Nazi regime. When Janning rebels against his lawyer and claims that he is guilty Haywood is pushed to have him imprisoned despite an impassioned plea from Rolfe.\n\nThere are several points in this film when it feels like a television production for the HISTORY channel and most of these come when Tracy steps away from the courtroom to purchase a hotdog or converse with the charming Ms. Dietrich. I understand that the film, which is based on a play, was trying to expand it's scope and go beyond feeling like a filmed play but these scenes seem utterly superfluous and add to the film's already bloated running time. This is not to say that Dietrich and Tracy are not wonderful together but they feel like they are part of an entirely different film, one that could be quite entertaining on it's own, that is not given enough time to develop on it's own merits. Kramer would have done better to eliminate this plotline entirely and focus on the courtroom drama where the heart of the story lies.\n\nSchell won an Academy Award for his portrayal of the morally conflicted Rolfe and he does give an impressive performance, managing to hold his own against legends such as Tracy, Lancaster and Clift. He is full of anger and bluster as many acclaimed performances were at the time but when negotiating with Lancaster he displays a softer side and his final plea to Tracy, asking him to visit Lancaster, is a touching moment. Lancaster brings a unique stoicism to his role as his famously \u2018cold' eyes reflect his character's tragic nature but when he does finally deliver one of many dramatic monologues in the film it feels like a cop out. One must accept that there will be big, dramatic, improbable speeches but it did get rather tiring after a couple hours seeing several thespians \"Capital A\" act their way through ten minutes worth of dialogue.\n\nTracy brings his usual gravitas to the role as we believe in him as an everyman with real concerns over whether he is doing the right thing. Widmark, in the least showy role, is surprisingly effective as his bland good looks and rigidity present him as a good foil for the more bombastic Schell. Clift chews the scenery in his one big scene and Garland fails to convince as Hoffmann, her tics and over the top style overwhelm the scenes. Clift and Garland's characters also seemed rather unnecessary as I would have preferred to have seen only one of them or had both of them cut out. Lancaster and Schell are the most interesting characters in the film and if all of the unnecessary star cameos were removed the film would be a great deal shorter and more impactful.",

On performance level, it holds up the expectation and delivers without flinching by great actors like Spencer Tracy, Maximilian Schell and Montgomery Clift. Judgement At Nuremberg remains true to its nature and loyal to the tone of the feature till the last frame which possibly is the only reason to encounter this experience for it lacks gripping screenplay, better editing and execution of a scene.",

            "content": "Judgment at Nuremberg is a masterclass in acting. There are so many strong performances here that singling out individuals could take paragraphs. I felt for each character and saw their point of view because they were all portrayed as realistic people with genuine motivations. While many of the German characters were played by American actors, I liked how they made the transition to English and just asked you to accept it without a lot of explanation. We get to experience the entire trial through the eyes of Spencer Tracy who is the chief judge presiding over the case. He takes in all the testimony as well as a lot of additional information he gathers from the people around him during the days of the trial. This allows us to walk through these events along with him.\n\nThe brilliance of the way Judgment at Nuremberg is structured is the fact that it lays out the case so you can see some validity to the argument of the defense. It\u0092s not easy when he\u0092s defending Nazis, but Maximilian Schell makes an impassioned plea that can almost sway the audience to mercy at least. They also use this film to show the political state of the world at that time, and the fact that there were legitimate reasons many people wanted these men to be found not guilty. It\u0092s a well-crafted film because it does all of this but it also forces the audience to view the horrible realities of the Holocaust. These scenes are awful, and made more uncomfortable because they used real footage of what actually happened in the concentration camps.\n\nI think what surprised me the most about Judgment at Nuremberg was that I never felt the length of the film. Ordinarily movies that are this long start to drag for me, but not this one. It flowed nicely and I never once lost interest. In fact, it strangely felt like they could have done more. This is so fascinating, and the moral questions it raises are so thought-provoking, I just want it investigated further. There was something about the end that felt abrupt and unsatisfying, almost as if the film ran out of gas. Perhaps it was the fact that I knew what the verdict would be since way back when I was in a history class. I anticipated the end, but I still think there could have been a more unique way to wrap things up. That being said, Judgment at Nuremberg is a strong film and it told a story that needed to be told, at just the right time for people to learn from it.",

            "content": "Outstanding film.  Star-studded with several fantastic performances.  Highly emotional given the subject matter, but presented in a very intelligent, balanced way.  I was struck at once by that, and by how well director Stanley Kramer gives us both sides of the argument - and avoids simply paying lip service to the defense of the German judges on trial.  Maximilian Schell is brilliant as the defense attorney, well worthy of his Oscar, and is forceful and compelling in his arguments.  There are also so many brilliant scenes.  Spencer Tracy walking in the empty arena where the Nazi rallies were held, with Kramer focusing on the dais from which Hitler spoke.  The testimony of Montgomery Clift and Judy Garland, both of whom are outstanding and should have gotten Oscars.  Burt Lancaster in the role of one of the German judges, the one tortured by his complicity, knowing he and others are guilty.  The devastating real film clips from the concentration camps, which are still spine tingling despite all we 'know' or have been exposed to.  Marlene Dietrich as the German general's wife, haunted but expressing the German viewpoint, one time while people are singing over drinks.  Her night stroll with Tracy, as she explains the words to one song, is touching.  It just seemed like there was just one powerhouse scene after another, and the film did not seem long at all at three hours.   Heck, you've even got Werner Klemperer and William Shatner before they would become Colonel Klink and Captain Kirk!  In this film, the acting, the script, and the direction are all brilliant, and in harmony with one another.\n\nAs for the trial itself, the defense argument was along these lines: they were judges (and therefore interpreters), not makers of law.  They didn't know about the atrocities in the concentration camps.  At least one of them saved or helped many by staying in their roles and doing the best they could under the heavy hand of the Third Reich.  They were patriots, saw improvement in the country when Hitler took power, but did not know how far he would go.  If you were going to convict these judges, you would have to convict many more Germans (and where would it stop?).  The Americans themselves practiced Eugenics and killed thousands and thousands of innocents at Hiroshima and Nagasaki.   The one small weakness I found was that the defense never makes the simple argument that these judges were forced to do what they did, just as countless others in Germany were, and would have been imprisoned or killed themselves had they not complied.  Anyone who's lived under a totalitarian regime may understand, or at least empathize. \n\n I'm not saying I bought into these arguments or that one should be an apologist to Nazis, but the fact that the film presented such a strong defense was thought provoking.  How fantastic is it that Spencer Tracy plays his character the way he does - simply pursuing the facts, and in a quiet, thoughtful way.  It's the best of humanity.  How heartbreaking is Burt Lancaster's character, admitting they knew, admitting their guilt, knowing that what happened was horrible and that they were wrong, and yet seeking Tracy's understanding in that scene in the jail cell at the end - intellectual to intellectual - and being rebuked.  Even a single life taken unjustly was wrong.  Had the Axis won the war, I don't know which Americans would have been on trial for war crimes for the fire bombings of Dresden and Tokyo, or for dropping the atomic bombs, but the film makes one think, even for a war when things were seemingly as black and white as they could ever be.  The particulars of this trial were fictionalized, but it's representative of what really occurred, and it transports you into events 70 years ago which seem so unreal today - and yet are so vitally important to understand, and remember.",

That is true of German wife who's husband was killed before this film started. \n\nI thought with the exception of the begging of the film where they had the translators speaking English for the Germans that the film is pretty boring for the most part on how the story was told. I think it needed more movement or cuts to be more interesting to be able to keep the audiences attention. \n\n\nThis film did not make sense what exactly the Germans were on trail until they presented the footage of Jewish concentration camps. Some of the statistics given in the film I was unaware of. \n\nI think that this film took far too long to get to the main point. It took almost half the movie before it got to seeing the footage of the Holocaust victims. \n\nI thought the ending of the film was interesting where they were all sentenced to life imprisonments by 1949. However by 1961 when this film was made none of the hundreds if German political prisoners were serving their life sentences. \n\nI also liked the perspectives given in the jail and by the rail staircase in prison at the end of this film. \n\nThis film brings up some interesting questions concerning doing their duty under Germany over the moral duty and where do you stand. The tuff questions. \n\nThis film also brings up how unaware the German people were of the Jewish Hollowcost. \n\nI think that this film should have been either been edited to be shorter or made into a short mini series. This film took a little over an hour to led up to what the purpose of the film was. I liked the opening and the last hour and a half of the film.  A large chunk of the body I feel just took way too long to explain and was boring in the way the story was told.",

It's a movie about equality, forgiveness, justice, and it acknowledges that not only Germany was responsible for the rise of Hitler. It's an important and necessary film.

Be that as it may, this movie is not for the faint of heart. The subject matter (judges accused of atrocities during the holocaust) is quite graphic and includes actual footage of concentration camps and extermination methods used by the Nazis upon their victims. I found myself hard pressed to keep my eyes on the screen while bulldozers shoved hundreds and thousands of cadavers into mass graves. Many of us, in these modern times, forget how truly awful it was. There are those among us who use terms like \"it's worse than what the Nazis did to the Jews\" to describe things as trivial and stupid as a parking ticket. This movie explores the question of justice versus law and how, sometimes, those two things can be exclusive.

It has powerhouse performances from the whole cast, but Spencer Tracy, Montgomery Clift and Judy Garland are the best with Garland giving possibly her finest performance, she is magnificent and just incredible to watch. The serious subject matter is dealt with utmost respect and unbelievably and thankfully neutral approach. It is a must-see film because of its important story, it is a movie that is incredibly well acted, directed and crafted, nicely paced and superbly executed. It is a classic, a masterpiece, one of the best films of the decade and one of the best courtroom dramas ever.",

Should u be pardoned more if you know its wrong and ask for forgiveness than the person who doesnt know better because theyve always been bad? Should u act in the best interest of the greater good or take each situation individually and regardless of overall consequence? What if u are just following your countries orders or doing your job? Lots of important questions are asked and examined. A very humanized approach to a barbaric time. Some disturbing footage from the camps. I couldn't stand the defense lawyer, but i found the character  played by Marlene Dietrich disarmingly charming in a scary way. Performed well and a movie that keeps your interest despite long running time. On a side note found out interesting history from this movie about the company Bayer and its affiliates.",

The Nuremberg Trials were the first trials of its kind, and it brought to justice the men responsible of bringing millions of people to their deaths during the Holocaust. The story of the Nuremberg trials has been recounted many times on film, and I've seen quite a few films on the subject. Judgement at Nuremberg is the finest example of the trial. Stanley Kramer delivers stunning picture that boasts a great cast of actors, and the film has a wonderful script that captures the importance of the trial. Kramer directs a wonderful cast including Maximillian Schell, William Shatner, Spencer Tracy and Burt Lancaster.  This is a flawless drama, and a must see for those who love court room drama. The film captivates the viewer by the fact that that this is based on real events and it adds to the experience. I found this film to be one of the better reconstructions of the trials, one that felt more subtle than other films, which for me anyway, felt less over dramatic, which is necessary in order to make a great film. Using great performances and a great story, Stanley Kramer was able to pull off a memorable and engaging drama that still resonates today. If you love classic cinema, Judgement at Nuremberg is a stunning, well acted film that recounts an important part of history. This is the finest portrait of the trials that I have seen, and anyone looking for the definitive portrait of the trials should watch this film. The cast, story, and direction are all top notch, and they make for a truly engaging film experience.",

Are they innocent because they were upholding the laws of the administration? Or, are they guilty for upholding those same laws and allowing the war crimes to go on? Though it seems easy from that description, the film really takes the time to show that this case isn't a clear cut case of good or evil, but rather a grey area that raises many questions about what was right or not. It also raises questions about the guilt of other countries for turning a blind eye to what the Nazis were doing. It's a deep, compelling, and harrowing drama that makes you pay attention to every detail and makes you think about the various issues and questions the script brings up. It's a film that requires full attention and participation from the viewer to fully process the details. It's also a film that is still very relevant even in this day and age that should be more widely acknowledged and shown. It's an important film that also happens to be an under-appreciated masterwork. If you love a good drama, this is one that is required viewing, in my opinion.",

            "content": "Wow, Spencer Tracy, Burt Lancaster, Richard Widmark, Marlene Dietrich, Montgomery Clift, Judy Garland and even a young William Shatner are but a few people in this $3 million period epic, so I think it's safe to say that Stanley Kramer knew how to save money more than he knew how to save on time. Yup, in case \"It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World\" wasn't overlong enough for you, well, this probably won't impress you, because I hear the original cut of \"World\" is, for some reason, about thirty minutes longer than this film, and plus, as overlong as this film is, it's a bit more worthy of a hefty link... apparently. I don't know what is up with everyone's ideas that courtroom dramas have to be really, really long, but hey, we've still gotten some pretty good, really long legal dramas, so it's only fitting that this, a film that is about as long as any legal drama, be good. Man, I can't help but think about how weird it is that Stanley Kramer did this sprawling, thorough study on the trials against the particularly high-ranking Nazi monsters against the merciless purging of millions of people in the name of anti-semitism, then followed it up with \"It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World\". Hey, say what you will about the guy's taste in runtimes, he was nothing less than versatile, or at least I think he was, because this film and \"World\" are the ones of his that people remember, and even then, people barely remember this \"little\" number. It's a shame, quite frankly, because we should never forget any kind of portrayal of the terrible, terrible travesties against the Jews, especially if those portrayals are as long as this one, because, I don't know about y'all, but if I'm investing three hours of my life into something, I better enjoy and remember it. Well, as sure as sunshine, this film is worthy of your time, though not entirely, as this legal epic is guilty of more than a few problems.\r\n\r\nOpening up only on the first night before the first day of the Nuremberg trials, this film doesn't really feel the need to give you all that much insight into the stories of the characters who will be driving this epic-length character study, and sure, compensation for expository shortcomings can be found within meaty characterization and richly well-defined performances, yet development issues still stand, giving you little immediate information and leaving you to go somewhat distanced from the full human depths of the final product. It's fairly impressive how much this film is able to flesh out its characters in spite of developmental shortcomings, especially considering the limitations in storytelling sensibilities at the time, but only so much can be done to obscure lulls in exposition, and even less can be done to drive your attention away from lulls in atmospheric kick, because as firmly secured as intrigue generally is, there are slow spots, something that a film this bloated cannot afford to have. At an astonishing 186 minutes of courtroom dramas and more simple, less juicy talkativeness beyond the courtroom, this film outstays its welcome by a considerable margin, seeming tight in some areas due to its being so good at sustaining intrigue on the whole, but truly being nothing if not exceedingly overlong, with excess material and filler, and, of course, repetition. The film is three hours well-spent, but this is still three hours we're talking about, and as momentous as the thematic depth of this important and humanly rich subject matter is, the plotting structure concept itself is anything but sweeping enough to sustain a runtime that boasts this sprawling of a length, which in turn only calls your attention further to natural shortcomings. Really, the flaws just discussed aren't as severe as I make them sound, as expository shortcomings are compensated for more often than not, and the runtime is made generally comfortable by intrigue that also thins out the sting of the atmospheric slow spells, so what might very well be the most serious shortcomings of the final product are of a natural persuasion, because there is something very minimalist about this conversationalist legal drama, thus the final product was never to be as potent was it clearly wants to be, and the sprawling runtime that was to breathe more well-rounded power into this worthy subject matter ends up doing only so much more than bloat storytelling into aimlessness. No matter how aimless the film gets, it grips, but not tightly enough for you to feel exactly what Stanley Kramer clearly wanted you to feel, as there is too much aimlessness to this overlong and slightly undercooked dialogue drama to consistently sustain your investment. Still, on the whole, no matter how much it is shaken, your investment never slips so far that the final product finds itself unable to reward, for although flaws are difficult to deny when it comes to this overblown drama, strengths are abundant enough to compensate and attract, even on a visual level.\r\n\r\nShot completely in black-and-white, this film found enough visual shortcomings within its being lensed at a time with limitations in photographic quality, so don't go into this film expecting its visual style to be especially advanced for its time, but do expect Ernest Laszlo to still show that he, at least when backed by Stanley Kramer's sharp directorial eye, sure knew his way around a camera, playing with framing in an occasionally stylish and consistently intimate fashion, while keeping what lighting there can be deep enough to give a sense of grit, augmented by the limitations in coloring. Stylistically, the film is hardly killer, but it is impressive when you step back to meditate upon what is accomplished here, unless, of course, it's too difficult to see this film's stylistic strengths through all of the much more rich substance strengths, which you should have no trouble seeing through all of the shortcomings in storytelling. Again, the film is too long for its own good, going into aimless spells - occasionally exacerbated by atmospheric limp spells - that give you more time than you should have to think about how limited this film's story concept is when it comes to structural meat, and yet, no matter how limited this story is in dynamicity, at its core is subject matter that is very worthy, rich and all around intriguing, with the potential to be executed into the compelling legal drama that it, in fact, is at the end of the day, partially thanks to Abby Mann's script's which boasts sharp dialogue to keep intrigue from slipping too much when struck by all of the narrative lulls, as well as many areas of subtly genuine characterization that may not be able to fully compensate for expository shortcomings, but do an adequate job of earning your investment in the characters, whose depths are truly powered by the performances that were somewhat ahead of their time. Not enough material is there for everyone to be stellar, but if nothing else is surprising about this film, especially considering the dramatic limitations of the time, it's just how much this star-studded cast delivers, with most every member having his or her time to shine as distinguished and effective, perhaps even powerful forces who drive much of the human depth within this character drama, whose outstanding secondary performances include such much too briefly present talents as the strong Montgomery Clift as a nervous, unstable and all around traumatized witness, and a piercing Judy Garland as a woman whose faith in a Nazi she thought was kind goes crushingly shaken while she finds herself tortured with accusations of an illegal statutory affair with the Nazi in question, and whose more primary cast members command your attention throughout the film, with Spencer Tracy being charismatic as the trial's chief judge, and a then-up-and-coming Maximilian Schell being effectively convincing in his immersed and layered portrayal of an intense seeker of justice for the unjust whose passion grows to corrupt his understandable, if somewhat misguided intentions, while the great Burt Lancaster all but steals the show in his initially quietly striking and gradually intensifying portrayal of a guilty man who regrets the terrible crimes that he and his peers are accused to exacting in the name of love for their flawed country. The names just mentioned are but a few worth mentioning in this hefty cast of classic talents, almost all of whom deliver with onscreen inspiration that goes matched only by Stanley Kramer's offscreen inspiration, because in spite of his inability to fully compensate for the final product's shortcomings, Kramer does enough to flesh this story out with a subtlety and range that is surprisingly audacious, being unafraid to take what chances it needs to (This film even has the guts to shamelessly feature a sequence that shows the fainthearted audience of the early '60s footage evidence of what was going on in the concentration camps) in order to reinforce intrigue of both a human and legal nature. The film is too overdrawn, aimless and naturally thin to be all-out powerful on the whole, but the thoughtfulness that Kramer puts into the telling of this intriguing tale gracefully fleshes out depth and intrigue enough to compel you time and again, and craft a final product that overcomes, not necessarily its natural shortcomings, but its flaws enough to reward the patient.\r\n\r\nTo come to my own judgment, moderate expository shortcomings slow down momentum, though not as much as the slow spells and repetitious padding that reflect the natural limitations in this relatively thin story enough for the final product to fall short of what it wants to be, though not so short that you can't still appreciate it as rewarding, as there is enough attractiveness to Ernest Laszlo's cinematography, sharpness to Abby Mann's script, power to the performances within this star-studded cast, and audaciously intriguing thoughtfulness to Stanley Kramer's inspired storytelling to make \"Judgment at Nuremberg\" a thoroughly compelling, if naturally restrained dramatization of the Nuremberg Trials and study on how passion can intensely corrupt.\r\n\r\n3/5 - Good",

The film is based on the true stories of the Nazi war crimes trials at Nuremberg. Expanding what is often a restricted subject, Kramer explores conscience, morality, justice and the horrors and aftermath of German Nazism within the courtroom setting thanks to a great screenplay, an amazing ensemble of on screen talent whose performances are sublime with Spencer Tracy's perfect representation of American conscience, and a photography that makes everything look majestic and stylistically works as a great tie between the mise en scene of classic American cinema and the modern cinematography of the approaching American new wave.",

Spencer Tracy, Burt Lancaster, Richard Widmark, Marlene Dietrich, Montgomery Clift, Judy Garland, Werner Klemperer, and even William Shatner all play a part. However, Maximillian Schell is by far the standout because he is such an amazing defender of his country's honor throughout the entire film. He wants the Holocaust to be known and yet all the while he goes through the case with dignity even though the pressures are so great. For every intense moment the viewer is stuck in their seat and when the verdict comes it is hard to contain the emotion. This movie should be seen by all not only because it is great but it also chronicles an important event in history. Whatever happens we should never forget the events surrounding the Judgment at Nuremberg.",

Stanley Kramer's three-plus-hour-long courtroom drama exposes a side of postwar Germany few know about, describing the trial of the four highest ranking judges of the Third Reich for their war crimes. Kramer, himself a corpsman in WWII, acknowledged the world had made up its mind about Nazis and presented Judgment at Nuremberg with a completely unbiased approach, allowing him to focus his efforts on keeping the camera in near constant motion to help keep his courtroom epic from falling into monotony. And it worked. The smooth panorama motions and quick zoom ins add an elegance that prevents Judgment from being another Oscar-bait yawn-fest, which is quite an achievement for a dialogue driven film with no rising action. The magnitude of the brilliance of Abby Mann's cracking screenplay and the immense ensemble performance cannot be contained in one review, so that discovery is up to you.",

At times an intense courtroom drama, and at times a truly disturbing look into the eyes of the Nazi criminals whose shameless actions only fuel this film's purpose to detail its message, Judgment at Nuremberg never tires regardless of its somewhat-necessary running time. The highlight of the film: Richard Widmark's monologue used during a frightening and horrific look at just some of the Nazi's treatment of Jews during the Holocaust which creates a spine-tingling effect that most films can hardly match.",
