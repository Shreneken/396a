            "content": "In my opinion 'Throne Of Blood' is almost as brilliant as Kurosawa's more celebrated 'Rashomon'. It's almost impossible to fault this brilliant adaptation of Shakespeare's 'Macbeth'. It's the most compelling version of the story I have seen, even better than Polanski's outstanding film of the early 1970s, which until seeing 'Throne Of Blood' was my favourite. Kurosawa is without doubt one of the greatest film makers of all time, and watching this movie is experiencing a master at work. Toshiro Mifune gives another brilliant performance and Isuzu Yamada, who plays his wife (the equivalent of the Lady Macbeth character) is absolutely chilling. The stylized acting combined with the superb cinematography gives this movie a frightening nightmarish feel, yet the characters are always human. This makes it a very powerful and haunting movie. I don't seem to see 'Throne Of Blood' mentioned a lot as one of Kurosawa's best, but I was incredibly impressed by it, and it comes with my highest recommendation. This is a brilliant movie and to call it a masterpiece is no exaggeration.",

            "content": "Washizu is a brave samurai who helps his lord to fight off a violent rebellion.  Washizu and his friend Miki are riding through Cobweb Forest when a spirit appears to them and makes predictions which fire their ambitions.  When Washizu explains this vision to his wife Asaji, she urges him to murder his lord and rule in his stead.  Thus the tragedy begins.Kurosawa's interpretation of Macbeth is visually fascinating. Swirling mist, colossal trees dripping with rain, rich black volcanic soil and bulky fortress architecture provide the imposing, dread-laden backdrop against which the humans move in superbly stylized patterns.  The director chose to shoot the action on Mount Fuji precisely because of the volcanic soil - and even had truckloads brought to the studio for pickup shots.Westerners unfamiliar with Noh are missing a huge part of the film's meaning.  This thousand-year-old theatrical tradition corresponds broadly to our Elizabethan Tragedy, and Kurosawa shows how the two cultural strains, eastern and western, interlock and interact.  The one illumines the other.The Noh stage must have on it three pine branches and a symbolic Shinto temple-arch.  In the film, shots are carefully composed to include tangles of branches in the foreground, and the vast entrance gate of Washizu's fortress serves for the temple arch.  And yet Kurosawa is not including these details redundantly, for mere form's sake - the ubiquitous branches, framing the human action, remind us all the time of the forest nemesis awaiting Washizu.  The arch is Washizu's interface with the world - open in the early stages, but gradually less so as the protagonist retreats into his own diseased inner self.A Noh play features a \"doer\" (Shite) and a \"companion\" (Waku) who plays a subordinate role.  Washizu and Asaji are the Shite and Waku respectively. Elements in the Noh include a battle-drama (we get one here) and a so-called \"wig drama\", in which a female character dominates the action.  This is the central portion of the film, in the quiet of the fortress quarters, when Asaji ruthlessly manipulates her husband's ambition.  Every Noh play has a ghost which appears to the Shite, and the spirit in the forest fulfils that function.  Noh plays are never original works, in that (by a venerable convention) they are re-workings of ancient legends.  Kurosawa follows tradition by quarrying his tale from Shakespeare's play.There is no western term to describe the stylized striking of poses so important in Noh.  Our word \"dance\" is a crude word which approximates to, but does not convey, the grace of the Japanese art-form.  Asaji, alone with the blood-stain, gives us a glimpse of this delightful ritual.Finally, Noh contains an aural richness almost totally absent from western tragedy - the complex rhythms of stamping and percussion which accompany the spoken word.  In the film, the rhythmic patterns of horses' hooves on soil, and Washizu's bare feet on the boards of the banquet hall, are meant to reinforce the mood as they creep into our emotions by subliminal insistence.Isuzu Yamada is terrific as Asaji.  Her stillness absolutely oozes determination, contrasting strongly with her husband's hollow bluster.\nIt seems that Kurosawa cherished the concept of a Noh Macbeth for some years before committing it to celluloid.  Apparently the project had to be scrapped in 1952 because Welles' Macbeth was nearing completion, and Kurosawa did not want the two films to suffer by being endlessly compared. This version, then, had to wait until 1957 to be realised.The director is not afraid to add his own flourishes to the well-known story.  We hear of the notorious traitor Fujimaki who disembowelled himself in a room of the fortress.  The exact spot is now known as the Forbidden Room, a place of evil omen with its indelible bloodstain on the floor.  It is a symbol which encapsulates the spirit of the film, interweaving the related themes of treachery, blood and guilt.  In a brilliant transition, we are taken to a change of scene by the ripping down of a banner by galloping horsemen.  Washizu at the pinnacle of his arrogance is filmed from below with severe foreshortening, conveying his vainglory more effectively than words ever could.  The death scene, with its railing, hysterical protagonist and relentless volleys of arrows (their grouped shafts recalling the fateful forest) has enormous power and lives long in the viewer's memory.",

            "content": "A great deal has been made of the fact that THRONE OF BLOOD (also known as SPIDER'S WEB CASTLE) is drawn from one of Shakespeare's most celebrated plays. This is both a blessing and a curse, for while it gives western audiences a point of reference, it also invites all sorts of comparisons that viewers familiar with the Shakespeare play feel honor-bound to make--and that can get in the way of seeing the film as it is rather than what we expect it to be. And that would be a great pity, because what it is in and of itself is quite fine indeed.The cast is a very strong ensemble, with frequent Kurosawa star Torshiro Mifune leading the film with a remarkably fine performance as the ambitious warrior Taketori Washizu. To my mind, however, the most memorable performance is offered by Isuzu Yamada as Lady Washizu--who plays the role with a demonic stillness that cracks into physical action only when she is completely sure of herself or in utter desperation. It is one of the most disturbing characterizations I have ever encountered.As usual in any Kurosawa film, the imagery involved is extremely powerful, and the moody tone of the film quickly draws viewers in--and once ensnared there is no escape; the film holds your attention with considerable ease throughout. Even so, I would not recommend THRONE OF BLOOD to western audiences who have never seen a Kurosawa film, for it is so completely Japanese in aesthetic that some may find it hard to grasp. It is best seen after you are already familiar with both Kurosawa's work and Japanese cinema in general.The film is available via Criterion DVD, which is quite good, with a nicely restored transfer and bonus features that include the original trailer, a choice of subtitle translations (I prefer the Hoagland translation), and a somewhat awkward but ultimately rewarding commentary track by Michael Jeck. If you're a Kurosawa fan and you've never seen THRONE OF BLOOD, this is your opportunity; if you're looking to replace an existing video with a DVD, this one is likely as good as it gets.

            "content": "Directors don't come much better than Kurosawa, writers don't come much better than Shakespeare, and movies don't come much better than this excellent combination of the two.  Add Mifune's acting, plus a good supporting cast (including a really good performance by Isuzu Yamada), and you have a top-quality, classic film.  In retelling the story of \"Macbeth\" with characters from medieval Japan, Kurosawa does honor to the original and creates a fine achievement in its own right.Much of the time, when Shakespeare plots are transferred to different settings, what results is only a shadow of the original, because too many directors have only a limited grasp of what Shakespeare's deep masterpieces are all about.  That is not at all the case here - Kurosawa shows a great appreciation for the themes and potential of the Macbeth story, and adds plenty of masterful touches of his own, creating a distinctive, memorable atmosphere and characters that come to life in their own right in addition to serving as worthy parallels to the Macbeth characters.  There are many fine details that enhance both the medieval Japanese setting and also the important themes of the story itself.Whether you like Shakespeare, Kurosawa, or both, \"Throne of Blood\" is an excellent movie that should not disappoint.",

Her Lady Macbeth is one of the most terrifying things I have ever seen, a forerunner to Sadako. Dressed in Noh make-up, slow moving like the world's most effective predator, unblinking, she is, without a doubt, the true lady Macbeth. She turns Mifune towards murder, and, although she is seen going mad at the end, we do not see her die. The tragedy of the tale is heightened by the fact that we are told at the start what will happen. Every shot Kurosawa composes is memorable. The arrow through the neck, the thread spinning witch in the forest, Mifune turning his back on his master, all are haunting and unforgettable. This film cannot be praised enough, and although it is not a horror movie, it puts all modern horror movies to shame with its deadly atmosphere.

            "review_title": "Best Shakespeare on Film",
            "content": "As most people know, this is Shakespeare's Macbeth rendered by Kurosawa into Noh format for cinema. Not for nothing is Akira Kurosawa regarded as Japan's greatest director, for this is the best cinematic version of any Shakespeare play (and also one of Kurosawa's best films). Kurosawa had the advantage of working in a different language (Japanese), so he didn't have to agonize over the usual dilemma - whether to use Shakespeare's rotund oratory and blank verse (which is glorious, but goes badly on screen). Kurosawa essentially translates Shakespeare's poetry into visual images, while keeping dialogue to a minimum. He also had the good fortune of accessing two great cultures - European literature and Japanese visual art (he was originally a painter before entering cinema as a set-designer). There are many painterly images reminiscent of Ukiyo-e (e.g. Washizu full of arrows).The Noh style of acting (like Kabuki, but more refined) seems stilted and exaggerated for the first few minutes; then you realize that is ideally suited to a story like this - more natural acting would seem out of place, as other Macbeth-movies go to prove. The Japanese title of this film translates as \"Cobweb Castle\" (or Spider City) and this really should have been the title in English. The film is full of the notion of spiders spinning webs (and plots) in secret. It is worth noting that the witch (or \"monster\") is first seen with a ghostly spinning-wheel. This symbolizes the thread of fate, but also reflects the cobweb theme.The story is sometimes slow-moving, but you have to realize that this is a story of insidious slow rot (hence the references to spiders and cobwebs). The decay is punctured by occasional bursts of violent action, as befits the story. The black-and-white picture adds to the creepiness, and the atmosphere is so thick that the movie works more effectively than \"Ran\" (Kurosawa's more polished Shakespeare-adaptation).Macbeth is the great-granddaddy of the entire horror genre, and Kurosawa is a worthy descendant.",

            "review_title": "Another ambitious film from Akira Kurosawa.",
            "content": "Throne of Blood is, in fact, ambitious as a film as well as in its meaning. It suggests that ambition, when based on whimsical motivation, can sometimes lead to the destruction of very close relationships, and even one's own ruination. Throne of Blood begins with a series of messengers bringing news to their daimyo about an invasion of North Castle by the Fujimaki, which is led by an enemy samurai named Inui. The invasion is broken and then bravely retaliated against by two armies which are led by two samurai, Washizu and Miki. As they are returning to the daimyo, they come across a ghostly spirit in the woods, who predicts leadership positions to be attained by each of them that very day. These predictions come true to the last detail, which sets off a destructive chain of events.Miki becomes the leader of Fort One, as predicted, and Washizu becomes the leader of the North Castle, as predicted, but it is also predicted that Miki's son will rule North Castle after Washizu, which causes problems later in the film. Despite their good fortune, Miki and especially Washizu must keep their encounter with the fortune-telling spirit in the woods a secret because, if word gets out, Washizu is likely to become endangered because people will want him dead out of suspicion that he will try to kill Yoshiteru, Miki's son, to keep him from taking over Washizu's position. In an effort to prevent any of this, Washizu decides to name Yoshiteru as his heir, but Asaji, his wife, forbids this, saying that she is pregnant. It is Asaji who pressures Washizu into having Miki killed so that he can be the sole ruler of all of the provinces, but when this happens, the other castles turn against him and seek to avenge the leaders who have been killed under his orders. In the end, he is killed by his own army, which has lost all faith in him and has also turned against him.There was a very interesting use of symbolism in Throne of Blood that is worth pointing out here. From literally the beginning to the end of the film, the setting is covered in thick fog. One scene that comes to mind that quite clearly communicates the meaning of this fog is early in the film, just after Washizu and Miki saw the spirit in the woods, and had their futures revealed to them. As they are riding out of the woods and back to the castle, they begin to cross large, flat plains that are covered in this stiflingly thick fog. There is literally a couple of minutes of footage of them riding their horses into the fog, then back toward the camera, then into the fog in another direction, and then back toward the camera, and so on. This fog seems to symbolize a natural inability to see ahead, or to see the future, as it were. This technique is especially effective this early in the film because much of the two men's decisions later in the film are founded on what the spirit told them, yet the fog symbolizes a type of foreshadowing that suggests that this premonition cannot be correct.\nThrone of Blood is also structured in a very unique way. The film starts off showing a desolated castle, as well as its surroundings, in which there is a sizeable gravestone marking a burial site. While this is being shown, there is a song being sung by an unseen choir about a brave warrior who once ruled this now-deserted castle, but who was `murdered by ambition.' At the end of the film, we see this same montage, and the same song is heard, and this is where we learn that the gravestone marks Washizu's burial site.\nKurosawa used different camera techniques to communicate parts of the story or to emphasize it in various ways much more than he did in other films, like Ran, Kagemusha, and High and Low. One particularly noteworthy example occurred late in the film, as Washizu is standing over his army. Washizu stands on an elevated walkway, and his army is crowded on the ground below, looking up at him. There is a low angle shot from amidst the men, and while Washizu is small in the shot itself, he is high above the other men, looking down at them, and they are all looking up at him in unison. However, it would seem that, rather than use this shot to convey a sense of superiority or of dominance, Kurosawa probably meant to emphasize his position of power, because this is the scene in which his army turns against him and he is shot with dozens of their arrows. The low angle shot would contradict Washizu's descent into madness if it was meant to show superiority, but to emphasize his position of power at this point in the film, it makes his downfall much more dramatic.This is usually not the case with Akira Kurosawa, but Throne of Blood reflects more of a formalistic style of direction. For example, his use of high and low angle shots, as well as the extensive symbolic use of the fog, suggest more formalism here than realism. Besides that, and probably more obviously, is the way that the strange spirit in the woods was presented. She was in a radiantly lit hut in the middle of the dark woods, and Washizu's encounter with several other spirits later in the film was presented among an extensive use of cutting and editing. The extensive use of very long takes and slow action seen in Ran and Kagemusha is definitely seen here, but not nearly as much. There are scenes in which these long takes are seen, but in addition to them there can be found many more short takes and highly edited sequences, which were largely absent from the previous films. But having done this with the same skill, Kurosawa has fashioned another samurai masterpiece.",

The plot revolves around betrayal, conspiracy, greed, honour and megalomania. It is inspired by William Shakespeare's Macbeth intertwined with stylistic elements from Japanese Noh which is a visually appealing but physically static type of traditional musical drama.The movie tells the story of friends and generals Washizu and Miki who are foretold a bright future by a mysterious spirit in a misty forest. Initially skeptical, the prophecies of the spirit happen to be true when Washizu is named Lord of the Northern Garrison and Miki Commander of the First Fortress. However, Washizu's cold-blooded wife Asaji manipulates her husband into forcing his luck instead of waiting for it to fall into his hands. They plot to assassinate Lord Tsuzuki and then kill Miki but their gloomy plans soon backfire and spiral out of control.The movie convinces with gorgeous settings such as gigantic Spider's Web Castle. The acting performances are really intense and especially Yamada Isuzu convinces as sinister femme fatale. The plot is filled with interesting conspiracies, intrigues and twists. The film's pace is relatively steady after a slow but necessary introduction. The final quarter of the movie is particularly intense and ends in a brutal tragedy. The movie has aged rather well thanks to its timeless plot.This movie isn't among Kurosawa Akira's greatest films like Seven Samurai and The Hidden Fortress but is still in the upper middle section of his impressive works. This dynamic historical drama is a clever take on William Shakespeare's timeless Macbeth and convinces thanks to stunning settings, gloomy atmosphere and intense acting performances. If you like elegant action films, intense dramas or epic war movies, you will certainly appreciate Throne of Blood. This entertaining movie has aged quite well and would serve as an appropriate introduction to the works of both Kurosawa Akira and Mifune Toshiro.",

When her predictions come true, it is the beginning of an ignominious tragedy that will ultimately end in death for both men ...Made during his dynamic fifties period, this powerful retelling of William Shakespeare's Macbeth is the best movie version of the classic play (although the Orson Welles and Roman Polanski films are both good too). It sticks pretty close to the original text; the Washizus are the Macbeths, the Mikis are Banquo and Fleance, Tsuzuki is Duncan and Odagura is Siward. Some characters are missing - notably Macduff - and there are some new elements - such as Lady Washizu's pregnancy - but Kurosawa has captured the feel and the atmosphere of the story perfectly, whilst still making his movie visually powerful and arresting. He does this by making it almost a horror movie (the Japanese title translates as Cobweb Castle, a horror film title if ever I heard one); it's packed full of creepy scenes, startling sounds and moments (for example, when Yamada gasps at the murderer's sudden appearance), and is embedded with dread. It's also drenched in grim weather - the ever-present fog is a stunning metaphor for the moral dilemmas which constantly confront Washizu, almost as if the cloudiness of his thoughts have seeped out to surround him. Immediately after meeting the ghost, Kurosawa uses an amazing ten wordless shots - count them, ten - of Mifune and Chiaki riding around lost in the fog. Anyone else would have used one or two, but the ten are astonishing; this director loved bad weather. His use of camera is also brilliant in its simple, powerful elegance with so many clever shots to mention; the ghost's sudden dramatic disappearance, Lady Washizu swallowed by blackness as she fetches the poisoned saki, the famous Banquo's Ghost dinner scene, not to mention the incredible finale as the treasonable Mifune is tortured by a rain of arrows from his own men. This movie isn't as much fun as some of Kurosawa's others - it is Macbeth, after all - but it is stunning throughout, and one of the best screen adaptations of Shakespeare.

I'm sure literature majors out there are having an apoplexy now that I said that. It's just that in using such stilted language, the plays often become ponderous. This is definitely NOT the case with Akira Kuraswawa's version of Macbeth. Because you really don't translate 17th century English into 17th century Japanese, the more modern language used in the movie makes this Japanese version MORE ACCESSIBLE to the average English-speaking person! Plus, the Japanese imagery (such as the witches now appearing as bleached out demons) is spectacular and exciting to watch. I think Shakespeare himself would have enjoyed the effort, though considering he is currently dead (and it appears this will not change in the near future), it is only a guess on my part.

            "content": "The Scottish Play gets a very Oriental makeover in this combination of samurai film and Noh theater from master filmmaker Akira Kurosawa. As a fan of both AK and Shakespeare I owed it to myself to give this a go, particularly as this play has drawn many gifted filmmakers over the years, always to interesting results.If you know Kurosawa's Seven Samurai or Yojombo, your expectations going into Throne of Blood will probably let you down at first. The energy and visual flair are there, but expressed very differently: a suffocating formality and simmering rage replaces the vitality and dynamism of those other films. Lost in a thick, perpetual fog, Kurosawa's characters stumble around like broken puppets, heavily made up in Noh theater makeup that is at first hard to adjust to. it creates a useful distance, and underlines the power of the cruel hand of Fate, moving its victims across an apocalyptic landscape to a shockingly violent conclusion, one you would do well not to preview online before viewing the film.Of his three adaptations - Ran being a masterful retelling of King Lear and The Bad Sleep Well using elements of Hamlet - this is the least accessible, but also the most visionary and unique. Oddly enough, it has similarities to Orson Welles' earlier adaptation made half a world away. Both films focus on tribal symbolism, are doused in fog and could never conceivably have had the same impact in color.If you're interested in either Japanese cinema or Shakespeare, this should definitely be near the top of your list. As an entry-point to Kurosawa's catalog, you'd probably be better off with some less weighty fare.",

            "content": "I am more of a Seven Samurai, Ran and Hidden Fortress fan myself when it comes to Akira Kurasawa's films. However I do think alongside the likes of Welles' Chimes at Midnight, Branagh's Much Ado About Nothing and Olivier's Richard III to be one of the finest films based on Shakespeare's work ever made. Throne of Blood is a somewhat loose adaptation of Macbeth, not as bloody perhaps and set in a Japanese feudal setting, and I am aware that it has been criticised for one-dimensional characters and its dramatic structure. For me though, the dramatic structure, even with the purposefully slow-moving pace(at times), was compelling and sometimes even moving in places, and the characters while not exactly complex are not that one-dimensional in comparison to other characters in other movies. Taketoki Washizu, masterfully played by Toshiro Mifune, is one of those villains where you do feel a lot of pity for at the end I found. Whatever Throne of Blood is criticised for, I cannot deny how powerful the atmosphere conveyed is here, it is very intense and eerie with a harrowing final scene. Kurasawa's direction is superb, the basic essence of Macbeth is there but there are also touches like the Forbidden Room that are part of the director's own creative touch. Of the other acting, which is not naturalistic to start with and considering the tone and subject matter all the better for it but always effective, Isuzu Yamada is a standout, determined and intensely still. And Throne of Blood is an incredibly well made film, the camera work is exemplary and the spooky sets add so much to the atmosphere. All in all, one of the finest Shakespeare adaptations on film. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

This adaptation of the bard's Macbeth is one of Kurosawa's classics but I have to say I found it hard going at times. Definitely a film you have to be in the mood to watch, it's without doubt a technically superb piece of work with some undeniably effective moments (the spooky witch in the woods, the famous rain of arrows, Isuzu Yamada's wonderfully manipulative Lady Asaji) and some overt symbolism that even I could grasp. So, on that level, the film works wonderfully. And yet \u0096 I don't know, it just seems so emotionally detached from its characters that Washizu's inexorable descent into madness as he realises the ambitions fired by an encounter with the aforementioned witch in the Cobweb Forest failed to engage me. Assured direction, and superb cinematography make this a film that always has something to occupy the attentive viewer's mind, but the slow, by-the-numbers treatment left me feeling as if I had done a duty rather than indulged in a pleasure.",

            "content": "Akira Kurosawa is one of the most celebrated and renowned of all filmmakers not only because he created some of the world's greatest visionary masterpieces such \"Seven Samurai\" (1954), \"Rashomon\" (1950), and \"Yojimbo\" (1961) but because he had the nerve to draw in on formulas and elements from all around the world and not just those of his native Japan. He is considered the most Western of all Japanese filmmakers, having owed a lot of his influence to men such as John Ford. But there also came times when Kurosawa would tend to the realm of William Shakespeare and the influential plays that he created so many years before.The Shakespearian play \"Macbeth\" is considered one of the playwright's classics, so it wasn't a surprise when Akira Kurosawa decided to film his own adaptation of the story and blend it with his own shocking twists and ideas. His 1957 film \"Throne of Blood\", while not entirely faithful to Shakespeare's play and not alluding to any of the original dialogue is ranked one of the greatest \"Macbeth\" adaptations of all time. And remember, this is a story that has been modified and reconstructed over and over again through the centuries.The basic plot remains the same. Toshiro Mifune stars as the Japanese equivalent to Macbeth: a war hero-turned-ruler who, upon being egged by his vindictive and cynical wife (Isuzu Yamada) and being told a strange prophecy about his future, plots to murder his own master and anybody who stands in his way. Once the murder is committed, peace does not follow, but rather a long chain of bloody killings until the position Mifune holds is exactly what the title personifies.Although I strongly feel that Kurosawa did a better treatment of the Shakespeare play \"King Lear\" with \"Ran\" (1985) and that this film does not rank on top with some of his others, \"Throne of Blood\" is still a very good and very visionary and creative opus. And part of the reason why I like it is because of its inherently dark nature. Unlike \"Yojimbo\" (1961) which made a sort of glory out of violence, \"Throne of Blood\" has an atmosphere of terror and intensity around it. Right from the beginning, when we hear Masaru Sato's chilling opening score, we know this is going to be a dark film. Toshiro Mifune was perfect casting as the bloodthirsty Washizu. Although he is far less evil that Macbeth from the play, Washizu is in his own way, more intimidating due to his viciousness and again, those eyes. Mifune maintains the impression of a madman throughout the course of the film and gives us the impression of a wild animal hungry for human flesh and blood. I was also very fond of the performance by Isuzu Yamada as Lady Macbeth's equivalent. Although her performance is mainly a one-note ordeal, it still works out well and there was something about her that reminded me not of a snake like one would expect, but a rat. I do not know if Kurosawa did this intentionally, but when she walks, the lower garments of her robe rubs against the floor with a kind of squeal-like wisp. And like a rat, she spreads her disease: the thirst for blood.\"Throne of Blood\" is not a perfect film, however. The music score by Masaru Sato, save for the opening theme and a few cues here and there, is rather forgettable. Some of the supporting cast members, such as those by Akira Kubo and Takashi Shimura seem very underdeveloped. However, any weaknesses that become noticeable are soon forgiven when Kurosawa's original and terrific ending scene comes into frame which was a major improvement over the disappointing climax from the play.So overall, Kurosawa's \"Throne of Blood\" is again, not his best film, but certainly a very unique and entertaining one and a great vision of the Japanese perception of Shakespeare's classic.",

Though I don't personally agree with it's place there, it's hard to dispute it's quality.The film is a Japanese Toho made (Kurosawa directed) adaptation of William Shakespeares Macbeth. Though many of us have a slight bias against the tale due to it being forced down our throats in school it's hard to argue with its quality.Sure Toho have tweaked it but you can clearly identify the original story and it's made masterfully as most Toho movies are.It demonstrates once again that at the time the acting pool was small and you tend to see the same faces. Once again we see Seven Samurai (1954) stars Toshir\u00f4 Mifune and the excellent (Though barely in this) Takashi Shimura.It all looks fantastic though I'm quite surprised the movie wasn't in colour.

            "content": "Okay, the warriors Washizu and Miki ride back from a victorious battle through a magic forest and run into a wispy specter that tells them that Washizu will become king while Miki's son will inherit the kingdom. Coaxed by his wife, Washizu assassinates the king and takes his place. Again coaxed by his wife, he has his friend Miki killed as well. Well, Washizu (Toshiro Mifune) has made a lot of enemies by this time and they gang up on him, attack his castle, and kill him -- whereupon Miki's son takes the throne, thus fulfilling the prophecy.That's it, in brief. Can I skip the rest of the plot? Read Shakespeare's MacBeth for the whole story. It's one of my favorite plays by WS, partly because it's the shortest that he ever wrote.I was led to believe Kurosawa's version of the tale deviated considerably from Shakespeare's and that it might be almost unrecognizable, but that's not the case at all. It's far from a filmed play, of course. In the play we only hear about the woods creeping up on the castle. Here we see the Spider Web Forest in full creepy motion. And if MacBeth is finally killed off stage by Duncan, here Washizu winds up with more arrows sticking out of him than a porcupine has quills. And of course Shakespeare's poetry is missing. Or, let's say, whereas Shakespeare's poetry was verbal, Kurosawa's is visual.And what a visual delight it is too, in inexpensive black and white, full frame. A terrific use of fog, lighting, spare sets, minimalistic acting punctuated by outrageous ham. Toshiro Mifune overacts to the extent that, at certain points, it becomes a miracle that his eyeballs stay in their sockets.There are, however, some differences. I think the editing might be off, or else I missed the part where Washizu gives the order for Miki to be killed. (They bring Washizu Miki's lopped off head, missing in the play.) If I remember, Madam MacBeth doesn't become pregnant and have a stillborn child either, as Washizu's wife does here. Also, in the play, she dies for reasons unexplained. Here, she seems to just disappear from the story, like the Fool in King Lear, unless I looked away from the screen at the wrong moment and missed some subtitles. (Just listening to it is no help because I only understand a few words of Japanese and all of them are unprintable.) \"Is this a dagger that I see before me?\" is missing, naturally, but the Banquo's Ghost scene is kept just about intact. It includes the intrusion of Washizu's wife, trying to explain to the guests that her husband sometimes has these fits and spells when he's liquored up. (How many ordinary wives have made the same apologies for their ordinary husbands?) But Washizu's wife does more than try to patch over her husband's gaffes. In the play, she merely propped up her husband when his ambition weakened, urged him to \"screw your courage to the sticking place.\" In Kurosawa's film, she's the INSTIGATOR of the whole thing. She's truly Machiavellian. Next to her, Washizu is a guileless moron who takes too much for granted and is too dumb to concoct her kinds of intrigues. Her emoting throughout is highly stylized and seems somehow artificial to Western eyes, but probably more accessible to those Japanese who are in the noh.I admit I found myself a little confused now and then. Especially during the first half, I couldn't keep the Lord's Castle, the Garrison, and the First, Second, and Third Fortresses straight. The play dealt mostly with titles -- the Glames or the Glans or whatever they were -- but in the film, the prizes are places as well as titles.It's a dark film, darker than the play that begat it. The three witches with their bubbling cauldron seem to be figures of fun, but the spectral old man who sings a tale of life is positively depressing, though spookier than the witches. The imagery in this scene is really notable.I keep hearing that Kurosawa was influenced by John Ford but it's hard to see how. Kurosawa was attracted to umberous, humorless stories. Ford rarely went without a dance or celebration of some sort. And Kurosawa tried suicide, whereas Ford was never in any such danger except for maybe drinking himself to death. I wonder if it had anything to do with Kurosawa's having fought on the losing side of a war and Ford's having been on the winning side.In any case, don't miss this.",

Throne of Blood is Kurosawa's adaptation of Shakespeare's play, Macbeth, but in a feudal Japanese setting.The film begins with Taketoki Washizu (Toshiro Mifune) and Yoshaki Miki (Minoru Chiaki) winning a fierce battle for their lord. Afterwards, they are invited to the lord's castle. On their way there, they come across a spirit in the forest. the spirit tells Washizu that he will soon become in command of a castle but that he will not rule long, and Yoshaki's son will soon takeover. Washizu is soon convinced that these predictions will come true, and becomes consumed with greed and evil in order to make sure that they do indeed come true.In this film Kurosawa uses a more still and quiet filming style than was used in his previous films (with the exception of Ikiru). A style that he continued to use for the rest of his career. The Shakespearean influence is obviously there, not only in story, but the film itself has a very theatre-esque feeling to it.",

For those who don't know, it's Kurosawa's \"Macbeth\" and unlike much of his later epic film-making, this one attempts to distill the complex storyline down to its most basic elements...it's as close to horror as it is to an epic.And it works, but only to me on a rather superficial level. The development and motivations of both Lord and Lady Washizu (Toshir\u00f4 Mifune and Isuzu Yamada) is only thinly sketched -- true it isn't the most significant part of the Shakepeare original either, but here events move so quickly that I felt the madness was taking hold with no alternating moments of sanity, which I do remember from the play. Washizu gets the prophecy -- is promoted -- takes the Lordship -- pays the penalty -- it's all done in a breathless manner, with many striking scenes including the great final execution -- but to me at least it rang a bit hollow; I felt more of an understanding for the Macbeth of Welles and even Polanski than I did for Kurosawa's warlord.

            "content": "Being a native English speaker with no knowledge of Japenese I may be at a disadvantage in commenting on this film. But as one who appreciates the beauty of the language in Shakespeare's \"Macbeth\" it is difficult not to be disappointed by the mundane subtitles. Instead of poetry we get an uninspired narrative. Compare \"Commander of Fort 1\" with \"thane of Cawdor\" and \"Cobweb Forest\" to \"Birnam wood.\"There is much sound and fury in Mifune's performance but I found his rantings harsh to the ear. I recognize that what is histrionic to me may be sublime to a Japanese, but I felt the need to turn the volume down as the movie went along. However, I thought that Isuzu Yamada, in the Lady Macbeth role, was impressive; paradoxically her quiet restraint accentuated her dominating authority. The scenes between Yamada and Mifune in the bare room are powerful. But, Yamada seemed so unwavering in her ambition that her total reversal in the \"Out, damned spot\" scene seemed unmotivated.There is some engaging black and white photography but often director Kurosawa appears to be too much in love with his own brilliant technique. When Washizu and Miki get lost in the Cobweb Forest they ride in and out of the fog for a good two and a half minutes when thirty seconds would have been enough; the scene where Washizu accompanies the murdered lord's coffin to Miki's castle seems to go on forever. As spectacular as the final scene is where Washizu is inundated with a barrage of a thousand arrows, it was unbelievable that 99% of them missed him by only a few inches. I suppose this was in order to allow him to die a more dramatic prolonged death. A single arrow through the neck might have been more effective.It may be that a culture gap is greatly responsible for my reaction to this film, but I cannot give it high marks.",

            "review_title": "By the pricking of my thumbs, something wicked this way comes. Macbeth has come to Japan and it was somewhat amazing! Throne of Blood is worth checking out!",
            "content": "Set in feudal Japan, during the 'Sengoku Jidai' civil war era of 1477, with stylistic elements drawn from Noh drama. Director Akira Kurosawa's radically retelling of author William Shakespeare's 'Macbeth' was wonderful. 'Throne of Blood' (Kumonosu J\u014d, \"Spider Web Castle\"), has an intense & spooky atmosphere with great emotional tragic haunting characters. Fame Japanese actor, Toshiro Mifune stars as General Washizu, a Japanese warlord whom receives a prophecy from a strange spirit who foretells his future, in which he was consumed by ambition and spurred to action by greed, murders his lord and takes the throne for himself, only to find out, that he has gone mad, with power. Without spoiling the movie, too much, 'Throne of Blood' is a far more effective haunting story compared to most of the earlier English Macbeth films, not only because it follows many of Aristotle's rules of tragedy, but also, it made great use of the natural looking outside locations, in which the plays, live on, rather than being limited in a fake-looking stage studio. Akira Kurosawa is known for his use of weather, and it somewhat shows here, with all the scenes, filmed in the rainfall, as well, in the fog. It's amazing, that they were, even able to get, pretty good shots, out of it; seeing how they were filming in the harsh volcanic slopes of Mount Fuji & in the creepy forest of Aokigahara AKA the suicide forest. It's also cool to hear that Kurosawa's film crew, brutally, built a real fa\u00e7ade castle for this film in this location, giving the film, a feel of isolation. As a result, the film has a definite coldness; as it gives the audience chills, noticing the castle, come out of the fog. Another thing, this movie does so well, is mixing Shakespeare's tale with that of old Japanese folklore. It really does give it, a very unique kinda frightening feel. A good example of this, is how Kurosawa made the three witches or fates, into a Yama-uba, old demonic hag with cannibalistic tendencies. Another is how it relate to real-life history. Indeed, the 'Sengoku Jidai' era was marked by internecine conflicts among rival Japanese clans, due to the absence of a central political power during the Onin War (1467 to 1477). It wasn't until Tokugawa shogunate took power that the kind of treachery, prevarication, and murder that Kurosawa dramatizes in 'Throne of Blood' has ended. I kinda like the ending of this film, showing that the struggle for leadership in the end, leads those, who seek power, closer to the grave. It's way different than the whole political conservatism idea of good vs evil of the original play. Since the Macduff subplot was left out in this version, it lead to somewhat way different, but more thematic end for the Macbeth figure with the shots of walking trees. For a Kurosawa film, the violence is surprising, pretty tame, compare to his other earlier works like 1950's 'Rashomon' & 1954's 'Seven Samurais'. A lot of the harsher violent moments, were mention, after the face, done, off-screen, or mention, through texts in some really badly edited moments. The only thing, I can say, was really intense was the famous arrow scene near the end of the film. It was surprising, done with real arrows. No wonder, why Toshir\u00f4 Mifune looks like, he was crapping his pants. I like how Kurosawa was able to get Mifune to have a facial express of real-life fear. His acting, throughout, this film, was great, even if he sounds, a bit, over the top angry at times. While, Mifune might had been a little bit overdramatic, the actress, Isuzu Yamada that played his wife, Lady Asaji was not. She was very limited with her facial expressions, lines, and movement in this film. I know, a lot of people like her Noh-like mime performance, here, but I found it, to be, not as villainous as other versions. She barely moves or blinks during the entire first half of the film, and always takes a polite tone with her husband. I guess, it's to show that she can be sinister, without speaking much, but I found her, acting to be too robotic and unhuman to be taken seriously. Her repetitive comments wouldn't convince me, to commit murder and that's the bad thing, to have in a movie, because it's the plot-point that drives the film, forwards. Because of that, this movie really drags at points, during pacing. Even some of the supporting cast members, such as those by Akira Kubo and Takashi Shimura seem very underdeveloped. Yet, I do like the idea of all the actors in the film, being caked with make-up that looks like Noh-looking spiritual masks. I just wish, they add, this much, effect to the dead-lord ghost sequence, during the middle of the film. Another thing, the Japanese music by composer Masaru Sato that went along with this movie was ear-bleeding noise. I really couldn't stay that high pitch flute sound at all. It was really distracting me from the rest of the film, as I had to cover my ears, whenever it came on. It really did ruin parts of the film for me. Yet, the Japanese with English subtitles does not. It was a lot easily to understand this film with the Japanese with English subtitles, than the Old Shakespearian English language, playing on its own. Overall: As good as the aesthetics and philosophy are, in the film. I just wish, some parts of the film like the psychology would be better. Still, I have to say, I kinda enjoyed this film. It was awe inspiring, just need a little more work.",

I was astonished at the facial expressions of the Macbeth figure played by Mifune. I was equally freaked out by the wife who is so calculating and controlling. Mifune uses his eyes to show us the depth of his soul. Like Macbeth, he is a good man who falls prey no so much to ambition but to honor. His wife has tremendous power over him and knows how to use it. She coined the phrase \"blind ambition.\" The cinematography is incredible. Kurowawa uses his black and white paintbrush to show incredible battle scenes and encounters. His destruction is so well played. The final scenes are incredible. Shakespeare would have been proud.",

            "content": "The story of Macbeth by William Shakespeare as seen by Akira Kurosawa. Two generals of a powerful warlord return home from a great victory, but on their way through a haunted forest they encounter a spirit. He reads their future and tells that one of the generals would take their lord's place as the next lord of the castle. But he also reveals that it would be the son of the other general that would be the lord after that.And thus we follow these two wretched souls as they in vain try to fight against their destiny only in doing so end up fulfilling it. The story is about man's irrelevance to the world and about his arrogance despite this. Kurosawa drew heavily from Japanese Noh theatre tradition, which emphasizes hard, big emotions, stillnes and explosive movement intermixed and also clearcut stereotypical character archetypes. And for this story it works wonders. The sets are vast and detailed, at times almost drowning the actors, emphasizing their smallness. The dramatic acting fits the mythological and heavily thematic story very well, helped along by an ensemble cast.It should be noted that the pacing can feel weird to a Western audience. The traditions of Noh, as well as Japanese cinema in general, mean that the film has its own rhythm that takes some getting used to.Nevertheless, this is a masterful film and my favourite Kurosawa so far. Definitely worth a watch for all fans of epic, myth and the inevitable.",

The Dialog here is Sparse and that does not bode well for the Shakespeare Play but this is Cinema, Magnificently Pure and Simple.Do not expect Epic Battles, so well Associated with the Director or Samurai Sword Fights. This is all Mood and Character, with the Cinematography Proudly Portraying one of the most Important Characters.

            "content": "Kurosawa takes the Scottish play and turns it Japanese. This was something of a departure for him, as for the first time he neglects the humanist warmth that was his trademark up to this point, to make a film that his overwhelmingly dark, dismal and cold.Not only does Kurosawa transfer the setting of the story from Scotland to Japan, he also keeps the theatrical roots of the story in mind, but transfers them to oriental theatrical tradition. The music, pace, movement and mood is reminiscent of Japanese Noh performance. There are piercing reed flutes, slow deliberate movements and guttural voices. Kurosawa even frames much of the action between doorways, gateways and trees, as if they were the edges of the stage. With all this theatrical exaggeration it was also his most stylised and unnatural picture to date.Kurosawa appears to have been heavily influenced by Laurence Olivier's Hamlet (1948). Like Olivier he uses a wide range of cinematic techniques to inject an atmosphere of despair and dread that could never be conveyed on the stage. An even more direct influence is the horror aspect \u0096 the meeting with the witch in Throne of Blood is particularly similar to the appearance of the ghost in Hamlet, right down to the eerie, distant voice.While it follows the story of Macbeth fairly closely, perhaps the biggest deviation is that it is Washizu's own men \u0096 not the approaching rival army \u0096 who kill him in the end. That puts a new spin on the study of power, making the point that a corrupt leader could just as easily be brought down by the people he commands. And there's another theatrical reference that deepens the point - the army assembled below the balcony in that final scene is more than a bit like an audience gathered in front of a stage or a screen. In other words, it's us who've got rid of Washizu! Kurosawa's technical direction was at its peak here and Throne of Blood is an incredibly fine and polished work. The creation of an atmosphere is really well done. You can almost feel the cold dampness of the fog that dominates the outdoor scenes. A particularly strong scene is the first one after Washizu has been made master of North Mansion. We see Washizu's men relaxing outdoors in bright sunshine, one of whom remarks that the lord and lady must be very happy now. We then cut to see the reality, as Washizu and his wife Asaji are sitting motionless and brooding in a dark, bare room. This probably was an influence on Francis Ford Coppola in his construction of the opening wedding scene in The Godfather.The camera-work in Throne of Blood does annoy me a little. There's too much dollying in and out in some scenes. Having said that, the dollying is used as quite a clever device in the scene where Washizu sees Miki's ghost. The ghost appears and disappears each time the camera returns to the point where it is sitting, as the point of view we are supposed to be seeing changes from Washizu's to that of the other characters.Throne of Blood is another finely crafted work from a master director. The only trouble with it though is that it doesn't have any fun or warmth to it, making it incredibly depressing to watch. Sure, it can be \"appreciated\" and it's occasionally mesmerising to watch, but overall it's nowhere near as enjoyable as many of Kurosawa's other pictures of this period.",

            "content": "Macbeth is a haunting play, and Kurusawa is always such an interesting character to make Japanese recreations of his work. Of course, in the process, he does change them a bit, creating something that is not Shakespearian anymore: it's Kurusawa. Some themes are altered, mostly thanks to the images that Kurusawa takes his time to study.Here, however there is a problem. It is quite lengthy. It's almost forgivable, because Kurusawa really sets the dark mood to a point when it becomes unbearable: it's so haunting that you almost feel sick. Mifune is incredible, his performance as Washizu, the loyal warrior who kills the king to take over his throne. It's excellent whether you know Japanese or not. I didn't really like the other performances, however, they were all pretty cartoonish and at that, static and monotoned. Again, I must say, though, that Mifune does a great job because he has got an evil face.The cinematography is overwhelming. The emptiness of the rooms, the majesty of the noble samurais, and the mystique of the sinister and magical characters and plot developments. The apparitions are quite admirable. The second time he sees the witch, the apparitions become scary. The way people appear and reappear: it's all mad, and you can understand why Washizu has become insane. And in the scene where, during a dinner where Miki was invited, but had been killed, Washizu sees his ghost, and it's an unnatural vision that is edited excellently on the spot. The camera moves around the set as it we were following Washizu's own destructions at the end of all that is evil, and himself.As I said, the photography is beautiful, and overwhelming. And example of this is when Asaji, now collapsed under the pressure of 'the deed', keeps scrubbing her hands because she can't get rid of the smell of his Lordship's blood off them. It's a very dramatic sequence, made even more dramatic by Mifune's brilliant performance, particularly when he hopelessly calls out her name. It is the prelude of the end here isn't Throne of Blood, whereas in Macbeth by Sakespeare, it's a secondary even that almost comes as a relief to Macbeth.The film drags on a little too much is a few sequences. The dialog is repetitive, and sometimes that can be frustrating. This happens quite a lot when Washizu and Asaji talk about the reasons why he should kill his Lordship. This is the only point where Kurusawa heavily relies on dialog, and it's a misstep.WATCH FOR THE MOMENT - Miki's apparition at Wasizu's dinner. His public breakdown. The clear beginning of his insanity and self-destruction. And Kurusawa's brilliant camera-work, aided by a great Mifune.",

            "content": "The film adaptations of Shakespeare's play 'Macbeth' of 1606 are indeed a mixed bag. The least disappointing of them all is that of Orson Welles' low budget version of 1948 but even that is weakened immeasurably by the ludicrous casting of Jeanette Nolan as Lady M. It is to be regretted that Laurence Olivier was denied the chance to transfer his highly acclaimed interpretation of Macbeth from stage to screen.It is left to Akira Kurosawa and his regular collaborators to give us what is indisputably the greatest NON-SHAKESPERIAN version committed to celluloid.Kurosawa has chosen to set this during the 'Warring States' period of feudal Japan which echoes the clannish conflicts of 11th Century Scotland. He has also taken the courageous step of utilising the austere and formalised acting style of 13th Century Japanese Noh drama. Dunsinane is now Spider's Web Castle whilst Lord and Lady M are now Washizu and Asaji.Washizu is played by human dynamo Toshiru Mifune who was to make no less than sixteen films with this director before their unfortunate falling-out. His is a larger-than-life personality and the mesmerising Isuzu Yamada as Asaji offers the perfect contrast in her sinister stillness. This is to some degree a slight weakness in the film as her face, in keeping with the requirements of Noh drama, has to remain mask-like. As a result the emotional dynamic is lost and the complex relationship between the two is under-developed. This is only a minor quibble as the films many strengths more than compensate.As with most of Kurosawa's films the Elements play a great part and the use of Mt. Fuji with its mists and fogs is inspired whilst no film of his would be complete without a torrential downpour! Asakazu Nakai is again behind the camera and Masaru Sato has contributed one of his greatest scores.The ghost banquet, the scrubbing of bloodless hands, the moving Birnham Wood. These linger long in the memory. What can one possibly say about the astonishing final sequence? Literally 'the arrows of outrageous fortune'!This is both a masterpiece of film-making and a further reminder, if indeed we need one, that 'Shakespeare is for all the ages'.",

            "content": "Having bravely fought off the enemy, Lords Washizu and Miki are summoned to the Cobweb Fortress by the Emperor. Lost on the way they meet a mysterious old woman who predicts that, following promotions this very day, destiny holds the throne for Washizu and that Miki's son shall be his successor. Despite her ghostly vanishing act, the two half-heartedly laugh it off \u0096 until they arrive at the Fortress and are rewarded by the Emperor with the very promotions the old woman foretold. Both are humbled by this but no malice exists between the friends. Washizu's wife convinces him to seize his destiny by killing the Emperor himself, which he does \u0096 blaming others and taking control. However it is not long before his wife begins to suggest that Miki and his son are a threat to him and Washizu becomes corrupted to his core.In a week where I watched Firewall, 10,000 BC and some trashy rubbish called Frankenfish, it is perhaps a bit rich of me to suggest that I am trying to watch more \"classics\" of cinema that I haven't seen rather than watching whatever dross is the least demanding. However recently I have been trying to catch up with the work of Kurosawa and hence me watching this version of Macbeth \u0096 a play I am familiar of but have never seen or actually read. Perhaps this is for the best as it allows me to come to Throne of Blood as its own piece of work rather than worrying about how Shakespeare differs. What Kurosawa does is make the story very accessible and easy to follow without losing the heart of the story in the corruption and madness of Washizu. The trade-off to this is that the characters are not as complex as I would have liked but it still works well.The lead performance from Mifune is a big part of this as he does a good job of portraying this without losing the \"sympathy\" (or at least \"interest\") of the audience. Yamada plays \"Lady Macbeth\" as cold and sharp as a knife, OK so her dialogue is not brilliant and she turns Washizu a bit easily but her visual tightness works. Support is generally strong although the film does belong to Mifune \u0096 as is often the case. Kurosawa plays out his story against a convincing backdrop. It did feel a bit sparse in terms of sets at times but this did work to the film's benefit by contributing to the cold, cynical edge of the material \u0096 suffice to say that there is no \"light relief\" either. He uses the fog and wood really well too; while the story is about the destructive force of knowing your fate, the fog stands as a symbol for not being able to see the future and ultimately it is (sort of) the fog and wood that brings Washizu his fate.Throne of Blood is perhaps superficially not as \"intelligent\" as Shakespeare but it is accessible and enjoyable, having stripped down the story to the key aspects and delivered them with strength. Kurosawa gets good performances and adds his usual class touch as director and the film has heat while also being overwhelmingly cold in some regards while the fog and labyrinth nature of the forest loom large as a symbol of the unknown.",

            "content": "When I look back on my prior reviews of Kurosawa films, I'm surprised that I've seen as many as I have. This one is my seventh, and though I acknowledge him as one of the film world's great directors, to me he comes across as an acquired taste. There are things that I don't care for in his pictures, such as the erratic and often over the top interpretations of his players, in this case Toshiro Mifune as Taketoki Washizu. There's also his overly long scenes establishing a mood or focusing on a character's face or body. These are all personal tastes of course, and I wonder if he would have told his stories in a more fluid way had he been born somewhat later.A lot of Krosawa's films also deal with Samurai or Japanese warriors, and his themes are similar as well. Like the principal character in \"Yojimbo\" and \"Sanjuro\", Washizu comes to rely on duplicity and cunning as he's compelled by his wife Asaji (Isuzu Yamada) to fulfill a forest spirit's prophecy that he will soon become the Great Lord of Spider Web's Castle. To do so, he must kill the current Great Lord and turn his back on a long time childhood friend.What I liked about this story, and I realize it's based on Shakespeare's Macbeth, is the use of supernatural phenomena like ghosts and ephemeral spirits. Lady Washizu's descent into madness attempting to rid the blood on her hands was an inspired scene, as was Washizu's attack on an invisible ghost that no one else could see but him.For all of that however, I do find it a chore at times to sit through Kurosawa's pictures. On the flip side, I've had better luck at times with a second viewing, as in the case of \"Seven Samurai\" and \"Rashomon\". That could be the case here as well, though it's not going to be a priority with me. Even with my negatives though, I don't mind rating this picture relatively well, due to it's excellent cinematography, intricate costuming and bold story telling. I can recognize those achievements aside from my personal quirks.",

Basically it is a loose and reversioned adaptation of William Shakespeare's Macbeth, set in 16th Century Japan. General Taketoki Washizu (Toshir\u00f4 Mifune) and his commander Yoshiaki Miki (Minoru Chiaki) have secured military victory on the battlefield, but they find themselves lost in the maze of the dense Spider's Web Forest. There they discover a spirit, a mysterious old woman, who foresees and tells them their futures, that they will be promoted following the victory, Washizu will someday be the Great Lord of the Spider's Web castle, while Miki's son will someday rule as Great Lord as well. They find their way back to the castle, and the first part of this prophecy does indeed come true, but Washizu has no desire to become the Great Lord, his ambitious wife Lady Asaji Washizu (Isuzu Yamada) urges him to reconsider. The current Great Lord makes a surprise visit to the garrison outpost, but Washizu's wife reminds of dangers that will come when he is again promoted to commander of his vanguard, pressure continues to mount for Washizu, and his actions lead to an inevitable conclusion. Also starring Takashi Shimura as Noriyasu Odagura, Akira Kubo as Yoshiteru Miki, Takamaru Sasaki as Kuniharu Tsuzuki and Hiroshi/Y\u00f4ichi Tachikawa as Kunimaru Tsuzuki.

Gives it a fresh look without changing the broader story.Solid direction by Kurosawa and a commanding performance by Toshiro Mifune (Kurosawa's go-to guy for many of his movies).Only thing that prevents this from being an absolutely compelling masterpiece is that, if you know the story of MacBeth, you know how the plot unfolds. This dampens the impact of some of the twists. It also makes some scenes seem overly long and tedious, as you want to get to the good bit you know is coming.

It's a really engaging movie yet enjoyable as well and that really culminates in the final parts of the picture to make a film not only interesting but actually exciting as well, the slight action involved is great, the remake of Macbeth is done well (although of course some fans of Shakespeare may not be best pleased by this adaption) and the acting is one that really shocks me because it almost feels like acting that would be still be great years and years after this was made.Of course the main actor and really the man who could even be said to steal the show from even Akira Kurosawa, is Toshiro Mifune who for me is a top actor, and especially when playing a samurai. Of course many will point to \"Seven Samurai\" and \"Rashomon\" as his finest performances and collaborations with Kurosawa, but for me never forget this one because he is very good indeed, out doing the entire cast and the movie without him would have possibly suffered greatly. I think without Kurosawa's directing you would also be seeing a worse off film because he really brings this to life and the story just bursts from the screen in the early moments and that heavy rain mixed with dense fog and swaying but eerily silent trees make this not only a great plot, but also ascetically incredible.I must mention of course the rest of the cast including such people as Isuzu Yamada, Minoru Chiaki and Takashi Shimura who join a cast who are relatively good but never good enough to match Mifune. The way in which Kurosawa's direction works is that he seems to just know how to make you focus on the scene, whether that is through a character gone mad, a battle or even the rain etc that I mentioned. When you add everything together it is Kurosawa who then surprises you, and this is in a story where you know how it ends, but it doesn't matter because not only is this set in feudal Japan, but also because Kurosawa makes the story fresh and lively. I'm not quite sure if this is his very best mostly based on the fact that Kurosawa seems to just make what people consider great movies over and over again. One thing I do want to say though is that if you're really looking for a great feel of a film, the kind of movie where you become entwined in the plot and the atmosphere, this is definitely one to watch of that as it just seems to draw you in at every turn. If your new to Kurosawa then this is a great place to start, it's not only really likable but also at times just a nice little yarn to watch, and of course to mention this is a great watch for any aspiring director who wants to learn how Akira seems to do it.I think as movies go this is one I maybe watched with slight apprehension over what to expect but came out very much liking it and it was really good as well. So there you have it, Macbeth set in Japan, a kind of movie where there probably won't be one like it ever again because it's just so different (and Macbeth in samurai set Japan). Wonder at the skills of Kurosawa and Mifune, confuse yourself over who is really the bad person in this, and don't try and look out for Macduff, he's apparently called Noriyasu now.",

            "content": "Akira Kurosawa's adaptation of William Shakespeare's Macbeth may feature a different setting but it keeps the context & essence of its source of inspiration entirely in tact, and is arguably the finest adaptation of the famous play on the film canvas. A fascinating meditation on the corrupting nature of greed & power, the film retains its effectiveness even today.Set in feudal Japan, the story of Throne of Blood follows a war general who, en route to his lord's castle, encounters a spirit who foretells him his near-future. When part of the prediction turns out to be true, he hesitates to fulfil the remaining prophecy at first but is eventually spurred into action by his ambitious wife, which in turn sets them on a path to destruction & madness.Co-written & directed by Akira Kurosawa (best known for Ikiru & Seven Samurai), Throne of Blood may have shifted the well-known plot to a different timeline & location but it is the Shakespearean tragedy right down to the bone. Kurosawa's direction is top-notch, for he follows the events quite faithfully yet manages to give the film an identity of his own with his creative & stylistic choices.Both the depicted era & Spider's Web castle is illustrated in fine detail. The greyscale photography is sharp & crisply captures the unfolding events. Editing is firmly carried out and steadily paces the narrative although a few moments could've used little trims. Music exudes a haunting vibe. And the performances from the entire cast is strong, especially Toshir\u00f4 Mifune whose formidable act ranks amongst his finest.On an overall scale, Throne of Blood is a terrific adaptation of Shakespeare's tragedy despite the many liberties it takes with the original, and is one classic that has effortlessly endured the test of time. Visually striking, narratively engaging & employing its minimalist approach to great effect, it ranks high on both Kurosawa's filmography & Shakespeare's film adaptations and will satisfy fans of both with ease. Definitely recommended.",

            "content": "Throne of Blood, or Kumonsu jo, was not the first film Akira Kurosawa made with Toshiro Mifune, but (if you discount the slightly Hamlet inspired The Bad Sleep Well) it was their one and only Shakespeare pairing. Macbeth, indeed, is a great match for them, as Kurosawa puts down the atmosphere like its nobody's business (so to speak), and Mifune puts all the cues down in the great 'Noh' theater tradition (usually over-acting, but for a purpose, to add a level of intensity lacking in Western productions). Some things are changed or formed off from Macbeth, the masterwork of a story of ghosts, temptation, and the devils in the greatest men (and women). For example, the supernatural elements are pumped up in some different ways, mostly for accessibility for Japanese audiences. Like the symbolism (as the DVD commentator says) of the crows 'caw' and appearance, and the strange appearance of the spirit that forecasts the doom awaiting the General and his fellow soldier in the fog-filled forest.Indeed, this is almost like Kurosawa's true Gothic horror film, in the guise of a dark samurai film. The violence, up until the infamous arrow climax, isn't as much as one might expect, but when it comes its often more in suggestion; Washizu (Mifune) gets his Lord title off-screen, with only a blood-stained sword as evidence. And when he does kill someone on screen, Kurosawa's camera is sort of away from the action, very linear and formal in composition, like a death painting or something. The ghost that appears to Washizu (chiefly in one of the best scenes of the film) is a real shock, but not as much as his reaction to it. Mifune is at the top of his game here, with a look of intensity that tops any in all the rest of his films (one pivotal, quick close-up of his face before his life-changing act is priceless). And, of course, the performance of the Lady of Washizu's, Isuzu Yamada, is perhaps the best performance I've seen to date of the archetypal figure of Shakespeare's work.It is Kurosawa however, and alongside with his director of photography (Asakazu Nakai, Seven Samurai's DP) and production designer (Yoshiro Muraki), who triumphs. This is a great film if only for the control of atmosphere, of the tightening claustrophobia and on-coming dread that pervades the story- the soldiers on their horses in the rain soaked forest; the fog that overwhelms them once they leave; the doom that surrounds Washizu in his home(s). And, of course, we come to the arrow scene, which is as frentic as the battle footage of Seven Samurai, with the over-the-top zeal of Mifune before this and during it that makes it jaw-dropping (Mifune has said it was for real). It's a show-stopper of a climax, but it is only part of a bigger whole. Like Shakespeare it is a tale of demons, of lust for power, of madness in a grip of a prophecy, yet it is also a kind of bleak, powerful film about what it means to have this power in the samurai system. It may lack subtlety (except for maybe a couple of key moments), but not longevity.",

            "content": "As I watched this version of the Macbeth story I had to ask myself would William Shakespeare have approved of this Japanese version? I think the answer would undoubtedly be \"Yes\". This version has its own moments and shifts that the other film adaptations did not and you have to credit the artistry of the filmmaker for that. This story takes place in Japan where a period of civil war was taking place called Sengoku-Jidai and Lord Tsuzuki (Takamaru Sasaki) has been having problems with some of his Commanders of his three fortress's. Fujimaki was the Commander of the North Garrison but he has betrayed his Lord and has joined forces with Lord Inui who is systematically attacking Lord Tsuzuki's fortress's and trying to overthrow him. Two warriors named Taketori Washizu (Toshiro Mifune) and Yoshiaki Miki (Minoru Chiaki) repel the enemy horde but get lost in the dense and foggy forest. They come upon a female ghost (Chieko Naniwa) who knows both of them by name and tells them about their future. They continue on until they make it back to their fortress and when they arrive they are honored for their bravery. Lord Tsuzuki promotes Miki and Washizu to Commander of the First Fortress and the North Garrison which is exactly what the spirit foretold.*****SPOILER ALERT*****Now that Washizu is in command of his own Fortress his wife Lady Asaji (Isuzu Yamada) starts to fill his head with ideas of killing his Lord because Miki will probably do it first and then he will be next. She continues to drum these thoughts into him until Lord Tsuzuki comes for an unexpected visit and later that night he murders his Lord. Asaji helps to conceal what has been done but Washizu is haunted by his own guilt and at times he even sees ghosts that haunt him. The only thing that can put an end to his rise as a Lord would be if his army finds out about his murderous deed. Akira Kurosawa does an admirable job of translating Shakespeare's story into Japanese and it translates rather easily. There were many instances of civil unrest during Japans history so this story ties in well. This is one of the more stagey films that Kurosawa has made but there are still incredible shots that you would come to expect from his films. Early on there are some very effective scenes in the forest as they come across the ghost. With the fog and mist this scene is very eerie and the ghost woman is well photographed as well. The performances seem more theatrical than usual and Mifune gives a different look than we have seen him before. He's not the strong silent type with the imposing persona like he usually is but he's a man ridden with guilt and easily manipulated by his wife. Mifune's Washizu is paranoid and not sure of what he is doing and he seems to take whatever advice he can get either by Asaji or the ghost. Who does come across strongly is Yamada as Asaji who wears the long Japanese gowns and heavy white make-up. Yamada has patterned her performance in the \"Noh\" style of acting. Noh is a form of Japanese theater where an actors movements are restricted by either clothes, masks or make-up and what is left is carefully selected movement or speech. Most of Yamada's performance is spent kneeling and staring as she instructs her husband to murder. Her character is much stronger in this film than in the original story. This is minor change that benefits the film. This is definitely not as great as \"The Seven Samurai\" or as unique as \"Yojimbo\" but this should still be considered as a terrific achievement by one of the greatest directors that ever lived.",

Acting by the lead male actor is mostly confined to grimaces (he looks like he needs a root canal operation due to all the scenery he has chewed on). The lead female actress employs an acting style consisting of monotonic line readings and a mask-like, unchanging facial expression. The real co-stars are the costumes which are spectacular (too bad the film was not shot in color), and in-camera special effects (especially the arrow showers at the film's end). Sets are OK, but exterior long shots of \"castles\" show structures that are far removed from restored/rebuilt castles of the period on view in Japan today. (Perhaps impoverished exterior sets are a result of budgetary constraints?) Subtitles are a bit long and often abrupt. Film score is fine. A highly not recommended film experience.

I would rather watch a movie like \"Throne of Blood\" any day over a faithful but stagy filmed play. This version of \"Macbeth\" MOVES; Kurosawa knows how to tell a story visually, and he takes full advantage of the play's opportunities for ghoulishness: haunted woods, opaque fogs, grisly deaths. Kurosawa regular Toshiro Mifune gets the Macbeth role and does well with it, but no one in the movie comes close to equaling Isuzu Yamada's performance as the Lady Macbeth counterpart. Yamada delivers a performance so intense and harrowing that you want to shrink from the screen when she's on it. Her portrait of a woman consumed with hatred and revenge to the point of near inhumanity is one of the most frightening things I've ever seen captured on film, and would alone make this movie worth watching if nothing else did.

            "content": "Literature and visual arts are two different things, and they don't have to act slavishly in relation to each other, meaning that film has to be, to use Greenaway's excellent phrase, \"an illustrated book\". They're interpretations as much as our reading, merely in a different medium.I really like Kurosawa as an interpreter of Shakespeare: he removes the language by which we know the works by heart, and sets them in eras and surroundings unfamiliar to us Westerners. What remains is the essence, the forceful dramatic pull of the stories. And what force there is. 'Macbeth' is seductively aggressive, full of ever-crescendoing, foreboding, atmospheric horror. The problem at heart is not whether to follow one's fate and not even whether this fate is influenced by good or evil, which should be rather apparent from early on. The problem is whether Macbeth can outwit the wheel that keeps turning, or seems to be turning. The tragedy unfurls from the predestined consequence that he cannot, and never could. Many consider the \"Late Kurosawa\" period, starting with \"Dodes'ka-den\" (1970) and perhaps reaching its apex in \"Kagemusha\" (1980) and \"Ran\" (1985) to be nihilistically cold and detached even to the point of sadism where the so-called heroism of his earlier works, especially of the fifties, is utterly annihilated and the world has fallen into chaos, and the sorry lives fall apart. Consider this film, then! It's made when Kurosawa and Mifune were, in terms of popularity, at the peak of their powers and fame. I think it's 'not' as bleak as his later works, but it is remarkably close. Knowing 'Macbeth' of course adds to the narrative of pain. There are many great scenes, and the banquet where Miki \"appears\" is among the most lucid: the way he builds up towards the climax is masterful, let alone the great sweeping long take that reveals and hides the ghost. The forest, of course, is a highlight, a place as unfathomable as the evil spirit that appeared there. It's fascinating the film appears here in Kurosawa's filmography, and I think it's a recommendable experience to advance from here not to the adventures of the sixties but straight to the two epics of the eighties that go as far as Kurosawa ever did in exploring the theme of cosmic pandemonium within the human soul that makes the whole world collapse.

            "content": "\"Throne of Blood\" is Akira Kurosawa's extraordinary retelling of Shakespeare's classic play \"MacBeth\" into a magnificent war epic masterfully executed, with the magnetic Toshiro Mifune as the lead character. Toshiro Mifune, at the peak of his collaboration with the Master.Mifune is not a star, he's a planet in the great actors' universe, and his interpretation of the samurai commander Washizu, will be forever graved in my memory. Mifune sublimated \"Throne of Blood\" as a fascinating character study of the iconic tormented soul whose future is foreseen by a spirit met in the Spider Web's forest. Washizu, with his friend Miki, learn that he will become the lord of the Forest castle, Miki lord of Fort One, and his son lord of the castle, too. Everything goes as planned, and Washizu becomes the powerful and respected lord of Forest castle as a reward to his bravery.The brilliance of the story is how beyond his strength, Washizu is a puppet whose strings are pulled by Asuja, his shy and respectful wife, played by Isuzu Yamada. Asuja is indeed the mastermind who'll govern Washizu's actions. She's like the little voice of the Devil that whispers in our ears the most envious and heinous thoughts, the one who'll shed the first blood until it gets so ineffaceable, Washizu will have no choice other than going against the prediction, until definitely losing the control of his actions. \"Throne of Blood\" is the tragic tale about the futile struggle against fate. Everything is written, and Washizu's future was already painted in letters of blood on the doomed throne \u0085 Washizu reminded me of Oedipus's myth in its implacable depiction of the inevitability of fate. When he encounters the spirit in a scene that swings between horror and poetry, the whole streak of events is already told. We know it will become reality, but the 'why' is futile and the beauty is in the 'how'\u0085 And like Oedipus, it's by acting against the prediction that he'll pave the way for its achievement. And by 'he', I mean, him guided by his wife who makes the spirit sound like an angel, by a pure exercise of contrast. This double influence torturing Washizu's doomed soul, a mix of self-awareness and refusal to resign, will provoke one of the greatest cinematic descents into madness ever portrayed in film, Washizu's reason as Oedipus' mind.Mifune's performance deserves all the praise. Remaking a Shakespeare's play is risky but if the price is to admire the magnificent acting of Mifune, it's worth every liberty taken by the Master. Never had Mifune hypnotized me so much, such a range of emotions powerfully portrayed that his performance is enough to put this film in Kurosawa's Pantheon. What fascinated me the most is the fierce vigor in Mifune's eyes, while the movement of his eyebrows and the way he stretched him are almost muscular, like a compelling virile force, while the black of his eyes is like the tunnel plunging you in the darkest depths of a poor creature's soul, a lost man who's good enough see the gravity and not enough to realize the futility \u0085 Drown in his own ambitions, Washizu, inhabited by a cruel thirst for power, will pursue his dark scheme until he reaches the breaking point into madness and cruelty. The more he tries to fight the prediction, the more it gets real. And as I said, the fascinating and gripping aspect of the film is how the demise ultimately happens.Maybe the genius of the film relies on that particular aspect: Washizu's demise, a crucial part of the story that makes us question the genre of the film. As Washizu and Miki speculate about the meaning of the spirit, hallucinations or ghostly appearance, viewer wonders if the movie is a fantasy or an epic drama. But I wouldn't dare calling this film a fantasy, without denying the supernatural elements, but if they inspire the actions, the movie clearly insists that it is human hand that perpetrate the crimes. Washizu sees his friend's ghost and we understand how devoured by fear he is, but for the audience, he's just a man losing his mind. The ghost can be even perceived as a metaphor for conscience like Asuja is a living metaphor for the devil who inspires hatred and jealousy. The fantastic element is accessory as illustrated in the fulfillment of the last prediction. It made so much sense, it inserted a deep element of tragicomedy in the story. And I really felt guilty for having been fooled.This is a tragic tale because of the certainty of the actions. It's all in the 'how' but we're clearly given a few hints announcing the fall of Washizu, his hallucinations during the dinner scene, perfectly portrayed by Mifune and his wife whose commanding reaction emerged her from the two-dimensional carapace she tried to hide in. The enemy lead by the son of Miki and Norayesu, Takashi Shimuyra in a small but pivotal role, is the only one who knows the forest ... with such confidence it makes no doubt that he will ultimately defeat Washuza.And even with the knowledge that Washizu will be defeated, Kurosawa manages to surprise us with one of the most unforgettable death scenes and turning points ever filmed. The climax, also known as the 'arrows' scenes, is the unforgettable element of the film that makes it among Kurosawa's greatest creations. The genuinely scared looked of Mifune is close to perfect, the whole scene is harrowing, so harrowing that the revelation of the 'moving forest' trick is almost secondary \u0085 but no less powerful.\"Throne of Blood\" is the quintessential tragic tale carried by a sublime performance from Toshiro Mifune. The kind of captivating and charismatic actors that lacked in Kurosawa's latest filmography, that lacked in \"Ran', that cruely lack in today's movies",

I should admit that I have never seen a production of \"Macbeth\" and am not familiar with Noh, but I understand that a key feature of the latter is stylized conventional gestures to express emotions, and the use of masks. Instead of masks, the characters wear stylized makeup.In transposing Shakespeare's play to feudal Japan, Kurosawa makes war the focus. The final scene - which should be one of the most famous in cinema history - poses the question: does war truly end, or does it persist beyond the actual fighting?

After an uprising against Lord Tsuzuki two of his generals, Washizu and Miki, return to Tsuzuki's cobweb castle through the almost impenetrable cobweb forest. After getting lost the meet a strange old woman/spirit who foretells their future; Washizu will be given command of the Northern Mansion and Miki will take over Fort One\u0085 this is not all; one day Washizu will become the lord of Cobweb Castle and later on Miki's son will be the lord. As they leave they wonder if it was all a strange dream but upon reaching the castle Tsuzuki gives them the postings the old woman foretold. Once in the Northern Mansion Washizu's wife Asaji warns him that if Miki were to tell Lord Tsuzuki about the prophecy he will attack them and when Tsuzuki turns up it looks as if that could be the case. Asaji persuades her husband that they must kill Tsuzuki. They get away with this murder but the sense of paranoia only increases when they are ensconced in Cobweb Castle; she is convinced that Miki will try to take the castle from them and when she becomes pregnant she is determined that the original prophecy much be broken\u0085 it cannot end well!Kurosawa did a brilliant job here; the story is well told and perfectly paced. It is also incredibly atmospheric; the near constant fog adding to Washizu's increasing paranoia and some genuinely spooky scenes involving the spirit-woman. Of course a great film needs good actors and Toshiro Mifune dominates as the film's Macbeth; Lord Washizu and Isuzu Yamada manages to be suitably unpleasant as Asaji\u0085 the Lady Macbeth of this story. While there aren't vast battle scenes or even prolonged sword fights there are inevitably moments of violence; most notably the final scene when Washizu is brought down by numerous arrows\u0085 a scene that would never be made the same way now\u0085 real arrows were shot very close to the leading actor! Overall I'd say this should be watched by any fan of classic cinema or those looking for a different take on one of Shakespeare's best known tragedies.",

The movie stars the recurring actor Toshiro Mifune as Washizu Taketoki who's Macbeth and co-starring is Isuzu Yamada as Washizu Asaji who's Lady Macbeth. Both did amazing performances, superb even and the rest of the cast was also great. It was much darker and the acting and characters fit the atmosphere Akira was going for, what we got was memorable scenes and great dialogue.Kurosawa's admiration of Shakespeare's work clearly shows, of all the detail he placed into it from direction, script, props and costumes, sets and well everything. It's cinematography is simply incredible making each shot visually stunning to look at and it's all mystic in away.Throne of Blood is a movie that will probably be better the second time, as you see more details and sees it different but for my first viewing I have to say it was an excellent experience and incredible movie, with the best thing of it was the direction and acting from Toshiro Mifune. From the movies I've seen with him, this is by far his best.",

            "content": "Akira Kurosawa's black and white 1957 film Throne of Blood (Kumonosu J\u00f4- literally Spider-Web's Castle) is a very good film, but not quite up there with the best of his films, like Seven Samurai, Ikiru, nor The Bad Sleep Well, despite its vaunted adaptation from Shakespeare's Macbeth. That said, the hour and forty nine minute long film, written by Kurosawa, Shinobu Hashimoto, and Ryuzo Kikushima, features one of the best performances by its star, longtime Kurosawa leading man Toshir\u00f4 Mifune as Taketori Washizu, the warrior who has the Macbeth role. Yet, in watching this film, I have come to the conclusion that while there is a minor influence from Macbeth, it is in no way merely a Japanized version of the Bard's play. There are just too many significant differences, as well as the clear power and influence of the Noh Theater on this film, which is absent from other historical Kurosawa classics, period films called jidai-geki.First off is the notion of determinism. In Macbeth, all the main characters have free will- they are just corrupt from the get go, whereas in this film the main actors either are fated, or- more likely, buy into the idea of fate so strongly that they live out self-fulfilling prophecies. This Orientalist determinism is at great odds with Western ideas of individual free will. It manifests itself in the fact that the minor characters in the film- despite whining about their superiors' flaws, are more or less apparatchiks, whereas the lesser characters in Macbeth are all strong willed, for better or worse. Also, the film is not only about the personal doom that we know awaits Washizu, but that which awaits his whole class of samurai warriors just a few centuries after this film is set- likely the 13 or 1400s, due to the absence of guns. Thus there is a sense of cultural apocalypse that looms- note the beginning and ending choral sequences, straight out of Noh- as well as Greek drama, and set on the steaming and otherworldly and post-Apocalyptic slopes of Fujiyama, whereas the play is more focused on individuals with internal rot, not their whole society. After all, the Great Lord Tsuzuki (Takamaru Sasaki). whom Washizu murders, was himself the murderer of the Great Lord before him, unlike King Duncan in Macbeth. The framing device lends the whole film a very Ozymandian feel.However, anyone who was entranced by the recent meager Lord Of The Rings trilogy should watch this film, for it defeats that whole series as easily as a samurai kills a foe with one stroke of his sword. Whereas it is more primal and simple a tale than Seven Samurai, it is far more interesting than the usual drama that Hollywood spews. Throne Of Blood may not be a masterpiece, but it is a piece by a master, and as such, it deserves an audience- preferably one with the intellect and ability to discern the difference between an adaptation and a derivation. Whether or not you feel it is a treatise on free will's failures vs. determinism's folly, and what side you come down on, will reveal much about yourself, and such disclosures are what all art strives to do, for after communication, revelation is one of art's greatest qualities.Lo!",

It's exaggerated movements and slow pace serve to illustrate the web of deceit that Macbeth readers are familiar with.Toshir\u00f4 Mifune is brilliant as Taketori Washizu (Macbeth), a Samurai that is pushed to occupy the throne by his devious wife, Lady Asaji Washizu (Isuzu Yamada), who made an outstanding Lady Macbeth. Mifune and Yamada made three films together in 1957, and it certainly shows in their work together.The black and white cinematography and the set decoration added to the feel of horror in this film.",

            "content": "William Shakespeare is the greatest English writer ever to live and arguably the greatest writer of any language. His numerous plays and poems have entered our society today to fluidly, hundreds of years later it is difficult to find someone who hasn't heard of him. In Japan, I'm sure the same can be said of Akira Kurosawa, possibly the greatest Japanese film director whose multiple successes have transposed internationally to make him universally praised.Here, we have a meeting with the genius of letter and the genius of visual. Kurosawa translated Macbeth to the screen and set it in feudal Japan with amazing backdrops and samurai action. As with all Kurosawa films, this one looks great, but there is something about Throne of Blood that is so well-made that it only heightens the experience to just sit there and look at the amazing set pieces, costumes, and makeup used to bring this dark tale of murder, corruption, and supernatural to life.Another staple of Kurosawa is great acting, and this is no exception. Toshiro Mifune, Kurosawa's muse is brilliant here as the Macbeth character, a man ambitious enough to want to rule, but foolish enough to let that cloud his judgment. Perhaps the finest performance here is the actress portraying Lady Asiji, or Lady Macbeth. With this being one of the best parts Shakespeare ever wrote, it was vital to find an actress able to bring her venomous personality to the screen. And she succeeds so well as the woman desperate to have her husband rule without any thought of consequences. It is wonderful drama to watch as this story unfolds and the stage is set for a final battle.If Shakespeare peaks your interest, don't forget to check out Orson Welles' Macbeth as well. But, also take a look at this Japanese adaptation. It is dark, twisted, and sensational. It is great cinema and shows Shakespeare's genius in writing universal stories and Kurosawa's ability to translate them.",

Normally he plays the cool, noble Samurai but this time he is the mad, hungry for power lord, that wants to become the next emperor of Japan. It's an awesome performances by him. Perhaps the main premise of the movie sounds a bit familiar, which is because it's basically being a Japanese adaptation of Shakespeare's Macbeth.It was the first time Kurosawa took on a Shakespeare play and it wouldn't be until 3 decades later that he would take on another attempt with his movie \"Ran\", that is an adaptation of Shakespeare's King Lear.I wouldn't go that far calling this movie the best Macbeth adaptation but I have to give this movie that it makes the story a very accessible one. You could say that the story gets simplified a bit and with its 110 minutes it's also a quite short movie. I feel that it's also an accessible Kurosawa, so when you aren't really into his movies or Japanese early cinema, this movie still remains a perfectly watchable and accessible one.Main thing about this movie is that it's a beautiful looking one. It's masterfully directed, with lots of eye for detail and its environments. The cinematography is great and the fact that it's a black & white movie also adds a lot.But also yet again, Kurosawa manages to tell a simple story in an incredible and intriguing way. The characters get developed and handled very well, which is of course also thanks to the fine actors portraying them.Simply one fine movie.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

After seeing the credits fade to I Live In Fear (1955-also reviewed),I got prepared to gaze at the throne covered in blood.View on the film:Dripping plans into the ears of her husband over how they can solidify their power as dollops of blood trickle out of her blacken mouth, Isuzu Yamada works with the film maker for the first time,and gives a terrifying performance as Lady Asaji. Inspired by Noh Theatre, Yamada gives Asaji unsettling slow body language movements, that increasingly moves closer to her husband Taketoki, as the forest moves closer to the castle.Unable to shake out of a trance from the spirit foretelling him that he will become lord of the castle, Toshiro Mifune gives a blistering performance as Taketoki,who as Asaji becomes mad over the inability to wash the spot of blood off her hand, Mifune has Taketoki descend into a paranoid obsession, with Mifune having Taketoki throw all loyalties away,to lash out at anyone he fears wants to sit on this bloody throne.Inspired by Noh as a method for staging his favourite Shakespeare play (with The Films of Akira Kurosawa by Donald Richie revealing that he originally planned to only write the script for the project), with The Warrior's Camera: The Cinema of Akira Kurosawa by Stephen Prince detailing the film maker looking back at the title and saying \"The composition of leaving a large area white and drawing persons and things only within a limited section of the space is peculiar to Japanese art. The influence of such pictures goes deep with us, and comes out spontaneously in our arrangement of composition.Reuniting with his regular cinematographer of this period Asakazu Nakai, co-writer (with regular collaborators of this era Ryuzo Kikushima, Shinobu Hashimoto and Hideo Oguni) /directing auteur Akira Kurosawa expands on the long lens wide-shots of Seven Samurai (1954-also reviewed) with a refine quality.Book-ending the film on the same shot, and holding back from big, emotional close-ups, Nakai and Kurosawa compose an ominous atmosphere that dip the camera with stylish mid-shots and dolly-shots into the large empty spaces of the castle where Taketoki and Asaji Washizu brew, surrounded by the ghostly sound of wind, lightning and birds, (a major recurring motif of the film maker), which crackle to Kurosawa's sharp, distinctive screen-wipes going back to the errie the Spider's Web Forest, where the spirit awaits to give Taketoki a new foretelling.Transferring the Scottish play to Feudal Japan, and not featuring the scenes of self-examination in Shakespeare 's play (with Kurosawa later saying on the play that \"The images of men who lived through the age when the weak became a prey for the strong are highly concentrated. Human beings are described with great intensity. In this sense, I think there is something in Macbeth which is common in all other works of mine.\")The writers superbly adapt Shakespeare's play into a a highly concentrated land of darkness, where the unshakable fog, maze of misery of the Spider's Web Forest, and lashings of rain against the dour walls of the castle, are manifestations of the black hearts the preying on those who might stand in their way Washizu's have, when sitting on the throne of blood.",

            "content": "A re-telling of Shakespeare's Macbeth set in feudal Japan, Throne of Blood visually captured the play's self-seeking and treacherous atmosphere whereas its characterisation is somewhat left to be desired.General Washizu and his comrade Miki come across an evil spirit who prophecies their rise with Washizu becoming Master of the North Castle and Miki will be Fort Commander. The evil spirit concludes that Washizu will eventually become Lord of Cobweb Castle, and that Miki's son will succeed Washizu. Washizu and Miki are understandably puzzled by the evil spirits' prophecy and initially disregards them. However Washizu with his wife Asaji become obsessed with the prophecy, leading to violent greed and malicious manipulation. Considering the heinous themes within Throne of Blood, one would expect the performances through characterisation to be riveting. Unfortunately the performances were mostly sub-par incorporating little depth to their characterisations. The performances felt as if they were being read from the script and using over-emphasised facial expressions simply because they had to. Even Toshiro Mifune's (Washizu) performance was mostly underwhelming. His performance gave little to establish reasons for Washizu's inevitable lust for greed and murderous desire. It is only when Washizu becomes haunted by those he's killed that Mifune's performance improved capturing Washizu's mental derangement. Isuzu Yamada as Asaji gave the only consistent performance. Asaji's subdued expressions and cold-hearted tone influencing Washizu personified her character which Yamada fully understood.Throne of Blood's strength lied in its visual representation. The opening sequence contained ominous music which was unsettling emphasised through misty surroundings where Cobweb Castle once stood, creating a mysterious tone relevant for the themes which followed. The visual representation was emphasised in various well-choreographed military scenes of enthralling action along with Washizu's climatic death scene directed with hallowing silence and long shots to encapsulate excruciating repercussions. Throne of Blood was a film that faired better in visually conveying its themes rather than personifying them through characters. However that is not to say Throne of Blood did not well adapted the origins of Shakespeare's play and in that sense its visual representation was an acceptable substitute for flaws in characterisation.",

The opening sequence alone, with it's haunting dirge, tells how \"Throne of Blood\" will end. It's just a question of how Washiza gets to that point.The supernatural elements are strong throughout the film (and eeriely believable), but they do not overshadow the all-too believable elements of human pettiness and greed. The true horror of this film is not that it happens to include dark omens, dire prophecies, and perhaps one of the most malicious evil spirits on record. It's true horror lies in the uncomfortable, unshakable truth of what man's ambition can lead him to.\nKurosawa wisely dispensed with or downplayed most of the events in Shakespeare's original that do not include the central figure of Macbeth, which allowed him to amplify the meanings of the earlier work. Toshiro Mifune is our tour guide on this slow crawl into madness. Though he is excellent in the role, the scene that stays the most in my mind is not about him, but his scheming, power-hungry wife, Asaji. Endlessly, she washs her hands of the blood that she touched the night the master of Cobweb Castle was slain. Though her hands are spotless, she can't keep out the smell of the blood--blood that she helped to spill.If nothing else, \"Throne of Blood\" reiterates something many a good horror writer has said before: man can be the greatest monster of them all.",

Kurosawa sets the tone early on with shrouds of mist on a stark landscape, and we know we're in for something special. Soon we see two returning samurai heroes (Toshiro Mifune and Minoru Chiaki) riding through the labyrinth of a forest during a rainstorm, where they meet a ghostly spirit (Chieko Naniwa). In a fantastic sequence, she speaks of man's transience in an other-worldly voice, and while turning her simple spinning wheel, foretells each of the men's futures. Mifune will eventually be lord of the realm, and Chiaki's son (Akira Kubo) will succeed him. They seem like a good fates to have, but the men don't fully appreciate the danger or subtlety in her words, something that will happen again later in the film.I love the scene where Mifune's wife (Isuzu Yamada) first starts planting devious seeds with her cold, calculating comments, her face emotionless, all while looking downward. He knows her suggestions are dishonorable and evil, and yet, as the horse outside in the background cants around in a circle, so do the thoughts within his mind. Mifune and Yamada are excellent and a study in contrasts, perhaps illustrating the different forms greed can take, one dispassionate and the other reckless, but both leading to disaster. The story of Macbeth is well known and so what happens isn't a shock, and yet, it's so well-told and transplanted to feudal Japan, the film is riveting. The period costumes were wonderful, and I loved the headgear the samurai wore. Kurosawa gives us a variety of visuals - the stark interiors, ghostly spirits, and armies charging into battle. Throughout it all, there is a dreamy, nightmarish, epic feeling to the film. Men with passions stirred, riding around in the fog, lost - what a brilliant metaphor to life and human folly. The scene towards the end, the one with archers hurling volley after volley of arrows at Mifune, is outstanding, and even more so when we discover that they were real arrows. It's interesting to think what would have happened if Mifune/Macbeth hadn't met the spirit in the forest, which set the wheels in motion with his wife. Is it inevitable, and tragedy pre-ordained? I think the story is telling us yes, and that in a larger sense, people invariably bring trouble and ruin onto themselves through greed, instead of simply counting their blessings and enjoying their too-short lives. William Shakespeare and Akira Kurosawa make for a potent combination.",

All this was portrayed in two good friends whose fate is about to change .... by an evil will.It is one of those ghost stories with a noble message that your grandma used to recite for you before going to sleep! Mifune did a nice job being on the dark side ... yet his moments of guilt do co-inside with the nice young man that we knew in Seven Samurai.Perhapse what makes this movie a classic is the story itself, less on the direction or the very negligible battle scenes.Overall: It is another movie that is absolutely worth watching ..

            "content": "Throne Of Blood (1957) :\nBrief Review -William Shakespeare's Macbeth through Legend Akira Kurosawa's eyes. Macbeth has been adapted many times not only in Hollywood but also in Asian cinema and regional cinema. What makes it a great story? Then it is dark shades in the characters and the dark theme of dark mind set in the dark world. It's getting too much dark here already. Jokes apart, but it's true. Macbeth is firmly a dark tone drama and may be that's why it is difficult to adapt it and present it in different way. I must say, Akira Kurosawa did better job with his original Japanese Classics than this adaption. He took the entire theme and converted into ancient Japanese culture. May be that's why he couldn't provide much to supporting characters which were vital part of the storyline. But i am happy that he gave spiritual and fictional touch to it which made it culture friendly for Japanese audience. It looks good anyways no matter which culture you belong to. I am seeing Toshiru Mifune and Takashi Shimura very frequently and mostly in the same director's films so it is becoming easy for me to understand thier talent. Both of them are fine in this film too. Supporting cast is okay because like i said they didn't get much to do when actually the potential was there. Kurosawa has been doing Great with his films during 50s and i found his life work truly amazing but i am bit upset with Throne Of Blood. It could be because i was very familiar with the storyline so the excitement was never built-up and anyways i was hoping for more from the legendary director. Nevertheless, it is a very good film of it's own because as i mentioned that Spiritual and fairy tale angle worked on its level. Overall, Throne Of Blood is another fantastic film and nicely done drama on the cliche topic of Excessive Greed.RATING - 7/10*By - #samthebestest",

            "content": "Having not read or watched Macbeth before, I wasn't sure exactly what Throne of Blood would be like, but it's about the best mix of Shakespeare and Japanese culture I could've hoped for. Kurosawa paces the film masterfully, with the battle sequences and interactions sharp and quick while also allowing the characters, particularly Washizu, space to consider their inner thoughts and desires. The central idea to me was the way perception and public expectation can be overwhelming psychological forces. When the ghost first talks to Miki and Washizu, it captivates both of them and they feel uneasy in part because of the knowledge that the other also knows and is watching to see if the prophecy comes true. As things start coming true, we see how both characters start acting in a way that reinforces that the events will keep happening. The ending was brilliant as it showed the fragility of public opinion and the power of groupthink - when Washizu is confident, everyone is behind him, but once the opposition takes advantage of the rumor by pretending to be the trees, public opinion swiftly turns on him. The fickleness of loyalty and thirst for power drives all the events of the film, and this is really well underscored by the final sequence mirroring the opening scene. At first, the fog and song gives us an atmosphere of unease and aggression; when we see it again at the end, we understand exactly what it means, that the cursed land is destined to have warriors betraying each other for power perpetually, as the spirits give the people prophecies which their minds cannot handle. The realization of the circularity of the land and the commentary on human's struggle to deal with prophecies or ideas they are convinced must be true are very well executed.",

On their looong horseride back to the lord's palace, they find a forest spirit that foreshadows powerful events in both their futures. Washizu will soon rule over the North Castle and Miki is to command Fort One. They of course don't believe it, but when they finally reach the palace their lord Tsuzuki gives them those exact positions of power. What follows is pretty much what I said with the Scar story line in the Lion King. This is more or less a fantasy drama with samurai commanders, is it good as a film? Absolutely! This movie was made in 1957, know what that means? No green screen and LOTS of real time effects. The scope of this movie is impressive. There's huge beautiful set pieces and these scenes with hundreds of extras charging battle fields. Production design is on point. Toshiro Mifune plays the lead as General Washizu and puts on a show. In one scene he'll have this menacing screen presence and the next he'll play terrified and confused, he shows a lot of acting range. The story is an adaption of Macbeth, which unfortunately means it's not too original. Where the movie wins is its presentation and how it tells the story. My favorite thing by far were the costumes. The samurai armor is beautiful and awesomely detailed. The pacing can drag for a bit too long for me though, it's about and hour and a half long but felt much longer. This is beautifully made movie that cinephiles can really appreciate. I wouldn't recommend to more modern casual viewers. 8/10",

When the initial prophesies come true, Washizu, goaded by his power-hungry wife (Isuzo Yamada) starts to conspire to become Lord and to eliminate his friend Mika's son as a potential rival. Thus, Macbeth, one of the great plays in the Western canon, is retold as one of the great films in the Japanese jidaigeki genre. Director Akira Kurosawa takes numerous visual and musical cues from Noh theatre and combines them with his usual elemental imagery (similar to the Bard's frequent use of elemental pathetic-fallacy), great sets and costumes, and some excellent action sequences (the film's special effects were directed by Eiji Tsuburaya, who four years earlier had created 'Godzilla', the first and greatest of Toho's kaiju). The cast, which also includes Kurosawa regular Takashi Shimura, is excellent but the standout is Yamada's incredibly creepy Lady Asaji, the ruthless wife of the easily-swayed lord, who frequently speaks in an eerie monotone, an image made especially disquieting by her corpse-like stillness and fashionably blackened teeth.

            "content": "The Japanese film Kumonosu-j\u00f4, directed by Akira Kurosawa, was shown in the United States with the title Throne of Blood (1957). The film is a Japanese version of Shakespeare's Macbeth.The internationally famous Japanese actor Toshir\u00f4 Mifune plays Taketoki Washizu (Macbeth). Isuzu Yamada, who plays Lady Asaji Washizu (Lady Macbeth), is not as famous outside of Japan, but she was considered one of Japan's greatest film and stage stars.Moving Macbeth from feudal Scotland to feudal Japan isn't too much of a stretch. However, cultural differences cannot be ignored. Kurosawa utilized the conventions of Noh theater for many scenes. Here, the actors tend to be quiet, both physically and verbally. For example, when Macbeth is wavering about killing the king, Lady Macbeth sits quietly, not facing Macbeth. Then, she says something like, \"If you wish to be king, you must act like a man.\" Similarly, after Macbeth sees Banquo's ghost, she tells him sarcastically, \"Admirable, my lord. You who would soon rule the world allow a ghost to frighten you.\"These words are every bit as forceful as the lines of Shakespeare's Lady Macbeth, but his Lady Macbeth was bombastic and shrill. Kurosawa's Lady Macbeth is quiet, almost shy, but she still gets the job done.The ending of the film surprised me, because I would have thought that Shakespeare's climactic scene between Macbeth and Macduff would be the perfect samurai ending to the movie. Kurosawa veers in a different direction. He makes a very interesting choice that worked for me, after I thought about it for a while.This movie, with its sweep and grandeur, would really be better in a theater. We saw it on a \"classroom size\" screen. I have to be honest and say that it won't work as well on DVD. However, if you love great movies, and/or if you love Shakespeare on film, and/or if you love films made by extraordinarily talented directors, you have to see Throne of Blood.

The first problem is that the film, and the characters are not nearly dark enough we get no actual depth. This is supposed to be based on Macbeth, but Macbeth is an unbelievably brutal and dark work, something that is only hinted upon here. I believe that Kurosawa over reached, he'd been hailed as a genius and the acclaim had clearly gone to his head. Perhaps I see things this way because I'm not a fan of his work, I'll be the first to admit he was a very talented man, but most are blinded by the cold and static nature of his films, he wasn't a quite poetic soul, his films where just dull. That's another problem, there is no real emotion in this film, and once again Macbeth needs this emotion if we are to care about the fall of these characters. The look and structure of the film is also a problem, the slow panoramic shots of the lush Japanese scenery and the slow, structured cuts soon become irritating. It's a nice change from Kurosawa's usual fast and furious battle scenes but it doesn't feel right for this film. I hope you take this into consideration when choosing to view this film, but if you want to see a true Kurosawa classic, see Ran (1985) instead.",

Unlike the usual smoke machines we're accustomed to with music videos or horror movies, Kurosawa's fog is a natural extension of the text.  What's even trickier is how Kurosawa frames objects--dominantly MacBeth and Banquo on horseback--in the fog, no easy task even by today's standards.  He also disposes of most of the romanticized elements from MacBeth--such as MacDuff--in exchange for a darker and more mature story.  Shakespeare never intended for 'MacBeth' to have a sunny day.

Many of his films were influenced by Western and in turn some of his films were remade as Western. But with Throne of Blood he turned to the Shakespeare and made a Japanese version of Macbeth.In a province of Feudal Japan Washizu (Taketoki Washizu) and Miki (Minoru Chiaki) defeat rebels against all the odds and are promoted with new lands. But they meet a Witch (Chieko Naniwa) who prophesise that Washizu would become the Lord of Cobweb Castle and Miki's son would succeed. Despite Washizu being happy with his new lands, his wife, Asaji (Isuzu Yamada) convinces Washizu to fulfil the prophecy by killing Lord Tsuzuki (Hiroshi Tachikawa).Besides from the Japanese setting and some changes to the text, Throne of Blood is a fairly loyal adaptation of Macbeth and keeps the themes of the source material. Throughout there is the theme of corruption and the seeking of power. There is of course corruption of Washizu by his wife who seeks power, leading to Washizu's personal corrupt, guilt and madness. But there is also an undercurrent of corruption and rebellion with Lord Tsuzuki also being a usurper and in Washizu's new lands where he is living in the shadow of the previous rebel. We see that Washizu is a good man who ends up descending into evil and it is a tragedy.As well as the personal corruption we do get an occasional look at the wider effects on the land as we follow some of Washizu's soldiers, we see that land prosper when Washizu follows that prophecy and falls into darkness when he defies the prophecy. This is play about destiny and following the social order, that if someone seizes power then accepting the natural order of live. This is of course because the original play was set in Medieval Scotland and it was written to welcome James I to the English throne.Throne of Blood has some great black-and-white cinematography as it soaks us into the misty mountain landscape of Japan, providing atmosphere and symbolising whether the land is in a good or bad state. There is also fine music from Masaru Sato as he gives us a percussion heavy soundtrack. And Kurosawa's editing was great at showing the flow of time as well as using tricks to add to the supernatural elements where people or figures disappear.Throne of Blood is a film that inkeeping with the tone and themes of the source material and an excellent adaptation of the play as it takes to a new settling without the need to modernise it.",

It goes to show when the one's thirst for power and the quest for honor are two different things. The two samurais are great warriors, when they meet the forest spirit, it appears that his words speak just as loud as his actions would. The results, the ultimate downfall of a warrior's honor. And I like the part when they said, \"The forest is alive\" which is the other warriors using trees as camouflage. That caused fear and confusion to the enemy. The samurai armor is really effective to the arrows, but one shot to the neck, and that warrior is done. It goes to show, one's thirst for control of the castle leads to dishonor and shame.

            "content": "I'm a big fan of Shakespeare but movies of his plays never quite translate the genius of his dialogue to celluloid. Here's a film which comes close. Throne Of Blood adapts Macbeth and it's relatively true to the play despite various liberties taken with the source material. Akira Kurosawa, one of my favourite directors, who was a big Shakespeare fan, is making this so naturally it's going to be great. And it is. While this isn't a straightforward horror film, many scenes such as the ghost appearing at the feast or the legendary death scene where the Macbeth character is killed with arrows, are so downright chilling they outshine any jump scare in modern horror flicks by a clear mile. The cinematography is great, and fog and rain have rarely looked cooler. It's a brilliantly directed movie, as can be expected and there's a real sense of artistry to it. However, the story and drama do not get lost in all of the smashing imagery and like the great play it's based on TOB is a sobering story about a man and woman who destroy themselves.TOB is not without shortcomings. It's a bit slow, like many other films of world cinema, and the pace could have been quicker. Kurosawa is great at shooting action, so the lack of this is slightly disappointing. Ultimately, this is more of a dialogue driven drama, but an excellent one of its kind. Toshiro Mifune is typically excellent in the lead role and there isn't any bad acting in the film. Despite deviations from Macbeth it's still a hauntingly powerful story and the emotional moments are well handled. Overall, the message of the play is conveyed well by the film through powerful dialogue and economical storytelling. The story is told without resorting to flat out horror or endless exposition. TOB is a very impressive adaptation. It's not as good as Ran, but then again, what is? If you're sick and tired of seeing bland and generic interpretations of the bard's works, than this is the film for you.9/10",

            "content": "This is a director's showcase, Akira Kurosawa showing off with all of his skills, adapting Shakespeare's Macbeth to feudal Japan while heavily using Noh as a source for visual influences. Everything is heavily stylized from costumes to performances, the play has been cut down to its core, and Kurosawa is in complete command of the entire production, giving us an ideal adaptation that retains the point of the original play while transposing it convincingly into a new cultural space at the same time. It's also wonderfully entertaining.The story is the same as the play, of course. A vassal to a great lord receives a prediction of his rise to ultimate power that he and his wife use to justify their actions which also leads to their ultimate downfall. The vassal is Washizu Taketoki (Toshiro Mifune) who, alongside his childhood friend Miki Yoshiaki (Minoru Chiaki), wins a great battle against the rebellious forces of Inui for their Great Lord Tsuzuki Kuniharu (Takamaru Sasaki). On their way to their lord's castle, Spider's Web Castle, they get lost in the forest surrounding it (Spider's Web Forest), and come across a mysterious evil spirit who gives them the prophecy of Washizu's rise to power and Miki's son's subsequent rise. They refuse to believe the prophecy until the first stage (their promotions) gets fulfilled that very night.One thing about this movie visually, it is very precisely designed. The first thing to notice is the heavy use of fog in the establishing shots of Spider's Web Castle, engulfing it completely and barely letting us have a clear look. The forest is thick with vines and branches, giving a visual representation of the eponymous spider's web in the forest's design. The ghostly image of the evil spirit (as well as the later ghost of Miki) is made bright white against darker surroundings, and the voice is some kind of heavily manipulated sound that doesn't quite match the mouth, giving it an otherworldly quality that is genuinely disquieting, especially in the spirit's second appearance late in the film.The sudden rise to power and the rest of the prophecy spark something in Washizu's wife, Asaji (Isuzu Yamada). In a movie of stylized performances, Yamada's performance as Asaji stands out for its stillness. There are moments where she's moving around and acting (sometimes even frantically so like the \"out damned spot\" scene), but mostly she resembles a porcelain doll. This is contrasted, since all of her scenes are shared with Mifune, by Mifune's near-inability to stay still. Both are given rather pronounced makeup regimes with Asaji bearing the pronounced and exaggerated eyebrows high on her forehead while also painting her teeth black (a common practice for wealthy Japanese women in their medieval period) while Washizu has an overstated set of facial hair and makeup that helps his eyes pop out of his face. Asaji's look like a porcelain doll feels somewhat ironic. She may be a weak woman physically, but she is the driving force for the paranoia that she implants in Washizu's mind.I have a well-documented history of despising prophesies in fiction, finding them lazy drivers for characters instead of finding ways to get them actively in pursuit of whatever they're supposed to want. It's no real surprise that I've always found an exception for how Shakespeare used prophecy in Macbeth, and that extends to Kurosawa's adaptation. The prophecy isn't a gameplan for the characters to follow, it's a question that they ponder over. Can they influence it? How will it manifest? When will it happen? These questions drive the husband and wife to make decisions they would never have made in order to fulfill their own private ambitions. The prophecy is an excuse.It starts with Asaji implanting the seed of doubt in Washizu's mind about the loyalty of his childhood friend Miki. One loose word from him, and the Great Lord could come down upon Washizu in his new post and kill him. Asaji convinces him that killing the Great Lord and becoming the Great Lord himself isn't a faithless act of ambition but an act of self-defense. The murder he commits gets blamed on Noriyasu (Takashi Shimura) because it was his men defending the Great Lord who then flees the country with the Great Lord's son. Miki vouches for Washizu to the council, and Washizu is declared the new Great Lord. Seems like Miki wouldn't have betrayed Washizu to me, after all.Still, the latter part of the prophecy is still out there, that Miki's son will become the Great Lord, and Asaji still has her claws in her husband's mind. Washizu simply wishes to announce Miki's son as his heir, but Asaji announces that she is pregnant, changing everything and leading to Washizu's attempted assassination of the father and son. Only Miki is killed, his son fleeing to join with Noriyasu under Inui, and the ghost of Miki visits Washizu at a great banquet. It's really striking visually with Mifune doing his best showing his character losing his grasp on reality.The great confrontation with Noriyasu's forces comes after Washizu goes into the forest to visit the evil spirit one more time, given the well-known promise of never falling until the forest rises up against him (the mother-born stuff of MacDuff doesn't get through the adaptation). The ending turns out completely different, eschewing any personal confrontation and instead going with his men turning on him. It's an interesting change that works quite well, I think. First is Mifune's manic performance as he watches his situation fall apart around him. It's compelling to watch. The other side is narrative, allowing a much tighter focus on Washizu that doesn't involve outside elements. His destruction is entirely his own. That's still true in the original play, but in the slightly abbreviated adaptation, it allows for the characters that would have done the action (namely Miki's son) to mostly remain on the side of the action without needing to fully build them as characters. When shaving down a source to fit within the confines of a 110-minute film, it's a good decision.Handsome, well-acted, intelligently adapted from Shakespeare, and otherworldly all at the same time, Throne of Blood is a great film. This feels like Kurosawa stretching his muscles both artistically and within the power structures of the Japanese film industry to make a large, esoteric adaptation of a piece of major Western literature. This feels like Kurosawa at the height of his power, doing something different, and finding great success.",

A loose interpretation of Macbeth, it's stunningly composed and shot, brilliantly acted and, oddly, very leisurely paced. Like a lazy stroll through a moonlit enchanted forest, it blends its more fantastic, mystical themes with a dark edge, setting it all against a hazy, eerie backdrop. Kurosawa veteran Toshiro Mifune is the inescapable center of attention as a power-hungry young general who's slowly, violently losing his mind. His rapid descent into lunacy is vibrant and ensnaring, especially when he's fully lost the plot, dodging arrows in the unforgettable penultimate scene. Although its deliberate, methodical speed left me sleepwalking a few times, that's a small price to pay for the riches it delivers in other areas.",

            "review_title": "One of Kurosawa's best...",
            "content": "Director Akira Kurosawa, without a doubt Japan's most famous director in the Western world, had an enormous influence from English language's best playwright, William Shakespeare, to the extent of making adaptations of Shakespeare's plays. However, unlike most adaptations of the Bard's works, Kurosawa's versions blended the plots with his many other influences resulting in very original stories that while Shakespearean at heart, were also very Japanese. Movies like \"Ran\" and \"Warui Yatsu Hodo Yoku Nemuru\" (\"The Bad sleep Well\") are examples of the results of this mixtures of influences, where the plot is deeply rooted the play, but with the rich Japanese culture filling the screen. Like those two, \"Kumonosu J\u00f4\" (known in English as \"Throne of Blood\"), is technically Kurosawa's very own interpretation of \"Macbeth\", but like the other examples, it is more than a mere adaptation of Shakespeare's play and actually takes the story to a new level by adding elements of Japanese Noh theater.\"Kumonosu J\u00f4\" means literally \"Cobweb Castle\", and that is the place where two brave generals, Taketori Washizu (Toshir\u00f4 Mifune) and Yoshiteru Miki (Akira Kubo) are heading to after defeating the enemies of their Lord. In their way to the castle, during a dark foggy night, they meet a mysterious old woman (Chieko Naniwa) who presents herself as a powerful spirit. The spirit foresees their future, revealing them that Washizu will be Lord of \"Cobweb castle\", and that Miki's son will be his successor, but before that, they'll receive great honors from the Castle's current Lord. After they arrive to Cobweb Castle, the first part of the prophecy fulfills as both are highly honored, and this triggers the ambition of Washizu's wife, Lady Asaji (Isuzu Yamada), who in turn convinces Washizu to betray his Lord in order to fulfill the second part of the prophecy. The ambitious Washizu obeys and soon finds himself Lord of Cobweb castle, but fearful of the unfulfilled final part of the prophecy.While certainly there is more than a little resemblance to \"Macbeth\" in the plot, the similarities remain only in the basic plot structure, as the story of \"Kumonosu J\u00f4\" (Written by Kurosawa and his regular collaborators Shinobu Hashimoto, Ryuzo Kikushima and Hideo Oguni) has more changes than the simply translation from Medieval setting to Feudal Japan; in fact, \"Kumonosu J\u00f4\" works more like a Noh drama put on screen than as a straight forward Shakespeare adaptation. This is not to say that the immortal theme of uncontrolled ambition is lost in the script, but here it takes a very different approach (with Lady Asaji being far more intelligent and cold blooded than Lady Macbeth), and with the element of fate being of bigger importance due to the setting of the story and the cultural differences.The elements of Noh theater are more prominent in the visual conception of the movie, as director Akira Kurosawa takes the highly stylized atmosphere of Noh drama and translate it to film. This atmosphere includes not only the slow graceful moves of the characters and the equally slow pace of the movie, but also in the gestures, the music and the overall atmosphere of the film. As always, regular collaborator Asakazu Nakai is in charge of the cinematography of the film, creating this atmosphere of desolation and impeding doom with an excellent use of the forest, the birds and the fog. Using Nakai's beautiful work Kurosawa literally creates poetry with his images, and while far from faithful to Shakespeare, he creates one of the most powerful versions of \"Macbeth\" ever done. The finale, while appropriately different from the play's ending, is simply a glorious example of both Kurosawa, Nakai and Mifune's work.No review of \"Kumonosu J\u00f4\" would be complete without talking about the superb acting by Toshir\u00f4 Mifune and Isuzu Yamada. As Washizu, Mifune shows his vast range as an actor by playing a considerably different character than his previous samurai warriors. Washizu is a man whose ambition is only equaled by his loyalty to his Lord, so the inner conflict in this character after he is finally convinced to fulfill his destiny is what drives the movie. Mifune is simply excellent in his portrayal of a man whose ambition is driven by fate, and consumed by guilt. However, while Mifune definitely gives one of his best performances in his career, Isuzu Yamada is the one who completely steals the movie as Lady Asaji. Her performance is simply breathtaking and of an almost supernatural quality. She is definitely the highlight of the film and it is not a surprise that this is her most celebrated performance on film.\"Kumonosu J\u00f4\", or \"Throne of Blood\", is a remarkable achievement by Kurosawa, and one of the best Japanese dramas of the 50s. However, its fame as a \"Macbeth\" adaptation may give the false impression that it's a faithful translation. People expecting an exact Japanese \"Macbeth\" will be sorely disappointed, as while the stories are similar, the explored themes are a bit too different for purists. In the same vein, fans expecting another samurai epic like \"Shichinin no samurai\" (done 3 years earlier) will definitely be disappointed as the movie is more drama than samurai action. The Noh drama style of the film may be probably hard to get at first, as its stylish method of storytelling may look a bit too slow to modern audiences. However, once the movie starts it's easy to get used to it and personally, I don't see a better way to tell Washizu's story than this.In his country, Kurosawa was often criticized for being \"too Western\" for Japanese audiences after the worldwide success of \"Rash\u00f4mon\" and \"Shichinin no samurai\"; however, \"Kumonosu J\u00f4\" is an example of Kurosawa making a very Japanese film that despite having its roots in an English play, it's very accurate in its portrait of the Japanese Feudal culture. \"Throne of Blood\" is definitely a must-see and a remarkable classic. 9/10",

            "content": "This is Kurosawa's adaptation of Shakespeare's Macbeth. While I am certainly not a Shakespeare expert but I still am aware of the story of the play. Being aware of the original play, I could pick up all the subtle as well as significant changes in the film. Kurosawa uses the basic plot of Macbeth, but actually ornaments the film with a lot of Japanese folklore using Noh traditions and Japanese/Buddhist mythology. Macbeth ends on a happy and morally upright note of good triumphing over evil. But 'Throne of Blood' ends on an ironic note and it is significantly different. Kurosawa uses a much more bleak ending than Shakespeare. The film explores the cyclical nature of men falling prey to greed which leads them to embrace evil ways and in a way it is implied that this cycle will continue forever. The throne will always have blood on it in a symbolic sense. The world will never rid itself of misery and suffering as long as human beings continue this tradition of being overwhelmed by a sense of greed. This is a bit of a contrast to Rashomon. In 'Rashomon' the entire film is about greed selfishness and the idea of losing faith in humanity. But Kurosawa ended the film on a very optimistic and humane note and the poignancy of that beautiful ending gets heightened when you consider 'Rashomon' came out only years after the Hiroshima/Nagasaki blasts. But 'Throne of Blood' doesn't offer the viewer any optimism ladled respite, but that doesn't take anything away from the mastery that's involved in the filmmaking.I don't need to say too much about Kurosawa. Everyone knows that he was a master. Like his other films that I've seen, this film is also visually beautiful. They way he frames his shots with meticulous details regarding the placement of the actors in a particular shot to visually express the mood is fantastic. Complementing the subtle shots are the trademark Kurosawa wide angle sweeping shots of armies and soldiers that are just brilliant. He generates a sense of fear and paranoia through the way he shoots the film. An example that can be cited to talk about the paranoia that runs through the film will be the way Kurosawa films all the scenes in the Spider's Web Forest. The movements of the characters in the forest gets obscured because Kurosawa shoots their movement from behind trees and branches. These branches and twigs are clearly made to look like a spider's web to make a visual symbolism of the characters(specially Washizu) losing their way and getting trapped in the spider's web of greed. The lighting, the smoke and the general feel of the trees and the supernatural elements of the scenes in the forest really felt creepy.Toshiro Mifune is again fantastic and commanding. He really commits to this character of Washizu. His eyes had an intimidating and fiery quality to them that makes it impossible to look away from them. He dramatically portrays the changes that take place in Washizu and it completely works. I would also like to give a special mention to Isuzu Yamada who plays Asaji. Kurosawa uses the character of Asaji in a very unique way and as a result she stands as a character on her own distinguishing herself from Shakespeare's Lady Macbeth. They way she moves, the make-up on her face, the way she speaks and the visual style used by Kurosawa in one particular shot of her does make her look like a ghostly figure in one sense, but even then in my eyes the character retains some elegance and dignity.My only complaint which is a nitpick is that the editing at the beginning is a bit bizarre and jarring. But apart from that the film is pretty much flawless.",

Not only is \"Ran\" also a Shakespeare adaptation (King Lear), but the filming locations of both films where in the neighborhood of a Volcano. \"Ran\"was shot near Mount Aso and \"Throne of blood\" in the neighborhood of Mount Fuji. Both films thus have also a visual similarity (black volcanic sand).Kurosawa adapted the story of MacBeth rather straightforward, but nevertheless managed to give it a Japanese twist. In certain scenes the music and the movements of the actors are very much like the traditional N\u00f4 theatre.Best scenes are in my opinion the two encounters of MacBeth with the ghost who foretells him the future. The landscape is foggy and mysterious. The language of Shakespeare is ornate ... and also mysterious.",

            "content": "Akira Kurosawa's \"Throne of Blood\" is a retelling of Shakespeare's \"Macbeth\" and as so, the story seems very familiar. It is a faithful adaptation of the classic story and Kurosawa utilizes his magic to create a tragic tale that is both haunting and triumphant in its own right. The story begins as Washizu (Toshiro Mifune) and Miki (Minoru Chiaki) travel their way through the magical Spider's Web Forest where, through the fog, they meet an otherworldly Spirit who foretells each man his prophecy. Washizu is to become Lord of Spider's Web Castle while Miki becomes Lord of The First Fortress and his son eventually will take over Spider's Web Castle. This scene brilliantly captures the ethereal tone of the film and sets up what is to come. The story of MacBeth deals with the supernatural. Kurosawa brilliantly blends the Western ideology with traditional Japanese folklore to create an atmosphere that is visually intriguing and original. The two men's confrontation with the Spirit is a haunting scene that is magnified by the men's acceptance that what they are seeing is a real spirit from another world. The vast fog surrounding them gives the feeling of loneliness and uncertainty. One thing this film has is a lot of fog. I found that the fog symbolized uncertainty of the future. We see the men riding off into the fog but we are unable to see what is ahead. Along with being a faithful adaptation, Kurosawa, nonetheless, made it his own. The entire cast does great but Toshiro Mifune is a standout as the war-hardened general Wishizu. Just the intensity his eyes give off is a scene in itself. I have yet to see a film where Mifune gives anything less than an amazing performance. Isizu Yamada is very good at playing his wife, Asaji. Some of the best scenes in the film are with those two. She convinces Wishizu to kill their Lord so he can take over the throne and fulfill his prophecy. Thus, the tragedy begins and a trail of bloodshed ensues...one bad omen after another. \"Throne of Blood' is a story of betrayal and we reach a point where we know it cannot end well for the main character. In doing research, I learned that Kurosawa incorporated elements of Noh Theatre, a traditional Japanese artform, which is evident in costume design, music and character interactions, such as the interactions between Washizu and his wife. The characters struggle with their conflicting beliefs, but ultimately the thirst for power wins. The film was shot on and around Mount Fuji, which has a rugged landscape and lots of natural fog. I thought it was pretty cool that Kurosawa decided to film there. The landscape works perfectly. The cinematography is very good too. For many outside shots, there is an eerie atmosphere that the fog presents and a rugged, uneasy view of the world. Inside shots are very balanced and calm, as we view the inside of a room from the outside framing. These contrasting shots say a lot. Akira Kurosawa was a master at making every shot count and here, there is no exception. It sucks you right into the world of these individuals and keeps you wondering what will happen next. The ending is sure to satisfy!",

And it reminds me of the scenes in the 7 samurai. But for me the whole movie felt a bit dated. I thought the rhythm was really slow, even for an old Kurosawa film. It is also predictable right to the last detail, even for a Macbeth ignoramus like me. And as is the usual case, a theatrical script is better suited for the theater, and it fails to amount to something superior on the Big screen. The lesson to be learnt with The Throne of Blood is that when man thinks he has planned his life to the last detail, usually the Gods (or the evil spirit in said movie)have the last laugh, creating havoc with his hopes, his attempts at manipulating fate, and his vanity. I find the 7 samurai and Yojimbo are infinitely more cinematic, more original and superior in every filmic aspect.",

This is one of them, and -- although I liked 'Ran' much better -- it's still a damn fine movie.Mifune is excellent, as usual; the camerawork is top-notch; basically everything you'd expect in a Kurosawa flick. Watching Mifune gradually come unglued is amazing: first, when he kills His Lordship and must have the blood washed away from his hands; later, when he begins doubting Miki's friendship; when he confronts the spirit for the second time, etc. All leading up to the moment where the forest *does* indeed move to attack him and he is slain by dozens upon dozens of arrows. The forest scene was very good; I tried squinting to see if I could figure out how they were doing it or if any people were visible (the idea of his enemies using branches and the like to sneak up behind *did* occur to me at that point) but, quite frankly, it was done so well especially(for that period) that if I saw it, I would no doubt be as frightened as Washizu was.The moral of the story, as detailed in the opening and closing scenes, is a simple, but righteous one. Since I now own a copy of this film I look forward to seeing it again. Now that I know the outcome of the story, the real test of this movie's longevity will be in seeing/studying how effectively Kurosawa shows Washizu getting from beginning to end.I'm guessing pretty well.",

            "content": "Macbeth contains some of the most hauntingly vivid images of English literature; the bloody dagger immobilised in the air, the ghostly apparitions of the witches and a dear old friend, and that surprise that so much innocent blood could spill out of the good king Duncan, that great oceans cannot wash away this sin. Kurosawa's first of his three Shakespeares takes these powerful words and in his own style makes them terrifying. The Noh influence is clear. The three witches putting on a musical display (for the king patronage) and brewing devilish concoctions becomes a single sitting figure, powdery white, transfixed upon the spinning wheel and yet spouting haunting predictions of fate and power. Yamada's Lady Macbeth (the Waki) doesn't wear a literal Noh mask, but her face is ghostly white and might as well be frozen, unblinking and still. She settles in her eerie stance, and uses quiet lines to manipulate her husband. Watch as she turns his inward ambition and lust for power into action like the witch does with a simple phrase: \"I do not agree.\" As she directs Washizu, the silence is penetrated by those sinister swishes of her silk trousers as she slides across the floor. Oh, it makes it so worth it when she crumbles in sight of the blood. The flute and drums burst in when Washizu is named Lord of the Northern Garrison, confirming the prophesy in his mind, and when Lady Macbeth is confronted with that sea of spilled blood, there's no Shakespearean dialogue, but a flutter of panic and fright in the stylised gestures. Washizu's frenzied slashes of his katana when Miki's ghost appears exhibit the same influence behind his demonic mask-like glare that seems ever present. This is a film that personifies visual dread. A plentiful of scenes are consumed by a thick fog, none more-so than the few minutes of nothing but riding where Washizu and Miki gallop around in a field that has utterly no escape. They careen around and around, riding up towards the camera before turning another way in futility. Earlier as they navigate the Spider Web's Forest, Kurosawa utilises the elements as he always does; the torrential rainfall pours down upon the pair, the thunder crashes and bangs, and the camera tracks them from behind a tangled mass of tree trunks and branches, as they hurriedly try to escape this storm. For all his ambition and might and military prowess, Washizu is not a man of great foresight, this seems to signal. Throne of Blood is bookended by a haunting youthful chant depicting a ruined castle, warning of the dangers of delusion and desire for power. This adds an extra layer of foreboding after the witch's premonition of Miki's royal offspring; absolute power corrupts absolutely. Fog billows into the castle, a flock of birds signal ill omens, but that classic cackle dissuades them all of worry. It is said that real arrows were shot at Mifune in that climatic betrayal. Whether it is this real horror in Mifune's face or a fantastic performance does not matter. It is a ominous ending as he shrieks in full disbelief of treason to kill the great lord and of the forests rising; his eyeballs seem to almost pop right out in frenzied terror. Power have consumed him, and he does not realise the irony of his accusation. There is a low-angle shot just before the shower of arrows, that is traditionally used to signal power and dominance, yet Washizu is considerably tiny on top of the tower, thundering down at his army to hold their ground. How indeed does treachery rear its ugly head. If anything could top this it is the reveal of the armies clutching those trees, branches billowing in the fog and breeze. No theatre production could ever match this image in its sheer scale and captivation. The Great Birnam Wood is truly coming for him.",

Now I can understand why Toshiro Mifune was considered one of the best Japanese actors.I usually do not enjoy black and white old films. Nevertheless even though I started this movie with the intention of just watching some parts for memories' sake, I was glued to the sofa until it ended...then I let out a \"Wow...\".PS and yes, I was hoping to see the creepy parts, and yes again... They are still creepy!",

            "content": "Throne of Blood is Akira Kurosawa's adaptation of William Shakespeare's play Macbeth. This adaption sees the classic story transported to feudal Japan, a change that worked to the films advantage as the themes of honour and betrayal felt more authentic and consequential. As with all Kurosawa films it's impeccably shot, the film has an epic, grandiose scale. The cinematography is atmospheric and the use of nature and weather help to bring life to the film.The film stars Toshiro Mifune as Taketoki Washizu a samurai warrior who along with his close friend Yoshiteru Miki (Akira Kubo) come across a spirit in the woods. The spirit prophesied that Washizu shall become ruler of cobweb castle and that Miki's son will rule after him. Leading to him becoming fearful of eventually being usurped. The film follows the play fairly closely with none of the major events being drastically altered.The characters in the film are given deep characterisation. They all felt unique with distinct personalities. The standout in the film was Isuzu Yamada as Lady Asaji Washizu. She gives a brilliant, conniving snake like performance. Her whispers and manipulations in her husbands ear felt natural and authentic. You see the wheels of mistrust turn in Washizu's mind as her words begin playing on his mind, confirming that he needs to take action before being betrayed himself.Throne of Blood is one of the best Shakespeare adaptions I've seen. It's also one of Kurosawa's most accessible films. There's not a-lot too add that people haven't already said, only that Throne of Blood is a bona fide classic.",

            "content": "Akira Kurosawa, Toshiro Mifune, feudal Japan, and samurais. I've seen this scenario many a time, and each time it still remains awesome. Throne of Blood was a film released during Kurosawa's hayday and it is one of multiple William Shakespeare inspired films. The film is based on Shakespeare's Macbeth, a story of greed, corruptibility, as well as witchcraft and wizardry. Kurosawa regular, Toshiro Mifune, stars as Washizu, an ambitious lord who stumbles upon a spirit in the forest that tells him he will one day be Emperor. Determined to fulfill this prophecy, Washizu ruthlessly plunders his way up the hierarchy of the land, losing friends and making enemies along the way in this tragic tale of the corruptibility of man.Throne of Blood has everything you should expect from Akira Kurosawa. It is Kurosawa in his greatest comfort zone, samurai stories. Thus, what Throne of Blood delivers is more great samurai warrior action told through a grand scope full of epic sets and costumes. Kurosawa flaunts his dedication to authenticity via his period appropriate production design that enthralls us within this glorious time period. But amongst the grand visual prowess of the film, Kurosawa never loses his knack for great storytelling. He, as always, does a magnificent job at keeping his tightly woven and rigidly structured narrative that always proves interesting and never has the makings of anything less than genius storytelling.Throne of Blood doesn't possess the kind of emotional power that some of Kurosawa's other films have, but it is still nothing short of awesome. This is an incredibly fun film with a magnificent look that shows Kurosawa's love of filmmaking, as well as a perfectly told story that exemplifies Kurosawa's equal love for storytelling. It also possesses many of the Kurosawa regulars who all give powerhouse performances that, while seeming a little over the top, are simply great. Throne of Blood is Akira Kurosawa doing what Akira Kurosawa does best.",

Rather, it seems that he is not trying to write a good movie script.\nToday's movie script has its theory that a character meet a crisis and he do against it. But this story, the character is follow his doomed destiny. it of course become boring as usual.\nSince the original is the stage, it is a script that is conscious of the stage. So it's too plain as a movie, and the parts that are too explanatory are quite noticeable. For example, how a young man who escaped the crisis is angry afterwards is usually drawn in the script. By not taking out the camera from the castle and forest, it gives the illusion that we are only seeing a limited aspect like seeing of the stage. Akira Kurosawa made such a wonderful movie from a script with such restrictions.\nI think the greatness of this movie is at its slow pace. The story itself goes very quickly, scene to scene, but each scene goes very slowly. The exquisite production is wonderful. The camera is basically stationary, but occasionally moves like a living creature. The balance of the camera works between static and dynamic is wonderful.\nOr Toshirou Mifune wearing armor is superb and well photographed. In the first half, the armor is taken up from a beautiful angle to cover the boredom of the beginning of the story. At around the climax, Kurosawa intentionally suppress it and use extreme resounding and the like to avoid taking it from the front. And at the very end, it is taken beautifully from the front ... I dare to express that scene as beautiful ... it gives a catharsis to audience. In addition, the castle model and the camera work to show the photograph beautifully, the beauty of the movement of soldiers, horses, soldiers' flags, etc. are extremely impressive.\nI appreciate that the best movies are those that are creating new atmosphere. This is one of the most amazing movies and one of Akira Kurosawa's representative masterpieces. And it is the movie that Toshirou Mifune's talent is the most brilliant.",

            "content": "In Throne of Blood, Akira Kurosawa transposes Shakespeare's Macbeth to Mount Fuji, among the clanking thanes and brutish politics of feudal, war-torn Japan, adapting it as a hyper-stylized Noh drama. Thankfully, Kurosawa crafts the conceits into a visceral, bloody supernatural drama devoid of creative hubris and breathtaking in its beauty, cruelty and virtuous storytelling. The result is a powerfully imaginative visual descent into the hell of greed and superstition, which strips away the Bard's introspective soliloquies, instead fusing imagery and sound to convey an atmosphere of doom and fury.The story is set sometime in the 16th century, an era in which feudal Japan was constantly crumbling beneath power struggles and treason. As the film opens, the great warrior, Washizu (Toshir\u00f4 Mifune, compelling as always) is first seen returning from a successful battle alongside his fellow general Miki (Akira Kubo). While riding through the knotted labyrinth of the Spider's Web Forest on their way back to their lord's castle, they come upon a white prophesying spirit, occupying a mysterious cage, consistently spinning loom who tells them they will both rise to prominence. She predicts, in a tone just short of mocking, that Washizu will soon become the warlord of Spider's Web Castle, thus suggesting he will murder the current ruler, but his reign will be interrupted when Miki's son takes over. Washizu tries to ignore the prophecy, but his shaky good intentions are no match for his insidious wife Lady Asaji (an absolutely sinister turn by Isuzu Yamada), who's vaunting ambitions push him to perform treacherous acts at every turn. Urged on by his perfidious wife, Washizu begins to eliminate his opponents to consolidate power, which eventually entails him murdering the lord of his clan and assuming full power. With each step Washizu takes, he becomes less and less human, eventually convincing himself that he is, in fact, invincible. A belief that eventually leads to his downfall!Throne of Blood defeats categorization. It remains a landmark of visual strength, permeated by a particularly Japanese sensibility, and is possibly the finest Shakespearean adaptation ever committed to the screen. Kurosawa captures the spirit of Shakespeare's writing, as the shrouding shadows, translucent mists and screeching animals lend metaphorical weight to this tale of murderous human ambition, creating an all-pervading sense of doom, By painting his characters with both soft devilry and desperation, Kurosawa almost exposes their internal rotting better than Shakespeare himself. Throne of Blood remains a full-throated, swiftly kinetic adaptation of Shakespeare's 'Macbeth' - a bloody, eerie, visceral masterpiece that lithely weaves Shakespeare's fluid lyricism with a distinct Japanese flavor. While staying faithful to the spirit of Shakespeare's work, it achieves a dark individuality that most adaptations can only dream of.",

Every detail of the warriors' armor and other outfits comes through, and the visual mastery that Kurosawa displays doesn't make one wish for color in any way.\nThe storyline is, of course, Macbeth, transplanted into medieval Japan. While Kurosawa doesn't try to duplicate Shakespere on a scene-by-scene basis, he certainly succeeds in capturing the essence of the earlier play, and Mifune gives another virtuoso performance. Because the story is performed in an intentionally-formal style (based on the Japanese Noh theater tradition), this movie may be one of Kurosawa's least-accessible for western audiences, but the familiarity of the storyline draws you in, and the visual lavishness and top-notch performances will keep you there.

            "content": "One of a number of films that Akira Kurosawa made in the 1950s and which have become classics, THRONE OF BLOOD is the director's adaptation of Shakespeare's Macbeth, set in feudal Japan but showing that lust for power is a perennial feature of human society. Washizu (the Macbeth character, Toshiro Mifune) is a soldier serving the lord of Spiders-Web Castle. While riding through a forest with his comrade and childhood friend Miki (the Banquo character, Minoru Chiaki), they come upon a forest spirit that foretells an elevation in rank for the two, and eventually Washizu's reign over Spiders-Web Castle. While Washizu denies that he has any desire to seize the throne, the forest spirit could see into his heart, as can his wife Asaji (the Lady Macbeth character, Isuzu Yamada) who spurs him on to murder any potential rivals. Thus Mifune moves inextricably towards his own elevation, but also his own fall.Although the film is an adaptation of Shakespeare, the way the actors move before the camera owes much to the Japanese theatre called Noh. So much of the film is carried by the powerful facial expressions of the main actors: the over-the-top snarls and gasps of Mifune; the sad mien of Chiaki, as if his character is already aware of his fate; and the chilling calm of Yamada, a coldblooded killer even if she doesn't personally murder anyone but has others do it. Kurosawa's set design is elaborate, one really feels back in Edo Japan. Furthermore, by shooting the film in a bleak part of Japan with abundant fog, the landscape powerfully mirrors the predicament in which the characters find themselves.This is one of those films that any Westerners with a solid liberal arts education (by which I mean at least some general knowledge of Macbeth) should see and will probably enjoy. Because it is based on a universal theme that just happened to be so well packaged by Shakespeare, the plot is straightforward and engaging in spite of the exotic setting. But because viewers can so easily follow that plot, the feudal Japan dressing with its distinct mores will prove a fascinating touch, and Kurosawa has depicted this world in rich detail. I don't know if postwar scarcity was still a thing in 1956 when Kurosawa shot THRONE OF BLOOD, but it seems like no expense was spared here.",

            "review_title": "The Fourth Masterpiece",
            "content": "When discussing Kurosawa, most fans point to his three masterpieces: Ran, Rashomon, and Seven Samurai.  Without disputing the validity of any of the films on the list, Throne of Blood certainly belongs with the Holy Trinity on any retrospective of the director's greatest works (one could also argue for the inclusion of High and Low, but that's a different discussion altogether).Visually, Throne of Blood will be immediately recognizable as a Kurosawa film to anyone who has seen Ran.  He utilizes the same epic scale to represent the relative smallness of these otherwise larger-than-life characters when placed in nature, presenting all human ambition as the highest form of folly - a theme that appears in much of his later work, and that meshes perfectly with Shakespeare's own moral in Macbeth.  The filmmaker's ability to express grand themes without extensive dialogue is already well-documented, but is usually seen as a skill developed later in his career, sometimes noted by pointing out the differences between the dialogue-driven narrative in early works such as Rashomon with the more visceral story-telling in such films as Dersu Uzala and, of course, Ran. While it's certainly true that the more visual style was a hallmark of his later films, Throne of Blood clearly shows us that this was not exclusively a talent that grew with age and experience.Even without the amazing visual aspects of the film (including, but not limited to, cinematography), Throne still stands as a grand example of a master storyteller surrounding himself with the ideal cast and crew to produce that rarest of films - the personal epic.  In contrast to other attempts (Gladiator, Titanic, et al) to personalize well-worn epics, Kurosawa never loses sight of the human qualities that drive the action in Macbeth.  Cupidity, machismo, and the manipulation of others others to achieve an evil end are all explored in even greater detail than in the original play.Interestingly, Throne of Blood also makes the Macduff character (here called Miki) complicit with Macbeth(Washizu)'s schemes - perhaps the most profound deviation from the original.  This probably had much to do with Kurosawa's own view of post-war Japan, and the silent majority that allowed what he saw as the dehumanizing effect of corporate cultural dominance to take hold (another recurring them in Kurosawa's later works).  Miki is not excused through ignorance - he is fully aware of what has transpired, as are all of the soldiers on both sides of the battle.  This adds an interesting twist to the old story; nobody is innocent, and none are excused from culpability.A few final notes (each deserving more consideration):  the acting, while highly stylized (I jokingly refer to the film as Kabuki Macbeth), is often brilliant.  Minoru Chiaki was outstanding as the conflicted Miki, and Toshiro Mifune was, of course, outstanding.  Special consideration has to be given to Isuzu Yamada's Lady Washizu, by far the finest portrayal of Lady Macbeth that I've seen - and I can't imagine one better.  She dominates the film in every scene she's in, and her every word drips with venom and duplicity.  Also notable is the climactic scene in the movie (****spoiler, if you've been living in a cave for the last 400 years and don't know the story****), where the source of Macbeth's death elicited an audible gasp from the audience when I saw the film - this 46 years later, in the post-Exorcist age.  In the end, Throne of Blood is easily the finest film version of Macbeth, and even surpasses the original in many ways.  For any fan of Kurosawa, this belongs on any list of his finest films.",

This only accounts for you, for you telling the superego, but also have your fellows. The work of great literature that it was William Shakespeare, speaking of these things and \"Macbeth\" is a treatise on the struggle that occurs in men between instinct (desire for power) and reason (the point of balance). Intense dialogue and the highest eloquence characters palace with his deep contradictions and ambitions to the surface, and facts that lead, inevitably, to the results to the dictates of reason, make this book the highest point of world literature that summons his knowledge so essential. With all the slack in the film artist par excellence, the Japanese director Akira Kurosawa made his version of \"Macbeth\", here called \"Throne of Blood\", approaching the English genius with images so expressive that, at times, beyond words and achieve that, meaning and what confronts Shakespeare, remains intact in its main aspects.Adapted to Japanese culture, they change names and minor events (and not three witches but an evil spirit only), the end of Macbeth (here Washizu) and Lady Macbeth (Asaji) have other connotations... and for purely cinematographic accord priority for action regardless of long dialogues, but the substance remains vivid, shocking and fascinating. The rigor of its staging, with that creepy castle more than monumental, with such thick fog that account for the deep shadows that loom over this underworld built with much blood spilled by warriors and innocent, with those slow movements denoting the heavy burden of pending actions, and those characters and some ghostly features blurred by the lust for power in others, result in a work of high aesthetic value and never to be forgotten.

I cannot overstate how much I love and appreciate Kurosawa's direction for Throne of Blood with haunting atmosphere brought about by fog filled forests and eerie spaces of isolation. Whether characters are aimlessly riding horseback, wandering through the forest on foot, or pacing back and forth in their room, Throne of Blood is rife with suspense.

And back, talking about Throne of Blood, this film is just amazing. I mean, fantastic. Arguably the best adaptation so far of a Shakespeare work. And this is saying a lot, because to start with I only read Macbrth: because of that film specifically. And is pretty much a perfect adaptation, but not only in transferring the values of the book to the big-screen, but also converting all the western values to the eastern values in an impeccable way And yes, It don't has all the poetry of Shakespeare, but the gritty and creepy atmosphere and the story telling is on par with the classic, no doubts about it. And talking about atmosphere, the cinematography is excellent, I mean, the film was made in the 50s and has great and beautiful shots made with ease, something that good part of the films nowadays can't accomplish.I also want to talk about the acting. Toshiro Mifune really gained me, he is really a goddamn great actor. Some would say that his acting is cartoonish, well, I can't argue, but in no way is 'out of the place' in the film.

In it he combines a lot of his trademarks - Samurais, Shakespeare, evil women, rain - and creates a ghostly story about one ambitious man's rise and fall.Speaking on a purely visual level, this film looks great. Feudal Japan is once again brought vividly to life but unlike a lot of his work, Throne of Blood has a considerably more gloomy atmosphere to it. This is not the rich palette of colour that made Ran so striking; Japan here is mist-laden and largely empty, barren hills and torturous forests eerily devoid of life. At the centre is the notorious Cobweb Castle, an imposing structure rising out of the ash slopes of Mount Fuji that appears to have been built on mounds of the dead. It's a fitting tone for the unfolding story; the once loyal Samurai Washizu (long time Kurosawa collaborator Toshiro Mifune) being tempted into treachery by his scheming wife after encountering a malevolent spirit in the forest. Soon, Washizu is Lord of Cobweb castle, but the spirit continues to haunt him and rival Samurai clans are keen to take his lands for themselves.Surprisingly for a Kurosawa film though, there isn't that much action in it. The film opens with the aftermath of an epic battle but you never see any genuine combat. Later, Samurai armies march through the forest to attack the castle but the film ends before they arrive. This may not bode well with those who yearn for the frantic hack and slash of The Seven Samurai or Yojimbo, but it does allow Throne of Blood to function as more of a character piece. So while viewers may not necessarily agree with Washizu's actions, we still get a full illustration of why he follows them through; his sense of honour clashing with the fundamental drive to stay alive.Shame then that his wife doesn't get such a decent depiction. Where Washizu is very much a full character and believably human, she is simply evil for the sake of being evil. However, she is admittedly a haunting figure and her emotionless pale face and a strangely sinister walk make her far more terrifying than the frankly rather daft Ghost that Washizu encounters in the beginning of the film. If anything, the Ghost is the film's biggest weak point and the complete inability of anyone to question its existence is a bit of a blow to the otherwise credible story.That said, Throne of Blood is otherwise an excellent film. The political machinations of the Samurai is given the main focus rather than the usual blood letting and the end result is a compelling study of the trappings of power. The closing scene is also one of the most striking of Kurosawa's career. It's not as violent as the confrontations in Yojimbo or as epic as the castle siege in Ran, but when you watch it consider this: those are real arrows. Real arrows people, they shot real arrows!",

But both are really cool versions of their respective sources; no longer mired in an almost foreign tongue, they're done in a way that is completely foreign! What makes Throne of Blood (English title for \"Spider Web's Castle\") so great is how well it meshes with the Japanese aesthetic and historical setting. Whats more the acting is highly stylized, based on Noh plays. This gives it a theatrical quality that is fresh and exotic. Its fun to watch Mifune throw himself into it.I was pretty young when I first caught this on TV (maybe 15?). I started watching it about 1/4 of the way in, so I didn't catch the first little part that makes it much more obvious it is based on Macbeth, but obviously near the end it becomes very clear. This made for a rather entertaining twist and is a movie I will never forget for that reason.It doesn't take a genius to see the genius in this film. My favorite film version of the master's plays, and handily convinced my younger self that yes, even black and white films can be good.

And he doesn't disappoint at all - with its staggering sets and photography this version brings out the true Gothic horror of the original. Unlike most other Kurosawa movies there is no lightening of the mood, no layers of meaning - just unrelenting death and decay, up to a truly memorable ending.Its been noted that most Japanese directors follow a similar career arc from starting out radical and modern, and gradually becoming more traditionalist as their careers go on. In this sense, this movie is a turning point for Kurosawa as he started to move away from the radicalism and western influences of his earlier movies to utilizing traditional Japanese theater. Whether that was a positive move or not is a moot point - personally I love his noir movies like High and Low and Stray Dog and I think they are ultimately superior movies to this one because of their inner complexity and contemporary resonances.But even though I don't consider this to be his greatest, minor Kurosawa is still head and shoulders above the vast majority of other film makers.

That's why \"Throne of Blood\" based on MACBETH and \"Ran\" based on KING LEAR are both dear to my heart. Apparently, Kurosawa was making \"Throne of Blood\" concurrently with Orson Welles version and deemed to release his 5 years later. Still, similarities abound: the foggy, dusky setting, the primitive costumes(both films feature horned crowns), and the appropriate use of black and white film. We are so fortunate to have two versions of MACBETH by top notch directors (Three, if you count Roman Polanski's version).\"Throne of Blood\" features the greedy, cold hearted, conniving female Lady Washizu based on Lady MacBeth. Lady Washizu does not need to result to the evil spirits to replace her \"milk with gall\". She is naturally \"unsexed\". A very similar character reappears in the form of Lady Kaede in Kurosawa's \"Ran\". Younger audiences quickly identify these Samurai sword sweeties with the KILL BILL girls. THRONE OF BLOOD has so many Oriental touches I often forgot I was watching a Shakespearean story (Let's face it, the Chinese language with subtitles is easier to follow than Elizabethean English without). The most notable alteration for me was the substitution of the three witches with an elderly fortune teller. Although seers are featured in Shakespeare plays such as JULIUS CAESAR, the old singing seer in \"Throne of Blood\" is a small example of what gives this film such an unique feel.",

It is an adaptation of William Sheakespeare's \"Macbeth\" told with a feudal Japan setting. Washizu and Miki are two warriors who are returning to their emperor's castle to receive praise on their achievements in battle. They become lost as a storm rains down on them. They encounter a mysterious old woman who predicts great things in both of their futures. When they finally arrive at the castle the prophecy begins to come true as they are both promoted accordingly. Washizu, at the encouragement of his wife, quickly decides to fulfill the prophecy himself and thus begins his bloodied ascent to power. The story is told with the Kurosawa's classic style of filmmaking. He uses a thick fog that is present throughout the film to add to the murkiness of the story. The scenes with the evil spirit in the fortress who predicts the men's destinies are incredible. The fog combined with the the spirit's eerie presence is very effective at getting underneath your skin. Washizu's rise to power is swift and engrossing as is his tragic downfall.\nToshiro Mifune never ceases to impress me with his vast range in his various roles under the direction of Kurosawa. Having just seen \"Stray Dog\" yesterday I can clearly see the growth in his acting between the two films. In \"Stray Dog\" he was fairly young and new, however still magnificent. In \"Throne of Blood\" he is more experienced but does not let it show. His performance is as commanding and transfixing as Kurosawa's direction. The film makes me want to see more of their collaborating as well as their individual work. I am curious to see how the two men work without eachother. Overall, \"Throne of Blood\" is another Akira Kurosawa masterpiece to add to my personal list of favorites. It makes me wonder if the man was ever capable of directing mediocre films. I am eagerly awaiting my next Kurosawa movie-watching experience.I give this movie *****",

            "content": "Out of so many movie adaptations of Macbeth that can be found worldwide, the one directed by Akira Kurosawa is definitely the most unconventional. It stands out from all the Western versions, because of its strong emphasis on the visual techniques and deep psychological insight into the minds of various characters.Throne of Blood follows the basic storyline of William Shakespeare's great tragedy, but it offers a fresh and very distinct perspective on this famous tale of betrayal, envy and enormous greed. It is also easy to notice that it carries a certain theater-like feeling, so praised by the official author of this tale.The movie is based mostly on the clever act of intersecting the cultural aspects of, both eastern and western, medieval tragedy. Kurosawa, being a brilliant and truly creative director, put a few little, but highly meaningful themes, that weren't included in Macbeth, like the 'haunted' room, in which an irremovable bloodstain reminds of the atrocious crimes that happened in the Palace. All of the events depicted here take place in the Feudal Japan. On the road back home, after their triumphant war victory, the two main characters - Washizu and Miki \u2013 encounter a strange old woman, who claims to be able to predict the future. As any normal person would probably do, the tired men simply laugh ignorantly at this silly statement and continue their walk on to a really unexpected surprise\u0085If you ever had a chance to read the book, see a theatrical performance, or watch one of many other movies about Macbeth you should already know the rest of the story. However, Kurosawa's magnificent mastery of the cinematic craft makes this adaptation as compelling and stunning as ever. There aren't too many brutal scenes of murder that are in the original play. In fact, the only on screen killing occurs in the final scene of the film. Still, the viewer is able to experience the impact of all the wrongdoings of Lord Macbeth and his treacherous wife, Lady Asaji, through the accentuation of the characters' emotions, so greatly visible by camera's close-ups.The true genius of the film is indicated by a scene-by-scene building up of the tragic effect of karma, that gradually overwhelms Washizu. The arising greed starts to take control of him. His wife also takes a big amount of blame for all the vengeful steps taken by the warrior, as she is like a snake in the Garden of Eden, tempting him to follow the path of ferocious treachery. At one point he gets what he wanted deeply in his heart, since the time that he met the old woman in the forest - he becomes the Emperor. But at what price exactly? Ultimately, every single decision brings him closer to the unavoidable destiny. And by this I mean the eventual fulfillment of the final prophecy stated by the spirit from the Cobweb Forest. The combined play of recurring sounds and movement of the surrounding nature has a metaphorical meaning, as it brings us closer and closer to the climax of the whole picture.I must say that I was really impressed by the presentation of the final scene, which shows the marching trees that herald the coming defeat of Washizu. It possesses a huge impetus on the sudden uprising of all the soldiers that want to dethrone the unwanted Emperor. And then the unbelievable nightmare comes true in a gripping, and purely drastic scene of a public execution.As for acting of the main couple: Isuzu Yamada is fantastic as Lady Washizu. She brilliantly captured the character of a disastrous, but irresistible 'voice in the ear' of the husband. This is also yet another outstanding performance by the experienced Toshiro Mifune, who collaborated with Kurosawa on so many movies during his lifetime. If you ever wanted to experience a different viewpoint of the Macbeth tragedy I highly recommend Throne of Blood, as it is the most powerful, and truly the most interesting and original version ever made. Kudos, Mr. Kurosawa.",

            "content": "There have been many film and television productions of \"Macbeth,\" but there may never have been one as innovative and interesting as Akira Kurosawa's \"Throne of Blood.\" Meanwhile, in spite of the major change of time and scenery, Kurosawa is able to preserve much of the story with only minor alterations and, most importantly, to keep the atmosphere and emotion of the play. The loss of Shakespeare's language is a tragic one that's difficult to make up and the incredible depth and multi-layered nature of the play are quite possibly impossible to convey in performance, but an interesting and well-performed interpretation is still quite wonderful, and that's what Kurosawa's film is. For my review, I'm going to focus on some of Kurosawa's most interesting interpretive choices and their success.The incredible characterization is perhaps most prominent in Isuzu Yamada's Lady Asaji Washizu (Lady Macbeth). Yamada's character does not have the sexually-charged brutality of Jane Lapotaire's (in Jack Gold's BBC production), nor the supernatural malevolence of Greta Scacchi's (in Michael Bogdanov's production). Instead, her character takes a slightly less aggressive role, pushing her husband by planting simple seeds of her own suspicions in his mind while coldly advocating the path of bloodshed with seemingly no conscience. She also is given a breakdown scene that might be the most powerful version of Lady Macbeth's collapse ever committed to film. Her performance is fascinating and original, something of a microcosm of the entire film.Washizu, the film's Macbeth, is more traditional, but contains more of an air of military bravery, honor, and power than the previous portrayals (many of which seem to ignore Macbeth's oft-mentioned military prowess, such as Ian McKellen's performance). Toshiro Mifune, always a brilliant actor, is able to convey the extreme inner turmoil of a proud soldier whose ambition takes him places where he feels honor-bound not to go and, fixing an oddly common problem in film productions of the play, looks the part of a great soldier.Kurosawa's most interesting other change is in his portrayal of the witches. The witches are, first of all, reduced to one, and she is first glimpsed weaving, as though she is in fact a Fate rather than a witch and perhaps presaging her predictive powers. Most productions, most notably and effectively Roman Polanksi's, have portrayed the witches as somehow a product of nature, but Kurosawa opts for the opposite, presenting a more obviously corporeal witch who is imposing on the wilderness and looks alien in it. This last choice also hints at what Kurosawa does with the entire film's supernatural elements, which is to reduce them. His film definitely reads as a psychological tale of an overly ambitious and suspicious leader, with the supernatural presence toned down accordingly, though the Fate-like opening shot of the \"evil spirit\" confuses the issue. Most productions have been unable to overcome this problem, since it is difficult to focus on either the psychological or the supernatural element and nearly impossible to use both without becoming muddled (the dense language of the play can overcome this on paper, but not in performance).\"Throne of Blood\" is a definite must-watch for all \"Macbeth\" fans and a recommended viewing for all. The performances and characterization are excellent, the direction is truly wonderful, the score is excellent. Indeed, the only weak point the film has is its slightly confused vision of the witch, both suggesting that it defines Washizu's fate and reducing its presence from Shakespeare's work. This film is yet another great entry into the canon of both Shakespeare filmography and Akira Kurosawa.",

To watch him act is riveting, and he is especially great in films like Yojimbo and Sanjuro.But I'm very disturbed by some of the reviews here, as I found a lot of ignorance. Exaggerated acting??? What a bunch of hogwash. Anybody who's knowledgeable in arthouse films KNOWS that the three major asian nations - China, Japan, and Korea respectively - have an ancient and deeply held tradition of stylised opera acting, which explains the difference with Hollywood acting that's rooted in Stanislavsky's method that embraces realism & experience. Please people, get your facts straightened out - and watch more movies and educate yourselves. Also, to call Kurosawa as a \"cold\" director is totally unjustified, as the director is a staunch humanist. Obviously those people have not seen Seven Samurai and Ikiru, the latter film is especially one of the most moving story about humanity's downfall. One very good example of a director with a \"cold\" directing approach would be Stanley Kubrick. There is a difference!All in all, this movie is really good, and gives an interesting Japanese angle to a literary classic.",

Kurosawa produces Macbeth well in the cinema screen, enjoying Japan's dramatic heritage, such as Kabuki and New Theater. Using clever plans and a minimalist compilation of the Japanese worldview, he picks up beautifully the concepts of choice and fate. On the other hand, Toshiro Mifune is one of the few iconic and well-known actors in the world to inspire the impression of the audience's imagination with characters.",

            "content": "Akira Kurosawa's version of Macbeth, with Mifune as the distorted and erratic Washizu. Concentrating and the spiritual and supernatural atmosphere of Macbeth, Kurosawa employs the style of Noh drama to bring the viewer into this phantasmagorical world of man vs. nature; and of man vs. his own greed. The film is beautiful. Kurosawa's use of \"planes\" and of Noh aesthetics helps to portray a theatrical world of chaos (symbolised by the contorted forest) and order (as in the rigid structure of the military forces and castle.) Shakespeare's poetry is put aside in order to emphasize the atmosphere of the cobweb forest and its naturalistic inhabitants. A wonderful motion picture. One of my favourites.",

            "content": "Yet another Kurosawa movie for ages!! Throne of Blood is masterly adaptation of Shakespeare's 'Macbeth' and is skillfully crafted movie in its own. The story is that of a man's greedy nature and his rise and fall in the power. Kurosawa the master as he was, selected a royal subject and molded it magnificently in the medieval Japan settings with the help of his writers and actors. The casting couldn't have got any better than this, especially Toshir\u00f4 Mifune in the central role; he is a class act as Washizu whose soul gets poisoned under the influence of his ambitious wife and takes disastrous steps to become the emperor but eventually his guilt gets the better of him and by the end looses everything that he once stood for, his emperor, dear friend, and his life. Mifune smoothly ease into his character and very ably expresses Washizu's sense of surprises, fear, power, betrayal, friendship and everything that the character demands. He was extremely talented and in some of the scenes (which are very hard for me to describe in few words) he displays that talent magnificently. He again proved why he was such a favorite of Kurosawa and together with him created so many wonderful movies. Other actors too did a good job in their respective portrayals and support the central character well. To sum up, the movie is just the result one should expect when two of the worlds supreme talent (Kurosawa and Shakespeare) meets with one of the finest actor of Japan. Recommended to anyone interested in Kurosawa, Mifune, Shakespeare or class movies.",

The sequence with the arrows at the end is impressive, as are a number of other scenes, but they don't really add up to a great film.  Mifune isn't at his best here either. If you love Kurosawa, this will keep you entertained.  Less avid fans may find it slightly lacking.",

            "content": "THRONE OF BLOOD or SPIDERWEB CASTLE By Akira Kursosawa 9/10I recently got the criterion collection version of \"THRONE OF BLOOD\" By Akira Kurosawa. I was kind of disappointed by the amateurish beginning sequence with the choir singing an ode to Mifune's Macbeth and the Japanese feudal council planning their strategy in a predictable manner. I was starting to get disappointed but then the story progresses to Macbeth and Banquo (I can't remember their Japanese names) and their encounter with an \"Evil Spirit\" which is one of the best scenes I have watched in VERY long time. Kurosawa knew how to do all of that in the 50's. Just amazing. As for the acting, Mifune looks hilarious. But then he shows his versatility in the scenes in which he kills his king and sees the ghost of Banquo(Another brilliant scene). It is very hard to believe that he is the same Toshiro Mifune from \"SEVEN SAMURAI\" who played the rude and compulsive Kukuchiyo and the unusually inhuman Bandit from \"RASHOMON\". Lady Macbeth played by Isuzu Yamada steals the show too. Her monotonous voice and her skeletal physique with the layer of Noh makeup along with the sly smile on her face makes her give the dark shade to the film. Well, this is not THE BEST of Kurosawa but it does showcase his brilliance. The only reason I am giving this film 8 instead of the 9 that I was tempted to give was because of the script which sorely lacked some good lines.",

            "content": "I sat down to watch this not knowing it was a Macbeth adaptation, which made for a delightful and captivating experience. I have seen a number of Kurosawa's most notable films, but I believe this is superior. Indeed, I believed I was watching what must be one of the most influential horror films of all time interwoven with a sweeping epic, all in under two hours. If Edgar Allen Poe directed Macbeth, this is something of what it would feel like. Yamada and Mifune have some of the most brilliant scenes of non-romantic tension between a man and a woman I can recall- everything in these scenes is perfect because there is emptiness in every element, nothing unnecessary or light exists. In school, Macbeth was always my least favorite tragedy, perhaps because we lack the belief in the supernatural and the relationship with death to be horrified by such dialogue and such people, and this film struck a chord with English-speaking audiences because it expresses the essence of all that far better to us.",

            "content": "I have seen this movie a couple of times but this time I noticed that Mifune's character doesn't think. When he wife was egging him on before she gave the drugged sake to the guards, she said clearly that he had benefited from the predictions so far without any personal interference, but then she pushes him to interfere. Why did he not reply that he had gotten this far without doing anything so why do anything now? The logic would have been inescapable even for his wife.A little later the Lord's coffin is carried into the fortress, but you can see the way it moves around that it lacks heft. I was surprised because in another of Kurosawa's movies people had to paint camellias black so they would appear red in the black and white film. So why did he not add weight to the coffin? It would have been simple to do, but if you watch the coffin you can see it bop around as though it was empty.",
