            "content": "The Hustler (1961) **** (out of 4) 'Fast' Eddie Felson (Paul Newman) shows up to play the legendary Minnesota Fats (Jackie Gleason) in a game of pool and soon the hotshot realizes that there's more to winning than just talent. After some time off the hustler winds up with a woman (Piper Laurie) who suffers from alcohol abuse but even worse is when he teams up with a gambler (George C. Scott).Robert Rossen's THE HUSTLER is without question one of the greatest films of its type. Most people are connected to it because of its story of a hustler and the gambling aspect but there are some of the greatest performances you're ever going to see on display here as well as a pretty depressing look at losers. Throughout the movie Felson is constantly called a loser, which is a term that fits the majority of the characters in this rather grim, dark and depressing film.For me the greatest thing here are the performances with Newman easily leading the way. It's easy to see why this is the film that turned Newman into a superstar. Up until this point he had played a fair share of troubled rebels but everything in him just came together for this role. He's certainly very believable as this young guy who can't seem to stay out of his own way when it comes to trouble. This is a very troubled character and the actor perfectly nails every aspect of it. Gleason will always be known as a comedic actor but he could nail drama when he needed and this is the perfect example. It certainly doesn't hurt that the two actors were also great pool players and this brings a real nature to the film.Laurie is rather heart-breaking in her role as the drunk and then you've got Scott playing one of the biggest snakes in film history. There's no question that his Burt character is one of the great villains in film history. Myron McCormick is excellent in his small role and then you've got a young Murray Hamilton. THE HUSTLER also benefits from some wonderful cinematography that perfectly captures this pool world. I mean, has there ever been a better example of why B&W is so great? Add in the terrific score and you've really got something special.THE HUSTLER is a classic film that constantly gets better each time you view it.",

            "review_title": "\"We Have A Contract Of Depravity\"",
            "content": "\"The Hustler\" is steeped in the seedy atmosphere of smoke-filled pool halls in the ugly urban hinterland of America. The Ames Billiard Hall is funereal in feel.  When 'Fast Eddie' Felson walks in with Charlie, his manager, Charlie remarks, \"These tables are the slabs they lay the stiffs on.\"  The film is about the talented men who perform, but equally about the talentless predators who exploit them.  The habitues of the pool hall cling to the shadows.  They wince when a blind is opened and sunlight gets in.  A new hustler enters, and these vultures gather silently on the margins.Eddie is the youngster hungry for glory.  He and Charlie pose as salesmen and Eddie feigns drunkenness, hooking the punters by repeating an almost-impossible shot.  For all the slickness of the con, Eddie is impatient for bigger things.  He wants to challenge Minnesota Fats, the best hustler in the land.Newman gets his name above the title, but this is a film with four exquisite pieces of acting.  Jackie Gleason as Minnesota, Piper Laurie as Sarah and George C Scott, playing Bert Gordon, turn in wonderful performances.Eddie matures as the story progresses.  He starts as a cheap chiseller, hustling ten bucks, but ambition carries him to Louisville and the world of the high rollers.  Sarah's love opens emotional dimensions in him which he previously lacked.  Bert Gordon confronts him with his own spiritual inadequacies, forcing him to understand himself.  Eddie is jejune in the first game against the Fat Man, but by the second meeting he is emotionally strong, and completely his own man.  He has made the spiritual journey from the whining \"everybody wants a piece of me\" to the inner knowledge that Sarah bequeathed him - that only those who give can truly live.Bert Gordon, with his dark glasses and hawkish features, is a creature of the night.  Loving the 'action' of a clash of talents, but lacking any talent of his own, Gordon is the predator on the sidelines.  Hearing of the new hustler's presence, Gordon arrives soundlessly and sits watching intently for hours.  His dark genius sees the weakness in every soul.  In the bar, when he and Eddie talk business, Gordon is foreshortened to look tiny alongside the talented youngster.  For all his money and sharp wits, Gordon will never be more than a parasite living off the ability of others. Finally, Eddie and Fats walk into the sunlight, heroes who have proved themselves.  Gordon remains perched on his gloomy barstool, a prisoner in his own dark kingdom.If Sarah is the vulnerable, physically-disabled woman who relies on drink too heavily, the victim of the men she encounters, she is also the heart of the movie.  She destroys Gordon's certainty and she shows Eddie the meaning of love.  Her tragedy is Eddie's salvation.  She and Eddie find each other in a deserted bus station in the dead hours.  They are both lost souls, Citizens of Hell.  She is the deformed girl with the empty life, and he is the emotional cripple with no resources of education or character to sustain him.  They cling to each other  as if shipwrecked.  When the seduction comes, Sarah hesitates.  She knows this will lead to suffering. \"Why me?\" she asks, then surrenders to her fate.The time when Eddie's hands are in plaster is Sarah's brief season of happiness.  She stops drinking and even makes progress with her writing. Somebody needs her, belongs completely to her.  It cannot last.\n\"I made you up, Eddie,\" Sarah tells him, and in a sense she did.  She imagined him to be loyal and stable.  On the night when the truth dawns, Sarah goes from feeling pretty in her new dress to being a rain-sodden wreck.  She is supplanted in Eddie's attention by the sinister Gordon, who asserts the new power-balance in the railroad dining-car.  The hotel suites are adjoining, and though Sarah closes all the doors, she can't keep Gordon out.  By Findlay's party, she has hit the bottle again.  The patterned dress which Eddie bought her, a symbol of her incarceration, has the shadow of the ballustrade projected onto it, seemingly magnifying her sense of ensnarement.Though Jackie Gleason does very little in this film, he dominates it. On screen for a fraction of the film's totality, and having neither great speeches nor grand gestures, he impresses by his sheer presence.  Stillness, self-containment and an ironic amusement make Minnesota Fats the perfect foil for the angry, ambitious Eddie.  In the final showdown, Fats' quiet poise outshines the grandstanding of the others.  Gleason conveys beautifully the fear at the core of this big dandy.  When Eddie has him in trouble, the Fat Man begins to lose his sartorial integrity as his confidence unravels.This contrast of stillness and motion is effective in the first meeting of the hustlers.  Fats and Gordon, who know what they are about, remain motionless and tranquil.  Eddie the incontinent wannabe gradually loses control of both mouth and limbs.  The film is rich in symbolic language. The cheap rooms which Eddie rents are mere boxes for hire, like the bus station locker which he lives out of.  When he and Sarah meet for the second time, the inevitability of their coupling is conveyed in a scene without words or gestures.  Eddie's plastercasts are manacles - without his hands, he is nothing.  A sumptuous restaurant and a happy couple are transformed when the brutal truth emerges.  The camera angle is reversed, and Eddie and Sarah are now separated by gaunt shelves of crockery.  The illusion has been shattered.  When Eddie sneaks out on the sleeping Sarah with the stake money in his hand, it is the betrayal of Charlie re-enacted.A marvellous film is enhanced by a superbly sleazy jazz score (Kenyon Hopkins) and the violence is all the more gut-wrenching for being suggested, rather than shown.Verdict - probably a masterpiece.",

            "review_title": "A Talented Loser",
            "content": "It's an intriguing idea. If a person is talented, that person should be a winner. And, we would expect a loser to be someone who is not talented. But the idea that someone could be a talented loser is a paradox, a contradiction that doesn't fit into the conventional mindset of American culture, and is the basis for \"The Hustler\", a character study of an ace pool player who can't seem to win respect from his peers.The pool player is (Fast) Eddie Felson (Paul Newman). The plot moves along by means of four secondary characters with whom Fast Eddie interacts: (1) his manager, Charlie; (2) the veteran pool player, Minnesota Fats; (3) Eddie's girlfriend, Sarah; and (4) the money man, Bert Gordon.\"The Hustler\" is very much a product of the late 50's and early 60's, when progressive filmmakers were trying to buck the staid post WWII era, with its reactionary Cold War mentality that resulted in strict conformity to established American values. In this film, Bert Gordon and Minnesota Fats represent the establishment. Eddie Felson is the loner, up against the establishment; he's the renegade kid, out to beat the system. Yet, at every turn, the establishment beats Eddie, one way or another. His idealism is useless. He must conform to the establishment's rules, expressed in the film as \"character\", or give up his dreams.The film is therefore very cynical and incredibly cold. From start to finish, there's not an ounce of humor. It depresses the spirit. But the film is a very good metaphor for a terrible era wherein societal repression was the norm.While the story's main character may be a loser, the film itself is a talented winner. The excellent B&W lighting, together with a jazzy score, create an effectively somber and downbeat tone, consistent with the oppressive political atmosphere of that era. The dialogue is sparse and incisive. And the acting is persuasive. Paul Newman is convincing, as are the secondary characters. I especially liked the performance of Jackie Gleason, who comes across as suave, serious, and in total control, a great contrast to his comedic side, in \"The Honeymooners\".\"The Hustler\" is depressing and grim. But the film is very well made. It entertains in ways that are obvious, and educates in ways that are subtle.",

But when where he is is nowhere, he grows up.  He learns the value of lost opportunity, and he gains integrity at a high price.  It is worth a look for anyone who wants to see the redemption of a lovable curmudgeon.",

            "content": "The Hustler had the misfortune to be up against films like West Side Story and Judgment at Nuremberg in 1961. Another year it might have carried away more Academy gold than just for black and white cinematography and for black and white art&set direction.A lot of people think The Hustler is about pool, what it really is about is obsession at being the best and how it can cost you in other things that really matter.Paul Newman as Eddie Felson is one such obsessed creature. He wants to be the best pool player ever. To do that in the words of that eminent 20th century philosopher Ric Flair, \"to be the man, you got to beat the man.\"The man is Jackie Gleason playing the legendary Minnesota Fats, champion pool player of all. They have a marathon match in which Newman seems to have the upper hand, but Gleason pulls it out in the end. Nevertheless Newman comes to the attention of George C. Scott, a gambler who wants to use him for his own ends.Jackie Gleason and George C. Scott both got nominated in the Best Supporting Actor category, but lost to George Chakiris in West Side Story. Scott is a dangerous and malevolent figure, he was probably at his most evil on the screen in this role. Piper Laurie got an Oscar nomination for Best Actress and this turned out to be her career role. She's an alcoholic floozy with some dreams that keep her ego afloat, but she loves and respects Newman. They complement each other's needs and Newman finds that out way too late. Laurie unfortunately lost to Sophia Loren in Two Women.But what I liked best about The Hustler is the contrast between Paul Newman and Jackie Gleason. Gleason is on screen at the beginning and at the end. Note how he sits apart from everyone in the pool room. No social life, no people in his orbit, it's lonely at the top. And to stay there Gleason dedicates himself to pool to the exclusion of everything else.Yet this is who the ambitious, but very vulnerable Newman wants to be. In creating his character Newman gave it equal doses of ambition and vulnerability, both working at the same time. Not an easy thing to do, but Newman is at the top of his game as Eddie Felson. Sadly Newman lost the Oscar that year to Maximilian Schell in Judgment at Nuremberg.But eventually some 25 years later Paul Newman got the Oscar for playing a more mature Eddie Felson in The Color of Money. A kind of justice, certainly few players ever get that kind of opportunity again.The Hustler was also up for Best Picture and Best Director for Robert Rossen. It lost to West Side Story in both categories. Both films hold up well after almost half a century, that was a tough call for Academy voters.The Hustler is about pool the way Moby Dick is about a whale. And there both classics.",

However, he produced three films which deserve  a permanent place  among the classics, All the Kings Men( probably the best film about American politics), Lilith( one of the greatest films about mental illness) and this, a movie which DESERVES to be ranked with the hundred greatest, and possibly the fifty greatest, American films. It is superbly acted, brilliantly photographed and edited, and directed with clarity and assurance. In a just world ( if there is such a place), an special Oscar would have been bestowed on Newman, Laurie, Scott, and Gleason AS A GROUP. Piper Laurie was unforgettably poignant, Scott unforgettably sleazy, and Gleason... well, Gleason simply IS Minnesota Fats. Paul Newman almost certainly deserved the Oscar.It was  an amusing irony, perhaps a little joke by God, that the bartender in the movie was played by none other than Jake LaMotta.",

            "content": "I've seen The Hustler repeated times, thought not as many as some of the other commentators.  Recently I saw it for the first time in the theater, at the Alamo Drafthouse in Austin.  Watching \"The Hustler\" in a theater is like listening to Dave Brubeck's \"Time Out\" album: you start to see and even hear things in black and white.  You know the pool tables are green, and the balls are multi-colored, but somehow the black and white perfectly matches the colorless existence of the protagonist and his supporting players.  You can smell the cigarettes, taste the booze.Newman, Gleason, Scott, and Laurie all turn in great performances.  But this movie, made after the heyday of the studio players' contract, still bears the hallmark of great movies from that era: strong supporting performances all the way down the line.  Vincent Gardenia, for pete's sake, as the unlucky bartender in the first scene!  Michael Constantine as Big John. Myron McCormick as Charlie, Eddie's sponsor most of the way through the movie.  And Murray Hamilton as the millionaire Southern mark.  This movie was made when supporting roles were an end in themselves, by actors who believed every second they were on screen should be of high quality.The day I wrote this review -- January 18, 2004 -- The Hustler was no. 143 on the Top 250 list.

Paul Newman plays \"Fast Eddie\" Felson, a young player from California who travels east to take on the ultimate challenge: to beat \"Minnesota Fats,\" played by the late Jackie Gleason.Willie Mosconi, probably the greatest pool player who ever walked the Earth, was technical adviser and choreographed many of the game sequences. On technical merit alone, this film is a pool player's classic. Beyond that, however, the way \"Fast Eddie\" takes to his skills and relationships pushes this film out as a classic for the general audience. In one scene, he is describing what it is like to be really good at something. It is one of the best speeches about excellence I have ever heard. This is one of my top three films.

            "content": "Spoilers herein.Here's a game I play: find the similarities between the story and how the story is told. After all, the same mind makes both decisions. Often there isn't deep reflection on the choices -- they just feel right. But sometimes the relationship shows careful selection of strategies and philosophies.  We see here that the key artists know what they were about and engineered the drama to reflect the dynamics of pool.The story is simple: characters as pool balls, bouncing off of one another, with a particular combination shot resulting in both a death of one and the better placement of another. Every element of the story reinforces this notion. The staging is very abstract, very clean. Cinemascope black and white provides a wide table. But watch these actors. I really appreciate actors who have both ability as actors and ability to integrate their methods into the larger methods of the project. Very few actors know how to do this, or even care. They instead substitute what we as viewers call \"ensemble\" acting, which consists of bouncing off of each other like balls. That happens here, but this is Scott's project: he adds a dimension to this, the dimension of manipulating the dynamics of the actors. Meta-acting. His character manipulates everyone else; two of them (Fats and Fast, whose very names indicate permutations like poolballs) try to manipulate each other, and the method is manipulating balls. But then of course, the balls are them, their configuration affects the competition between Fast and Fats, and on up the chain determines how well Scott and his character play their games.Scott is an underappreciated actor, actually I mean to say that he is appreciated for his superb ability to do the ordinary rather than his risky attempts to do (as here) the extraordinary. I can this folded acting. Newman knew he was being manipulated as an actor and himself claims to not have learned folded acting until much later in \"The Verdict.\"Piper is exploited as an actress just as her character is. She's clueless.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 4: Worth watching.",

It is more about the life around it, Fast Eddie Felson's life in particular. Paul Newman plays this man in a terrific way. Eddie is a great pool player, he could be the best, if only he had more character. This is what Bert Gordon (George C. Scott) tells him. It is true. Eddie is a self-destructive man. He drinks too much and he does not know when to stop. At one point early in the movie he is playing the man who is considered the best of the country, Minnesota Fats (Jackie Gleason), and he has won 18.000 dollars but he gets too drunk and loses everything.(Minor spoilers.) Then he meets a girl Sarah (Laurie Piper) who, like him, drinks too much. They start living together and it seems that Eddie is changing, but we suspects he is always thinking about playing Minnesota Fats again. Eddie gets in some trouble, his thumbs are broken, and after this he decides that he needs Bert Gordon to get back on track again. Gordon made him an offer before his thumbs were broken which seemed pretty unfair but now Eddie thinks he has no choice. He has the woman he loves on one side, who could get him out of trouble, and the game of pool and his desire to be the best on the other. What will happen is for you to see.The interesting story about this self-destructive man is also about the self-destructive woman and the events around her are almost inevitable. The hero is a hero in most ways, but it is a hero who must face his weaknesses instead of discovering his strong points. This kind of hero is rare these days. Paul Newman shows us why he became such a great star with this memorable role.Other things are very good too here. Although the game is never explained it is fun to watch every shot, some of them almost impossible. The black and white cinematography looks great. Fast Eddie Felson would return in Martin Scorsese's 'The Color of Money', a lesser film in some points but very good as well.",

Scott as the Hustler hustling the hustler. His performance gave the movie a gritty underworld feel to it. Piper Laury delivers a powerhouse performance as the ill-fated drunk girlfriend of the lead player Paul Newman. He probably delivers one of his best roles to date. Just like Robert De Niro in Raging Bull he plays a character who is incapable of handling the pressures of fame and fortune, who is as George C. Scott's says \"A born loser\". If you look in Newman's eyes during the picture you can see the troubles he is going through. He loves the girl, but is unable to express this because he is afraid she will know the real him. He has to keep playing this Hustler-character all through his life to keep himself going. He knows nothing other than playing pool and hustling people out of their money.The cinematography was absolutely brilliant alongside the set-dressing. The dirty, low-life feeling that must have hung around these dives called poolhalls was conveyed perfectly to the screen through brilliant lighting and art direction. The scenes in which Newman plays the different people at the pool table were shot and edited to near perfection (which has been redone again to near perfection in The Color of Money by Martin Scorsese).The music gave a real emotional feel to this moving picture.

Anyone of the three main characters could fill the titular role, whether it be Paul Newman's up-and-comer, Jackie Gleason's man-to-beat, or George C. Scott's behind-the-scenes angle-shooter.These three stars (all-Oscar nominated) carry the picture, both individually and collectively. The thirty-ish Newman is simply a revelation to anyone (me) who hasn't seen him act much in his prime. He perfectly captures the smooth, in control but on the edge persona of Fast Eddie, who has the physical tools, but not necessarily the mental skills to be a champion. Gleason likewise perfectly fills the body and clothes of Minnesota Fats, with a graceful elegance uncommon to a man of his size. Scott (who declined his Oscar nomination) could easily have been overshadowed in his role, but his subtle and shifty eyes and movements create a character that occasionally outshines his two huge co-stars.The Hustler reaches its zeniths when at least two of these men are on the screen. The dialogue exchanges of Newman and Scott as they feel each other out crackle with intensity. Gleason and Scott ooze wary respect for each other; and Newman and Gleason combine admiration and competitiveness into one neat package from which the entire film derives its energy.A film about pool sharks seems to demand brilliant representation of its colorful world. But French cinematographer Eugene Shuftan instead opts for black-and-white, which surprisingly works wonderfully. His Oscar-winning imagery particularly excels in displaying light and shadows, such as the sun streaming into smoke-filled billiards halls. Shuftan accomplishes an exceptional feat, using a monotone style to effectively paint vivid pictures.Despite high achievement in so many areas, The Hustler suffers from Doughnut Syndrome: there's a hole in the middle. The pool scenes that bracket the story are very good, and one middle scene between Newman and Scott is the best of the film, but the romantic portion of the story flounders. The drifter Newman falls for a fellow drifter (Piper Laurie) for no apparent reason, other than alcohol and the fact that they're both alone. To their credit, they do acknowledge that their relationship is flimsy and depraved, but the movie squanders too much times on this wafer-thin story arc, rather than stick with what works.Those parts succeed wildly, about as enjoyable as any scenes ever shot, but without adequate buttressing material, the film as a whole falls short of the high watermark left by its parts.Bottom Line: Phenomenal at times, but subpar at others, the male performances carry the film. Seven of ten, but definitely worth viewing if you haven't seen it yet.",

Why is Eddie so self-destructive? He has Minnesota Fats, ostensibly the country's greatest player, beaten in the first marathon match only to drink himself into insensibility and let Fats off the hook. Throughout the movie Eddie is surrounded by other people who are self-destructive or only interested in making a buck off of him. Even Charlie, his original manager (Myron McCormick in a terrific role)needs him for a meal ticket. Bert, his second manager, is a slithering, calculating parasite who uses everyone around him. Sara, Eddie's pathetic girlfriend, is going through life in an aimless, alcoholic haze. The movie really lets you into the lives of these people who live on the margins of society. The cinematography is outstanding, the settings and mood of the movie draw you in totally. The acting is uniformly outstanding from top to bottom. Great movies get great performances from the minor characters, too. Vincent Gardenia, Michael Constantine, Murray Hamilton and McCormick are perfect in the smaller roles while Paul Newman, Jackie Gleason, Piper Laurie (all getting well-deserved Oscar nominations) and George C. Scott are indelible in the major roles. Even boxer Jake LaMotta has a cameo as a bartender. Can Eddie finally overcome being a born loser? Can love redeem any of these lost people? What makes a person a champion? Is it talent alone or does a champion need some inner demon that can only be defeated by pursuing victory at all costs?",

Film is based on Walter Tevis novel of the same name.A small-time pool hustler travels cross-country with his partner and earns, on fraud, some money. His attitude and his big mouth forcing him to challenge the legendary player \"Minnesota Fats\". A challenger and legend finally meet each other. Straight pool duel can begin. Their game attracts the attention of a professional gambler. The young challenger has, despite a noticeable talent, lost the match. He leaves his partner and he meets, at the local bus terminal, a girl, who is an alcoholic supported by her father, attends college part-time, and walks with a limp. They start a strange relationship. However, the pool hustler wants again to challenge a famous rival. His talent does not seem sufficient, he needs a strong character...A restless, irritable and evil protagonists are perfectly integrated into a dark atmosphere. Their greed for a fame and money has ruled out any form of love and nobility in this film. The plot is brisk and exciting. Every word or move is full of passion and has its price.Paul Newman as Eddie Felson is a passionate and violent pool hustler. The protagonist, who is, at one point, on the top of his life goal, and then drops down until he touches the bottom. He was intoxicated with his ambition. The loss of a loved person and a bitter life knowledge are his brutal sobering. Mr. Newman has offered a quite good performance. Piper Laurie as Sarah Packard is his girlfriend, who has lost in her unclear past. However, when Eddie comes into her life, she revives her pathetic reality. She is a dominant character in one part of the film, in which she emphasizes their tragic fate. George C. Scott as Bert Gordon is an antagonist on duty. He is an evil which trades with feelings and souls. His performance is very convincing. Jackie Gleason (Minnesota Fats) is a cool as a legendary player. However, he has become a prisoner of his talent and money.Maybe this movie is a strong projection of the real world, which is complemented with a cynical reviews and a tragic-ironic end. The protagonists have condemned themselves to a bitter taste of life.",

            "content": "When Paul Newman got his teeth into a role he could really deliver. Nobody else could have handled roles like the leads in \"Cool Hand Luke,\" \"Hud,\" \"The Verdict,\" or this, his first major effort, \"The Hustler.\" Not to say that Newman's performance makes the movie because ALL of the major performances are superb, as is the direction by Robert Rossen, the script by Rossen and Sidney Caroll, and the jazzy blues score by Kenyon Hopkins. Even the set dressing couldn't be much improved. This one is a winner.Newman is \"Fast Eddie\" Felson from Oakland, California, who comes to New York to play the reigning king of the game of pool, \"Minnesota Fats\", done to a turn by Jackie Gleason in a dramatic part. The initial contest drags on for twenty-five hours. Newman, a small-time hustler, is as talented as Gleason but he drinks recklessly and becomes over confident, fatigued, and careless. He loses everything he'd won when the game began.Cutting a long story short, Newman ditches his sensible old partner, Myron McCormick, meets a lame alcoholic, Piper Laurie, and moves in with her. Laurie falls very convincingly in love with Newman but his attitude towards her is casual, sometimes callous. Failing at local hustling and getting his thumbs broken in the process, Newman comes under the tutelage of gambler George C. Scott. Scott had made a good deal of money off Newman's losing the bout with Gleason, which Scott attributes to a lack of character. There is an immediate antipathy between Laurie and Scott. She sees Scott as a materialist with no soul, and he sees her as structurally weak, which she is. Scott wins the contest but Newman acquires \"character\" in addition to talent, and in the final match up, he beats Gleason flat, then leaves town alone.It's a tragic story. Newman may \"win\" in the end but Laurie loses everything in order to make that victory possible. Newman's character arc is clear. He begins as a cold-blooded hustler, using everyone to advance his standing in the game's hierarchy. He dumps his old friend and partner, McCormick, and chooses to play a game of billiards with the effete Murray Hamilton over leaving with Piper Laurie. By the end of the film he is almost destroyed and willingly gives up big-time pool, which is not a bad idea since his achievement, in beating Gleason, was stunning. What could he do for an encore? I kept waiting for some trap door to open and have the whole enterprise collapse but it never happened. (The deck sagged only once, during the final shoot out between Newman and Gleason, when Newman spells everything out for an audience that, in its infinite maturity, must already understand.)It's hard to believe that Piper Laurie once played third fiddle to Francis the Talking Mule or Elvis Presley the Singing King. She's not the cloyingly sweet cutie from the early 1950s. She's worn -- just enough. She doesn't play the character of the drunken slut flatly either. She brings nuance to the part. Her voice is a mellow contralto and has peculiar and unpredictable ups and down, and often she turns her face from the person she's speaking to and looks at him from the sides of her eyes. It doesn't come across as an acting trick. It seems more like the kind of habit we might find in someone we know. When she tells Newman in an firm declarative statement that she loves him, and Newman looks away embarrassed, we find that scene familiar too.Murray Hamilton's ultra-wealthy gentleman gambler is likewise outstanding. The photography has given us some angles of Scott that lend him a Satanic cast. Hamilton gives Scott some curious regard then turns to look at a statuette of a satyr, or perhaps its Bacchus or Pan, and remarks that Scott could have modeled for the sculptor. (Scott stares at it for a few seconds then says, \"It's possible.\") And when Hamilton loses a bundle of money to Newman and Scott during a game of billiards, he gives new meaning to the descriptive adjective \"shaken.\" But there isn't space enough to give this movie the attention it deserves. It was, in its time, a breakthrough film for Newman, Scott, and Gleason, and it led inevitably to one or two pallid imitations like \"The Cincinnati Kid.\" Fats and Fast Eddie became icons of vernacular culture, enduring enough that Eddie was resurrected by Martin Scorcese for \"The Color of Money.\" Scott repeatedly refers to Newman as a \"loser\" while Piper Laurie tells Newman he's a \"winner.\" Well, in the end, Newman is a tragic winner. The film itself is a winner.",

            "content": "Perhaps unsurprisingly given its title, The Hustler is a film about deception. Fast Eddie (Paul Newman) is a handsome, honest looking guy who hangs out in seedy pool halls, bars, and motels so he can hustle people at pool. He pretends to be drunk or impaired so the denizens of these places will look at him and see easy money. Once they are hooked, Eddie employs his great skill and beats them easily. Eddie is so good at this that in some cases the mark doesn't even realize he's been hustled.Merely beating common people out of their money is not enough for Fast Eddie, however. After what seems to have been years of hustling people, he decides to go after Minnesota Fats (Jackie Gleason) the man who is supposed to be the best pool player in the country.After his match with Fats, Fast Eddie ceases to travel. Before long he meets Sarah Parker (Piper Laurie) a depressed alcoholic and moves in with her. Eventually he prepares to return to the world of pool, upsetting his fragile lover. The conflict between the two sides of Eddie's personality (emotionless hustler and passionate lover) leads to the climax of the film.Every character in The Hustler is a hustler of some sort. Fast Eddie makes a living hustling and his relationship with Sarah begins as a hustle. Sarah's own hustle involves her invention of a character that she pretends to be all the time instead of being herself. Everything she tells Fast Eddie in early scenes is later revealed as a lie, ironically including the part about her past career as an actress. Eddie's manager Bert Gordon (George C. Scott) hustles Eddie by mocking him at certain times to keep him in control. Even Minnesota Fats hustles Eddie in subtle ways by acting as if he is in control during their contests.Essentially The Hustler is a character driven film about Fast Eddie's struggle to find meaning in his own life. He has to choose between success in pool or his relationship with Sarah. This conundrum (and his desire to prove himself) torments Eddie, but the decision is ultimately taken away from him and Eddie learns the bitter lesson that an individual doesn't always have time to make his own decisions.For those looking for a grimy, cynical character study seasoned with a pinch of melodrama, The Hustler is a great choice. Those looking for a glossy feel good film should look elsewhere.",

After initially falling behind, Eddie surges back to being $1,000 ahead, and suggests raising the bet to $1,000 a game; Fats agrees.This film is great for the trick shots alone, but then you throw in Paul Newman, one of the greatest actors of all time. Oh, and Jackie Gleason at his best? And even George C. Scott? You really cannot make a bad movie under those conditions.There is some talk that this film captures man at his most human, a striving to be the best in his field, a competitive nature. And, along the way, he must stumble... but this seems a bit of a cop-out. As I understand it, most films feature characters who strive for a goal and encounter an obstacle along the way.

When they're on screen or the story picks up, it's a gripping movie. There's not a duff turn among the supporting cast either.Negatives: Was Newman trying to be Brando? Because for me, his performance bombs - he looks like a nerdy college kid trying to act tough, the cockiness is totally forced and overplayed. And what are the redeeming features of Piper Laurie's character that Eddie puts up with her? She goes around being a mouse and bringing everybody down, the wrong sort of drunk for the story. These tough guys would have found a good-time gal, or at least told her to cheer up once in a while. If Eddie's trying to help her because he feels the need to help himself it doesn't come over in the script. Her aspirations to becoming a writer consist of four lines typed up one drunken afternoon, and the three (ten-dollar) words on the mirror. That's pantomime. There's no hint that she knows she's deceiving herself, or drinking secretly, or that she has any inner pain at all - she's just grumpy ALL the time. (She had polio and her father died - that's it? Maybe it's the hairdo). Sarah's misery is all taken as read, same as Eddie's genius (he never practices) and the characters come across as half-baked. Sarah's story also steals the focus from Eddie; she does make a far bigger sacrifice after all. But because the character is so thinly written, there's no chemistry between her and anybody. In fact the only dramatic tension is in the pool contests, which may make you feel 'The Hustler' is better than it is. Presumably this movie was part of the early 60's gritty realism trend in drama, but these preppy actors attempting a methody thing with the progressively more overripe script just come across as pretentious. 'The Cincinnatti Kid' is a far better sports drama of the time. 'The Hustler' tries to do too much.",

            "content": "'Fast' Eddie Felson is a pool hustler who is small-time despite his attitude and mouth. His attitude leads him to challenge the mighty Minnesota Fats to a game of pool, a game that lasts for over 24 hours and leaves Eddie broken and broke. Eddie dumps his manager and goes back to working small poolrooms for small change, hooking up with an alcoholic girlfriend who he met in a bus station and settling into life on the bottom.Widely regarded as a classic, it has been a few years since I last saw this film (well \u0096 almost a decade) so I decided to rewatch it in order to be able to review it properly rather than just writing off from memory. The film opens well with the scenes that are the strongest of the film \u0096 the hustling scenes in the poolrooms. However once the film gets past Eddie's emasculation by Minnesota Fats it enters into it's middle section where we watch Eddie slowly hit rock bottom before starting to try and get up again. It is this section that takes up most of the running time and it is this section that contains many of the film's weaknesses. As Eddie falls deeper, the film trades in its atmospheric style for something more akin to social realism. Given that this is the gut of the film it is a major problem that it really fails to engage to the same degree that the other parts do. It feels a little dated and obvious and, although it still works, it is not effective enough drama to be worthy of it's place on so many critics' top whatever list.However the real drama works well in the pool scenes and the related bits, these are delivered with style, good dialogue and atmosphere to boot. The characters spark off each other here and at times you can feel the silence in the room as if you were there \u0096 like Eddie himself says, silent like a church. It is in these scenes where Eddie changes both times and it is therefore here that the drama works best. Of course we needed the middle section to deliver a story and give us Eddie's whole tale as opposed to some cool and stylish pool (like Scorsese mostly did) but it is overlong (it didn't need to be literally a long night of the soul!).The cast perform well and really help the film. Newman is very good even if you can see that he knows this is a good role for him \u0096 the odd time you could see he was showboating a little but he mostly kept his performance accessible and under control. Laurie has less to work with and is merely a driver for Eddie's actions at the end and a comfort for him in their shared destruction; her performance is OK but she is left to carry the weight of the film's middle section. Scott is good despite only being in part of the film while Gleason and Hamilton are both fine in small roles.Overall I felt pressure to really love this film because it is a classic and so highly regarded by the majority of critics. While I did love parts of it and liked it on the whole, I didn't think the main middle section was really that good \u0096 it got itself bogged down and delivered too little over too long a time. It still works sort of but it isn't good enough as a story to be worthy of such high praise as it is often given. The pool scenes are really well done and it is here where we see just how stylish, gripping and interesting the film can be as the characters really spark off each other with a palatable tension but sadly, for me, these scenes only served to show up the middle sections failings all the more.

The whole film looks fabulous, with the photography not only looking beautiful and moody but adding so much to the gritty atmosphere, the pool scenes (especially the first one) beautifully shot. The set design is great as well. The jazzy music score is both intensely sleazy and emotionally sombre, like the photography adding so much to the mood. As said previously, few other sports drama are written as intelligently as The Hustler, the dialogue really provokes thought and has an almost poetic, searching quality and genuine meat, this is not skim-the-surface writing, this is meaty stuff that has an at times harrowing effect. A lot of it is quotable, who can forget Burt's \"you owe me MONEY\", George C. Scott's delivery playing a huge part of its impact, without him the line could have been just ordinary. The same can be said for the story which gives the world of pool a grittiness and excitement, the pool scenes have intensity as does the almost scary conflict between Paul Newman and George C. Scott. This is ceaselessly compelling stuff with no sugar-coating, it's not pleasant and can be downbeat but is done with such realism. The characters are far from black-and-white, for the types of characters they are they could have been easily, but flesh-and-blood complex characters especially Eddie and Sarah. The Hustler is brilliantly acted (all four leads giving among their best ever performances, a possible career-best for Laurie and Gleason), with Paul Newman giving one of his greatest and most balanced performances. And the supporting cast are just as unforgettable, with Piper Laurie at her most poignant and tortured, Jackie Gleason at his most restrained and most cool (remarkable for a performance that couldn't be far different from his comedy roles) and especially George C. Scott at his sleaziest and most chilling. All in all, a sports drama that is hugely deserving of its iconic classic status, one of the best of the genre. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

In fact, it was downright unpleasant to watch, too sleazy an atmosphere for me.The main characters, except for Jackie Gleason as \"Minnesota Fats,\" are all unlikable people. Gleason was fascinating but Paul Newman (\"Fast Eddie\"), the supposed \"hero\" of the film, was an arrogant punk; Piper Laurie was a drunk with an irritatingly horrible voice, and George C.

All we have to do is pull the blinds down.\"It's pretty cool when actors can actually play a sport or game really well, and in this case, Paul Newman and Jackie Gleason look fantastic playing pool as \"Fast Eddie\" Felson and Minnesota Fats. Fats has established himself as the best player in America when Fast Eddie approaches him in the opening scene, and it's a long, drawn-out duel through the night ensues, the outcome of which you can probably guess. Down but not completely out, Fast Eddie then meets a woman (Piper Laurie) who is a part-time college student, part-time aspiring writer, and full-time alcoholic.The film's transition to their relationship is a bit of a mixed bag. On the one hand, Piper Laurie is mesmerizing and turns in a brilliant performance. She plays her part so well she actually seems intoxicated in one of her early scenes, and her chemistry with Newman is fantastic, their kisses passionate whether drunken or sober. The middle section of the film also allows us the viewer to sink into the squalor of Fast Eddie's life. He's addicted to booze, addicted to gambling, and addicted to making a name for himself, the combination of which means he never knows when to quit. Newman is, as always, effortless and wonderful here. Unfortunately, the pacing to the film in this middle section isn't as good as it could have been, especially for a 134 minute overall runtime.George C. Scott plays a \"manager\"/gambler/gangster who demands a rather outrageous 75% cut of Eddie's winnings to connect him properly to the right kinds of games, the mirror opposite of the 25% his first handler was pocketing (Myron McCormick). The threat if he doesn't accept is that he might get roughed up, and there is as scene where Eddie is indeed maimed that's pretty frightening. This along with all the drinking and addiction gives the film a feeling of griminess, and indeed there is no grand redemption or happy ending to the love story. There is a depressing feeling that even if you're great at what you do, cutthroat businessmen will always in the end be in control, and the best you can do for yourself is to understand that, and to have a degree of control over yourself. It seems to me that the film is thus an even earlier example of the \"New Hollywood\" style filmmaking than Bonnie and Clyde, which would appear six years later. Overall, watch it for the performances and the pool play, don't watch it to feel happy.",

Scott then takes Newman along with him to hustle high-class players, but Newman's naivety and lack of intelligence do not help out his situation. \"The Hustler\" is also a love story as Newman and Oscar-nominee Piper Laurie self-destruct as Newman cannot control himself and Laurie cannot control a terrible alcohol problem. Heart-rending, entertaining, fascinating and brilliant in every way, \"The Hustler\" is one of the greatest films ever produced hands down. 5 stars out of 5.",

            "content": "The Hustler (1961)An archetypal man's movie in the poolroom. It's about power, and bluffing, and class. It really isn't about pool, or billiards, though there are some great shots by the leads, especially Paul Newman (and some great trick shots, too, not showing who is shooting them for the camera). But it is a little bit about poolrooms and poolroom ethics, and poolroom hustling.Hustling is the art of scamming, and it gets applied to pool in particular because it's a classic place to bluff your way in as a mediocre player and then win big at the end of the night. But as easy as this seems to keep an eye out for, or to avoid by playing your best no matter what, it gets to be a complicated mind game. And a game of plain old violence in the bathroom, where losers win in the end. Sort of.Jackie Gleason plays the great Minnesota Fats and does both of them justice (Gleason is stoic, sharp, and overweight, all important counterpoints to Newman's Fast Eddie). The third player is the ugliest character, the money man behind the players and ruthless, played with more restraint than usual for this actor, George C. Scott. Yes, three great male actors in a beautifully filmed, black and white, Cinemascope gem. And look for the actual ex-boxer great, the Raging Bull himself, Jake LaMotta as bartender. (No coincidence that the sequel to The Hustler and Raging Bull about LaMotta are both Scorsese's, but that's another tale.) Director Robert Rossen might be better known for some top notch screenplays, but among his other films is the great boxing story, Body and Soul (1947).As much as Newman is amazing, a defining presence in nearly every scene, it is the one woman in the movie, Newman's girl Sarah, who gives it depth and, oddly, life. Piper Laurie bounced between the stage and screen for decades before and after The Hustler, and managed two Oscar nominations in that time, including here. She not only gives her character believable depth and pathos (when she is allowed to--many scenes she's just sitting and watching), but she brings out the human side of Newman. My favorite scenes are when the two of them have something of a life together.Director Robert Rossen might be better known for some top notch screenplays, but among his other films is the great Body and Soul (1947), about boxing.",

Watching this for the first time, i was expecting a movie full of games of pool with trick shots galore, with Newman the hero getting the girl and beating Fats the champ, role credits...a nice little feel good story. wow, was i ever mistaken (and very pleasantly surprised to be). The Hustler is filled with great performances: Newman, Gleason, Scott, and Laurie all give great, GREAT performances that makes a fairly simplistic plot with little real action absolutely riveting to watch. Newman is great as Eddie the born loser with talent coming out of his ears, but not enough brains to know how to utilise it best. Gleason is great and says a lot with simple body language more than the few lines he has. Scott is phenomenal as always as a soulless gambler only looking out for himself and dragging all those around him down as well. Laurie is perfectly suited to her character, a desperate, lonely alcoholic who seems to know her relationship with Eddie is bad for both of them, yet is unwilling or unable to break free.The Hustler is amazingly written, with quotable lines and dialogue that just cuts deep into the cores of these characters; as they interact with each other and are forced to show their true colours, we see the true people underneath as the facade is stripped away. These are damaged, broken, confused, troubled souls who seem to gravitate towards one another, as if they can sense a kindred spirit. I have to say that the reason these characters resonated so strongly with me, is because, as unpleasant as it is to do so, i can see elements of myself in each character.This kind of movie is one that would be nigh on impossible to get made in contemporary Hollywood. A downbeat story from start to finish, with unlikeable characters, it is one of the greatest films i have ever seen. an absolute classic in the purest sense.",

            "content": "No need to recap the plot.Despite the hype of the time and Newman in a tailor-made role, the movie is spotty at best. Altogther, there may be 90-minutes of usable material, but stretched to over 2-hours, the pacing drags, particularly in the middle part. Writer-director Rossen inserts too many unnecessary pauses long after we've gotten the idea. For example, Sarah's (Laurie) alcoholic stagger down a city street goes on for a minute when 10-seconds would suffice. Then there are the many dialog pauses in the Eddie-Sarah conflabs. These may imitate life, but here they simply drag out the scenes pointlessly. Maybe if Sarah had more than a single drearily predictable personality, there might be more interest to the scenes and what she says. However, as things stand, her one-note character blows a hole right through the movie's middle.The film's strength lies in a raft of colorful supporting players, including the underrated Murray Hamilton who injects just the right amount of oily decadence into his Southern gentleman. Newman at the time was one of Hollywood's hottest properties. His rebellious role here was a near perfect fit for what would become his definitive screen image, though I agree that his Fast Eddie is not very likable and without the compensatory charm of a Hud or Cool Hand Luke.If my little review seems weighted with negatives, it's because I think the movie's overrated, and needs some deflation. Reputations can sometimes be misleading, especially now that the initial hype has worn off. At the same time, the hype was somewhat understandable since Hollywood was promoting more adult features like this one to escape the deadening hand of 1950's conformity. At its best, The Hustler's a good series of colorful character studies; at its least, however, it's slow and repetitive and far short of a classic.(In passing\u2014 for a sports movie, the action here is an oddity. Most sports films mine the moment-to-moment suspense of a crucial play. But there's none of that here. That is, we get no close-ups of crucial moments when winning or losing is in the balance. Rather, the detail in the games between Fast Eddie and Fats is skipped over in cursory fashion. The narrative's only interested in the overall outcome without playing up the suspense. I suspect that's because the rules of pool are not widely known, plus the action itself is too visually chaotic for an audience to easily follow. Anyway, I found the absence unusual for a sports movie.)",

            "content": "'The Hustler' is one of those films that shows its age. What seemed so dramatic back then, is really old hat now. Isn't Paul Newman's character 'Fast Eddie' rather obvious and one dimensional? We find out so little about him except for the fact that he's obsessed with making money and being 'top dog' in the seedy world he inhabits. This goes on ad infinitum. And of course, Sarah Packard, the wounded but insightful woman who attempts to steer Eddie away from his pointless existence, fails to make an impression on him until it's too late.I don't like films about 'sad sacks'. I've made this point in countless number of my reviews. It's as though the screenwriter is crying out for recognition: 'you see, I'm really a genius for recognizing just how down and out my characters are.' We're all supposed to experience some kind of catharsis when there's a moment of insight. But the problem is that there's so little to the characters to begin with. Yes we 'get it' that Fast Eddie is a loser and that when he beats Minnesota Fats at the end, it's a pyrrhic victory since Sarah is now dead (by her own hands) and Bert points out that Eddie won't be playing in anymore high stakes pool games ever again. When a character's transformation is so predictable, as it is here with Eddie's 'punishment' for his lack of empathy and general cluelessness, why heap accolade upon accolade on a screenplay that doesn't deserve it? Further evidence of the screenwriters' ineptitude is the treatment of the antagonist, Bert, played by George C. Scott. Is there a more unlikeable antagonist than this? There's really nothing good about him from the '75% stake' to his wretched treatment of poor Sarah. The word 'villain' is rubber stamped over his face from the beginning and it shows a complete misunderstanding of what psychopaths are like in the real world. In short, they're charming and likable\u2014the exact opposite the way Bert is depicted here. To their credit, Robert Rossen (who wrote the novel the film is based on) and the adapter, Sidney Carroll, manage to have the bad guys win out in the end, but their antagonist is so devoid of charm, that we can hardly believe any of it. Pull out your Sopranos DVDs if you want some verisimilitude.Plot-wise, 'The Hustler' is a slow-moving affair. There's the long drawn-out pool hall 'battle' between Newman and Jackie Gleason, who has little to do except hit a few balls around on a pool table. Then there's a lot of cuddling between Newman and Piper Laurie as Sarah followed by the big 'action' scene, where Eddie gets his thumbs broken by the local riff-raff. Newman ends up winning against a high-society billiards player and he's back playing against Minnesota Fats. Oh yes, I forgot about the suicide scene where Sarah can't take it anymore.'The Hustler', shot in black and white, has some decent cinematography and acting, despite the hokey script. As a piece of film history, it's worth seeing once but please don't try and convince me this is some kind of masterpiece. I can assure you that Roger Ebert's pronouncement that this film will grow in your \"memories\" is just another example of how wrong he often is in his evaluation of the top films that are out there.",

It also makes you a much better player on a standard size table. In addition, a very close friend of mine's father played Willie Mosconi in an exhibition game. Mosconi, who was one of the greatest pool players of all time, does the one trick shot in the film (known as a masse shot).

Eugene Schuftan's photography is one. There are scenes in bus stations, on city streets, and cheap apartments that capture a certain neglected aspect of the urban sixties that wasn't to show up again on screen for many years, till Schlesinger's Midnight Cowboy, by which time things had changed a good deal. Marginal lives, much less places, are seldom shown honestly in movies, with the bark off, so to speak, and no sentimentality.

The film is about character or more specifically about the development of character. It's about a character coming to realise what's really important in life. Robert Rossen commits to making Eddie a very complicated character who has both positive as well as negative traits. This is why, the character arc that he undergoes seems very effective. Phil Newman is charismatic as well as extremely emotive in his portrayal. What I also like about the film is the treatment of the character of Sarah. On one hand, she isn't the damsel in distress who is supposed to be saved by Eddie. But on the other hand, neither is she the pixie dream girl who is perfect and the fantasy girlfriend from a male perspective. Just like Eddie, Sarah is a complex character who is given requisite amount of importance and attention by Rossen. Piper Laurie's performance is really really great. There is a particular scene in the film where Eddie and Sarah attend a party. There is a particular tracking shot in that scene(which is marked by extremely loud music) where the camera is on Sarah as she walks towards the camera with Eddie visible at the background talking to another woman. The facial expressions and general demeanour of Laurie in this scene is absolutely heartbreaking. My only little gripe with the film is the treatment of character of Bert Gordon. Performance wise, George C. Scott delivers a good performance which exudes authority and charisma. But unfortunately, the Mephistopheles-esque aura that the character is supposed to personify(this symbolism gets explicitly verbalised in the film) doesn't get enough build up and I didn't really feel his influence on Eddie to be as strong as the film wants us to feel. Overall, 'The Hustler' is a really impressive film that revolves around a sport, but is mainly about character ala 'Raging Bull'.",

After initial success, Fats beats Eddie, with him being battered and beaten. He ends up forming a relationship with an alcoholic woman, Sarah (Piper Laurie), a woman who is beaten down by life.

It is a character drama, it is about the broken American dream (like the writer John Steinbeck focused on). Many of the characters are flawed in some way. Eddie is a very arrogant character, who doesn't know where to stop and is almost on the path to self-destruction. Sarah is an alcoholic, who has given up on her dreams. Bert Gordon is a user, a man who only thinks of his own self-interest, an good villain. The Hustler strongest element is the acting, with top performance from all the actors.

            "content": "\"The Hustler\" was criticized by Variety when it came out for being too realistic, making it boring. If that was true at the time (and judging from the Oscar nominations, I would have some doubts), it's what makes it endure so well. This movie is smooth, nothing seems dated. The acting isn't theatrical or too \"Method,\" there are no big moments where someone flips out. Made today, this movie would be just as good, although I wonder if someone would have the patience just to let things be, the way Rossen does here.The opening sets the tone: the opening music behind the freeze-frame credits. The score by Kenyon Hopkins, who hasn't done much more than \"12 Angry Men,\" has a stressed yet sleepy, jazzy style and a minimal quality. The movie is similar. It's quiet and forceful. The actors make use of the lack of words, and make the best of the words when they have them (\"You owe me money!\"). Of course, it doesn't hurt that all four of the main characters are terrific. It's where Newman, in one of his greatest anti-establishment roles, became a truly respected actor and not just someone from the Actors Studio who looked good in an undershirt (he still does). He's like a more human Marlon Brando -- not as volcanic, but more realistic.\nFor the supporting players, Scott, as the man who wants a piece of Fast Eddie Felson (Newman), the hot new kid, is at his very best (early in the film he makes moving a chair seem utterly compelling). Gleason, as the legendary Minnesota Fats, has few words (and making appearances only at the opening and closing, his performance is almost like an extended cameo) but that makes him all the more memorable. He doesn't need to talk -- this guy's got tenure (he's also the film's heart and soul). Piper Laurie, as Sarah, Eddie's girl, is partly a mystery. She's an alcoholic and she has some troubles, but we don't know much else about her. Her interactions with Newman are superb and their relationship grows believably; by the end of the movie (well, not quite the end, I guess), they're nowhere near where they began.In the first pool game, we can't help but smile when we look at Newman. He talks tough and because of it we expect him to lose. Throughout the film he has some looks of disappointment that are genuine and perfectly timed.Eddie's partner, Charlie, adds something to the film, as well. We don't know exactly how to feel about him. Does he think of Eddie as a son or as someone to generate money? He's getting old and would like some financial security, but he's not a bad guy. He's not vicious the way Scott is. There is a really small cast at work here. The only other person I feel I should mention is James Findley, the rich Kentucky billiards player that Eddie goes to beat. He plays his character as an effeminate southerner and it worked well. He's an elegant (probably gay) man that gives the film a little something else.Some of the personal moments between Newman and Laurie get longish, but with the appearances of Scott, the movie is immediately recharged. And sometimes it's enough to simply watch Newman -- the man couldn't look bad if he tried (the dinner scene - my God).I don't know much abut pool or billiards, but through and through this movie had me convinced. The pool shots are handled well, and I liked that we are shown more the players' technique and their face as they shoot, rather than the trick shots themselves.This is a serious movie -- for anyone who loved the poker scene in \"The Sting\" (which I see as a pleasant, but over-valued, crowd-pleasing entertainment that required Newman to do little more than strip down to his natural charm), this offers a more honest take. The hustles here aren't about a smile and a giggle, they actually mean something. The stakes are big here -- it's not just the money Eddie's playing for.\"The Hustler\" is a hardboiled American classic and one to see in widescreen -- it will suffer on TV. If you're looking for a classic with some class -- business as usual -- here she is. \"That's the way it's done.\"****",

I have to seriously wonder if one extra speech, which was apparently cut though I couldn't tell from where, would've bumped him up to full Oscar status (this was by the way) where Scott's animosity to the AMPAS began with his loss to Riff from West Side Story) - and the main cast is uniformly excellent.But I'm tempted to say that Piper Laurie may be my favorite performance of the bunch. Sarah has been used and doesn't always like that, but she is always in constant conflict about it; amid the trials Eddie goes through, she seems to go through her own, while falling in serious, non-kidding love with this guy. She has all of the layers to play here, and there are a few moments where I wondered if it would become less a \"Sports\" movie (and this is as much a sports movie as Raging Bull, Jake LaMotta connection) than Days of Wine and Roses - and this is, if \"About\" anything, addiction and personality disorders. She makes such a tormented character feel raw and real and vulnerable and strong and charming and just everything that you want out of a movie character. Her final scene is also shocking, though I still didn't expect what would happen next.And Jackie Gleeson. I half expected him at one or two points, following a Fast Eddie clip, to go \"We got a Weisenheimer, Alice!\" He was part of the 'coolness' of this picture of me, super tough, possibly dangerous but, in his way, kind of like that old-bad*ss knight (or gunslinger, and when Eddie re-enters the bar for the climax it has that feel too of a saloon in the Old West) who gets challenged and goes toe-to-toe with another upstart knight or something.George C. Scott... When he exclaims in that final scene \"You owe me MONEY!\" I let out a laugh, not as it was funny exactly but it was so unexpected and charged. He the tough, a-hole Capitalistic shark of the movie, as Eddie (yes even as Newman was 35 when this was made) is young with that go-gettem spirit but with heart and all that jazz. Scott plays this guy as someone who, in other hands, could be the hammy villain of the movie, whereas with him he also makes him almost a tragic character. Almost.Oh, and the filmmaking is crisp and innovative in parts - those montages, so captivating - and knowing, along with Dede Allen, when to leave the camera going without a cut, or to keep the cuts smooth and good for a conversation (Sarah's breakdown at the party the former, when she and Eddie meet at the bar the latter).Bottom line, a sort of \"guy\" movie that owes more to film-noir than sport movie clich\u00e9s. I'm not sure what I was expecting - the Color of Money is the good but still, it-can't-be-helped, inferior follow-up - but I got a minor masterpiece.",

            "content": "The Hustler is one of those rare films that has been so well crafted that it is lauded by both critics and savvy audiences alike as a benchmark film, the quintessential movie about pool, its players and hustlers, and the obsession and drive involved with wanting to be the greatest. What makes a movie great is when all the elements come together so beautifully, from the casting, acting, directing, cinematography, editing, etc., that it works virtually flawlessly both as a whole and as individual elements. The Hustler is one of those films. You could argue how you could have made it differently but you would be extremely hard pressed (or delusional) to claim you could have made it better. As anyone who has seriously acted or otherwise participated in a film or play will tell you, once enough of the right elements have come into play, the film or play will take on a life of its own and all the strengths will make each other stronger and better, the rare phenomenon of a group of individuals working on the highest common denominator, as opposed to the too frequent degenerating into the lowest common denominator. The casting is great with not a single weak performance anywhere from a young Paul Newman when he was at the peak of his craft, down to Jake LaMotta (the real \"Raging Bull\") who plays a bit part as a bartender. The acting is so often brilliantly understated you might think you are watching a documentary, especially since the film is shot in stark black and white. The unflinchingly honest realism is one of the underlying elements that gives this film such great life. None of the characters or situations are glamorized, including the love between Eddie (Newman) and Sarah (Piper Laurie). They are two lost souls who are drawn together by their shared angst and alcoholism yet develop a true, powerful love that is heartfelt and realistic. They don't magically make each other perfect but they do bring each other some happiness and relief from their loneliness. Jackie Gleason is perfectly cast as Minnesota Fats, partly because he was \"The Great One\", Jackie Gleason, but also because he really knew the game of pool. Probably Holloywood's greatest all time pool player, in real life he hustled full grown men when he was an eight year old kid. Incidentally, both Newman and Gleason did their own pool shooting in the movie, adding to the movie's realism. George C. Scott plays Bert Gordon, the powerful, dangerous hoodlum who controls the money and action for both Eddie and Fats. Scott gives such a fine performance you could easily imagine he would have been a real life Bert Gordon if he hadn't been an actor. If you want light, shallow fare, then \"The Hustler\" is not for you. But, if you are looking for a great, honest movie that will haunt you as you remember many of the moments in dark poolrooms, where everyone smoked and drank too much back when they were socially encouraged and viewed as relatively harmless; a film that neither preaches nor glamorizes, it just shows what is, powerfully and unapologetically, so you are forced to draw your own conclusions as you see that everything has its price and that even for the supposed winners, there are no magical, happily ever after scenarios where everyone and everything is beautiful and perfect, but rather flawed and struggling to find an elusive state they will probably never achieve, then you will truly enjoy \"The Hustler\", a great film.",

            "content": "It's always fascinating when a movie transcends the concept suggested by it's title. In this case, one has to wonder who was the greater of the two hustlers, Fast Eddie Felson (Paul Newman) or slick Bert Gordon (George C. Scott). Set in the seedy, not yet professional venue of high stakes pool, the film becomes a taut psychological drama played out between it's principals, ending in an unanticipated 'contract of depravity' suggested by Eddie's pick up girl friend Sarah (Piper Laurie). With that in mind, the character of Minnesota Fats (Jackie Gleason) becomes almost a secondary player, which of course couldn't be further from the truth. The film balances itself with almost equal weight on each of the four central characters, with an ebb and flow that makes you forget how truly depressing the story actually is. For that reason, it's a classic piece of movie making that deserves to be mentioned in conversations of the top films of all time.Somehow I found myself comparing Newman's Fast Eddie to Marlon Brando's Terry Molloy in \"On The Waterfront\", an underdog determined to prove himself in a world that finds it easy to honor winners and discredit losers. The distinction often lies in the self confidence and mental toughness of the person competing for honor and recognition. By the time Eddie takes on Fats in the finale, one can sense the shift in attitude of the three high stakes rollers, done with nothing more than facial nuance and body language; in this case the game is over when the fat man sings.Outstanding performances and excellent black and white cinematography capture what might almost be considered film noir but without a subversive criminal element. Yet the story does have it's victims, most eminently Lauirie's character at a point in the story when she's reduced to complete vulnerability. In fact, each of the principals is a victim in one way or another, in a film that allows it's protagonist to attain the goal he sets out with, but without anyone actually feeling very good about it.",

            "content": "Paul Newman stars as \"The Hustler,\" a fantastic film that costars George C. Scott, Piper Laurie, and Jackie Gleason. It's the story of a young man, Eddie (Newman) who makes his living as a pool shark. Then he meets three people who will change his life: Minnesota Fats (Gleason), Bert Gordon (Scott), and Sarah (Laurie). Both Gordon and Sarah see the man that Eddie can be - but they're seeing different things. Which man he will become remains to be seen at the beginning of the film.This is a gritty, black and white movie that takes place in pool halls, cheap hotels, and rooming houses for the most part. The people populating it are drunks, hustlers, parasites, and desperate people. Eddie is a young guy obsessed with winning, money, and taking down Minnesota Fats. Gordon is a gambler who bets on men, staking them with his money and taking their souls in return. Laurie is a lonely, lame alcoholic who falls for Eddie but finds him distant and preoccupied. They all play their parts as he learns what the game of life is all about for real.There's no question that even if he had not made some of the films he did, Paul Newman would have become a tremendous star. He's a magnificent actor, magnetic, and handsome to boot. But he probably owes a couple of his films to the death of James Dean - \"Somebody Up There Likes Me\" was definitely one, and more than likely this would have been another. Both men, of course, had the talent and unique sets of qualities to enable them to make a role their own, and Newman plays this complex role beautifully. In some scenes, his character will not permit any emotion to show, but toward the end of the film, faced with a tragedy, his whole body gives way as if someone has just hit him in the stomach with a boulder. The great thing about Newman is, despite his tremendous fame, you always forget it's Newman and become involved with the part he's playing. 25 years later, this role would win him the Oscar he should have received the first time around. Well, better late than never.George C. Scott is great as Gordon. In the case of Gordon, he has a put-on persona - but when the real Gordon comes through, it's scary. Your heart goes out to Laurie's character through her touching and very strong performance as a pathetic woman whose life is isolated and stuck in a bottle.Each actor in the film has a difficult role to play, as there are no one-dimensional characters, and each actor cast has amazing ability. Probably few actors or performers ever had the ability of Jackie Gleason. As Minnesota Fats, he projects a rock-solid persona that takes over the screen - and he does it with precious little to say. The expression on his face, the way he sits, tell you everything you need to know.Stunningly directed by Robert Rossen, \"The Hustler\" is a no-miss but only if you want to see great acting and a compelling story.",

Paul Newman and Jackie Gleason (and in a smaller dimension, George C. Scott) look great on the screen, but since part of Rossen's process as a director is showcasing technique, a few sequences lapse into melodrama and the second-half of the film isn't as strong as the first. Piper Laurie's love-interest (her last role on film until \"Carrie\" in 1976) is interesting without being terribly important. Harry Horner and Gene Callahan also won Oscars for their art direction.

However, unlike most sports films, this one is equally concerned with life outside the pool hall.Paul Newman gives a standout performance as a charismatic pool hall hustler. He has exactly the right mix of charm and assurance that makes his character both likable and believable. Jackie Gleason, on the other hand, gives a nicely understated performance as 'Minnesota Fats' which is the perfect complement to Newman's brash portrayal of Felson. I was also impressed by George C. Scott's turn as manipulative gambler Bert Gordon. These three actors all received well-deserved Academy Award nominations. So did Piper Laurie as Felson's love interest, though I must admit that I wasn't completely sold on her somewhat mannered performance.The story is interesting and will certainly take you by surprise if you're expecting a cookie-cutter sports film. The matches between Felson & Fats are central to the plot but the events in between are the real guts of the picture. That being said, I do think that there was just a little too much emphasis on the non-sports elements of the film, causing it to drag slightly as a result.While none of the technical aspects of the film particularly stood out for me, the direction by Rossen is solid and so is Dede Allen's editing. Meanwhile, the cinematography & set decoration won the film its two Oscars (out of nine nominations). The jazzy score is also ideally suited to the subject matter.I particularly recommend this movie to fans of sports films though its value as a serious drama should not be underestimated. Certainly a film worthy of classic status.",

            "content": "Robert Rossen's \"The Hustler\" is widely considered to be one of the greatest films of all time, and I would eagerly agree. Although it may seem dated on first inspection, it still contains rather subtle (or not-so-subtle) elements of sex, alcoholism, violence and drug abuse -- although it doesn't \"show\" all of these things, it certainly implies it. \"The Hustler\" is one of the key films of the 1960s and paved the way for the controversial, mature cinema of the late 1960s and 1970s. In an era when color comedies starring Rock Hudson and Doris Day were flooding the cinemas, \"The Hustler\" -- shot in grim black-and-white -- carries an aroma of steamy sensuality and visual decadence that helps to retain its classic status to this day.\"The Hustler\" follows the young \"Fast\" Eddie Felson (Paul Newman), a pro pool player renowned for never losing a game. When he goes up against Minnesota Fats (Jackie Gleason), his pride pays a price and he loses everything. Meanwhile he falls in love with the seductive Sarah (Piper Laurie), an addict who pulls Eddie down into her world. And he strikes a contract with the seedy manager Bert (George C. Scott) in order to regain his composure and take on Minnesota Fats again.\"The Hustler\" follows the routine sports-film formula: Our hero loses, falls in love, trains again and goes up against the \"villain\" of the film (who, in this case, are probably two people -- Minnesota Fats AND George C. Scott). This approach can be seen in just about any sports film, particularly \"Rocky\" which would be released over a decade later.But like \"Rocky,\" at the core of \"The Hustler\" is an examination of a man, and not the sport. This is a character-driven piece that uses pool as a backdrop to the human conflict.Fast Eddie Felson is one of cinema's deepest characters (his evolution in \"Color of Money,\" based on his wisening experiences here, particularly satisfying and realistic). \"The Hustler\" portrays Fast Eddie before he matures into the older man we see in Martin Scorsese's belated sequel -- this is great because it only complements the story and character's continuation.Some people have complained that the movie becomes too \"bogged down\" in its middle and focuses on the home-life of Fast Eddie with his girlfriend. Although I initially felt the same, and do feel it probably is a bit too long at times, it's important to remember that this is supposed to be a character study, not a sports film (as the DVD documentary claims many people misjudge it as).As a sports-themed film, \"The Hustler\" is very good. As a character-driven motion picture, it is one of the best of its kind and a true classic with some of the most steamy b & w visuals ever captured on film. Highly recommended!",

I pass no judgment; I like both styles, but having both in one movie makes for a slightly uneven mix. Paul Newman I tended to find a little too theatrical and stagey at this stage in his career, though he has charisma coming out the ears. He does that same cracking himself up with some private joke laugh that he does in Cool Hand Luke. He only really became a great actor in the 70s or even the 80s, in my opinion. You're not 15 minutes into the movie before a Fast Eddie-Minnesota Fats showdown is underway. There's sort of an emotional letdown after the intensity of that early highpoint.George C. Scott is electric. He really hit the ground running, nabbing Supporting Actor noms for Anatomy of a Murder and this film early in his career. But the story arc of poor Piper Laurie makes this film a tough and slightly unpleasant watch, as good as she is. Watching this film again helps give some resonance to the sequel The Color of Money, which I also saw again recently, in which Newman's Eddie (and anyone who's seen the original film) can see many of the same traits in the Tom Cruise character that he himself had in the first movie.Oh, and special mention of Myron McCormick, who plays Fast Eddie's first manager, whom I've just learned about by reading that new book about Henry Fonda and Jimmy Stewart. During the Depression, McCormick shared a one-bedroom apartment with Fonda, Stewart and Josh Logan in Manhattan and was the only one of the four getting steady work, in radio. He had his two highest-profile roles at the very end of his career: this film and No Time for Sergeants. Unfortunately, he was dead at the age of 54 only a year after making this movie.",

Paul Newman was perfect in his role as Fast Eddie Felsen and delivered a full menu of the many sides of this character. The authentic on-scene locations were a vital part, as were the fantastic excellence of the roles played by Piper Laurie, Jackie Gleason and George C. Scott. Piper Laurie had withdrawn from movies for several years demanding not more money but rather a substantive role. Thus her portrayal of the alcoholic and lame Sarah Packard, the finest role she ever played. Likewise TV superstar Jackie Gleason stars in his first movie and puts aside his comic side to deliver a restrained and excellent portrayal of Minnesota Fats. A new actor named George C. Scott would find his career built on his role as the bad guy. JTS Brown bourbon was put on the map by this picture. People were ordering it left and right after hearing Newman's demands for it. (Minor spoiler) So many quotes on this website, but not this one. Newman has suggested that he get a bottle and take Sarah Packard take him home. She agrees. At the door: SARAH: Why me? EDDIE: (A hard kiss). SARAH: You're too hungry! (She turns and enters alone). Some extra history --- Theater owners in 1961 were justly furious with 20th Century-Fox for selling the rights to 20+ prime movies for NBC'S Saturday Night at the Movies, making quality films available at home and free on the movie theaters' prime night. In revenge, THE HUSTLER was given almost no promotion or advertising in either its first or subsequent neighborhood runs, moving it quickly into a planned early death. Then along came word-of-mouth advertising and a few theaters cleverly booked and promoted re-runs after the movie's theatrical rental fees had dropped to minimal. Some theaters in my city played the re-run for 14 to 16 weeks, when just one week was normal for a hit film. One last comment: There was an unfortunate and substandard sequel made in 1986 by Martin Scorsese. Forget that one and find the original. Too bad in 2005 or 2006 not one single film comes even close to the excellence or entertainment value of \"The Hustler.\"",

Jackie Gleason is composed and stylish as the Fat Man. Myron McCormick is completely authentic as Eddie's manager. George C. Scott is incredible as the gambler Burt and relishes his power over people.A 10 out of 10. Best performance = Mr. Scott. I think Rossen only made one more film after this (LILITH).

Now broke and without a manager, he agrees to be taken on by ruthless big-time manager Bert Gordon(played by George C. Scott, superb).

            "content": "For a non-billiards-player, one might cavil this monochromatic classic seems to be a shade monotonous for the first half an hour of the running time, although one will surely be stunned by Newman and Gleason's pool table panache, but thanks to its confined layout and dooming denouement, a game predestined to lose for Newman with a prolonged battle against sleepiness and spiked by alcohol intake, all too familiar and stale to prompt a taut vibe. However, things are getting better, when Sarah (Laurie) being introduced to this male-crammed coterie, she lights up the screen instantly, a damaged cripple longing for a secure relationship, her chimera would eventually be shattered into pieces to cement her lover Eddie's (Newman) \"character\" which is prerequisite for him to be the top pick among the bunch. Laurie's intuitively destructive performance enables the film to be more affecting than the usual offerings where female-roles are decorative and neglectful. Newman also stretches out in his best form to deliver the gamut of emotions through the narrative arc, deadly charming as he is, Eddie is a far cry being a complete likable fellow as he appears to be, even finally he beats Minnesota Fats (Gleason) and valiantly defies and censures Bert's (Scott) greed and vileness, he still bears a certain degree of responsibility to the tragedy occurred before, in the end, he is more a repentant sinner than a victorious hero. Each of the four actors (Newman, Laurie, Gleason and Scott) grabbed an Oscar nomination for his or her work, both competing in the supporting actor category, retrospectively speaking, Scott's flagrant menace isn't a too taxing requirement out of his comfortable zone, while Gleason's reserved taciturnity implies much more chewy undertones than he purports to be, which positively suggests his background story would spin another gripping and morally-ambiguous tale easily. Personally I give the edge to Gleason. Other than a sterling cluster of awards-worthy performances, THE HUSTLER is elegantly conducted by Robert Rossen, a gone-too-soon figure in Hollywood manufacture (passed away at the age of 57 in 1966), conscientiously teases out the best of his cast under a low-key production paddings and represents us a visceral parable on human nature's weakness. P.S. The next step for me to dig into Newman's oeuvre is the unofficial sequel THE COLOR OF MONEY (1986), a Scorsese's production belatedly gave Newman a golden statue which he should have won decades ago.",

The lead character 'Fast' Eddie Felston is a brilliant pool player and there are several games that are pivotal to the narrative but the movie is really firmly about the people. It's a story populated by characters on the fringes. 'Fast' Eddie himself may well be a highly talented pool shark but his life is in a mess. He is full of self-doubt and going nowhere. His story arc is hardly typical of sports dramas; if anything it resembles a tragedy, the ending is at best bitter sweet. It's a pretty dark film overall. It was a new type of Hollywood picture back in 1961. For its time it must have been fairly daring and modern. It still feels modern to be honest and that says a lot about how well made it was. The characterisations are unashamedly complex. No one in the film is cardboard, they are all multi-dimensional. Even the villain of the piece Bert Gordon is a fully rounded creation and you can empathise with him on occasion.The writing is extremely good and it's matched by the extremely high calibre acting. Paul Newman, Piper Laurie, George C. Scott and Jackie Gleason are all exceptional; but even minor parts by Murray Hamilton and Myron McCormick are immaculately played too. It's a film of drama of the top level but highly cinematic too. It has excellent widescreen photography, in beautiful black and white. Presumably it wasn't shot in colour because the studio figured this dark and serious story wouldn't be a big commercial proposition. The soundtrack, like many from the time, has a lush jazzy score that adds a great deal to the downbeat feel.The Hustler is a complex film with considerable depth. It hasn't aged at all. It's one of the best dramas from the 60's.",

Like the backstage of people surviving as they could, before they lost any opportunities for choosing their way, as searching misery by non sense of daily life in an urban surviving style at the backyards of night activity. It was this lack of poetry from such an ordinary people, nonetheless skilled and waiting for chance in their lives, that this movie wins its fame as hymn of wrong side from the consumption society of values, to the time when should fighting for more dignity in their social blindness. This is still a portrait of modern misery, with a slight touch of gangsterism in a dramatic pause for any kind of sport. Where a big guy doesn't like anymore lose whatsoever, when gambling with such a young man in the middle of night till dawn. The quality of the main prize here is having for the least his thumbs broken and a less crippled girl as lover, because she killed herself meanwhile waiting for his lost soul helping still her busy dependence.In this small universe of little corruption there, getting from the ground of bitter expectancy, as though a new kind of morality to the loser by such a convenience of the boss from his own tough underground soul, that still he - the young character of a snooker's player - will have much for learning about his ambition and ambitious career for this candid fellow here. Meanwhile, staying alive of course is enough and thinking better with such an empiric mind of daily struggle on snooker - green tableland of caves with smoking fog, sleeping in degraded hotels with cockroaches on the bed - is not so easy for instance. This movie also displays us degradation, as inside a fake luck's mentality for winning for the less an abyss by the lack of resources, even though the currency there it is not always favorable at the hands of such a young individual, in an odd match of snooker forever with apparently no way out.What can he does, on the spot's snooker with such a style, when then he was here with both hands in such a weakened condition, for would thinking to play again less better next time, with such an adversary who controls himself the gambling landscape nearby in this borough ? The scene that shows us a resigned man, watched as though with his own professional way of life cutting down for a while - out of the labor, perhaps as a new kind of vagabond from the roads - in this kind of provoked fatality in his capabilities, it is illuminated crudely with the neon on the ceiling and the shadows on the walls of such a kind of new misery, in a place where predominated individuals like some of the same generation of men without scruples nor comprehension for a young winner needing a renewed of the beginning of his life properly. This is irony about the contrast between the two gamblers, in a fake trend with the robbery of the money, as win it by the character of a gambler performed at this stage by Paul Newman in his best movie ever, it seems now. The money that is not due by the strength of the next events, it is in itself enough as symbolizing an atmosphere but quite dry on its smooth for displaying in its anodyne brutality and sordid welfare at stake in such a defeat. It was an odd story, without another immediate sequel at the same decade, like a television story later.",

Eddie's aim to be the best leads to some self-destructive actions, but he perseveres. Fine support comes from Piper Laurie - later known as the fanatical mom in \"Carrie\" - as a woman who gets Eddie to realize his full potential amid his damaged lifestyle, as well as George C. Scott, Murray Hamilton (Mr. Robinson in \"The Graduate\" and the mayor in \"Jaws\") and Michael Constantine (the patriarch in \"My Big Fat Greek Wedding\"). I guess that we in the 21st century will be less inclined to admire Jackie Gleason's performance, given what we now know about him,* but it's still an intense role.The movie is not just about pool and the specific effects that it has on Eddie. There's the issue of what it means to be human: a tragedy forces Eddie to attain self-awareness. Another thing is that director Robert Rossen used the movie as a sort of confession. Much like how he named names to HUAC, Eddie figuratively sells his soul for prestige. It was one of the first movies to take this sort of an unvarnished look at ego-affirmation. One of the many movies that represented the new direction that cinema was taking in the 1960s.All in all, a true masterpiece. Maybe not Newman's greatest ever, but one that any movie buff owes it to himself/herself to watch.*In the book \"Riders on the Storm\", John Densmore recalls a time when Jim Morrison got charged with indecency.

I've never read the original novel by Walter Tevis by you do get the impression that it's a bit too low concept and character driven for it to be translated to screen 100% successfully , cinema is a visual art , things must happen in a visual manner , action must take place . But despite everything Robert Rossen has tried to make a memorable cinematic work , the monochrome cinematography of Eugen Schuffun brings mood and atmosphere to the scenes and Rossen and co adapter Sydney Carrol do make a very good effort to show the internal dilemmas going on inside the mind of Eddie Felson who is danger of hitting the self destruct button . It's a very good attempt on making a film from a novel that could be instinctively described as \" Unfilmable \" and things could have turned out far worseStrangely when I was watching THE HUSTLER today I am struck between the parallels between Felson and Alex Higgins . For those of you who have never heard of him Alex Higgins was a snooker player from Belfast who went on to become world snooker champion aged 22 years in 1972 . Without Higgins snooker would have remained an obscure game played in billiards clubs unlike the multi million pound sport it is today . Unfortunately Higgins went on to ruin his life and career through alcohol and despite earning a fortune through tournament wins , exhibition matches and sponsorship deals ended up penniless and homeless , a sad tale of self destruction brought about by drinking and womanizing and hubris which unfortunately causes THE HUSTLER to pale in comparison as a story",

            "content": "I love the feeling of a well-adapted novel to film. Scenes have breathing room and the traditional three act structure of a movie gets abandoned for a greater focus on character rather than plot. Even though it's an original screenplay, it's one of the reasons I love Tarantino's The Hateful Eight, which, I think, has a similar feel. The story of Paul Newman's Fast Eddie as he rises, falls, and rises again in the world of the poolhall gives so much room for Fast Eddie, Sarah, and Bert to breathe that it feels alive and vital in very key ways.The central idea is about the difference between a winner and a loser, at least as Bert Gordon, the gambler, makes it out to be. But winning isn't everything about being a winner. In this movie's parlance, a winner is the one who wins it all, implying the best at something. And the best at pool in the world is Minnesota Fats, played by Jackie Gleason, a hulking titan of a man who keeps his suit in pristine condition even after over 30 hours of straight pool. Fats isn't really a character in this. He's an ideal, a goal, for Fast Eddie to overcome. If this movie were about a runner, Minnesota Fats would be the three minute mile. He's a monolith, and Fast Eddie has to beat him.The movie's first quarter is dominated by the first meeting between Eddie and Fats. It's an extended poolhall sequence that covers that more than thirty-hour match between the two. Eddie is determined not to just beat Fats, but to beat Fats so badly that Fats throws in the towel himself. And yet, even when Eddie is up by more than eighteen thousand dollars, Fats just keeps on taking his breaks to the small washroom where he combs his hair, puts his suit jacket back on, and puts baby powder on his hands, coming back ready to play with poise. Eddie slowly deteriorates, though, and it's obvious that he wants it too much and too badly. As Bert Gordon, who observes most of the match, says, Eddie is a born loser, and it was obvious that he was going to lose. And lose Eddie does.So dejected by his loss, Eddie abandons his partner Charlie and hangs out in a bus stop where he meets Sarah, played by Piper Laurie. Sarah is just like Eddie. Living off of checks from her estranged father, she attends college two days a week and spends the rest of the time drinking. Eddie moves in almost instantly, and the two develop a certain co-dependent relationship of shared misery. Neither has any real interest in pulling the other out of their melancholy, but they seem content to remain in their own with someone else who shares similar feelings. He starts hustling on the side, making a few dollars here and there, with the ultimate aim of facing Fats again.One day, he meets Gordon again who tells Eddie that Eddie is a born loser, that he lacks the character to become a winner. After healing from an incident where some of Eddie's marks break his thumbs for hustling them, he agrees to Gordon's terms where Gordon will front the money for Eddie's rematch with Fats in exchange for 75% of the take. First, though, Eddie must prove that he has the character to win by facing a socialite named Findley during Derby Week in Louisville. This is where Sarah and Eddie have their break.The implication of a winner in this film is that winning is the only thing important to him. In order to win, Eddie has to forget about everything else and focus on the game. That's one reason that Fats himself isn't really a character. We can't know more about him, about where he's from or who he loves, because he can't have that baggage. His life is pool, and nothing else should matter. In order for Eddie to get to that same level, pool must become as important to him, so when Sarah needs his help when Eddie is on the verge of proving that yes, he can turn the game around and beat Findley, he has to ignore her because the game is more important to him. This sends Sarah into her final depressive spiral, leaving Eddie with nothing but his game. Finally, he's ready to face Minnesota Fats again. He has the character to do it.What makes this movie work is what I started talking about at the beginning, its steady and generous focus on character. Eddie has a lot of time to develop, to make himself and his desires known to the audience and the people around him. What he wants, the contradiction of him finding someone he could love in Sarah and needing to cast her off at the same time in order to accomplish his goal of becoming a winner, it's all given time to make itself known through character interactions and without direct exposition. The character relationships end up feeling more real because of the time, and when Sarah tells Eddie that she loves him and he can't quite say it back, it makes sense and feels like a genuine extension of their characters. The ultimate tragedy of Sarah's fate feels all the deeper because of the work dedicated to her in the movie's first two hours.With Eddie final victory over Fats, he reclaims his own humanity by rejecting the game afterwards. He's done what he wanted, become a winner, and with that he's going to look for a way to get back what he had lost. He's had his taste. He's gotten Fats' respect. And that's all he really wanted.Newman is great at Fast Eddie. Piper Laurie is very good as Sarah, the broken woman on the edge and finally finding someone in Eddie. George C. Scott is fantastic as the manipulative and underhanded Gordon. Jackie Gleason is a pillar of a man as Fats. It's filmed impeccably, reminding me of the exacting method of framing from movies like Marty and The Big Country, a testament to Robert Rossen's professionalism and approach to filmmaking.The Hustler is a great character study that delves into the world of the poolhall with intelligence and energy.",

            "content": "Fast Eddie Felson (Paul Newman) and Charlie Burns (Myron McCormick) are two relatively successful pool hustlers. Felson walks into one pool hall and proudly claims that no-one will play him because no-one can beat him. When Felson discovers that the pool hall he's stepped into is the place where regular pool shark Minnesota Fats (Jackie Gleason) spends his evenings, Felson can't resist the opportunity to prove to everyone that he is the best and is capable of beating the best. However, Felson is outclassed by Fats which sets off a spiral of events in Felson's life which results in Felson losing control.When watching The Hustler today and watching Newman's performance I couldn't help but be reminded of Alex 'Hurricane' Higgins. Higgins was one of the pioneers of British Snooker and was one of the people responsible for making the game of Snooker popular and bringing the sport to a wider audience. Like Felson, Higgins was a flamboyant character who mostly entertained the masses whenever he was in front of a crowd or on the big screen. Sadly, Higgins, like Felson, had a very destructive personality, lacked self-control and drank heavily which ultimately proved to be his undoing. For me having a real person's life mirroring that of Felson's made the film feel all the more raw, gritty, believable and actually quite sad at times.Part of the reason that this film succeeds is Newman himself and of all the films I've seen him in this is easily his best performance. He is the heart and soul of the film and the downward spiral that we see him on later in the film is heart-breaking to watch. Piper Laurie is also excellent in support and is almost as good as Newman but there's no mistaking that this is Newman's film and he's able to carry it with aplomb. Gleason is also excellent in the brief screen time that he was given. As much as I would have liked to have seen more of him in the film I can understand why he was only featured at the beginning and the end.Structurally the film is a little uneven whereby the first 20 minutes or so fly by at break neck speed - up until Felson's defeat to Minnesota Fats. The pace slackens slightly when Felson meets Sarah Packard (Piper Laurie). The melodrama here does mean the film suffers slightly only because the start of the film is so fast-paced - although the melodrama is much better here than melodrama we see in other films because of the relationship that exists between Felson and Packard. Giving the couple a relationship that exists more out of co-dependency than anything else still makes this aspect of the story quite interesting.The final third of the film comprises of Felson being approached by Bert Gordon (George C Scott) who tells Felson that he'll act as a financial backer to enable him to take on Minnesota Fats. Like Fats and Felson, Gordon is a Shark but not in the same sense. Felson is practically penniless at this point which is something that Gordon exploits for his own financial gain. Lured by the prospect of making money and having another shot at Fats, Felson once again becomes blinded by the very things that got him into trouble in the first place (not knowing when to quit). The real tragedy here is that Sarah can see Gordon for what he is, but Felson cannot and it's this inability for Felson to step back and see the bigger picture that ultimately results in Sarah taking her own life. It's only at this point that Felson starts to put things into perspective and see things in a different light.Cue (no pun intended) the action and the final match between Fats and Felson. This is the moment that we've all been waiting for and whilst some may find it disappointing that the match between them was short and sweet I think this fitted better with the narrative. I got the feeling that Felson faced off against Fats not just to show that he could beat him, but to prove that he could do it on his own. Felson's constant retorts to Gordon clearly prove this point. I also felt that the Felson that faced Fats at the end of the film was very different to the Felson that faced him at the start of the film. He still had the bravado but more importantly had much more self-control (Fats conceding and Felson walking away at the end clearly proved that Felson was a different person by the end of the film). It also showed that a mutual respect existed between the two men which probably didn't exist at the start.The Hustler is a fantastic film and is certainly one of the finest character studies that I've seen.",

These two strike up an unlikely relationship...and after having his thumb's broken he hooks up with Bert for a comeback that starts with tragedy.This was a dark and sad story about not the best people. Well acted, it was a wonderful film in that sense...my favorite part however is the end when Fast Eddie and Fats give each other respect like they are two businessmen just doing a job with mutual respect.Tough to watch, I remember enjoying this much more the first time around. This time I was really struck by how sad the whole story is.Great film and a classic for a reason, be prepared for a darker story...one that won't leave you feeling the best about mankind.",

Newman has played this character many times, and it never gets old. This time around, he plays a pool hustler who gets himself into trouble by challenging a well-known pool master when he's still small-time.Even if you don't know the rules of pool, The Hustler will hold your hand and explain the rules to you so you don't feel lost by the time the major game sequences start. If you already know and love the game, you'll find yourself in heaven while watching this movie. It's a total classic, full of drama, tension, and a steamy romance that's easy to root for. Paul Newman gives an excellent performance, showing vulnerability in the highs and lows of performance gambling. It's worth it just to watch him, but chances are you'll probably come away liking the entire movie, too!",

What a matchup. Pool hustler Paul Newman against a seasoned Jackie Gleason in a white knuckles game of games. While THE CINCINNATI KID was a salute to playing poker, THE HUSTLER is a pool player's delight, actually telegraphing each shot with craftsmanship and precision. In fact, it probably remains the definitive pool movie thanks to the technical advice of Willie Mosconi, the icon of icons of pool playing world-wide. Newman and Gleason are perfectly matched, and quite similar to Steve McQueen and Edward G. Robinson in THE CIN CINNATTII KID. This truly is one of the great screen team duels, both professionally and personally. In fact, behind the scenes Newman actually challenged Gleason to a single game. Gleason, from the school of hard knocks, reportedly shut him down, not allowing another shot, except the first! So there you have it, entertainment on a far grandiose scale, and still difficult to eclipse after all these years. Lessons learned from both films; reach for the stars only if you can take the fall back to earth. But who listens! The proverbial eye-opener to the last shot.",

            "content": "\"The Hustler\" is a truly great movie not because it is filled with outstanding performances, exciting pool scenes, and beautiful cinematography, but because of its depth as a character study.  The story is of 'Fast' Eddie Felson (Paul Newman), one of the truly memorable characters in American film history.  He is a pool hustler, living off money he conned out of others.  He challenges Minnesota Fats (Jackie Gleason), who is managed by the cold Bert Gordon (George C. Scott).  When he loses, he falls into a pit of anger and internal suffering.  He meets Sarah Packard (Piper Laurie), an alcoholic cripple, who he lives with in his misery.  He goes on like this, driven only by his desire to defeat Fats.The movie shines in its character development, which is boosted by incredible performances from Newman, Gleason, Scott, and Laurie.  The story is about selfishness, greed, and the desire to win.  Gordon tells Felson he is a loser, who lacks character.  Throughout the story, Felson comes to realize just what the cost of his lack of character amounts to.The lighting and camerawork are first rate, capturing the atmosphere of the pool halls and bars beautifully.  The setting lends itself to the story, which happens to be about pool but could really be about any form of hustling.  The dark, dreary halls are a perfect setting for the lowlifes like Gordon, who make their money off the suffering of others, to exist in.Even if you don't like pool, this movie is a must see for two reasons: Newman's performance, and the fact that you won't find a better character study anywhere.",

            "content": "The Hustler was one of those movies that I thought I had seen before because the name is so iconic but soon as I started watching it i realised that I hadn't and what a treat this film was !Paul Newman plays Fast Eddie Felsen who hustles in the world of professional pool. Fast Eddie is a young hopeful on his way to challenging Minnesota Fats for his world title. When he starts getting feelings for a woman he gets into a dilemma.Firstly this is not really a film about pool at all . It's about addiction . Be that an addiction to the thrill of winning , an addiction to money or more horribly an addiction to Alcohol.\nNewman is fantastic . He's so cool yet he's playing an extremely flawed character so the coolness isn't something the viewer aspires too.Piper Lawrie is fantastic too as the alcoholic girlfriend who is always going to play second fiddle to the hustle and you just know that the relationship isn't going to end well but she is so desperate to be loved she'd do anything for Eddie .One inspiring decision was to make this in black and white . In 1961 most films were now being made in colour and you would think a film involving pool , it would make more sense but it being in black and white makes this much more atmospheric .\nAs for the actual pool scenes , I'm a pool and snooker player myself and I can always tell if an actor can actually play the game by the way he holds a cue and his hand position and believe me , Paul Newman knew how to play the game !Next step is to watch the follow up The Color of Money and see how that holds up against this film . If it's even half as good I'll be happy .",

In no other movie has there been such a universal theme so well portrayed. The theme here is what makes a winner, what defines a loser.  The answer is character. How do we obtain that elusive ring? Through the crucible of disaster? Of a love lost? By selling out?The pool game in this movie is merely a convenient prop. This movie is NOT about pool.  We have seen this shoot out before.  The fast young guy challenges the king. King of the Hill is a nice term for boys growing up. Some gain the maturity to move on, to quit using people for selfish gain. Tevis & Rossen state it takes character to overcome those early base animal instincts and to find inside ourselves there is more than raw physical talent that makes us winners. How many times have you read about a sports team `They have no character.'It could be anything other than a pool game; business `brick laying' `a jockey.'  The most telling statement was delivered by the character Bert Gordon (George C. Scott) to  Fast Eddie (Paul Newman) after Eddie's ego got him humbled, and his thumbs broken, hustling suckers.  ` This( read - life) isn't football, you don't get paid for yardage.' Just count the cash. And isn't that life in 1999? Just count the cash.  There are so many dialogue lines that that just hammer the senses.  Like \" You know what beat you Eddie? Character.\"But there is another side to this. Because as Fast Eddie Felsen states (Paraphrasing.)...If I take that then she never lived she never died.... Eddie doesn't sellout to cash, he already sold out a greater value, too late does he realize it, and finds some pride gained through newly found inner strength. Character, maybe?Yeah Eddie there is more than cash and technical talent to life.The acting, absolutely brilliant. Newman's best. He had the game face and demeanor of a dominant aggressor.  Everything in this movie is what life is : Power. It is at times subtle, linear, abstract, existential (They wear masks Eddie.) Piper Laurie delivers fragility and vulnerability better than Leigh in `Streetcar.'  Scott is the loser and is stunning in role.  Gleason is the mountain of a man Newman had to `climb' over to get to the top.  It is all here in one superlative package of cinematic art.The best ever.",

            "content": "\"Fast Eddie\" Felson (Paul Newman) is a brash young pool hustler with the talent to compete with the best in the game, namely \"Minnesota Fats\" (Jackie Gleason). On his way to his initial confrontation with Fats, Eddie and his older partner Charlie (Myron McCormick) work their hustle in pool halls along the way from California to New York. They have finely tuned their show which consists mainly of convincing the marks that Eddie has mediocre talent and any good shot he makes is luck. Then, when the money is on the table, Eddie comes through with just enough skill to win. But Eddie's desire to play Fats is much more than a hustle--Eddie wants to prove he is the best there is. The first encounter between Eddie and Fats is captured in a masterfully filmed, captivating scene that lasts over twenty minutes. During the course of that scene Bert Gordon (George C. Scott) comes to spectate. Bert is a behind-the-scenes power broker and Scott plays this villainous character to perfection. As an example of how small details can establish character, in one beautiful scene Eddie asks Bert to move, since his continuing to sit in the same chair for hours on end is bothering him. At that point Bert stands up, moves his chair a few inches, and sits back down. By calling Eddie a loser Bert delivers a psychological blow that contributes to Fats' winning. This also sets up pivotal themes about whether Eddie has the mental toughness and true desire to win, and what he is willing to sacrifice for success. These are questions most everyone faces, whether they consciously recognize them or not. Sometimes it is easier not to compete at all, or to buckle under the pressure and back off and settle for less. Anyone who enters the workplace has to figure out how aggressive to be and what they are willing to sacrifice to get ahead. After Eddie's initial defeat he meets Sara (Piper Laurie) in a bar and ultimately takes up with her. The fact that polio has left Sara lame plays a significant role, both actually and symbolically. Although we do not know her background, Sara is a sensitive woman who has been wounded by life and has retreated into alcohol, but her relationship with Eddie starts to bring her back to life--their relationship is crucial to Eddie's ultimately being able to understand the sacrifices made in order to pursue his passion.Each of the main characters is given substantial screen time. Between Newman, Scott, Gleason, Laurie, and McCormick you have five Oscar-worthy performances. And the supporting performances are all quality as well, particularly Murray Hamilton as a rich southern gentleman who plays a high-stakes game of billiards with Eddie. It's too bad that monetary inflation factors cannot be edited into movies-- the $18,000 (which does not seem like all that much now) that Eddie was up on Fats would be over $125,000 in 2009 dollars. So, the guys were playing for some pretty hefty stakes at the time. This movie is a high point in black and white cinema. Filmed in CinemaScope (aspect ratio 2.35:1) it should be viewed on a wide screen for full appreciation. Director Rossen takes full advantage of the CinemaScope format with many shots having three characters in the scene, two of whom are at the edges. The print on the DVD is sharp. I think black and white is a dying or dead art form. Recent movies are rarely filmed in black and white and those that are, such as \"Good Night, and Good Luck,\" do not have the crispness of the older ones and it seems that contemporary directors have lost the ability to work in this art form, which is quite distinct from color. Facial expressions are much more dramatic in black and white than in color and can convey subtle reactions and emotions without any dialog being necessary. This is particularly capitalized on in this movie; you are fully focused on the close-ups of Gleason and Scott in scenes that would hardly hold your attention in color. And the use of shadows can be highly effective. Consider the scene where Sara walks down the staircase at the Kentucky party. The shadows of the balusters on the wall accentuate that scene and concentrate your interest on Sara's descent in a way that would be less effective in color. By comparison to this film, Scorsese's follow-up \"The Color of Money\" some twenty-five years later is filmed in color and is much less striking. It's not like I am opposed to color (\"Lawrence of Arabia\" would be a complete dud in black and white), but I regret the passing of an art form.The jazz score (not always up-tempo) by Kenyon Hopkins is perfectly suited to the material. Most of the sets are actual places and that creates an atmosphere of realism. The pool hall is a classic.There is some sharp, meaty dialogue to be had. When Eddie offers the excuse to Bert that he lost to Fats because he got drunk, Bert answers:Sure you got drunk. You have the best excuse in the world for losing. No trouble losing when you got a good excuse. And winning, that can be heavy on your back, too, like a monkey. You drop that load too when you got an excuse. All you gotta do is learn to feel sorry for yourself. One of the best indoor sports--feeling sorry for yourself. A sport enjoyed by all, especially the born losers. An essential scene has Eddie giving this impassioned observation to Sara:You know, like anything can be great--anything can be great. I don't care. Bricklaying can be great, if a guy knows. If he knows what he's doing and why, and if he can make it come off.I cannot think of a single negative thing to say about this film.",

            "review_title": "Fascinating Introspection into the concepts of Winning and Losing ...",
            "content": "\"Eddie, you're a born loser\", these five words still resonate in my mind, while I remember the conversation between \"Fast\" Eddie Felson, Paul Newman's greatest and most fascinating role, and Bert Gordon, masterfully played by George C. Scott. Eddie is a hustler who uses his talent in pool for money, and he's ambitious enough to challenge the living Gods of the green table during high-stakes matches. His boyish smile and way of talk creates the perfect harmony between arrogance and vulnerability, both inspiring fear and sympathy, anything but suspicion. Paul Newman makes his role so believable that in no way, one can guess he's a hustler, which makes him a pretty good one. So Eddie makes money to challenge the big ones and when it comes to play the game for real, he believes in one thing : winning, and winning big time. So does Bert, a businessman, who believes in one and only one sacred principle : whatever you do, never lose your money. And this is what the whole movie is about, winning and losing.Watching \"The Hustler\" is like an introspection into the whole concept of a game. What's the purpose of a game ? For the common majority, we play, we might lose or win, but we're entertaining ourselves and having fun. But for a small minority, there's no fun, no entertainment except if this leads to one thing : winning. Eddie belongs to this minority, and not only does he believe in winning, but it must follow the opponent's rules. It's over if the opponent says so. Winning doesn't count, it's the way you win. A winner has an attitude, he just doesn't win. For one thing, it's hard for us to disagree, since we don't know many lame winners, they all have this little something inspiring our fascination, our disdain but never our indifference. Eddie can't afford the attitude of the winner because as a potential winner he might be, he still carries the attitude of the loser, who's unconsciously always looking for an excuse. It's less the attitude of a loser than the attitude of the winner who wants to win so bad whatever he does, he loses. What Bert calls 'character' is attitude without efficiency. Eddie still has to learn from Minnesota Fats who plays and wins in a cool, detached elegance beautifully embodied by Jackie Gleason like a tailor-made tuxedo. There's indeed a gracious coolness in Fats's attitude : whatever Eddie lacks, Fats probably incarnates it. It must be the wisdom, the capability of knowing when to stop. The passion, the ferocious desire to win consumes Eddie's mind so much, he can't even realize when he's losing. Gordon notices that, and uses a provocative approach to tempt Eddie to work for him to get rid of this inner enemy, this 'character' in order to challenge Fats again, and win this time. But this character is something much deeper, transcending the context of the game. It's a blinding passion and egomania, making Eddie an eternally unsatisfied man, incapable of seeing happiness when it crosses his road. This is Eddie's tragedy.And this tragedy is incarnated by one character. Sarah Packard, played by Piper Laurie. Sarah is like a talentless Eddie's alter ego, a woman spending her life pretending to study, to be what she is not, filling the emptiness of her life as she fills a glass with alcohol. Alcohol fills her life, gives it a taste, makes her forget that she doesn't have anything else to do. Alcohol acts on her like pool on Eddie, with the same burning power, and that's why they understand each other, why their romance seem so realistic and natural. But I'm a bit unfair towards Sarah, she does have a talent that Eddie lacks : she knows what love is. She knows she loves Eddie who's too blinded by his ego to realize it, and when he does, it's too late. Seeing Eddie dealing with this relationship with the same ego than he does for pool, makes you realize how the old Bert was right. And the \"born loser\" statement sounds like the premise of a tragedy. Losing a game is one thing, losing the woman of your life is another.The love story between Eddie and Sarah is the soul of \"The Hustler\" and the tragedy in which Bert played a significant part, a heart-breaking conclusion. Bert believed in winning money, Eddie in winning a game, Sarah in winning by not losing the most precious things. And she's the one who got the true meaning of the word. If Eddie asked himself only once, what's the most valuable thing for him, and for Bert, maybe the tragedy could have been avoided. Sarah was like Eddie's therapy and so was he. When his thumbs were broken, they ironically became a perfect couple, and you could see Sarah's bitterness when she saw his hands healed. She declares her love but she needs the words but Eddie can't admit loving as much as losing, his character is too strong, and like I said, that's his tragedy.This is the tragedy of \"Fast\" Eddie Felson, probably one of the most fascinating character studies ever made with my favorite game as a backdrop. A movie in black and white and a jazzy music, like a paradoxical mix of coolness and darkness, appearance of detachment for dark motives, the typical 'hustler' attitude.",

Eddie gets into a relationship with someone facing her own demons in alcoholism, Sarah Packard (Piper Laurie) who has to adapt to Eddie's dangerous lifestyle including being attacked.Director Robert Rossen made the film after times dominated by Mccarthyism in the U.S. and brought socially bankrupt issues to the screen such as pool hustling, gambling, alcoholism and suicide.

The Hustler works on every level to which it aspires including furnishing an idea of the life of a professional pool player which was way down its list of priorities for first and foremost it is our old friend the Morality Tale in drag. Newman takes his character, 'Fast' Eddie Felson all the way from callow, arrogant punk to mature, sadder-but-wiser man in the space of a few months in real time and Piper Laurie must have been a revelation to those who knew her only as cheesecake in Universal programmers of the early fifties.

Paul Newman is a pool shark named, Fast Eddie. The story follows his collision course with rock bottom and his showdown with the legendary billiards master, Minnesota Fats, (Jackie Gleason). The film also stars Piper Laurie and George C. Scott.This film is a classic and it has everything needed to keep you glued to the screen. It is another one of those films that unfolds like a good book. The slow, meticulous storyline still maintains a pace that helps the audience absorb everything going on in the film. It allows you to pay more attention to the characters to see the angst in their eyes, always wondering if their pain will end. It helps you learn more about them, so that you understand everything that happens to them.The film has the acting, dialogue and story for a great night at the movies. Director Robert Rossen gives us a study about human frailties. Paul Newman does an awesome job as the drunk pool shark. Jackie Gleason, who didn't really say too much, spoke volumes just with his eyes, facial expressions and his performance elevated the tension in the air. You eventually realize that the moral of the story is not about the game, so much as, showing the audience that, everyone has a life that they have to live and survive through, regardless of the cards they are dealt with.It is an excellent commentary on the horrors of addictions. A reminder that vices and bad habits can go out of control. This is seen through the lens of early classic/modern films of the day. The 1960s ushered in the modern day of film. Movies were reaching a maturity and sophistication. The idea of telling serious dramatic stories was on the rise. The censorship barriers were starting to ease some. The film is a looking glass into how society felt in the early 1960s about the topic of addiction.What a life Newman's character was living, and I mean that very loosely. A man, who is so absorbed into his addictive life, who has to wonder when/where his next meal might be or when/where he might figure out his sleeping arrangements for that night, does not sound like a man with a lot of good karma. The film shows what making deals with many devils can be like and the consequences that follow..8.8 (B+ MyGrade) = 8 IMDB.",

            "content": "Paul Newman has here one of the greatest roles of his career, and he accordingly gives one of his best-ever performances. \"Fast\" Eddie Felson is a professional pool hustler with real talent, but he's also obsessive. He's not the type to leave well enough alone, or quit while he's ahead. Losing a match to the famed American pool player \"Minnesota Fats\" (Jackie Gleason, in a nicely under-stated portrayal), he lets a slick gambler, Bert Gordon (George C. Scott), take him under his wing. He also takes some time to romance a neurotic, boozy young woman named Sarah (an impressive Piper Laurie). More than anything, Eddie yearns to be a lot more than \"small time\".There's actually not that much pool playing in this insightful film. Mostly, it serves as a character study - an intelligent, thoughtful character study, populated by flawed but interesting individuals. Eddie has a definite abundance of self-confidence, but Bert is quick to point out that he thinks Eddie is basically a loser. What Eddie lacks is \"character\", something that Minnesota Fats has in spades. In fact, the literate script by Sidney Carroll and producer / director Robert Rossen (adapting the Walter Tevis novel) takes a good, hard look at the psychology of both losers and winners. And that's not to leave out the opportunists like Bert who exploit people like Eddie for everything that they're worth.An ultimately sobering film, \"The Hustler\" benefits from wonderful widescreen photography by Oscar-winning Eugene Shuftan, a jazz score by Kenyon Hopkins that is actually sparingly used, superb pool hall atmosphere, and excellent acting right across the board. Myron McCormick plays Eddies' initial partner in his schemes, and Murray Hamilton a rich man who also has a talent for the game (although *he* uses the term billiards). Putting in appearances are other familiar faces such as Michael Constantine, Stefan Gierasch, Clifford A. Pellow, and Vincent Gardenia. The famed prizefighter Jake LaMotta has a brief role as a bartender, and real-life pool legend Willie Mosconi (the technical advisor) is unbilled as a character named Willie. This would be the luminous Lauries' last film for approximately 15 years until she made her comeback with \"Carrie\".This is a genuinely great American film, and it's easy to see why so many hold it in high regard. Newman would return to the role of Eddie 25 years later in \"The Color of Money\", and win his first Oscar in the process.10 out of 10.",

The thing I found that was a little weird at first was how they have these marathon pool sessions and even if you beat somebody safe for 20 straight hours if they come back and win everything in the last five hours that you still lose the game. Can't imagine football or baseball work in the same way but alas it is explained in the movie why it works like that. Really this movie tried to tackle a lot of different very heavy themes and does a good enough job doing it. Competitive pool, gambling addiction, alcohol Addiction, suicide, the obsession that comes with the need to be the best at something. It does a decent enough job tackling these heavy issues with very good performances from the leads so worth a watch one time",

The first time I watched it I liked it, but I didn't quite get it. Then I watched it again, and once more, something seemed off.The movie is very, very slow, which is not necessarily a bad thing in a movie, but in this case it is. I get it that this was intentional, to build the characters correctly, and it succeeds in doing that, but after a while of long, drawn-out scenes in which nothing really happens, I started to lose a little bit of patience. However, this is balanced out by the great acting of Paul Newman as the main character Fast Eddie, and everyone surrounding him is great too, especially Jackie Gleason as Minnesota Fats (I wish we could have seen more of him), but I quickly forgot about the acting and caught myself desperate for some of the scenes to end.All in all, neither the great acting nor the extremely stylish scenes are enough to make this a great movie. If it was more straight to the point, it would have been an almost perfect movie.Still, a must watch, and I understand why so many people love it. I wish I did.",

Like Brando in \"The Godfather\" or Hopkins in \"Silence of the Lambs,\" his screen time is very short but hangs over the entire film. After the first shoot-out, as the story progresses, you know in the back of your mind that he's back at Aames waiting. Newman's performance is one of the greatest, but he's young, still coming into his own and has a few awkward, heavy-handed moments--for example the \"I'm the best you've ever seen\" speech is done awkwardly in a Brooklynesque accent that's just weird. Having BEEN a hustler, Gleason's performance is massively confident, flawless. Iconic performances: Ralph Kramden, Minnesota Fats and Sheriff Beauford T. Justice (Bandit I, only)--this guy was a GREAT actor with the right material. At one point, in the late 50s I think, he was considering playing an old-time ward pol in a John O'Hara script. That would have been something to see and may have put him over the top as a dramatic actor. Recommended: the movie version of \"Requiem for a Heavyweight\" with Gleason as Maish Rennick, another top Gleason/late-noir turn.",

            "content": "I had seen the Martin Scorsese/Tom Cruise sequel The Color of Money, which won Paul Newman his only Oscar, before seeing this original film starring the same character he played, naturally I had to see this film as well. Basically small-time pool player and hustler 'Fast' Eddie Felson (BAFTA winning, and Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Newman) has a lot of talent for both playing the game and playing people, but he is flawed by an attitude of self-destruction. He challenges the legendary pool player Minnesota Fats (The Honeymooners' Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Jackie Gleason) with his bravado to a high stakes match, he does show some good tricks, but they are not enough and he is defeated and heartbroken in the marathon. Broke and without a long-time manager Felson battles to regain confidence and the urge to play the game, and it is only when he hits rock bottom he joins forces with ruthless and cutthroat manager Bert Gordon (Patton's Oscar and Golden Globe nominated George C. Scott). His new manager agrees to take him on the road to learn more techniques and stuff for the game, but Felson realises his soul could be taken as he climbs to the top, and he may also lose his girlfriend Sarah Packard (Carrie's Oscar BAFTA nominated Piper Laurie) in the process. It is a question of whether Felson will play the high stakes game and win to keep his integrity and make some money, or will he let go of this mission and save himself from falling in too deep. Also starring Myron McCormick as Charlie Burns, Murray Hamilton as Findley, Michael Constantine as Big John, Stefan Gierasch as Preacher, boxer Jake LaMotta (the man focused in Raging Bull) as Bartender and Gordon B. Clarke as Cashier. Newman is cool enough that he carries the film vary well, and the supporting cast members do their parts well also, for me the most interesting stuff to watch was the pool games playing out, I can't quite agree with the five stars out of five rating the critics give it, and annoyingly I much prefer the sequel, but this is a watchable classic sports drama. It won the Oscar for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration and Best Cinematography, and it was nominated for Best Director for Robert Rossen, Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium and Best Picture, and it won the BAFTA for Best Film from any Source.

            "content": "Going into The Hustler I was expecting nothing more than a vehicle for a great Paul Newman performance. Coming out of it, I got that performance but I also got a wrenching exploration into addiction and what it takes to be a man. The script by Sidney Carroll and Robert Rossen is structured expertly, opening and closing with big games of pool, but traversing through a sea of despair and character development in between them. The opening game gets everything off to such a rapid start, with this fast and wickedly entertaining face-off between Fast Eddie Felson (Paul Newman) and Minnesota Fats (Jackie Gleason) that lasts over a day long. It plays out for practically the entire first half hour of the film, and that half hour flies by as a pace as swift as the two men moving around the pool table.That game hooked me in quickly, but The Hustler isn't concerned with being a sports movie by any means; it's about taking this character, brash and headstrong, and stripping away everything he's got in order to find out what he's truly made of. It's after the match is over though that the film really sinks it's teeth in and takes off dramatically. Eddie begins a relationship with the lonely Sarah Packard (Piper Laurie) that will change his life drastically and ultimately change who he is. George C. Scott marvelously plays Bert Gordon, the all-knowing man who backs Fats in the beginning, and he tells Felson that in order to win he needs to develop character. Well, that's exactly what he does.I've always loved films where the central character changes immensely from the beginning to the end, while the world around them stays the same, and The Hustler is a shining example of that structure. When we first meet Felson he is cocksure, stubborn and overly confident. By the end he is a completely changed man and Paul Newman portrays him with a brilliance that few actors have ever been able to accomplish. To go through these remarkable changes takes something great and Newman breathes every scene so strongly, trading on his natural charm and charisma to bring down the house when the film makes it's way into it's surprisingly dark and poignant themes.He's not the only member of the cast who shines, all four of the core actors pull off great work here. Piper Laure is devastating as Sarah, a character who we initially think Eddie needs but as more is revealed we discover that it's her that needs him. She's a ball of alcoholic rage and haunting loneliness and when the film ended she was the only who left the most resounding impression on me, despite it being Newman's show all the way. George C. Scott has an incredibly commanding presence, and Jackie Gleason makes enough of an impression in those opening thirty minutes to keep you thinking about him the entire film until he comes back in the final, wickedly intense showdown.The Hustler ended up being something much different than I was expecting, and something much more real and powerful. Paul Newman's revelatory performance took a deeply flawed and human character and tossed him through the ringer, leaving a mighty impression as the lights faded out.",

            "content": "When you are comparing first rate movies and trying to pick the very best of the very best, `The Hustler' must be in the running, and when you make comparisons you should remember Fast Eddie Felson's challenge, `That's right, it's my turn to shoot.  When I miss, then you can shoot.'  And this movie never does miss.  It is one of those cosmic events where everything was in the right place at the right time on the right day.  Casting, acting, direction, camera work, sets, editing, flavor and smell: all perfect.Paul Newman is absolute perfection in the role of Fast Eddie Felson as he shows how ego and naivet\u00e9 can work against each other to first destroy and rebuild character.  When viewed against Jackie Gleason's Minnesota Fats he is almost touchingly vulnerable.  `Pay him.  I can't beat him.' is Fats' exit line.  Just another hard days work for him, the consummate professional.  Eddie has destroyed everything for his one moment at the top, and he knows it, and Newman makes sure that we know it, too.  All of which would be just a little too heavy handed and metaphoric if it weren't for George C Scott's, Bert Gordon.  Bert is the ultimate utilitarian cynic.  He is pulling the strings, or thinks he is.  His only flaw ends up being his inability to truly judge the inner being of someone as elusive as Fast Eddie.My only complaint with this movie is that they should have given `Star Billing' to the poolroom.  It is like no other place on earth.  Not because it is physically unique. It isn't, but it is where the best come.  It is not a mighty arena where great pageants are staged and tremendous throngs cheer the victors.  `This is Ames', Mister.'  This is where you win, not to please the crowd, but just to win.  Winning has a high price for Fast Eddie, far higher than the price Minnesota Fats pays for loosing or Burt Gordon pays for backing him.We know how the movie ends, but we don't know how the story ends, and we wonder what becomes of the characters.  What is most surprising about watching this movie is realizing that we care about the characters in the end.  That is a great compliment to any movie, one of the highest.  This is of course the parable of an art form corrupted into a status symbol and a quest for glory, but don't let that stop you from watching it.  It is also a marvelous evenings entertainment.",

            "content": "Perhaps the film that established the great Paul Newman as one of the leading actors of his generation was The Hustler. Landing his second Oscar nomination, Newman's role as Eddie Felson was memorable for a number of reasons, the most obvious of which was the intensity of his acting, which came across as cool yet charismatic. Newman's natural flair for acting with composure had seen him racked up more than half a dozen Oscar nominations, though his only competitive win came in 1986 for Martin Scorsese's The Color of Money , a sequel of sorts to The Hustler.Directed by Robert Rossen (not to be confused with the French director Robert Bresson), The Hustler is often thought to be his greatest film. While I have not seen many of his works to give an opinion, I feel that it is an excellent film but not a great one. Shot in black-and-white, Rossen's film is \"no more about pool than Raging Bull (1980) is about boxing\" (Berardinelli). It is a character-driven film that pits Eddie not against his opponents but with himself. Drunk and obsessive about winning, Eddie succumbs to his character flaws in his long-drawn match against Minnesota Fats (Jackie Gleason) in the film's early \"action set- piece\".Much of the film after that does not quite reside in pool hustling. Instead Rossen calls to attention Eddie's romantic relationship with Sarah Packard (Piper Laurie). Their romance is not seen as a subplot to the film's main narrative but another lens to look at Eddie's character. With Sarah, Eddie is warm and nice, though there are occasional instances of volatility. But put a cue in his hands and he is a changed man. And for the worst, if I may add. One of the film's supporting characters, a rich cutthroat gambler named Bert Gordon (George C. Scott), calls Eddie a \"born loser\" and one who is without character.It is this quest to find that \"character\" that sets Eddie to build towards it, to prove himself that not only is he the greatest pool player anyone has ever seen, but also one that, win or lose, acknowledges the value of integrity, something he has failed to see for most of his life, and as a consequence in numerous situations, failed him as well. The Hustler, while quite effective as a conventional character study on human behavior and emotions, is less potent when it comes to dealing with the psyche of its lead character. The film does not seem to have the prerequisite grittiness to flesh out Eddie's psychological motivation (or ambiguity).Further, Newman's image as a clean and likable, albeit rebellious dude, coupled with the film's polished cinematography by Eugen Schufftan, who won an Oscar for his work here, suggest that The Hustler is not cut out to be a deep, complex, and raw character study in the mould of Taxi Driver (1976). Here, Rossen takes his film to a level that is enough for us to understand and root for Eddie. He refuses to go further and seeks instead to give us the pleasure of watching Newman and co. strut their stuff on the pool table. Speaking of which, those shots are actually quite exciting to look at.GRADE: B+ (8/10 or 3.5 stars)www.filmnomenon.blogspot.comAll rights reserved.",

            "content": "It was the Science Fiction fraternity along with the domain of the Super Hero Comic Books that advanced the idea of there being \"multiple Worlds\" or \"parallel Universes\" coexisting side by side, albeit in different adjoining dimensions (or something like that). In particular it was largely promoted by, though not conceived by Science Fiction Writer, Comic Book Script Writer and Lawyer, one Gardner F. Fox.It was in the DC comics title, THE FLASH # 123, dated September, 1961, that Mr. Fox's full length story, \"Flash of Two Worlds!\" premiered the Multi-Universe concept that became synonymous with the Super Hero Genre at National Comics, National Periodical Publications or Superman-DC. (Take your pick. They used all 3 names.) In this story, it was discovered that this multi-world set-up was in existence. The \"modern\" Flash (Police Scientist, Barry Allen), accidentally stumbled onto the \"Original\" Flash (Jay Garrick). They shared an adventure which led to future \"crossovers\" of virtually all of DC's characters, both old and new versions. It was a great tool for the writers, for the revival of old characters and not so very bad when it came to the old Ca$h $upply! In a very real way, our World is divided into several sub-worlds of its own; all existing side by side, day after day. Some may call it \"Counter Culture\"; others say \"Sub Culture\" or \"World\", even. But, though visible, these shadow areas are seldom seen by we lucky \"mainstreamers\". This finally brings us down to today's lucky honoree, THE HUSTLER (Rossen Films/20th Century-Fox, 1961).Filmed in a very dark, moody and shadowy Black & White, the film provides a fine canvass for painting such vivid and realistic a story. Adding on top of this about as fine a cast as was available. Beginning with anti-hero king, Paul Newman (\"Fast\" Eddie Felson) and Jackie Gleason (Minnesota Fats), the characterization is neat, crisp and dripping with realism. The other characters were cast with equal acumen. Lonely Lady, and Eddie's main squeeze, Sarah Packard (Miss Piper Laurie) totally made the role hers; crowning it with much worldly, bittersweet \"been there, done that.\" Eddie's partner-manager, Charlie Burns (the highly underrated and versatile Myron McCormick) and sideline kibitzer/promoter Bert Gordon (Patton himself, George C. Scott) add pressures and tensions of their own agendas to the whole mix. Characters like big timer, Big John (Michael Constantine) and Millionaire Thrill Seeking Pool Shooter, Findley (Murray Hamilton) add to the main plot and move things along in interesting subplot scenes. We also are treated to appearances by Vincent Gardenia and Jake La Motta (the real life 'Raging Bull') as bartenders and veteran character Stefan Gierasch as 'the Preacher.' FORWARD\u0085\u0085\u0085.We open, even before any credits have rolled, with Eddie Felson and Charlie Burns stopping by a local saloon, posing as salesmen on their way to Pittsburgh. After a beer or two, they start a little pool-shooting and soon some locals think Eddie to be a potentially easy mark. After a less than spectacular game or two, the suggestion is made to play for some really high stakes. Deal made, game played, Eddie goes all-out winning big and cleans the locals out! (That's what pool hustlers do!) BOOM! Roll the credits! (And the great moody theme, too!) Felson has been out to meet up with one Minnesota Fats, ever since Eddie was a youngster learning the game in San Diego. Then it happens, but Eddie insists on beating the Fat man into an all out, unconditional, \"I quit-type\" of a submission. (\"Uncle, Uncle!!\"). Being next to broke, after having the veteran Fats on the ropes, Eddie plies his trade with some other locals a little down the road, but looses his temper and goes all out to embarrass the lad. He is discovered to be what he is and the locals break his thumbs and take the dough.By this time he has met and concubining Sarah (Piper Laurie, remember?). Soon, Bert Gordon (George C. Scott) talks Eddie into going to Louisville for the Kentucky Derby Week festivities. There, he can cut into the millionaire money of some easy money, while giving his game a little tune-up.It is during this time, that Sarah, whom Eddie now loves so very much, is killed at the hands of (name withheld, see it!). Brokenhearted, Eddie eventually returns to Charlie and goes gunnin' for Minnesota Fats. FURTHER INFO DELETED! (See it, Schultz!) One thing we do learn is that, be it in main stream life or in a shadowy \"Parallel Universe\" of someone like the Pool Shark, the Money is not the important thing. It is merely what money truly is, a medium of exchange. It is the competition and the winning that makes it all worthwhile.And that goes for all literary endeaveurs! NOTE: * Well I did, anyway! You know, being that there was a real Minnesota Fats, wasn't there? We seen 'im on TV!",

A post-WWII America, shown in this particular context as a somewhat bleak scenario, in the gritty underground pool scene where only bitter men reside.\nWe are introduced to more characters worthy of mentioning like Minnesota Fats, the reigning champion and best pool player in town, practically unbeateable, the tragic Sarah (Piper Laurie) who is Eddie's drunken girlfriend.

He leads such an\none dimensional life, revolving around whatever he can get around his hustling schemes, and sometimes spending low quality time with his girlfriend or other associates. We could argue that their lives are heavily miserable; Eddie is a talented loser, he isn't smart enough to use his talents through different means or in more appropriate environments.It is a more than interesting character study, a film to analyze profundly in its entirety, filled with deep, intense and acute social commentary.\nPretty much everyone acting-wise gives their very best, channeling their conflicted emotions of self-destruction by means of sincere and heart-rending portrayals.The Hustler is so much more than just a film about pool.

From the onset we realise that Eddie's world is one of scheming vultures; back room predators all looking to tear the flesh off weakened animals. Director Robert Rossen then launches into a thirty-minute segment in which Fast Eddie wages war with a talented pool player called Minnesota Fats. They lock horns and do battle, after which Eddie eventually emerges defeated. \"You're a loser,\" loan shark Bert Gordon (George C. Scott) growls, an insult which sears Eddie to the core. From here on, Eddie is shown living in the transitory noir spaces of bus stations, bars and seedy hotels. He views himself as a loser, beaten and subjugated, and so begins to live as such. Whatever beauty the game of pool once had, has now been lost to Eddie. Whilst once he waxed poetic about the artistry of the game, the possibilities of the table, he now sees the sport as an ugly form of ego-affirmation. Pool has become a game of one-upmanship in which the goal is to castrate and dominate, victorious warriors wielding cue sticks like phallic symbols.As such, the rest of Rossen's film is filled with cripples, limping women and games of dominance and subservience. We watch as Eddie forges a relationship with a Polio victim (Piper Laurie), a limping woman who escapes the world by making up fantastical stories and drugging herself with alcohol. The world sees her as a loser, and so she engages in games of self-destruction.Eddie won't be dragged down with her, though. He's a beautiful player, an artist, but he wants more. \"You've got to have character,\" the sharks explain to him, \"the killer instinct!\" The real world implications of this are sinister. If a person is talented, one expects them to be a winner. But no. One must also have \"character\", where \"character\" is a euphemism for a kind of phallic dominance; prosperity at another's expense.The film thus gets to the heart of sports and competition and its relationship with masculinity, hierarchy and capitalism. The drive to win, assert one's \"manhood\", and profit are, or can be, corrupting of human relationships and corrupting of whatever aesthetic or spectatorial value sports may have. Eddie learns this at the end of the film, and then gives a speech that has now become a clich\u00e9 in sporting movies: its not about winning, its about playing the game right. It's about community, self-respect and the artistry of the sport. Whilst Freud once saw \"civilisation\" as an repressive force that thwarts base animal urges, transmuting them into psychopathologies, \"The Hustler\" (like modern evolutionary psychology) suggests that a larger threat may be the way civilisation thwarts civility and instead champions \"character\". There is a kinder, gentler side of human nature, and it seems increasingly to be a victim of repression. But while Eddie elevates cynicism to philosophy, berating the film's cast for selling their souls, it is ultimately they who school him. Flexing their muscle they ban him from all future pool halls, a threat which Eddie has no choice but to accept. What he learns is that his wisdom provides him with no moral choice but to give up the game altogether. There are no other options. A line can thus be traced from the \"running away\" heroes of 1950s-70s cinema (\"Cool Hand Luke\", \"Rebel Without a Cause\", \"Hud\", \"They Might be Giants\", \"Some Came Running\", \"A Thousand Clowns\", \"The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner\", \"The Devil Probably\", \"The Passenger\", \"Five Easy Pieces\", \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\", \"Goodbye Columbus\" etc) all the way up to \"Searching For Bobby Fischer's\" young chess prodigy, Joshua Waitzkin. These are all characters who refuse to abide, conform and who question the values ascribed to post war capitalism. Symbols of cinema's disenchanted adolescence, they also all ultimately reject the games being offered.Ultimately, what \"The Hustler's\" bleak ending does is steal the beauty away from mankind's phallic strutting. Much human activity revolves around games of domination, even outright sanitised sadism. Sublimated cruelty then becomes a virtue, a Darwinian-Nietzscean struggle for existence; win or lose, cripple or be crippled. The question a film like \"Bobby Fischer\", the spiritual successor of \"The Hustler\", asks, is how can one play, how can one enjoy the beauty of personal mastery, whilst not compromising the ethical compass.Perhaps it's fitting that behind the scenes of \"The Hustler\" we have a similar struggle. A communist, director Robert Rossen had always been preoccupied with the themes found in \"The Hustler\". See, for example, 1947's \"Body and Soul\". In 1953 he was also called before \"The House Committee on Un-American Activities\" and blackmailed into \"naming names\". Betrayed and forced to sell his soul to the HUAC (and to film studios), Rossen spent the 1950s making largely forgettable films before hitting us with \"The Hustler\" the moment the Hollywood blacklist was cleared. The film was his own form of redemption.Beyond this, \"The Hustler\" is interesting for another reason. In 1961, the old studio system was collapsing and production codes were weakening. \"The Hustler\" thus posses a rare cocktail: a frankness, a sense of \"adultness\", mixed with the restraints of classical film-making. It's at once as gritty as 1970s neorealism, but in possession of a subtlety and classiness which those films often lacked. Powerfully acted across the board - George C. Scott in particular is excellent - the film also boasts exquisite photography by Eugen Schufftan.9/10 \u2013 Masterpiece. Martin Scorsese would make a sequel which mostly misses the point of Rossen's film.",

After this he wants to take his revenge from him in another pool game but when he meets a woman everything change and are getting more complicated.I liked this movie because of the plot which I found it simply magnificent and in some moments I have to say that I could not predict what will happen. Another thing that I liked in this movie was the interpretation of Paul Newman who played as \"Fast\" Eddie Felson and he was really great at his part. I also liked the interpretations of Piper Laurie who played as Sarah Packard and George C. Scott who played as Bert Gordon and I believe his interpretation gave a different view in the whole movie.To sum up I have to say that \"The Hustler\" is a movie which combines very well a sport with drama and makes us understand how passion for win can change everything in a person's life. Also shows us how this passion influences all the relationships of a person has and what he has to do in order to save and protect them. This movie it is really worth seeing and I strongly recommend it.",

The only person who can carry from one movie to the other is Paul Newman, and his \"Hustler\" performance, for which he received an Oscar nomination for Best Actor, is far above the performance in \"Color\" for which he got an Oscar for Best Actor! There simply is no comparison. Rent (or buy) both and see for yourself. No question the first movie had the better acting in it: George C. Scott, Jackie Gleason, Piper Laurie, Murray Hamilton, Myron McCormack, etc. We want to see Eddie redeemed in \"Color\" \u0096 hinting that it might not have yet come for him in spite of what he experienced through the loss of Sarah (Piper Laurie) and the betrayal by Bert (George C. Scott). He seems to have survived in \"Color\" but it is unfortunate he did not allude to anyone who was in the first movie, particularly Sarah. I first saw \"The Hustler\" when it came out in 1961, and now that I own the DVD, I plan to enjoy it many times. It depicted a very small world, but it was a world made up of people like you and I. The ending was classic. In spite of Eddie's defeat of Fats, life seems to go on. Fats goes home, Bert goes back to his chair, the spectators of the game shuffle off into the nothingness from which they came, and Eddie moves out into his new life, but with hope. It is a good movie if you want to come out with a good feeling about the spirit of life itself.",

He had been involved with the Communist Party in the 1930s and at his first HUAC appearance refused to name names, but ultimately changed his mind and testified against friends and colleagues.  \"The Hustler\" is about a man who has talent and passion but sells his soul and betrays the one person who really knows and loves him in a Faustian pact to gain character.  Bert Gordon is explicitly likened to the Devil by Findlay. Eddie emerges chastened and redeemed.  Some of the dialogue is a touch portentous, especially in the love scenes, but it is a wonderfully exhilarating and depressing film that blends elements of period jazzy existentialism, moody religious parable, the qualities of a simply great sports movie and terrific performances from Paul Newman, Jackie Gleason, Piper Laurie, and George C.

The film takes place in the dingy, seedy world of pool, with all its gambling and boozing. It makes for a rather dark film. There is a little bit of fun to be had in the beginning as we're introduced to small-time hustler Fast Eddie Felson. Eddie yearns to be big-time and to do that he's got to beat the best. And Minnesota Fats is the best. We see Eddie and Fats play a thoroughly compelling game of pool. But for the film it's all downhill from there. Things get too dark, too bleak. There is nothing to enjoy. The film tells an interesting story to be sure. But that story is ever so hard to embrace, it's quite a sordid tale. Ultimately The Hustler leaves you with a sinking feeling in your gut. This is a rather unpleasant movie-watching experience.Paul Newman, as Eddie, and Jackie Gleason, as Fats, give fine performances. Newman makes Eddie into a compelling, if thoroughly flawed, hero. Gleason doesn't have much screen time but he makes the most of every moment, having such a great presence about him. Unfortunately the good work of Newman and Gleason is undermined by what surrounds them. The character of Bert Gordon, unscrupulous gambler, drags the film into the muck. George C. Scott plays the role and there's nothing wrong with the performance. Scott makes Bert into what the script calls for him to be. Unfortunately what the script calls for Bert to be is a vile, miserable, reprehensible human being. Hearing Bert, a man who has no character whatsoever, lecture Eddie about his lack of character will have you shaking your head. Bert is so repugnant his presence makes the entire film distasteful.Then there's Sarah, a young alcoholic woman who falls into a relationship with Eddie. Piper Laurie plays this part and, as with Scott, there's nothing to fault about the performance. The character just doesn't work properly, she's not entirely believable. She seems to exist only to teach Eddie life lessons. And Eddie does indeed learn much about himself by the time the film ends. But for the viewer it's been a rather unsatisfying journey. The film is slow, plodding and bleak to the point of being outright depressing. The film started with great promise. You thought that even in those dingy pool halls there might be some bright enjoyment to be had. There was not. This film gives you precious little to enjoy. Newman does the best he can to carry the film but ultimately he, and we, are let down by the story. The Hustler unfolds in a very dark world. Sadly, that darkness overwhelms the film.",

She wouldn't appear in a film again until 1976's \"Carrie,\" for which she would also be nominated for an Oscar (that has to be some sort of obscure record). Standout performances come from Jackie Gleason, breaking his Ralph Cramden persona to play a slick rival pool hustler, and most notably George C. Scott, as Newman's oily manager.Robert Rossen directs in the same gritty, sweaty style he brought to \"All the King's Men,\" a style that works well for the milieu.

            "content": "The Hustler, like most great films, grows in meaning as you grow older. As a boy, I saw the film and thrilled to the picture of America it painted. It was a tough, dangerous place where everyone was out to be a winner and losers were outsiders. Best of all, the Americans spoke in a kind of poetry that made everything they said interesting to a boy from small town Australia. \"You looking for some action?\" \"Big John, do you think this boy is a hustler?\" \"Fat man, you shoot a great game of pool.\" The jazzy score seemed to match the jazzy way Americans spoke.Eddie, the young outsider, was of course my focus when I first saw the film. I was young and the young always feel like they have something to prove. Eddie weakness is that he has something to prove. He must prove that he is the best pool player in the country and the money he might win in the process comes second to him. He is young and he must get the better of the older man. And this is the character flaw that Burt Gordon discerns and exploits.As I have grown older, I empathise much more with Charlie, Eddie's partner, and with \"Fats\" as played by The Great One - Jackie Gleason. These are men who know themselves and their situation in life. \"Fats\" sees the facade he presents to the world and as Eddie asks Burt Gordon, \"Who did you ever love?\", Gleason gives the slightest hint of recognition that his life is as empty as Burt's. Look at how \"Fats\" makes his entrance. He is like an actor getting ready to play a part. The poolroom is where \"Fats\" comes to life as the best in the country. We can only guess at his life outside the pool hall but as he leaves Burt perched upon a stool as the lonesome ordinary people who frequent Aimes go about their own colourless and unfulfilling lives, there is sense of resignation to this ultimately meaningless existence. Action is required for Burt, \"Fats\" and the pool hall cohort to come to life. Once it's over, there is nothing but the wait for the next piece of action.For the aging Charlie the future looms as a frightening prospect. As a child I cast him off in much the same way Eddie did. \"Crawl off and die!\" Myron McCormick's understanding of Charlie's desperate need for financial security shows in every facial expression. In one look he can tell the story of a lifetime spent as a lonely, small-time grifter. Eddie's first game with \"Fats\" is Charie's last chance for a big score if Eddie can only just take the money and run. Charlie is the voice of reason born of experience as opposed to Eddie's youthful recklessness. Financial security means nothing to youth when growing old is so far off in their minds. The present moment was beating \"Fats\" and getting him to acknowledge that he, Eddie Felson, is the best in the country.Eddie learns a hard lesson. To be the best, he must pay a dreadful price. \"Fats\" has paid the price and he wears a hollow crown. Only Gleason could depict how hollow as he sits and considers what Eddie says to Burt about Burt being a loser because he can't love anything and that he has a need to make everything dead around him in order to feel alive.My initial view of Americans as presented in The Hustler has led me to a lifetime of watching films in which American film makers reflect upon what it is to be American.

Scott could not have been better, and they are joined by a fine supporting cast. The atmosphere likewise is excellent, forming a fine complement to the characters and their story.Eddie, Minnesota, and Bert are all quite interesting in themselves, and the three characters also make for some nice comparisons and contrasts with each other. As the young pool star Eddie, Newman very effectively portrays the strengths and weaknesses that come with his great ability and self-confidence. As the old pro Minnesota, Gleason gets fewer opportunities, but he delivers flawlessly. He's a great character, and even though the movie is not really about him, he leaves you wanting to see more of him. The first, lengthy battle between Eddie and Minnesota is one of the fine set pieces of its era in cinema.Scott's character is thoroughly unlikable, but undeniably intriguing, and Scott's distinctive style is perfect for the role. The supporting cast, likewise, features some effective character actors who make the best of their roles.The story slows down considerably in the middle, as Piper Laurie's character comes onto the scene, but the change of pace is important in understanding Eddie and the things that lie ahead for him. Laurie's role is sometimes thankless compared with Newman's, but her character is an important contrast to Bert (Scott) and the way of life that Bert wants to offer Eddie. There are numerous somber yet important moments as everything plays out.Naturally, the most fun parts of the movie are the pool-playing scenes, and they work even better than you could have hoped for. The atmosphere makes you feel as if you were there watching the action, and the musical score is surprisingly helpful in complementing the settings.

Certainly all the performances are spectacular, from Paul Newman's talented but still a loser fast Eddie Felson, the wicked George C Scott playing the heavy (is there anyone who ever had a scarier voice?) and of course the incomparable Jackie Gleason as Minnesota Fats. But to me, the one who always stands out is Piper Laurie as Sarah. She absolutely makes the movie for me, and while she's often included, it still feels like she never gets her true due. She is the absolute heart of this movie and she battles George C Scott's Burt all the way for Eddie's soul. She gets me every time in the bar at the train station when she agrees to go with Fast Eddie back to her apartment and as she takes her first couple of steps, she stumbles a little and says, \"Don't worry, I'm not drunk. I'm lame.\" She is at once so heartbreaking and vulnerable, yet at the same time strong, honest and courageous, that just as it throws Fast Eddie, it always throws me for a loop - I'm with her all the way.As I said, it's a battle for Eddie's soul. She sees right through Eddie, the same as Scott. The difference is that while Scott sees him as a \"loser\" full of glory, Sarah sees Eddie as a winner, as even a brick layer can truly be great if he knows what he's doing. While Scott sees someone he plans to use for as long as he serves his purpose, before he spits him out and moves on to the next, Sarah loves Eddie and only wants the best for him. That doesn't mean she isn't aware of his faults, but she loves him without condition.So the battle lines are set and there's no doubt about Scott's power, offering Eddie fame and money and success. Scott is wicked smart, it's not just Eddie he knows how to play, he pegs Sarah just as easy, she's hanging on by her fingers, she's the lame horse that came in last. Thing is Sarah is just as smart, not just that she knows Scott's game, he's a Roman, but she's just as honest and truthful about herself. He can't hurt her, yet she isn't in a position of strength because he can and will hurt and destroy the thing she does love and care about, Eddie.These are high end stakes and this is the real game that's being played, not pool. Sarah gets it, Burt gets it, it's only Eddie who doesn't figure it out until the end. It's then that he gives Sarah the words she needs to hear so badly, words she won't let him take back, but it's too late. She's already made the ultimate sacrifice to save his soul, and what makes it more spectacular is that it's a leap of faith, she doesn't know if her sacrifice will make any difference because she doesn't even know if Eddie truly loves her. Yet in the end, it's Sarah who wins, she's the true winner because she's the one willing to play the game to the end, she's the one willing to go all the way. Because she's the one who knows the real stakes.",

            "content": "This film basically has three acts. There's part one where Fast Eddie (Paul Newman) arrives, meets pool shark Minnesota Fats (Jackie Gleason) and learns a humbling lesson that practically destroys him, and a second act involving Piper Laurie as the pathetic drunken woman he hooks up with, nearly bringing him down again, finally part three where he encounters George C. Scott as the manager who will represent him, taking a good majority of his winnings. The focus on one man, Paul Newman's Eddie, gives the viewer an insight into his desperation for fame and success as a pool shark, and it's interesting to watch him attempt to rise, fall, then rise again only to realize that he's been continued to fall even with each rise.Not the classics that I was expecting, it's still a good film with excellent performances, also I would certainly say that Laurie plays a supporting character, not the leading lady that she was acknowledged as at the Academy Awards that year. She's a far cry from the Romantic heroine said she had played while under contract at Universal in the 1950's, and I'm sure Academy voters were stunned to see a different side of her. Her character definitely has a lot of meat in her limited screen time, and it is a great part and she makes the most of it.The entire ensemble is excellent, but as supporting actors, Gleason and Scott stand out the most although I think Scott gets the juicier material and thus would have been my choice had they given an award to one of the actors from this film. Lots of great roles for character actors like Vincent Gardenia, recognizable as the bartender in the opening scene, Murray Hamilton and William Duell. The film is better for its characterizations than for its story and script, and Newman does give one of the best performances of the year as one of his best performances ever. Probably not as good as some of director Robert Rossen's 40's classics, just a very good film that is a bit overrated.",

This movie is enjoyable regardless of whether or not you are a pool player. The acting is great and the mysterious music puts you on edge and makes you excited.I would recommend this film to anyone who enjoys classic dramas. The cinematography, dialogue, and plot are all excellent and executed properly. In the scene where they first play pool together, the music starts off slowly at a low tempo and increases in tempo and volume as the game gets closer and closer to finishing.This film has it all- romance, a unique plot, gorgeous costumes, great music and amazing acting. Eddie Felson has the talent. He is an excellent pool player which is proved by how many games he wins. But, talent isn't all that it takes to make it big at pool.

            "content": "This film is absolutely frightening. Pools or billiards seem to be civilized games. But to play them you have to go to special pool rooms and there if you want to play for money you better have your manager. Then you become a hustler and the manager is the pimp. Unprotected you will get your thumbs or your fingers, or your arms, as for that, broken. If protected you better bring in the profit that is expected. But then how can everyone be protected? There must be a loser somewhere to pay for the winners, and then the loser's manager is going to lose money and he will not like that. So they have little arrangements and the loss is shared or the loss is never too much or the loss is that of the stray amateurs of one evening. But when a real good player appears and he wants to win big, he has to have his manager and he has to pay his percentage. But if he is very good he will never understand he must lose from time to time and he will jeopardize the local winner who is the famous chap in these here pool rooms and who knows exactly what to do and who to make lose or win. The young good one who wants to win at any cost and alone will be a danger to the balance of the trade, if not the racket. So he will have to be eliminated. Morally by calling him a loser or by having his own girl friend destroyed in a way or another, it will never succeed. He will even become more aggressive in his winning. Then you have to rig some game to bring him in a corner. He has to be authorized to win much one night in order to bring him either to accepting the authority of his manager and pay his share, or be brutalized into not being able to play again. There are two more solutions but that's the end of the film. Let him go or just plain kill him? In a world that this one a dead body can always be camouflaged. Have a good film. But I find it typical of his time, very early 1960s and it sounds like a sound stage and it is quite slow in rhythm in many ways. But the story is good and the acting is promising especially for Paul Newman. Jackie Gleason on the other side is by far too static to be impressive.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Cr\u00e9teil, CEGID",

The film is about a POOL hustler. All those coloured balls moving around at key moments, and he goes and shoot in black and white!  Not that the camera ever really focuses on the pool table; and, to be sure, the camera's casual attitude to the game itself feels surprisingly apt.  Anyway, it's a bit rich MY complaining.  I didn't do my homework.  I know only vaguely the difference between pool and billiards - although I'm still not sure what constitutes success in the latter - and I wouldn't have a clue how either of them differs from snooker. For all I know pool IS snooker, under another name.  I don't think my ignorance was a problem.  \"The Hustler\" offers a satisfying story told at a satisfying length: two and a quarter hours spent on a simple fable, yet the narrative looks and feels pared to the bone.  It's amazing what some people can draw with a minimum of line.  Take the scene where Eddie meets Sarah for the first time (although I could have chosen almost any scene) - so little is said and yet the lines are perfectly placed just so, giving us a sketch full of detail.  With this kind of perfection it's impossible to know whether to credit the acting, the script, the direction, or all three - not that it matters.",

            "content": "\"The Hustler\" is a frustrating movie to me, I thought it had great unrealized potential. I had high hopes for this iconic movie, but after seeing it finally I am disappointed. I really disliked the first 35 minutes or so and almost gave up on it, but I stuck it out to the end. It was far too long and slow though. I also didn't care for the direction or the black and white filming. The lack of color really hurt this film, I want to see that green felt on the pool table, the variously colored pool balls, the stained glass table lamps, the brown and green beer bottles, the blue chalk, etc. Instead we're given a dull black and white picture evoking the dullness of the characters and script. I also wanted to see more of the actual pool shooting, it was often hard to see the shots.The beginning was nonsense, who plays pool for 30 hours straight while drinking and betting? For a long night sure, but a night and day? Come on. All he had to do was walk away with the money. Obviously, this gets to gambling addiction and pride, but again come on. At this point I still had like 2 hours left in the movie and I thought what could possibly take 2 more hours to exposit while predictably ending up in the same match I just watched?Also for such \"seedy\" settings, there was a conspicuous lack of guns, knives, and hard drugs, but perhaps that is best, to keep it \"clean\", though they did show thumb-breaking and a suicide, so I don't know how \"clean\" it is. A really sad film though, especially the female character, she was just used as a plot device and thrown away after delivering some trenchant lines. But such sadness is endemic in our society even if it is frequently ignored or hidden, and pool halls, bars, and bus stations are the obvious places where such sadness percolates and can be often found amongst the patrons.In summary, a difficult film to rate, perhaps worth watching once for its cultural importance and exploration of the sadder side of life -- of losers trying to be winners and winners who are still losers. 5/10.",

            "content": "The longtime, champion pool player is Minnesota Fats; who has remained unbeaten for fifteen years. But now he faces a serious contender in the young and cocky 'Fast' Eddie Felson. He's conceited, brash and a pretty good pool player. But not good enough to beat Fats, and Eddie is forced to leave humbled but determined. It may sound like a movie about film but The Hustler is more than that. It's really a look at a talented but flawed young man who lives in a sordid world and pool just happens to be his game.\nThe film can be broken down into two tracks. One is about Fast Eddie and Bert and the pool. This was essentially remade into The Color Of Money, only with Newman now in Scott's role and Tom Cruise in the one Newman holds in this film. However, it made two fatal flaws: Eddie Felson isn't Bert Gordon and Tom Cruise's character possesses none of the charm Eddie does. Gordon is another one of the talentless, moraless scumbags this film is full of and, as Eddie ultimately realizes,he isn't and doesn't want to be either. Sarah's death drives Eddie to redefine himself and by the end of the film he's a different man. The cocky youngster from the beginning is now replaced by a more mature and wise man. If you seriously consider it, Martin Scorsese's mess obliterates everything this film stands for.Both Jackie Gleason and Piper Laurie were very impactful in their limited roles, but are still overshadowed by Paul Newman and George C Scott. I might go so far as to say Scott' performance was the best of the film. And while he can light up a scene brighter than a floodlight, it is also in part to the scenes and dialouge. The engagements between him and Newman have much more snap to them than any involving Laurie and certainly those with Gleason. All four of the film's leads were nominated for Academy Awards for their work in this picture, but none managed to take home the trophy. Although Newman would later go on win the only Oscar of his career for his reprisal in The Color Of Money.One of the incredible things about The Hustler is that you don't need to know a thing about pool to enjoy it. Because that's not the core of the film. It's a film about average people failing and hustling.",

            "content": "Produced and directed by Robert Rossen, who co-wrote the screenplay (with Sidney Carroll) which was based on Walter Tevis's novel, this above average drama about pool players, pool halls, and those that frequent them also includes a dysfunctional romantic relationship between two of its lead characters, played by Paul Newman (in the title role) and Piper Laurie. Newman plays a confident \"up and comer\", Eddie Felson, who's come to town to challenge the great Minnesota Fats, played by Jackie Gleason, who hasn't lost to a challenger in 15 years. Eddie's longtime road partner Charlie Burns (Myron McCormick) provides the stake money, but Eddie ignores any offered advice. After the two players get a \"feel\" for each other's games, their match lasts 25 hours, during which both drink plenty of alcohol and Eddie gets up $18,000 on the \"fat man\". However, despite Charlie's pleadings, Eddie refuses to call it a day and proceeds to lose all but a couple of hundred dollars to the old master before passing out. A wily businessman, Bert Gordon (George C. Scott), witnessed the whole affair; Bert's \"business\" involves setting up these kind of gambling situations, for the side betting action, playing the percentages, and winning large sums of money as the result. All this happens within the film's first 30 minutes!Unfortunately, except for a couple of other (much) later sequences, the exciting action drops off as the story ploddingly becomes introspective, delving into Eddie's character (his motivations, etc.), and that of his drunken girlfriend's, Sarah Packard (Laurie), for 100+ more minutes. After his \"fall\", Eddie meets Sarah, pulling her out of her \"funk\" as their relationship begins & becomes \"romantic\" (though she'll later describe it as one of degradation); it continues until Bert is able to pull Eddie out of his (Bert becomes Eddie's new moneyman). Then, eventually, after a private party billiards match, during which it's unclear who's hustling who, and a somewhat absurd denouement to the romance (and more), the anticipated rematch between Eddie and Fats is finally played out.Rossen received the last of his Academy Award nominations: for Best Picture, Director, and Writing (Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium); Eugen Sch\u00fcfftan won his only Oscar (on his only nomination) for his B&W Cinematography and Harry Horner and Gene Callahan (his first) also won for their B&W Art Direction-Set Decoration - both perfectly capturing the seedy atmosphere of pool rooms, where sunlight is unwelcome. Newman and Laurie (her first) received lead actor nominations; Gleason (his only) and Scott (who refused his recognition) were nominated in the Supporting Actor category. Additional, excellent support was provided by Murray Hamilton, Michael Constantine, (raging bull) Jack LaMotta (a cameo, really), and Vincent Gardenia. Real life pool expert Willie Mosconi, who performs at least one of the trick shots as a double, also appears as an uncredited character in the film.",

This movie is a perfect example of how brilliant directing can convey every bit as much the same expressiveness WITHOUT gratuitous sex and violence. In black & white and seemingly with one hand tied behind its back in relation to the lack of taste (for the sake of broader box office appeal) that is often displayed in more contemporary movies -- this movie is bursting with feeling and emotion on a darker level of human existence. It automatically assumes that its audience is adult. So the directing concentrates on artistic subtlety. Which allows the actors to display their talents. Leaving it up to the viewer to color in between the lines using his or her imagination. And for me that's some of the true brilliance in these older movies. A child could watch this movie with no concern. And yet an adult can come away feeling deeply touched and disturbed. IMO, this movie cemented Paul Newman as a box office star. It will stand the test of time. Because as long as humankind exists we will be battling our inherent ills and weaknesses. I think this movie IS a masterpiece.

Everyone seems to be feeling very \"enlightened\" having been shown that talent doesn't accommodate success, & yet the whole world is full of talented people who are forced to palette their mundane lives built on the foundations of moral bankruptcy & economic slavery. The only way people \"Win\" as far as I can see is luck & cheating. It's not like talented people rule countries around the world; it's not as though the top 10 billboard artists know their musical craft. It's about miserable people wanting to inflict more misery on others than they themselves have experienced. This is nothing new. The only difference here is that this sad fact of our corruption fits in to all the clich\u00e9d macho tropes of trite Hollywood media. Sarah - being a \"female\" knows exactly what's going on - easy to seduce. Eddie - being a bloke gets angry when he doesn't get his own way. Bert - being a \"Businessman\" only thinks in terms of money. Fats - is.. guess what! A Fat Man!! And he don't talk much man! Yeah man! Cool man! What a load of cods wallop! There's no subtlety in any of these performances which are dragged on & on & on until it becomes a frustrating chore. It's so very blatant that \"Winning is knowing when to quit\" & that \"No amount of money can buy a girl like Sarah\". The other message here is that people love to hate talented people. But the protagonist for some reason that eludes me is too retarded to grasp this simple philosophy of life. And instead chooses to go on a self-egotistical rampage out of greed, self denial, & fear of running out of booze & sex. ??? You couldn't make this stuff up!! Even the dead drunk irate poleaxe student bum Sarah makes more sense than the rest of these pretend characters at one point! But hey man.. it's Pool man yeh! And pool is cool yeh? So Spoiler alert: The best character in the film, the one you tolerate the film for; the girl Sarah, takes it upon herself to kill herself, but not before sleeping with the creep \"Bert\" who insults her, threatens her, sexually assaults her, & tells her to disappear. Why? Coz it takes the death of a bright young lady (who merely needed love) in order for the douche bag to finally win that darn game of cool pool & take home a small fortune!

The opening is really cool, and the 1st match between Fast Eddie and \"Minisota \"Fatts\" is exciting and heartbreaking at the same time, plus Paul Newman should have won an Oscar for this!.The film is very depressing, but it was very entertaining all the same, and Newman and Piper Lauire had fantastic chemistry together, plus Jackie Gleason and Geroge C. Scott are especially awesome in there supporting roles. Paul Newman's character is extremely arrogant and cocky, but i just couldn't help but love him, and root for him, and the scene where him and his manager Charlie(Myron McCormick) have a fight and break up in Sarah's( Piper Laurie) apartment, is really powerful, plus this movie should have won best picture as well!. The movie itself is almost entirely flawless, and, it's extremely well written and made as well, plus there are plenty of shocking moments as well!. This hasn't dated one bit, as it still holds up incredibly well today, and the Pool games are very intense and exciting to watch, plus, i believe this is one of the best films ever!.

Jackie Gleason is wonderful as Minnesota Fats, while he didn't have much screen time, he still made a big impression on me, i loved him!, i just wish he had more screen time. Piper Laurie is fantastic as Eddie's girlfriend, i really felt sorry for her character, and it was so sad with what happened to her, as she was so likable, and had fantastic chemistry with Newman. George C. Scott is fabulous here, he played the sleaze ball extremely well, and deserved a lot of recognition, for his fabulous performance here, i loved to hate him!. Myron McCormick did what he had to do well as Charlie's manager i liked him. Rest of the cast are great. Overall if you haven't seen Do so immediately you won't regret it!. ***** out of 5",

            "content": "If you are an actor of any sort, first-time actor just starting out or a veteran actor trying to hone in acting skills, look no further than 1961's acting masterpiece, The Hustler. Robert Rossen's feature is a clinic for acting. Paul Newman, Piper Laurie, George C. Scott, and Jackie Gleason all came to play. The characters they play are so realistic, that they can be referred to as touchstones. Even though this film features billiards, do yourself a favor and disregard any notion that this is a sports movie. The film itself doesn't care about the pool table or if any audience member even knows the rules of the sport. Although first conceived as a sports movie, Rossen decided to change the film into a character-driven drama midway through filming....and for the better. He wanted to focus more on a love story and themes such as redemption and the strengthening of character. That is a good thing too because I could care less for the actual sport and most likely I would have been bored to tears if this was an actual sports movie. Fast Eddie Felson (Paul Newman) is a small-time pool hustler who displays an enormous amount of talent, but lacks the attitude to play with the big guys. His bravery causes him to challenge pool legend Minnesota Fats (Jackie Gleason). It was a match with a lot on the line, but Eddie loses in heartbreaking fashion. With this loss, Eddie loses all confidence and hits rock bottom. He decides to team up with Bert Gordon (George C. Scott), the cold and ruthless manager to help him get back into the game. Along the way, he finds love in the form of a drunk Sarah Packard (Piper Laurie), and that is what he may need to find character and redemption. As mentioned before, this is the movie to see if you want to be an actor. The performances are so different, but they work well together collectively as a group. This is Paul Newman's breakthrough role, and he feeds off the other actors very well. Even his boyish, handsome looks contrast to the cold, weathered looks of all the players which allows him to easily challenge people to pool. Jackie Gleason had only a few lines, but it's his presence that makes his character. He is built to be Minnesota Fats with his body language, intense facial expressions, and the way he shoots pool. This was only George C. Scott's third film, but he broke out in an enormous way. He is cruel, vicious, and calculating. He uses Sarah against Eddie multiple times, and he is the one who delivered the order for Eddie's thumbs to be broken, and that was one hard scene to watch. Piper Laurie is the struggling alcoholic who sleeps at a bus station and goes to college twice a week and she is the key that helps Eddie build a positive character based on their love. The four actors here are fantastic together. Also, there are some great supporting turns with Murray Hamilton as the millionaire Findlay, and Myron McCormick as Eddie's first manager, Charlie Burns. The movie and themes have been said to draw parallels with director Robert Rossen's own career. In the 1930's, he was involved with Communist Party. He initially refused to name names during Mccarthy's witch hunt, but he ultimately betrayed his fellow party associates/friends to keep working in Hollywood. The theme of betrayal is also prevalent in this movie. Rossen directed many solid to great movies, but his greatest work may have come with The Hustler thanks to his past. \nOn the technical side of things, this film achieves many things. It was a great idea to film the movie in black-and-white. Eugene Shuftan's amazing cinematography was able to accurately portray the gloominess of the pool halls. Dede Allen's editing is a piece of art. She understands that the audience may not understand pool, so she cut the film as if pool is something we already know. Nominated for 9 Oscars and winning 2 for cinematography and art direction, The Hustler is a very good movie. The movie really works due to the acting and give the director credit for allowing equal screen time to all four of the main actors. The film can move slow at times and pool is not my thing, but I couldn't help but be entranced by the characters. For me, I loved how Eddie's character changed over time. He played two memorable matches with Minnesota Fats. The first one for the game of pool and the second one for the test of character. It doesn't get any better than that! Also keep an eye out for Jake LaMotta as a bartender!My Grade: A-",

            "content": "This is more than a sports movie. It is a movie about the human condition. The movie is crammed with metaphors, all of which add up to one thing: it is easy to become depraved. What starts out as a desire to win causes one to spiral downward into an abyss of moral decay which erodes one's priorities and leads to tragic consequences. Eddie Felson wants to win, but at what price? How much is he willing to hobnob with the sharks, shysters and gangsters who don't care a spit for him? For Eddie is symbol of an economic system that puts winning at any price before everything, and if anyone gets hurt along the way, then too bad for them, until of course it's too late and the damage is done. And Minnesota Fats is a symbol of what Eddie can become if he goes that route. And the pool hall itself is a symbol of a system in which people are being hustled, lured by the promise of a quick win. For Eddie, winning and losing is a matter of life and death, but for everyone else it's business as usual. Nobody seems to care about Eddie, and he becomes so craven that he rejects the only person who actually does care about him, all so he can play a game of pool and win some money and show to the world that he is the greatest - except that nobody cares. And that is the point of the movie. As Eddie leaves, life goes on, as if he was never there. He ruffles the feathers of the powers that be and it's duly noted; there will be other Eddies, and as for Eddie himself, he just another player, and a good one too, who arrives, has his moment of glory, and than disappears, with many others waiting in the wings to take his place.",

            "content": "Paul Newman stars along George C. Scott, Jackie Gleason and the reclusive Piper Laurie as his neurotic girlfriend, who will ultimately prove her mettle by being nominated for no less than three Oscars for three movies, including the mother of a very special girl in Carrie two decades later. Newman is still in his raw, just-becoming-a-star period of his career, having completed The Long Hot Summer, and then Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, and having finally figured out his tumultuous love life, leaving his wife and kids for Joanne Woodward, with whom he would forge a lasting relationship of fifty years. Newman cements his position as one of Hollywood's finest leading men with Hustler, although the script leaves him a little bit short of material. But Hustler is considered a classic, with nary a mediocre performance in the bunch. The cinematography is a bit short on the pool hustling scenes, with the later remake (albeit in color) better succeeding in dramatizing the action and flow of the pool games.For buffs who are watching this slightly darker movie after the Tom Cruise version, The Color of Money, where Newman trades places with George C. Scott to play Cruise's handler, it bears noting that this black and white classic is a bit slower paced, taking the necessary time to build up the characters and their associated pathologies, although younger viewers may find this off-putting, having been fed altogether too much action in the first five minutes of everything cinematic while just ignoring character depth.Consider that The Hustler is a must see, just like Breakfast at Tiffanys or Raging Bull, in that it marks the beginning of a screen acting legend and suggests his future prowess, while providing a gripping storyline along side some really talented actors, and suggesting its rightful place in cinematic black & white classics.",

Gleason and Newman play pool expertly in full shots. You never for a moment remember they are actors.

I mean, everybody basically likes either watching or playing pool, since it's such an easy to understand and accessible, international sport, you don't have to train for constantly or think of any complicated tactics, unless you're being a professional of course. But yet pool just doesn't seem like the most likely or most exciting main element for a movie.But the movie is of course also being more than just that. At first sight it really seemed as if this was going to be the story of a pool hustler, who went straight and was going to make it big time into the sport but by the end I started to realize that this movie really wasn't being about that at all. Everything in the story that seemed like a distracting and slowed things done was in essence what the actual movie was being about. It's just basically a random slice of life, about an ordinary person, who is stuck in a situation and lifestyle, that he just can't change, without hurting those who care about him.But the movie still wouldn't had worked out as good, if it weren't for its fine acting performances. It's a movie with an impressive cast-list, of which Paul Newman, George C. Scott and Jackie Gleason especially impressive, with their superior performances. The movie even stars Jake \"Raging Bull\" LaMotta in it! But it seriously is also really thanks to its excellent dialog that the actors shine so brightly in this movie.It's a movie that impresses all the more once you are starting to pay more attention to its details. It for instance is a really beautiful shot movie, that features some really great set-ups. It's a movie that is really made for a wide screen. Lotss of times the movie is featuring 3 characters in one shot, of which one is sitting/standing in the background, the other on in the front and to the right and the last one on the left and even closer to the camera. All are in perfect focus and everyone is doing their own thing and acting out their own thoughts and feelings. Really no wonder that this movie won an Oscar for its (black & white) cinematography. Perhaps its really being Eugen Sch\u00fcfftan's best work, even though he also did lots of great, mostly, French movies, that were also being very stylish and atmospheric. Next to its cinematography it also won an Oscar for its art direction-set decoration. This is also something I really can agree on. It are especially all of the pool halls that are great looking, even though they aren't any pretty or pleasant places within this movie.An unique and well made gritty dramatic movie, with a superb cast in it.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

However, there are disjointed scenes where Newman and his love interest become part of the story. The love interest scenes get across as flat. The ending with Newman's girlfriend is formulated and stale. The final scene in the pool hall with Newman is too dramatic. Good acting considering the times they worked in. Six out of ten stars.

How can a momentary change in an actor's countenance constitute one of the of the great moments in film? I don't know, but Newman manages it here.He just smiles, he manages one of the most classic 5 mile stares ever, and doesn't even appear to notice the outcome. He KNOWS he made the shot before he even made it. Just that one moment is so brilliant every time I watch the film I play it through about 5 times before I go on.And then there is the great ending as the credits role and everyone vacates the pool room, one by one. Kenyon Hopkins should have won some kind of award for the music he provided for just that one scene.The final sax note and strummed guitar chord when the film stops rolling is like the end of a great symphony. A never to be matched ending to one of the greatest masterpieces ever in the history of American film making.",

            "content": "I recently bought a house where the previous owner left amongst a whole bunch of other old furniture a dilapidated pool table. It was the only item we kept and after upgrading it, it now gets used a lot. Along with it he left a battered old slim paperback book called \"Minnesota Fats Plays Pool\" and even as I appreciate now that the real Fats appropriated the name of Jackie Gleason's character for his own ends, I feel a connection to this movie.I've also been listening lately to podcasts on the fall-out from the Hollywood Blacklist of the late 1940's and 50's and am aware of co-writer and director Robert Rossen's less than stellar role in that particular shark-pool. It might be too easy a read-across to contemporary Hollywood but here he posits Paul Newman's fast-cuing Eddie Felson as an ordinary guy with a particular talent in a sink or swim scenario in the seamy world of high-stakes pool. However for Eddie to survive and thrive, he has to decide the price on his soul and whether it's worth hanging onto. Rossen made his own choice when he named names to the H.U.A.C. and I couldn't help wondering whether this was his shot at personal redemption. The film was successful and was recognised by the Academy but still begs the question if it was worth it for the man behind the camera.Putting the politics on one side, it's undeniably a good movie. Fuelled by a cool, atmospheric jazz soundtrack and fittingly shot in monochrome, Newman is the cue ball on the table trying to call the shots not realising until too late that the real shot-maker is George C Scott's heartless, money-grabbing professional gambler who ends up managing him. Piper Laurie is the eight-ball Eddie finds himself behind. A pretty but lonely lush, living off her estranged daddy's pay-checks, her and Eddie somehow connect through the alcoholic haze as two out-of-control self-haters seeking solace in one another but their stormy relationship (he actually hits her at one point) is doomed from the start and when Scott seeks to exercise a 75% share of her too, the outcome is inevitable.At least by the movie's close Fast Eddie has revenged himself against the Fat man and purged himself of Scott's pernicious control, but in the end what sort of future has he bought himself and is he any better off at the end of the film than at the start?Newman, in one of his favourite roles, occasionally too obviously shows us the Method, but mostly convinces as the self-possessed hustler who learns too late that winners don't always win. Laurie is very good as the shopworn Sara battling her alcoholism and self-esteem in her fight to save Eddie from Scott and indeed himself. Scott also shines as the biggest shark in the pool, the conniving high-roller who wants to control everything and everyone in his orbit. However, you can't always tell which way the balls will fall as he finally learns in the elegiac final scenes.As a pretend pool-player I enjoyed the trick-shot set-ups and both Newman and Jackie Gleason as the inscrutable Fats seem natural and able behind their sticks, while as a film-buff I equally appreciated the gritty depiction of this unglamorous profession and its two-bit players.",

Director Robert Rossen made a film that I think has Paul Newman in one of his absolute best performances. Then Felson takes a break from hustling pool for a while with a girl named Sarah Packard (played by Piper Laurie), then he meets a man named Bert Gordon (played by George C.

I don't need to focus on the obvious talents and already duly noted portrayals of the likes of Newman, G.C. Scott, Gleason, etc. for their signature performances.What I shall focus on (and I'm not the first!) is the stellar performance of Piper Laurie, who ever so gracefully, intelligently and understatedly delved into her role as Newman's woman. Messrs. Rossen and Carroll wrote her a subtle and penetrating script and she delivered with great sensitivity and style. Her character was torn between her desire for a loving relationship and her internal demons of the past and present which mainly included her alcoholism and her father's ambivalence and lack of caring for her. Aware of her thrust-upon situation, she deftly alternates between the somewhat quirky, soft-hearted lover and the world-savvy dame who has seen her share of flops and near misses along the way in her young life. As the film progresses, we see the toll that this lifestyle extracts from her and others engulfed in it and the downward spiral that is always forthcoming, as many are called but very few are chosen.Kudos to all in this timeless classic, with a special shout-out to Kenyon Hopkins & co.

(Though he was renowned as the world's greatest billiards player in his prime, not pocket games.)The characters are so well defined, Gleason, Newman, Piper Laurie. George C. Scott, with Vincent Gardenia and even Jake LaMotta, the Raging Bull, showing up as incidental characters, and all so perfectly cast. Newman occasionally has larger then life moments, where he can sometimes get speechy, especially towards the end, but he's in character, and his moralizing fits a now troubled man who's talking out loud, coming to grips with some very cruel realities about himself and the world.Scott is both Demonic and Prophetic, but amazingly crude and down to earth, almost underground with his savagery. Gleason is the towering elegant impassive imperturbable Buddha of Straight Pool, Piper Laurie is beautiful and tortured, she knows way too much about pain.The black and white does what it's supposed to do. It shifts emphasis to the acting and sharpens and clarifies, makes things \"black and white\", and these things, are in essence deep mysteries of motive, that need all the help mortal techniques can provide to help illustrate them.Very literally, they don't make 'em like this anymore. They CAN'T do it technically, and human beings no longer have the humanity to act this way, digital dehumanization has seen to that. You are witnessing talent and style that have vanished from the planet. You are viewing patent superiority in the art. The movie was above and beyond in 1961 and time has only conferred even greater relative stature upon it. Or maybe you have to have lived 6 or 7 decades yourself to see it this way.So it seems to me anyway, and I am sure to most any viewer, that at the end they will just know they have seen a special movie.",

Perhaps it is because I am too used to modern movies about people with talents, but I found it refreshing how little the movie attempt to explain the activity (here: pool). We see some of the shots they make, but the movie is never about pool itself. It just happens to be the venue used to explore something different: the relationship between a person's talent, his character, and the facade he puts on.The highlight of the movie is probably the performances, combined with some great dialogue. The latter is likely not realistic, but it's gripping, and a delight to listen to. Paul Newman shines in his role as a conflicted winner and/or loser, and Gleason excels in portraying a man that is both capable, proud and talented, but also a subordinate coward.I love how the movie opens. You hardly get any background information about the characters, but are allowed a feel of them seeing Eddie first doing his regular hustling, then attempting to beat a famous rival. Had the rest of the movie been able to be as thrilling as these, the movie would have been one of my all time favorites. Sadly, I think much of the remainder of the movie is notably weaker, especially some of the scenes showing him building a relationship. Many of the scenes are delightful, but some feel excessive, not really taking the story anywhere. The performances are good, and as mentioned there are some really sweet and funny scenes between them. And the relationship between the two is important, and ties into the other themes of the movie.It's a recommended movie, even though it might not feel as relevant today as it once did.",

But \"The Hustler\" is different from it's imitators due to a tragic, ironic edge to its plot. Whilst it's a popular saying that every loser wins, the hero of this film learns the hard way that sometimes when you win, you lose.Fast Eddie Felson (Paul Newman) is a young, arrogant pool shark regularly playing other would-be glory hunters for up to thousands of dollars a game. Eddie's ambition is take on and beat the long-time pool champion Minnesota Fats (Jackie Gleason). But in his first match with Fats, Eddie gets too cocky and his rival gets the better of him. Obsessed with getting a return match, Eddie gets involved with a sleazy manager (George C.Scott) who tries to develop in Eddie the 'character' necessary to defeat Fats. Things are complicated when Eddie falls in love with a lonesome alcoholic Sarah (Piper Lawrie), an affair that eventually leads to tragedy...The film succeeds through a flowing blend of great acting and tight scriptwork. Although the film meanders inconsequentially through it's love story, the performances and memorable dialogue ('Fat man you shoot a great game of pool') ensure an engaged viewer. Pool fans too will enjoy the array of trick shots on display here. Paul Newman was taught by billiards legend Willie Mosconi, while Gleason himself was already a very telented pool player.Paul Newman is on top form as the talented but tortured Eddie, while Piper Lawrie engenders sympathy as his fragile, weak-willed girlfriend. George C.Scott is brilliantly dislikeable as Eddie's scheming manager, while Jackie Gleason plays Minnesota Fats with a quiet subtlety. In his hands the pool king is not really a villain, but just an honest, hardworking professional.Despite it's slow pace at times, this is still an immensely enjoyable, well-acted drama. \"The Hustler\" spawned a sequel over twenty years later with \"The Colour of Money\" (1986).",

            "content": "From the beginning of the film, we can see that Eddie Felson (Paul Newman) is nothing more than a pool hustler without a soul. The setting is a sleazy, darkened pool hall. Eddie's only goal throughout the movie is to conquer Minnesota Fats (Jackie Gleason) - the greatest pool shark in the country. When Eddie loses to Fats in the first showdown, he is broke and ruthlessly dumps his agent, Charlie Burns (Myron McCormick) in the process. He turns to a wealthy promoter, Bert Gorden (George C. Scott), in order to face Fats again. Gorden can see through Eddie as being nothing more than a loser. He retorts, \"Eddie, you're a born loser.\" It is only when Eddie develops a relationship with a tragic figure, Sarah Packard (Piper Laurie) that he finds true love. Sarah is a cripple and an alcoholic. She senses that Eddie has problems too, and warns him to stay away from her. Eddie and Sarah encounter numerous pitfalls, in what Sarah calls, a \"contract of depravity\" between her and Eddie. He has his thumbs broken. Sarah must nurse him back to health. They make love and drink all day long.When Eddie and Sarah are short on money, they must gain momentum by getting help from Bert. They travel to Louisville and Eddie must hustle a millionaire (Murray Hamilton) in a game of billiards for enough money to face Fats. Tragedy erupts along the way between Sarah, Eddie, and Bert. In the end, Eddie returns with enough money to face Fats for a final shootout. By this time, he has found his character and soul, despite the enormous sacrifice made by Sarah and the evil manipulation by Bert.The film is slow at times, especially when it centers around Newman and Laurie, but picks up the pace when Scott and Gleaaon are on the screen. The film was nominated for nine Oscars, including great performances by Newman, Scott, Gleason, and Laurie, and won only for art-set direction and cinematography.Score: 9/10",

Perhaps at the time, this film would have appeared to be somewhat more sophisticated than its contemporary movies, yet the plot hasn't aged well with its unnecessary over-dramatization that seems to detract from the more vital action mystery as to the billiard competition while blasting out the message of relationships as more important. There are even some residual lingering themes that were echoed in The Cutting Edge (1992) with D.B. Sweeny and Moira Kelly about figure ice skating competition in a much softer presentation. The dialogue used in The Hustler seems more staged as a theatrical production than a film and while powerful, it comes across more harsh and bitter than poetically beautiful as a movie. Compare this movie to Paul Newman's more nuanced performance in Cincinnati Kid (1965).",

            "content": "After many weeks of back-listed waiting, I finally received Robert Rossen's classic 1961 \"The Hustler\" on DVD. It was definitely worth the wait. The film is better than I remembered it to be; that is a real rarity. Not only did the \"main\" actors (Paul Newman, Jackie Gleason, Piper Laurie, George C. Scott) put in stellar performances, but none of those playing the \"lesser\" roles fell even remotely short of what should be expected.I really admire Paul Newman's entire career as an actor, and also his truly exalted status as a great citizen who has given back more than anyone can expect. This lead-actor \"Hustler\" role is now universally recognized as the one which propelled him into the top echelon; his successful career was truly launched in 1961.But, for me, Jackie Gleason is _the_ memorable actor in \"The Hustler\". Gleason played this role with quite amazing understatement. His performance was totally foreign to his usual brash, comedic, wise-guy persona, and that takes a _great_ actor. I believe Gleason was never honored enough for it; he did receive Best Supporting Actor nominations, but, as far as I know, never garnered those awards.Gleason was so cool, so smooth... He presented an iconic presence that, I think, completely dominated every scene in which he appeared. From now on, Minnesota Fats will forever be remembered as looking, moving, and talking just like Jackie Gleason. The (estate of) the real Minnesota Fats should be proud.On the larger scale, I think \"The Hustler\" should be considered a film noir classic, although I have never seen any reviewer mention that aspect. But does not \"The Hustler\" possess many film noir characteristics? Cinematically: The blues-jazzy filmscore. The black-and-white medium, with many dark scenes lit by one source only. The lack of exposition, leaving the viewer to squint, think, and wonder about scene meanings...Characters: Dark and flawed (except, perhaps, for Gleason's Minnesota Fats). Every character pulls the wise-guy quips, in more-or-less failed attempts to conceal their real natures. Even the \"hero\" role of Paul Newman is really quite obviously bent, in many respects. Fast Eddie Felson may logically be considered an \"anti-hero\".I admit the usual noir factors of the \"false\" and \"real\" facades are missing, but to me that is minor. There is no mystery here, just true character development in the search for winning... at the game, and in life overall.I am not a film noir expert, by any means; I am just beginning my collection and study. But, currently, I cannot think of any film as late as 1961 which truly belongs to this genre. Many recent films, of course, pay direct homage to the noir ambiance; \"Dark City\" comes immediately to mind. But, if we admit that the true film noir movement is decades dead, then \"The Hustler\" may be one of its last masterpieces.I don't think I am watering down my \"10\" ratings by awarding \"The Hustler\" one also. This is just a perfect, classic film.",

He is convinced that he is the best, and he dreams of proving it by defeating the famous \"Minnesota Fats\" and taking him at least ten thousand dollars (the equivalent of today's hundred thousand). Unfortunately, as with most things in life, talent and skill are not enough, and the difference between winners and losers is largely determined by maturity and character.\"The Hustler\" is, on the one hand, one of the best billiard films. Games were choreographed by fourteen-time world champion Willie Mosconi, who was also in charge of performing the most complex shots. And, on the other hand, this is an excellent character study of a man incapable to snap out and make something of his life until he touches the bottom first. The film deservedly won Best Cinematography, Black-and-White, and Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Black-and-White Oscars, and all the main actors were nominated.

            "content": "The Hustler (1) (1961) -I've never liked how cocky a person gets the moment they have a Pool cue in their hands. They have a strut and an arrogance about everything they do - how they walk, how they look, everything. It's not just the guys in Pool halls either, but friends, boys, girls, regardless, something about that table does things to people and I can't explain it. It's not an occurrence I've found with Snooker players.It's like they're showing off and strutting, while Snooker players look like they're embarrassed to be seen at all and would rather the spectators weren't even there.But it's always bugged me in the halls or bars and I've probably been guilty of it myself, although I can't play for toffee, but that might have been the reason that this film wasn't that exciting or appealing to me. It was still a fairly good film from a production point of view though.Having watched 'The Color Of Money' (1986) first, not realising that it was the sequel to this film, it was difficult not to be constantly expecting a con from any of the characters, which seemed to be all any of them did in the later film and I couldn't tell if Charlie (Myron McCormick), Eddie's friend, was in on it or not. That expectancy may have had me thinking too hard about it everything.Eddie was of course played by Paul Newman and there is no denying that he was a handsome so and so, but as yet I haven't seen a lot of diversity from his characters in the forms of 'Hud' (1963), 'Cool Hand Luke' (1967) and now this one. Credit has to be given however for his skilful delivery of each, despite them being a little bit samey.George C. Scott has never given a bad performance as far as I can tell. I certainly found him very suave and sophisticated in this one and very natural in his role.But with the introduction of Piper Laurie's character Sarah, the film went in a direction that I hadn't expected, certainly not based on what I had known from 'Color Of Money', because it didn't seem to fit with Eddie's character, but I did like the diversion from the sport element of the film.I've never really been a fan of obsessive characters. I can appreciate passion, but taking it so far and getting silly with it or putting pressure on others just frustrates me. I am by no means flawless, which is why I prefer to see films in which people strive for greater things, to give me something to aspire to, but most of these people are too flawed, which grinds my gears.Actually though, most of the bits without the pool were a tad dull, because they were so much slower. If they had been a little bit faster and maybe if they had made the film a touch shorter, I might not have drifted to the games on my phone so often, but ultimately there was something about this one that I liked. It was definitely better than it's sequel in my opinion, with Tom Cruise's passion as annoying as his shouty man that he did throughout the 80's.Not the worst film I've ever seen by a long shot and not even Paul Newman's worst, but those blue eyes, despite it being black and white, could charm anyone.562.31/1000.",

Besides all the excellent acting, this story could be mapped to many situation we encounter in our every day life without really fully realising it.

But after he played the role of Eddie Felson, which got him a nomination, he became one of the most highly acclaimed actors in Hollywood.  So I guess you could say that to Paul Newman, \"The hustler\" represents the same thing \"The graduate\" represents to Dustin Hoffman.  It was his break-through movie and he was really good in it.  \"The hustler\" is also probably the best movie that director Robert Rossen has ever directed. He threw in together the ingredients of a film-noir and of a drama, mixed them together and created a classic.One night, Eddie Felson (Newman) decides to go to a pool-room one night to play the local champ, Minnesota Fats (Jackie Gleason).  He starts off pretty well and that frustrates Fats for he has never lost.  But as the hours pass by, Eddie starts drinking and becomes totally drunk and so Fats starts winning again until Felson is completely broke and must be carried out of the pool-room.Back in his town again, Eddie meets a woman called Sarah Packard (Piper Laurie) at the train station and falls in love with her.  She invites him over to her place and soon after, he moves in with her.  And so Eddie begins to settle down.  Then, one day he meets a man named Bert Gordon (George C. Scott) who tells Eddie that he will help him beat Minnesota Fats but in exchange, he wants 75% of everything Eddie makes hustling.  Eddie tries to negotiate with Bert about the size of the slice he is asking for but Bert is unflexable.  P***ed off, Eddie leaves the bar where he spoke with Bert telling him he doesn't need his help.Eddie goes to another bar and hustles a pool-player until the guy is flat broke.  But the guys in the bar despise hustlers and once Eddie has won and collected his money, the boys take him outside and break his thumbs so he won't be able to play pool again for a while.  When he gets back home, Sarah puts some bandages on his thumbs and he slowly begins healing.  It is then that he notices that his girlfriend has a serious drinking problem and that something has to be done.The rest of the movie is the best part of the whole thing.  Paul Newman, Jackie Gleason, Piper Laurie, and George C. Scott lead a terrific cast. Plus, Robert Rossen's choice of filming the movie in black and white made the movie all the more riveting and gripping.  But it's Jackie Gleason and George C. Scott who steal the show, one playing one of the best pool players ever, the other playing a greedy man who has Eddie beat Fats only for the money.  A true classic.",

            "content": "Calling \"The Hustler\" a sports drama would be a gross mis-categorization. Outside of the film's first hour, you barely even see the action on the table. Director Robert Rossen understands that how \"Fast\" Eddie Felson (Paul Newman) wins or loses matters nothing compared to whether he wins or loses, and what the consequences are for the character.Based on the book by Walter Tevis, Felson is a pool shark who has been traveling all over the country with his partner and \"agent,\" Charlie (Myron McCormick) hustling dopes in pool halls and walking out with a lot of cash. He then decides to go after the legendary Minnesota Fats (Jackie Gleason). After taking Fats for $18,000, he lets his pride (and more notably his alcoholism) get in the way and he loses everything right back.Trying to get up on his feet again, Eddie meets Sarah (Piper Laurie), a fellow alcoholic, and the two are inescapably drawn to each other despite their vices (and knowing nothing about each other). Their relationship is a roller coaster, but they seem dependent on each other for support. Eventually, Eddie sees a way back up with a new backer in Bert Gordon (George C. Scott), but it could come at a price.Newman's charisma practically twinkles in this performance that you can't help but be impressed. Of course the trajectory of the character removes that twinkle very quickly, but not in any way diminishing Newman's work. The character is a classic '30s-'40s character, a man with potential he throws it away all too often to booze and has a quick temper. Fitting then that Rossen filmed in black and white (the reason this film has two instead of zero Oscars). Rossen's character-centric storytelling echoes the best directors of the '30s and '40s as well. You could almost argue it's the last great film of that era rather than a great one of its own, but using \"neo\" would probably be a better fit.Unlike a \"sports drama,\" Rossen's script (written with Sidney Carroll) does an incredible job of only saying what needs to be said. \"The Hustler\" can be a little tough to follow sometimes because it leaves out the more expository dialogue, but the script ends up sharper for it. Scott's Bert is a force in the final leg of the film the way he engages the themes of winning vs. losing and what it means to have character. Newman also impressively navigates the whirlwind of his character to hit on the more thought-provoking notes of the script.Laurie also has some navigating to do as Sarah, also a character who could easily slip into the mold of the '30s-'40s love interest who lets herself get pushed around by her out-of-control beaux. At times she does, but she shows a certain resilience and independence uncommon of female characters, even in the '60s. The added complexity of her own vices and problems is also impressive. She gets some great dialogue too and really takes command of some of the scenes with Eddie and Bert.\"The Hustler\" lacks in suspense, something you wouldn't expect from a drama centered on a gambling man who risks it all, but it makes up for it in character as well as themes and ideas that even contemporary films centered on a sport or game almost never consider taking on.As much as \"The Hustler\" echoes the past, nothing has truly followed in its footsteps since, discounting the sequel, \"The Color of Money.\" It has its own place in film history and cannot be grouped or categorized with many other films both in terms of the era it was released in and in terms of genre. In some ways, that makes it a classic by default.~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit moviemusereviews.com",

He takes perfect opportunities to win and turns them into disasters. Perfectly self destructive behavior of the first order. So, naturally, he hooks up with Piper Laurie's character Sarah, who does nothing but drink all day. However, we quickly learn that Sarah has much more soul and humanity than Eddie could over hope to have.Robert Rossen's writing and direction are first rate. Eugen Sch\u00fcfftan's cinematography features beautiful compositions and great black & white contrast. One of the highlights for me was getting to see the cities, trains and places of that time. Kenyon Hopkins' jazz score provides excellent background for the sleazy goings-on.Given what a great movie this is, it was so disappointing that Martin Scorsese turned Felson and the pool shark story into such a routine, mannered and just plain run-of-the-mill movie like 1986's \"The Color of Money.\" Definitely skip that, but please see \"The Hustler!\"********** (10 out of 10 Stars)",

            "content": "\"The Hustler\" tells the story of the up and coming Eddie Felson (Paul Newman) ultimately beating the long time champion Minnesota Fats (Jacky Gleason). Sounds like a hero epic? Well, it is not. It is more a Faustian story in which Eddie sells his soul not to the devil but to his ruthless manager Bert Gordon (George C. Scott), betraying the only one who really cares for him (his girlfriend Sarah played by Piper Laurie) in the proces.In \"The Hustler\" the story is situated in the world of pool, but more or less the same story is also told in the world of boxing (\"Body and soul\", 1947, also by Robert Rossen) and poker (\"The Cincinnati Kid\", 1965, Norman Jewison). In effect \"The Cincinnati Kid\" was a direct response to the commercial success of \"The Hustler\". In 1986 Martin Scorcese made a remake of \"The Hustler\" (\"The color of money\") in which Paul Newman played the champ and Tom Cruise the challenger. A similar sort of change of roles occured in \"All about Eve\" (1950, Joseph Mankiewicz) in which Anne Baxter played the upcoming actress in the film and 23 years later played the arrived movie star in the musical version.\"The Hustler\" is above all a remarkable movie thanks to the black and white cinematography of Eugen Schufftan, who very accurately portrays the atmosphere in the smoky and somewhat dingy playing rooms. Schufftan was already part if the world of cinema when he shot \"Menschen am Sonntag\" (1930, various directors) and was still going strong at the end of his career with beautiful work in movies like \"Les yeux sans visage\" (1960, Georges Franju) and 'The Hustler\".",

As Eddie leads the game , he gets tipsy and lacks concentration on the game and loses all the money he made in the previous rounds. He's penniless after the game, loses his manager, goes on drinking bouts and falls for a woman. His performance plummets to the lowest ebb and he gets into an agreement with Minnesota Fats' manager, Bert Gordon, who sees great potential in making money from Eddie than an aging Fats. Gordon gets him games, helps him make a fortune, only to take a larger portion of the returns. Gordon tries to take advantage of Eddie's girlfriend and she commits suicide due to embarrassment. Eddie, determined to get himself emancipated from the clutches of Gordon beats Fats in a marathon; beats him over and over again until Fats declares the end of the game. Eddie refuses to pay up his hard-earned money to a bookie but Gordon threatens him and after heated arguments, Gordon orders Eddie not to play another game of pool if he wanted his limbs to be a part of his body and Eddie agrees and keeps the money.If there's someone who could play an inebriated man perfectly in every movie, it has to be Paul Newman. George C.Scott's performance was equally good. The movie was rightly awarded the Best art-direction and cinematography Oscars.",

            "content": "Robert Rossen's \"The Hustler\" is a classic that not only is a great film but an influential piece of our cultural heritage. Paul Newman plays Eddie Felsen, a pool hustler who has his eyes set on a match with Minnesota Fats, the country's best. He meets up with Fats and is up $18000 after playing all night, but wallows in booze and glory until he has lost it all back to Fats. He ends up deserting his manager and sleeping in a bus station, where he meets the love of his life but has trouble realizing it. Most of the story involves Eddie trying to negotiate his relationship while at the same time summoning enough resources and self-respect to go at Fats again.The notion of \"character\" is important in this movie, and I credit the movie with being one of the primary constructors of this value in our society. Eddie is a better pool player than Fats, but he loses because Fats has more staying power, determination, and level- headedness. The notion of a protagonist finding character has become such a common feature of movies (Rocky anyone?) that we forget that the idea, especially in sports movies, first really came to fruition here.But the movie is richer than this--Eddie's pursuit of the whatever- it-is that will help him beat Fats ends up having grave consequences, and we see that the movie is also about the rewards and dangers of passion and obsession. Eddie is passionate about pool and obsessive about winning, and this makes him blind to elements of the story that are very sinister.And the movie is also about love. Eddie is not a sympathetic character--one might even say he is an arrogant, insensitive, immature weasel. And yet Sarah loves him, holding out some hope that he will mature. But the maturity that leads him to victory in pool is not quite the same as that required of him to return her love, and the film helps us see this conflict brilliantly.This richness in themes, along with great technical and acting achievements, make this a film for the ages. We learn all about winning and losing, love, passion, skill, and character. It almost seems like the whole world is in this movie.",

            "content": "A sports movie that focuses on the losing end of the deal, \"The Hustler\" is spearheaded by a fine Paul Newman performance in the title role, a killer pool player who nevertheless is snakebit by his own fatal lack of character.Fast Eddie Felson knows the ins and outs of life with a pool stick, but he's a loser at heart, unable to express his deepest longings and find true fulfillment. The same might be said of the three other main characters who discover their own depth of loser-ness when they come into contact with him: pool-room maestro Minnesota Fats (Jackie Gleason), who wastes his days at the Ames pool hall wearing the target Eddie aims at; the nasty manager Bert Gordon (George C. Scott), resenting the glory of others he lives off of; and dysfunctionally alcoholic Sarah (Piper Laurie), who has the misfortune of seeing Eddie as a ticket to love and a better life.Watching the four actors play off each other is more exciting than the clever shot making and mass\u00e9 action on the table, though it's all riveting stuff. Director Robert Rossen and his co-writer Sidney Carroll plant you in the seedy environs of back-alley pool halls and never let you breathe until it's all over.Rossen also maximizes the potential of his actors. Newman in his opening scenes sells you right away on both his talent and his hunger, but it's not until Gleason shows up some ten minutes in that the film pushes things to another level, the TV funnyman demonstrating awe-inspiring command in a deadly serious role. With him, we know quick that Fast Eddie has bitten off more than he can chew.\"I didn't leave you much,\" Eddie tells Fats after his opening break in their first game.\"You left enough,\" Fats answers, going on to show why.Newman was the best in his business when he had a solid script and good supporting actors to play off of. In the latter department, it's hard to imagine better than he gets here. Sure, Gleason is terrific, but even better are the other two. Scott is a grade-A SOB, full of himself in that inimitable Scott way, yet there is the mildest hint of discomfort around the edges, a sense of incompleteness that shows he is a loser, too.Laurie should be the weak link in this movie. I've read others here decry her method acting and sharpness of tone as negatives. But she reminds me of the journeyman pitcher who saves his best game for the World Series. Laurie was not a screen beauty, but she is quite striking here in the way she forms an empathetic center to the proceedings. You need her to reflect the hurt the others shrug off, and in her soulful eyes and quivering chin she makes you feel it to the bone without sacrificing subtlety or believability.What is the weak link? I don't think the film needed to be two hours, 15 minutes long, though I can't second guess any but two or three minutes of Dede Allen's cuts. Also, there are key scenes, one a final confrontation between Newman and Scott, the other between Newman and Laurie in a basement billiards room some minutes before, where the characters spell out what's going on in ways that feel too staged.Rossen may err on the side of telling too much rather than too little, but at least on a first viewing, you kind of want the additional information. I think that's where \"The Hustler\" scores best: It hits hard on a first viewing, like any good sports movie should.\"The Hustler\" is everything a sports movie should be, with some poignant observations on the human condition - when it doesn't lean on them so hard. Most of all, it stands up to repeat viewings as a chance to watch remarkable screen actors practice their craft at its highest pitch. Not much different from the Ames pool hall that way.",

Dialogue is either taut (George C. Scott is great), as in Bert Gordon's very few but essential exchanges with Sarah; or, poignantly penetrating, as when Eddie opens himself about pool(wonderful expression of the supreme joy and satisfaction of anyone who really loves what he does and is a master of his craft - whatever that may be) and Sarah quietly says what we all think: 'you're not a loser'. In the circumstances, her words 'I love you, Eddie' acquire a resonance and depth hardly every acquired by other pathetic speakers of that deathless line. There is the counterpoint with Bert Gordon who is 'dead inside': a hint at one of the sides to the nature of evil. The 'good' ending is not the all-too-often Hollywood syrup, and to call it the triumph of positive values over empty vice would be so simplistic as to be laughable. You do not have to be a pool/billiards/snooker player at all to enjoy this aspect of the film: the focus is not on the table; the seediness of the place and players are part of a social comment which is so light yet so penetrating - the external furniture of the souls of those concerned, especially Eddie's, naturally. One thousand words are not enough to analyse this film (what about Sarah's character and the acting of Piper Laurie, for example?). It is a masterpiece.",

            "content": "Character is the word Bert Gordon, businessman and gambler played by George C. Scott, uses to sum up why he thinks pool hustler Eddy Felson (Paul Newman) is a loser. He explains that although skillful, Eddy doesn't have the character to win, and has ready-made excuses for losing rather than face the flaws within himself.It is the theme that runs through this powerful film; the game of pool tests Eddy's character but so does his relationships with the people around him, and Eddy is found wanting. He has little loyalty to others and not much for himself; his one desire is to be the best pool player in the country. Although there are a number of pool games in the film, the one that stays in the memory is the first game against reigning champion, Minnesota Fats, with Jackie Gleason's portrayal just about stealing the movie. Filmed in a famous New York pool hall, Rossen takes us into a world that is almost separate from the life of the city around it. The duel with Minnesota Fats goes for nearly two days, and draws an audience of gamblers and pool devotees. Throughout the game, Eddy is strutting and voluble. He announces his thoughts almost as though they were Shakespearean soliloquies. He is so driven that it is a performance that rivals \"Hamlet\" for intensity. Paul Newman's performance goes close to being too much but it fits perfectly within the heightened atmosphere that Rossen has created. By contrast, Minnesota Fats is a model of restraint. He stays cool and goes about his game in a business-like manner. Both men drink but Minnesota Fats handles it better. He also refreshes himself from time to time while Eddy looks disheveled and beaten \u2013 the result is inevitable.Eddy meets Sarah Packard, played by Piper Laurie, who gives such a heart-felt performance that it is almost too painful to watch. But Eddy still has a difficult journey to make and it is not until tragedy takes him to his lowest point that he shows the character that Bert Gordon said he would never have.\"The Hustler\" is one of the best movies from a period, which I think was the most fertile for dramatic film in the history of cinema, the 10 years between 1955-1965. At the time, we took it for granted that those films would be challenging, passionate, thought provoking, and possibly even disturbing. Every era of cinema produces great movies but there just seemed to be so many good ones in the field of drama right then.Society was changing and so were films. Talented writers and directors were emerging who had cut their teeth on live television drama. Novels were adapted with subjects that challenged the established order. Plays by people such as William Inge, Tennessee Williams and Arthur Miller were translated from stage to screen. Hollywood was also heavily influenced by ideas coming from Europe \u2013 Italian Neorealism with the emphasis on real locations, the French New Wave, and a group of powerful dramas from Britain. Independent production was replacing the old studio system. And to see the impact Marlon Brando and 'The Method' was having on drama, look no further than Paul Newman's performance in \"The Hustler\".But there were other forces. The McCarthy era had either exiled or embittered a large group of writers and directors, a number of whom started to re-emerge towards the end of the fifties and early sixties; their screenplays and films expressing some of the pain they had endured.The other strong force was the Motion Picture Production Code. Despite the fact that filmmakers railed against it, the parameters it set actually made them more resourceful \u2013 what couldn't be shown could be alluded to with symbolism and metaphor. These factors no longer exist but they did have an affect on Robert Rossen back then. Much of what happens in \"The Hustler\" was allegory for the ills he felt ailed society, and the meaning of real character permeates the film.Although there is a lot more to the movie, \"The Hustler\", and especially Minnesota Fats have become synonymous with the game of pool. \"The Hustler\" deserves all the praise it has received over the decades, it is a film that rewards any number of viewings.",

But Eddie has an Achilles heel which is his own arrogance, it's not enough for him to win he must force his opponent to acknowledge his superiority. The movie follows \"Fast\" Eddie on the road with his partner setting-up a long line of suckers to lose their bankroll on pool games with him. Eddie's dream is to to play and defeat the master of the game the legendary billiards champion Minnesota Fats, played by Jackie Gleason in a magnificent scene-stealing bravura Oscar nominated performance. Felson falls in love with Sarah, played by Piper Laurie in a superlative performance, she is a alcoholic would-be writer and sometime prostitute, and falls under the spell of the nefarious Bert Gordon, marvelously played by George C. Scott in a compelling turn, who is a successful and ruthless gambler that takes Eddie under his wing and teaches him how to play for the big-time money. However when Sarah joins Eddie and Bert on a trip to Louisville for a high-stakes match with a dandy named Findlay, nicely played by Murray Hamilton, the consequences prove tragic. Rossen direction is absolutely flawless, and there are some wonderful cameos from pool champ Willie Mosconi and boxer Jake LaMotta that add to the atmosphere of Harry Horner's grubby production design and Eugen Sch\u00fcfftan's extraordinary black & white camerawork.

            "content": "The Hustler isn't just one of, if not the single, greatest sports movies of all-time. It's just one of the great films ever made. Everything about this film is almost pitch perfect, from it's cinematography, it's tone, the direction, writing, acting, music, etc. Robert Rossen has made a certified classic and a movie that is must-watch for any cinephile at least once a year.The best part of this film, by far, are the performances. In a film that uses limited sets and usually filmed in dark and closed pool halls, it's up to the actors to be at the top of their game, and the main quartet are certainly that. Paul Newman give a career best performance as \"Fast\" Eddie Felson, making the brash and headstrong pool shark a sympathetic character who goes through the entire gamut of emotions by the end of the film and has you questioning whether the end justifies the means.Piper Laurie as well, as Newman's counterpart and the one who quietly shapes everything about Eddie, is phenomenal as the equally flawed but equally sympathetic Sarah. She actually ends up with the most heart-wrenching and most important moments in the film, with her tender care for Eddie as he recovers from his injuries and her desperation and end thanks to a sleazy manager really hits hard.Of course, you have to focus as well on possibly the most underrated antagonist in film over the past 75 years in George C. Scott's Bert Gordon. There is nothing redeeming about Bert Gordon, nothing that makes a view think that maybe he's right in the end. He's greedy, slimy, manipulative, and only out for his own pocketbook. That point is never more clear than the sequence with Findlay (Murray Hamilton) in which he is able to anger Eddie enough to come back and win a substantial of money and then accosts Sarah and causes her demise. The slow diatribe that Eddie goes on throughout the climactic pool sequence going after Bert is cathartic not just for Eddie but the viewers as well. It's a well-written villain and Scott is perfectly sleazy for the role. If it wasn't for Patton, I'd say it was his best work.Finally with casting, we get to the mere presence that is Jackie Gleason. He's barely in the film, bookending the feature, but whenever he's on screen you can't look away. The big man dominates his screentime and is believable as the legendary shark Minnesota Fats. When he say \"pay up\" after being thoroughly defeated by Eddie, you feel for him, almost like he was just a slight speedbump for Eddie to drive over and get to his real target at this point, Bert.Technically, it's incredibly vivid to watch and the way the cinematographer and Robert Rossen use lighting and shade is immaculate. The closeups of Newman alone in the pool halls are worth the watch, but the standout sequence is the final scene of Sarah. You see her broken and at her end through a mirror. Scrawling \"Perverted, Twisted, Crippled\" in lipstick shows how dark the path Bert has led Eddie on and the next shot of Eddie discovering her and Bert claiming ignorance is profound.In the end, the Hustler is an incredible film experience and one that we can all learn form about the mentality of winning and whether we would take the steps to get to the point that we think we desire to reach. In the end, Paul Newman and \"Fast\" Eddie Felson is all of us. What good is reaching the mountaintop if all we did is lose ourselves and everything we love in the process?",

As the film opens, Fast Eddie Felson and his sidekick Charlie are on the road, hustling small town, poolroom suckers all the way from Oakland to somewhere near Pittsburgh on their way to New York City. Eddie's goal is to play and beat the great Minnesota Fats at straight pool--call the ball number and call the pocket, first to 125 wins. Eddie carries his leather cased cue like a gunfighter and this showdown is to take place at the Ames Pool Hall. Paul Newman said once, \"Ames in New York was on 47th Street on the second floor, just off Broadway.\" It's a dark place, an arena, a semi-lit coliseum where men play games for money. But, for Eddie, this game is more than just another hustle for money. He's come to claim the title of the best, number one, the champion and the only person standing in his way is Minnesota Fats.Bert Gordon is the local money betting boss. Bert's a gambler. He's also a power broker for those who want to play games for high stakes. Gordon is a businessman, part finance capitalist, part lord. He's a cunning dude, made powerful by the usual exploitation of finance capital and usurers in general, percentage loans. He's also keenly aware of the character weaknesses of his bondsmen.When Eddie plays Fats that first time, we see that he is a better pool player. Neither Eddie nor Minnesota are mere cheap hustlers taking the money of fools who bet their money on their skills versus theirs, but that is the way they make their livings. No, Fast Eddie and Minnesota Fats are artists. They love the game they play and they play the game they love and they're the best at what they do.Bert uses people to make money and to make himself feel powerful. The lower you are, the higher Gordon is. Ever conscious of his place at the top of the heap, Bert is there to see Minnesota eventually turn the tide on Eddie. Fats maintains his cool. Hubris comes before Eddie's long fall from a winning peak of $18,000 back to his $200 stake. Gordon sees this weakness in Eddie and declares Felson a loser, even as Eddie has reached his peak in winnings. Bert's money backs Fats and the game goes on way longer than its initial 26 hours.\"What beat me?\" Eddie asks Gordon. \"Character,\" Bert replies.Eddie is spooked by Gordon's \"loser\" tag. He abandons Charlie, his long time partner and goes off to lick his psychological wounds. Charlie has disappointed Eddie with his all too human focus on saving enough money for his old age. Charlie doesn't doesn't understand Eddie's need to practice his art as his motivating factor in life--that motive stands above the security of money.That's when Eddie meets Sarah. Sarah has been into a heavy bout of self-destruction. She doesn't want to live in a world where her humanity is treated as an object for sale. In her own way, Sarah has become a loser, hiding her failure to find a loving relationship in endless bottles of scotch. After the two meet, they retreat to Sarah's apartment for what appears to become a last tango in New York. At first though, Sarah rejects Eddie. \"You're too hungry,\" she says to him after their first lustful kiss. But she realizes as Eddie does later, \"25% of something big is better than a 100% of nothing.\" She takes a chance that Eddie and she might find love.Sarah turns out to be right with her gamble. She falls for Eddie because she sees that Eddie is a lover, a man who is passionate about his art and about life. She sees what Bert's inherent sadism is as well. It's Gordon who feels weak and characterless in the face of passion filled men like Eddie and to women in love, like herself. She sees that behind Bert's mask, he sees people as mere things to be manipulated for his own accumulation of power. At a crucial point in the lovers' dialogues, which take place between Eddie and herself, she asks Eddie why he thinks Bert is right about him being a loser. The implied question is what makes Gordon a winner. \"He owns things,\" Eddie says about Bert, explaining why Felson and others think Gordon is a winner. Sarah replies, \"Is that what makes him a winner?\" What is a winner? Someone who possesses the colour of money? Where does Bert's power come from? \"He owns things.\" That's Eddie's answer. But after Sarah hears Eddie's rapturous description of pool as art, she says, \"You're not a loser Eddie. You're a winner. I love you Eddie.\" At that moment, Eddie begins to understand what it's all about--his character is enriched by love freely given. He only begins at that point though. He only begins.....the play's the thing and at the end of his game with Minnesota Fats there is a felt mutual recognition and respect in the air. At the same time, the relation of lordship and bondage is broken on Eddie's newly found character, integrity, courage and solidarity. All this personal strength and solidarity has been brought to the fore by love.Willie Mosconi, the best pool player ever, advised Gleason (Fats) and Felson (Newman) on pool playing and he plays a bit part in \"The Hustler\", as does one former Raging Bull, Jake LaMotta.See this movie.",

            "content": "The Hustler's \"Fast\" Eddie Felson, Paul Newman created a classic antihero, charismatic but fundamentally flawed, and nobody's role model. A pool player from Oakland, CA, as good as anyone who ever picked up a cue, Eddie has an Achilles' heel: arrogance. It's not enough for him to win: he must force his opponent to acknowledge his superiority. The movie follows Eddie from his match against billiards champ Minnesota Fats (Jackie Gleason) as he falls in love with Sarah (Piper Laurie), an\u00a0alcoholic would-be writer and sometime prostitute, and falls under the spell of Bert Gordon (George C. Scott), a successful gambler who offers to take Eddie under his wing and teach him how to play in the big time. However, when Sarah joins Eddie and Bert on a trip to Louisville for a high-stakes match with a dandy named Findlay (Murray Hamilton), the consequences prove tragic. Along with a classic performance by Newman, The Hustler also features turns by Scott, Laurie, and Gleason, in a rare dramatic role. Cameos from pool champ Willie Mosconi and boxer Jake LaMotta add to the atmosphere of Harry Horner's grubby production design and Eugen Sch\u00fcfftan's camera-work. Director Robert Rossen, who had been working in films since 1937, was to direct only one more film, Lilith (1964), before his death in 1966. In 1986, Newman returned to the role of \"Fast\" Eddie in Martin Scorsese's The Color of Money, for which he finally earned an Academy Award as Best Actor. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi. The director of these talents great acting. The images captured influence can be seen in more modern films",

            "content": "With the title \"The Hustler,\" we expect a character study of Paul Newman's pool hustler Eddie Felson. But it is also a character study of Sara (Piper Laurie); of Bert (George C. Scott); and of Minnesota Fats (Jackie Gleason). Of the four, Sara is the most profound. The first step comes after Eddie has lost to Fats. Eddie has great talent, but Bert tells him that Fats has more character -- and character is vital. It is interesting that Bert, a brutal, greedy, immoral man, has this insight into human nature -- in movies the greedy men usually aren't the ones who recognize such things. But Bert doesn't see that buried inside, Eddie has character that just needs to be awakened. Then Eddie meets Sara (Piper Laurie). He talks about the beauty of the game, and the quality of talent -- it is clear that he loves and respects excellence, and loves and respects the game, the way an artist does. Sara sees that Eddie is not just a hustler -- not just a man who uses his talent to take money from others. In fact deep down he isn't really a hustler, he is a man who hustles in order to get the money to keep on doing his art, to try to be the best at his art. At no time in the movie does Eddie show any interest in extravagances -- he doesn't even really mind living out of a bus station locker. In this, \"The Hustler\" is similar to another of my favorite films, \"Babette's Feast.\" Both movies focus on a very talented person seeking the opportunity to do his or her very best.Sara is a very sad woman. She has a limp, which she explains as the result of a car crash, and says her source of money (she doesn't work) is regular payments from an ex-lover. But eventually she reveals that her limp came from childhood polio, and her payments come from her father (who, contrary to another commenter, isn't dead) who abandoned her and her mother. Her father's rejection of her, and her polio-withered leg, have meant that from an early age she has felt unattractive to men, a feeling that has only been reinforced by a succession of men she mentions who always end up leaving her. She sees Eddie as her last chance. She loves him for the character she sees in him, and sets out to awaken it. But Eddie, needing a financial backer to get another shot at Fats, partners with Bert, who says they'll have to go on the road. When Eddie tells Sara over dinner at a fine restaurant, she sees that he is going to slip away from her like all the other men have; but Eddie doesn't want to lose her, so he decides that she should come with him and Bert. Bert and Sara, meeting, instantly sense that they are in a battle over Eddie: Bert, who wants to control Eddie, and Sara, who wants to free him to focus on the art and talent he has. Sara exposes Bert as a man who is so jealous of people with real talent -- talent Bert hasn't got -- that he wants to exploit and destroy those who do have the talent. This reveals the source of Bert's twisted character: bitterness over the talent he wishes he had, but does not. Ultimately, Sara decides to sacrifice herself in order to expose, for Eddie, the evil that is at the heart of Bert's character, and thus free Eddie from Bert and trigger Eddie's true character to grow. At the cost of her own life, she succeeds. I doubt whether Eddie was really so significant a person to justify Sara sacrificing herself; she was the more insightful, altruistic, loving person. But she devalued herself, due to the careless and selfish treatment of her by other men, including Eddie; she never had anyone come into her life to tell her they recognized these good things in her. Her sacrifice causes Eddie to realize these things about her, and the tragedy is that it is too late to tell her he sees. With this sacrifice, Eddie's character finally develops into what it can and should be. He goes back to Fats's regular pool hall, challenges him, and quickly beats him. But Bert is there, and Bert demands a cut of Eddie's winnings. Eddie refuses, and Bert signals that some of the other men in the pool hall will beat him up if Eddie doesn't pay. And here is where we learn something about Fats. Fats just sits in his usual spot when Bert delivers this threat, and he advises Eddie that he'd better pay. And now we know that Fats is a man who surrendered to Bert. Fats's regular pool hall is controlled by Bert, some of the men in it are enforcers in Bert's employ, and Fats is the talent who attracts people to the hall. That's why Fats shows up every night at 8 PM, regularly. It's part of the arrangement he has fallen into with Bert. Bert is hoping that Eddie will take Fats' place, and keep the business going for another decade or two. And it is to help Eddie escape this kind of fate that Sara sacrificed herself. Eddie faces down Bert, and leaves. He and Fats acknowledge each other's talent as Eddie leaves. Sara's sacrifice has been successful. Eddie will be his own man, not a tool of a greedy soulless man like Bert. And this is why \"The Hustler\" is really about Piper Laurie's Sara: a good woman dealt an unfair hand by life, trying to do some good in the world by causing a man to become a better man -- and she succeeds.",

            "content": "Many people possess a talent but don't necessarily make it to the top. \"The Hustler\" is about a pool shark who, having realised that he falls into this category, enters into a Faustian pact in order to give himself the best possible chance of achieving his ambition to be recognised as the best pool player in the United States. As with all such deals, he soon discovers that any success he achieves comes at a very high price.Fast Eddie Felson (Paul Newman) is the arrogant, young pool player who, under the guidance of his long-term partner and mentor, Charlie Burns (Myron McCormick), travels across country from Oakland, California to New York to challenge the country's undefeated champion and prove his own superiority. Eddie is very successful at ripping off the unsuspecting locals that he cons into playing him at the various pool halls and bars that he stops off at during his journey but is also aware that playing Minnesota Fats (Jackie Gleason) at the Ames pool hall in New York will present a far greater challenge.When Eddie meets Fats, their encounter soon develops into a marathon in which, after some initial losses, Eddie finds himself $18,000 ahead. At one point, Fats arranges for his manager Bert Gordon (George C Scott) to attend and Bert quickly sums Eddie up as a loser. This opinion is vindicated when Eddie becomes the architect of his own defeat and completes the match totally exhausted and almost broke. Following this, Eddie ends his partnership with Charlie and spends the night at a local bus station where he meets Sarah Packard (Piper Laurie). She's a depressed alcoholic with a pronounced limp and a chequered past but recognises in Eddie, someone who's just as lonely and desperate as she is and they soon begin an affair which develops into a loving relationship.Eddie goes back to small-time hustling but one night, after humiliating an opponent by showing off, ends up with both his thumbs broken by a group of thugs who take exception to his behaviour. This convinces him that his only chance of getting back on his feet and ultimately being able to make another, more successful challenge against Minnesota Fats, is to take up Bert Gordon's offer to manage him. What Eddie doesn't realise is just how costly his deal with Bert will turn out to be.Based on Walter Tevis' 1959 novel, this well-written cinema classic features strong characters who are brought to life brilliantly in a whole series of exceptional acting performances, four of which (Paul Newman, Piper Laurie, George C Scott & Jackie Gleason) deservedly received Oscar nominations. Fast Eddie's development from an immature, swaggering raw talent to a player with the necessary character and good judgement to be a winner is fascinating and sometimes painful to watch and although his journey is never much fun, it's certainly memorable, full of incident and makes some interesting points that are just as valid today as they were at the time when this movie was made.",

This film goes around the life of a skillful man, Eddie (Paul Newman), in billiards but with many personal shortcomings, including a highly chaotic way of life without any sustainable economic position. The interaction of Eddie with Sarah (Piper Laurie), who becomes his woman, and with his rivals in billiards and sponsor is coherently shown; including the contradictions arose from these relationships.Behind the game of billiards a mafia-like people seems to be involved. The sponsor of all good players, Bert Gordon (George C. Scott), is an unscrupulous man able to exploit any man of the world just for his own interest. Eddie became a real man after so many discussions with Sarah, who was able to understand the malicious and tricky nature of Gordon. Eddie started to understand life after lessons received from his woman and also from Gordon's behavior. The end of the film has a good morale, useful to young people.The performance of all these actors/actress in addition to Jackie Gleason, who acted as the champion Minnesota Fats, was simply excellent. The film certainly deserves to be among the best 250 in the cinema's history, so our congratulations to its director, Robert Rossen.",

            "content": "\"The Hustler\" is steeped in the seedy atmosphere of smoke-filled pool halls in the ugly urban hinterland of America. The Ames Billiard Hall is funereal in feel. When 'Fast Eddie' Felson walks in with Charlie, his manager, Charlie remarks, \"These tables are the slabs they lay the stiffs on.\" The film is about the talented men who perform, but equally about the talentless predators who exploit them. The habitues of the pool hall cling to the shadows. They wince when a blind is opened and sunlight gets in. A new hustler enters, and these vultures gather silently on the margins.Eddie is the youngster hungry for glory. He and Charlie pose as salesmen and Eddie feigns drunkenness, hooking the punters by repeating an almost-impossible shot. For all the slickness of the con, Eddie is impatient for bigger things. He wants to challenge Minnesota Fats, the best hustler in the land.Newman gets his name above the title, but this is a film with four exquisite pieces of acting. Jackie Gleason as Minnesota, Piper Laurie as Sarah and George C Scott, playing Bert Gordon, turn in wonderful performances.Eddie matures as the story progresses. He starts as a cheap chiseller, hustling ten bucks, but ambition carries him to Louisville and the world of the high rollers. Sarah's love opens emotional dimensions in him which he previously lacked. Bert Gordon confronts him with his own spiritual inadequacies, forcing him to understand himself. Eddie is jejune in the first game against the Fat Man, but by the second meeting he is emotionally strong, and completely his own man. He has made the spiritual journey from the whining \"everybody wants a piece of me\" to the inner knowledge that Sarah bequeathed him - that only those who give can truly live.Bert Gordon, with his dark glasses and hawkish features, is a creature of the night. Loving the 'action' of a clash of talents, but lacking any talent of his own, Gordon is the predator on the sidelines. Hearing of the new hustler's presence, Gordon arrives soundlessly and sits watching intently for hours. His dark genius sees the weakness in every soul. In the bar, when he and Eddie talk business, Gordon is foreshortened to look tiny alongside the talented youngster. For all his money and sharp wits, Gordon will never be more than a parasite living off the ability of others. Finally, Eddie and Fats walk into the sunlight, heroes who have proved themselves. Gordon remains perched on his gloomy barstool, a prisoner in his own dark kingdom.If Sarah is the vulnerable, physically-disabled woman who relies on drink too heavily, the victim of the men she encounters, she is also the heart of the movie. She destroys Gordon's certainty and she shows Eddie the meaning of love. Her tragedy is Eddie's salvation. She and Eddie find each other in a deserted bus station in the dead hours. They are both lost souls, Citizens of Hell. She is the deformed girl with the empty life, and he is the emotional cripple with no resources of education or character to sustain him. They cling to each other as if shipwrecked. When the seduction comes, Sarah hesitates. She knows this will lead to suffering. \"Why me?\" she asks, then surrenders to her fate.The time when Eddie's hands are in plaster is Sarah's brief season of happiness. She stops drinking and even makes progress with her writing. Somebody needs her, belongs completely to her. It cannot last.\"I made you up, Eddie,\" Sarah tells him, and in a sense she did. She imagined him to be loyal and stable. On the night when the truth dawns, Sarah goes from feeling pretty in her new dress to being a rain-sodden wreck. She is supplanted in Eddie's attention by the sinister Gordon, who asserts the new power-balance in the railroad dining-car. The hotel suites are adjoining, and though Sarah closes all the doors, she can't keep Gordon out. By Findlay's party, she has hit the bottle again. The patterned dress which Eddie bought her, a symbol of her incarceration, has the shadow of the ballustrade projected onto it, seemingly magnifying her sense of ensnarement.Though Jackie Gleason does very little in this film, he dominates it. On screen for a fraction of the film's totality, and having neither great speeches nor grand gestures, he impresses by his sheer presence. Stillness, self-containment and an ironic amusement make Minnesota Fats the perfect foil for the angry, ambitious Eddie. In the final showdown, Fats' quiet poise outshines the grandstanding of the others. Gleason conveys beautifully the fear at the core of this big dandy. When Eddie has him in trouble, the Fat Man begins to lose his sartorial integrity as his confidence unravels.This contrast of stillness and motion is effective in the first meeting of the hustlers. Fats and Gordon, who know what they are about, remain motionless and tranquil. Eddie the incontinent wannabe gradually loses control of both mouth and limbs. The film is rich in symbolic language. The cheap rooms which Eddie rents are mere boxes for hire, like the bus station locker which he lives out of. When he and Sarah meet for the second time, the inevitability of their coupling is conveyed in a scene without words or gestures. Eddie's plastercasts are manacles - without his hands, he is nothing. A sumptuous restaurant and a happy couple are transformed when the brutal truth emerges. The camera angle is reversed, and Eddie and Sarah are now separated by gaunt shelves of crockery. The illusion has been shattered. When Eddie sneaks out on the sleeping Sarah with the stake money in his hand, it is the betrayal of Charlie re-enacted.A marvellous film is enhanced by a superbly sleazy jazz score (Kenyon Hopkins) and the violence is all the more gut-wrenching for being suggested, rather than shown.",

Tevis is the same writer that gave us \"The Queen's Gambit\", \u00a8The man who fell to Earth\u00a8 and \u00a8The color of money\u00a8 (Hustler's sequel) Paul Newman in the lead role as Fast Eddie is a talented young pool hustler. This is a classic riches to rags to riches type tale of the sort that Hollywood loves. It starts with a fantastic battle between Eddie and an older champion, Minnesota Fats, which Eddie nearly wins and then loses. The rest of the film has him building himself up again from nothing for a rematch.Director Rossen does a brilliant job of drawing tension out of the games Eddie plays, without the reader needing to understand the intricacies of pool. We end up feeling like experts on the game, although that mahy be an illusion. Despite not being a good pool player, I'm a sucker for pool stories and this is the greatest one. The highs and the lows of the matches, with the added zing of the danger that comes from the seedier side of pool hall hustling, make for fantastically entertainment. Best of all, Eddie is a kind of Everyman of young male hubris and determination and makes the movie feel more meaningful than it might have otherwise.",

            "review_title": "Shattering and utterly brilliant",
            "content": "If you love films, you just have to see Robert Rossen's The Hustler. Even though it centres around a very talented pool player, it is far from a run-of-the-mill sports film. Paul Newman portrays 'Fast' Eddie Felson in the performance of his lifetime. Eddie is a small-time pool hustler who travels far to play the reigning straight pool champion Minnesota Fats (Jackie Gleason) and he's prepared to risk everything. In the process, he develops a relationship with the booze-addled girl Sarah Packard (Piper Laurie). They have a 'contract of depravity'. Rich bookie Bert Gordon (George C. Scott) tries to eliminate Piper to get the maximum out of Eddie. In the shattering climax, Eddie realises that he has been playing the wrong game, with the dramatic results that follow.One notion that makes The Hustler such a great film is its brilliant acting. The classic supporting cast members (Laurie, Scott, Gleason, McCormick), three of which received Oscar nominations, is original in that every character is unique in its portrayal. The powerful Scott, sitting in the dark cigarette-smoked poolroom, is the source of evil throughout the movie. Gleason's performance is equally brilliant due to its subtleness, Fats barely has any lines, but plays a magical part with his movement, his dancing around the pool table. However, Paul Newman tops them all. Gordon tells Eddie he's a born loser, and we eventually know that this has little to do with the pool game. Eddie is a handsome, talented man but he's self-destructive and can't seem to come to terms with the dark world in which he lives, and this dramatic irony is omnipresent. He gives (indeed, donates) us a subtle but equally powerful performance, which perhaps only Brando could have pulled off. When Eddie finally leaves the poolroom, he and Fats conclude the film with the utterly great words: \"Fat man, you shoot a great game of pool.\" \"so do you, Fast Eddie.\"Indeed, this movie's energy and enigma is largely due to the choice for black and white. As the slightly disappointing sequel by the great Scorsese proves, it just isn't the same in colour (despite the Academy Award for Newman). The shadowy, mysterious aura that hangs over the pool room creates such a magical atmosphere, in which everything could happen. Roger Ebert was very right when he said that excluding 'black & white films' from your repertoire is an indication of your cinematic illiteracy.",

Different people see this film in vastly different ways. Most people say its about a young man finding \"character\". Thats true, but it is also about a simple game...pool. A game...like all games that creates its own masters. It is also about two giants of the game who clash ...like gladiators...with pride and passion. Each one thinking he is number one --- each giving deep respect to his opponent. The movie contains a real soul-less gambler (Scott) who is only interested in peeling off the psychological layers of naive young men with potential. Then when they are \"naked\"--put huge bets on them. Winning for this guy is as exciting as yawning. The money means nothing. If someone is eliminated along the way---thats too bad.

Bert Gordon buys Fast Eddie's soul with the promise to give him Character and make him a winner. I noticed there are two characters who are literally crippled. One is the man who helps Fats keep clean and well dressed. The other is Sarah, Fast Eddie's new girl. As Sarah points out, it is allegorical that every other character wears a mask and underneath they are figuratively crippled, perverted, and twisted. Fast Eddie learns too late, but finally has gained Character so he ultimately wins.

            "review_title": "One of the greatest American movies of all time.",
            "content": "THE HUSTLER is one of the essential American films of the 1960's, right up there with BONNIE & CLYDE, THE GRADUATE, and THE WILD BUNCH, a cultural touchstone for years after its release with scenes that defined a generation. If its luster has faded in the past few decades, maybe it is because B/W films were not favorites of the MTV generation and the millennials that followed, but I think it is The Great American Movie the way The Great Gatsby is The Great American Novel, in that it is a film that challenges the viewer to consider just what makes a person a success, a failure, and how does one gain the character to become the former and avoid the latter. It is also a damn good piece of film making, filled with subtle touches that vividly bring to life a time and place, and the marginalized culture of the big city pool halls.Most know the plot, of how cocky young pool hustler, Fast Eddie Felson, comes to New York City to challenge the legendary champ, Minnesota Fats, to a game of straight pool in Fats' regular haunt. It's youth challenging experience, and though Fast Eddie may well have the raw talent to beat Fats, he does not have the sense to know when to quit while he is ahead, and Fats utterly humiliates Eddie after a 25 hour marathon series of games, stripping the challenger of $18,000 in winnings and leaving him exhausted and drunk on the floor. It is a hard fall, and as brutal as any suffered by any gladiator in the arena, and the middle part of the film concerns Eddie's quest to get back on his feet, earn enough money, and take on Fats again. Along the way, he meets, Sarah Packard, a damaged young woman and begins a relationship with her, and ultimately makes an arrangement with Bert Gordon, a sharpie with a fat wallet who is willing to stake Eddie because he knows he has talent, if not character. But while Eddie has a chance at love with Sarah, his real passion is the game, and Bert is determined to protect his investment by getting rid of the competition. It does not end well for Sarah, and the sadly wiser Fast Eddie gets what he wants, a rematch with Fats, and a settling of accounts with Bert. In the end, Eddie Felson is a success, but was the price worth it, that is the question the movie asks and it has been challenging audiences ever since. More than its weighty themes, THE HUSTLER is a masterpiece of subtle film making, and its centerpiece is Eddie and Fats' initial clash around the pool table, a sequence that takes up nearly a quarter of the film's more than two hour running time. The genius of it is that you don't have to know much about the game to follow what is happening, but it is the interaction between the characters that is what bears watching, as money changes hands, signals are sent, liquor is drunk, and how simply the washing of hands, the putting on of a coat, and the picking up of a pool cue is tantamount to putting on a sword and a shield and going into battle. It is in the way Bert Gordon sits like an Emperor in the Ames pool hall, and how he gets up and moves his chair two inches and then sits back down when a drunken Eddie tells him to move somewhere else. More than that, it is in the scene where Eddie has his thumbs broken after he hustles the wrong crew, thus making him a \"cripple\" like Sarah, and for the first time, he is dependent on someone else, and they both become better people for it. The picnic scene where Eddie talks to her about his love of the game and the satisfaction he gets just playing it better than anyone is a paean to true success, the kind that comes from within. There is the party in Louisville sequence, where the vapid and empty character of the well to do is made plain by the way they ignore a drunken Sarah as she lies on a bed, rolling her out of the way to retrieve a coat, or the how the homosexuality of the aristocratic Findley is suggested in the statues of satyrs and Greek Gods in his basement. The heart and soul of THE HUSTLER lies in the casting of the four principles and the career best performances they give. Simply put, this is the film that made Paul Newman a superstar, it happens the moment when he flashes that great Golden Boy smile in the cold open scene. Fast Eddie Felson was a different kind of movie protagonist, the first of the wary anti heroes that would grace America's movie screen as the 50's faded into the rear view mirror and the popular culture began to more reflect the tensions in American life. Newman makes being tough and being vulnerable look sexy, and does things with this role that Frank Sinatra and Bobby Darin, who were considered for the part, could never have done. He was the front runner for the Best Actor Oscar that year, but lost to Maximilian Schell's performance in JUDGMENT AT NUREMBURG, he would have to wait a quarter of a century before getting the award, which many consider a consolation Oscar, when he reprised Fast Eddie in Martin Scorsese THE COLOR OF MONEY. I think he should have gotten it the first time around. For those who only know Piper Laurie only as Carrie White's mother, this movie will be a revelation, her Sarah Packard is Eddie's true love, a lame woman who clings to her man even as she is losing him; her final scene in the hotel room with Bert, where a vile sexual act is committed, is not to be forgotten. Sarah was a role many big stars of the time would have passed on as inappropriate for their images. Laurie was rewarded with a well deserved Best Actress nomination for taking the risk. This was George C. Scott's third movie, his Bert Gordon is shrewd and intelligent, but with no moral center whatsoever, he is the Satan of this particular hell, and Scott brings all his skills to the role, with that great voice getting to deliver some equally worthy dialogue; and nobody ever leaned in better than George C. Scott. Jackie Gleason was simply a force of nature, very familiar to audiences in 1961 from his time on TV, especially from THE HONEYMOONERS, but he had spent his many years honing a larger than life persona, and a reputation as a man who enjoyed the finer things in life. All of that is in his portrayal of Minnesota Fats, and it reminds us that this man who's other great movie role is Buford T. Justice, was one hell of a dramatic actor, if there are any doubts, just watch him in REQUIM FOR A HEAVYWEIGHT, made the next year. Murray Hamilton, who will forever be Mayor Larry Vaughn from JAWS, is the smarmy Findley; some might remember that he and Myron McCormick, who plays Eddie's partner, Charlie, were in NO TIME FOR SERGEANTS only a few years before. And there is a direct Scorsese connection in that the Raging Bull himself, Jake LaMotta, has a cameo as a bartender.There are some behind the scenes heroes of THE HUSTLER, starting with the director and screen writer, Robert Rossen, who spent some time in the 50's away from Hollywood because of the McCarthy blacklisters. A onetime member of the Communist Party, he had appeared before Congressional investigators and named names. Some of this finds its way into the story in the way Fast Eddie must make a deal with the devil in form of Bert in order to do what he loves to do best. Rossen had been something of a pool hustler himself in his younger days, long before finding success as a script writer at Warner Brothers and directing such classics as BODY AND SOUL and ALL THE KING'S MEN. This project was his big comeback and he made the most of it, turning it into his greatest critical and financial success. Sadly, it would be his last one, as he made only one more movie before dying much too soon in 1966. And THE HUSTLER would be nothing without the contribution of pool champion Willie Mosconi, who taught the game to Newman before production started, did some of the trick shots himself with the help of editor Dede Allen, and has a cameo as \"Willie,\" the man who holds the money at Ames Pool Hall.Scorsese's sequel, which came out in 1986, picked up the story of Fast Eddie 25 years later, and though it took its title, THE COLOR OF MONEY, from Walter Tevis's official follow up novel, the sequel did not use the plot of the book, but instead told the story of an older Fast Eddie, who is drawn back to the game he loves when he meets a talented kid, played by Tom Cruise, who is just as deficient in character as Eddie was at his age. My only complaint about Scorsese's follow up, is that it had so few call backs to the original film, that many young viewers in the 80's and later would watch MONEY over and over completely unaware that Fast Eddie had first made his appearance on the scene in 1961; their loss.The DVD special edition is an excellent version, complete with many extras and a commentary track; the transfer is well done, preserving the effect of Cinemascope, which made the pool rooms seem enormous, something seldom done in a B/W movie. My only complaint that the commentaries by various parties - Carol Rossen, Dede Allen, critic Richard Schickel, actor Stefan Giersach, and briefly, Newman himself - do not do a scene by scene breakdown. No matter, it is the definitive version of this classic. And after all these years, THE HUSTLER still speaks to us, especially to those who see it for the first time. Don't be turned off by the B/W, watch it and meet Fast Eddie and Minnesota Fats, Bert Gordon and Sarah Packard for the first time. They still have a lot to tell us.",

            "content": "Among the best character studies you can see on screen undoubtedly has to rank Robert Rossen's \"The Hustler\". The pool played in the film is fascinating, however secondary, as actually it's all about three characters you get to know up close: the title figure Eddie Felson (Paul Newman) who has his own self-imposed agenda, which is no less than reaching for the stars, then we have the alcoholic off kilter Sarah Packard (Piper Laurie) the anti-hero spends his days and nights with and the sleazy cutthroat manager Bert Gordon (George C. Scott), who's determined to squeeze every dime out of Eddie whatever it takes. And last but not least there's the big fish Minnesota Fats (Jackie Gleason) who has to be brought to his knees - but that's just one side of the story. All of these main characters have exemplary screen presence, weight and intensity, so that the stakes are felt and leave their emotional traces in the viewer. Paul Newman at the time was just hungry to proof himself, and he did, Scott in one of his first films already steals a couple of scenes and would continue to do so constantly in \"Patton\" and \"Dr. Strangelove\", and Laurie is anything else but the sweet love interest. And Jackie Gleason? Can a comedian in such a dramatic role work? You bet!Shot in black and white the language of the film is social realism which indeed comes across very strongly. Even the central pool hall is not just a set, but the real thing, the bit parts are played by genuine characters themselves, among them the real ex-fighter and later bartender Jake LaMotta (see Robert DeNiro's characterization in \"Raging Bull\"). All these details help to get us into the milieu, the thrill of the game, and we become part of the onlookers - it's almost as if one can smell the smoke-filled room and is tempted to make a bet. And there, in this arena it takes place: the fight between the clashing egos, where we also finally learn about the decisive difference between character and mere talent: Who will win and who will lose? And what is the price?",

He is a cocky loser in every way, and takes down a good woman who loved him and would have done almost ANYTHING for him, in the process. Yaaaay!...and as a woman, I can tell you that it's incredibly ingratiating to be compared to a game of pool, but, then, maybe that's the point. Maybe that is how men relate to the world. That is, pushing balls into a net with a stick. Maybe that really is how men come to understand the world around them, and the pain they cause in the process....maybe that was the entire point of the film. Who knows?",

Had Paul Newman not been in this movie it would not be as good, because Paul Newman was made to play Fast Eddie. Jackie Gleason does a good job as the pool hall big-shot Minnesota Fats, and Piper Laurie does a *GREAT* job as Eddies alcoholic girlfriend Sarah.This was an early film for Newman and he isn't the same Eddie in 'The Hustler' as the much older, wiser Eddie in 'The Color of Money'. Both films are very good, but I think I liked 'The Color of Money' better because I saw it first, and since 'The Color of Money' is much tamer than 'The Hustler', I wasn't expecting such a tragic and dark movie, but it is still an excellent movie. Check it out, but be sure to see the 'The Color of Money' with it. 9/10",

            "content": "The Hustler is such a solid movie that in which i have trouble seeing any weakness in conventional cinema rating aspects ( Acting, screenplay, cinematography, music etc ) resulting in a near flawless film that is further enhanced by its amazing casting.What could have been a movie about merely playing pool has turned into a study on 'character' and capitalism. 'Fast' Eddie Felson ( Paul Newman ) seems to hopelessly want to be the best, and doesn't know when to quit even when ahead a significant amount, because he needs to have the satisfaction in his mind of beating Minnesota Fats ( Jackie Gleason ) until he quits. Charlie ( Myron McCormick ), his partner, symbolizes the sane and logical part of Eddie, that one should quit when ahead, and not continue to lose it all again. When Eddie eventually dismisses Charlie, his last hold on controlling his self destructive nature disappears, and it is only later when met with Bert Gordon ( George C. Scott ) that this 'hold' returns to Eddie. It is a great character study on how Eddie, the arrogant talented 'born loser' turns into the epitome of a 'winner' through a long series of relatable and emotional events that occur. Newman is simply incredible as usual, and he seems to understand his character like no other. His entire monologue about being called a born loser with Sarah, his fantastic facial acting, his desperate drunken mannerisms, it all sums up in that he IS basically Eddie Felson. Jackie Gleason is great as Minnesota Fats, and Piper Laurie as Sarah Packard. But apart from Newman the other true star has to be George C. Scott, whose character symbolizes greed as the true capitalist that seeks only money and doesn't seem to care about anything at all along the way. ( As Eddie says to him, 'You're dead inside' ) Scott's energetic acting, head up tilting mannerisms to show how much above everyone else he feels he is, fast manner of speaking and this arrogant kind of self control result in a phenomenal performance and everytime these actors come on the screen it results in fantastic scenes.The acting is further enhanced by a fantastic screenplay so the dialogue said by these great actors never go to waste. As stated before the dialogue between Eddie & Sarah is so key to understanding his character perfectly for the audience, and it delivered in such an absorbing way by Newman. The dialogue in the final scene, and generally any scene in which Newman and Scott speak to eachother. The cinematography is world class and captures the 60s feel of the film like no other, which is also due to the fantastic Jazz score by Kenyon Hopkins. The pool games themselves are set up great with a lot of innovative shots of the audience's reactions pictured over the pool shots themselves, and a lot of the shots were apparantly made by Gleason and Newman themselves, with the occasional intervention of Willie Mosconi ( Reportedly one of the greatest pool players of all time ). It all results in a masterpiece of character development, that seems to be near flawless and covers all the angles of the aspects that make a movie great.",

            "content": "Nominated for nine Academy Awards and winner of two, THE HUSTLER galvanized a resurgence of interest in the game of billiards following its release in 1961. It provided Paul Newman with of his best known roles, that of pool shark Fast Eddie Felson, and transformed him from a mere star to a superstar. THE HUSTLER, especially the fictional Minnesota Fats, also inspired a man named Rudolf Wanderone to legally change his own name to Minnesota Fats.Based on the novel by Walter Tevis, rights to THE HUSTLER were optioned by several people, including Frank Sinatra, but no one was quite sure how to visualize how it would look until writer/director Robert Rossen expressed interest. Before starting in the movie business, Rossen hustled pool for a living in New York, so Tevis' character and the subject matter resonated with him.After securing a deal with Twentieth Century Fox, Rossen set about finding the right actors for the roles. Sinatra was too old to play a young hustler, so Rossen asked Newman, whose agent informed him that his client was about to reunite with Elizabeth Taylor once her current film was completed. However, that film was CLEOPATRA, which dragged on and on, making Taylor's accessibility impossible. The good news for Rossen was that her unavailability made Newman available for THE HUSTLER.Because Newnan had never handled a pool cue prior to THE HUSTLER, Rossen assigned Willie Mosconi, the billiards champion, to take the actor under his wing to teach him the rudiments. By the time production was about to begin, it was said that Newman was good enough to compete nationally. Jackie Gleason, on the other hand was an expert pool player which, besides his physical girth, may have been the reason why Rossen wanted him to portray Fats. George C Scott was fast making a name for himself as a powerful character actor, and was certainly a good choice to bring the sinister Bert Gordon to life. Actress Piper Laurie played Sarah Packard, Eddie's love interest.In the pre-credits, Eddie Felson and his aged colleague Charlie pull over at at a bar pretending to be travelling salesmen stopping off to wet their whistles. Pretending to be drunk, a sober Eddie soon scams the bartender and patrons in a pool game. They eventually find their way to the Ames Billiard Parlor in New York where Felson waits to challenge Minnesota Fats, the finest pool player in the country. What transpires is a marathon twenty-five hour marathon that takes up almost half an hour of screen time. Ultimately, Eddie is done in by his own hubris -and bourbon- leaving him with only $200 left.",

            "content": "This film has influenced me probably more than any other. I saw it decades ago and its meaning is now more realized. It is about confidence (pun intended, a hustler being the lead character), self-confidence, under-confidence, over-confidence. I will just address this aspect as related to the four main characters so as to limit repeating what others have said.Minnesota Fats (Jackie Gleason) - the character most at peace with himself knowing just who he is and his abilities.Eddie Felson (Paul Newman) - the character most troubled by his inability to judge himself in terms of his abilities. He knows he is masterful playing pool, but has no peace within himself unless judged by others. When he engages Minnesota Fats he can't stop playing even though incapacitated unless Minnesota himself frees him to stop. When an inferior hustler slights him, he has to retaliate without any charity to another hustler. He misjudges his first manager (Myron McCormick) who cares for him while his second one does not. He is closest to Sarah whom he can say how he feels about his abilities, but apparently that isn't enough.Sarah Packard (Piper Laurie) - Eddie's love interest. This woman feels total lack of self-confidence, but is able to see Eddie's faith in himself. Though she is Eddie's love interest, she can't bring herself to believe he could reciprocate. She gives up too early. Her confidence is that she loves him. When I first saw the film I wondered if she gave herself to Bert and did so out of despair. The second viewing leaves me unsure.Bert Gordon (George C. Scott) - Eddie's second manager. His over-confidence to get his way rivals that of Eddie's. His confidence is all external. His self-interest is so great, it causes him to make a mistake that loses him the best person he has to manage.I believe this film has such an impact because we all face the question of self-judgment in our abilities versus the judgment of others and how we handle our abilities matters a great deal.",

            "content": "The Hustler isn't just one of, if not the single, greatest sports movies of all-time. It's just one of the great films ever made. Everything about this film is almost pitch perfect, from it's cinematography, it's tone, the direction, writing, acting, music, etc. Robert Rossen has made a certified classic and a movie that is must-watch for any cinephile at least once a year.\n\nThe best part of this film, by far, are the performances. In a film that uses limited sets and usually filmed in dark and closed pool halls, it's up to the actors to be at the top of their game, and the main quartet are certainly that. Paul Newman give a career best performance as \"Fast\" Eddie Felson, making the brash and headstrong pool shark a sympathetic character who goes through the entire gamut of emotions by the end of the film and has you questioning whether the end justifies the means.\n\nPiper Laurie as well, as Newman's counterpart and the one who quietly shapes everything about Eddie, is phenomenal as the equally flawed but equally sympathetic Sarah. She actually ends up with the most heart-wrenching and most important moments in the film, with her tender care for Eddie as he recovers from his injuries and her desperation and end thanks to a sleazy manager really hits hard.\n\nOf course, you have to focus as well on possibly the most underrated antagonist in film over the past 75 years in George C. Scott's Bert Gordon. There is nothing redeeming about Bert Gordon, nothing that makes a view think that maybe he's right in the end. He's greedy, slimy, manipulative, and only out for his own pocketbook. That point is never more clear than the sequence with Findlay (Murray Hamilton) in which he is able to anger Eddie enough to come back and win a substantial of money and then accosts Sarah and causes her demise. The slow diatribe that Eddie goes on throughout the climactic pool sequence going after Bert is cathartic not just for Eddie but the viewers as well. It's a well-written villain and Scott is perfectly sleazy for the role. If it wasn't for Patton, I'd say it was his best work.\n\nFinally with casting, we get to the mere presence that is Jackie Gleason. He's barely in the film, bookending the feature, but whenever he's on screen you can't look away. The big man dominates his screentime and is believable as the legendary shark Minnesota Fats. When he say \"pay up\" after being thoroughly defeated by Eddie, you feel for him, almost like he was just a slight speedbump for Eddie to drive over and get to his real target at this point, Bert.\n\nTechnically, it's incredibly vivid to watch and the way the cinematographer and Robert Rossen use lighting and shade is immaculate. The closeups of Newman alone in the pool halls are worth the watch, but the standout sequence is the final scene of Sarah. You see her broken and at her end through a mirror. Scrawling \"Perverted, Twisted, Crippled\" in lipstick shows how dark the path Bert has led Eddie on and the next shot of Eddie discovering her and Bert claiming ignorance is profound.\n\nIn the end, the Hustler is an incredible film experience and one that we can all learn form about the mentality of winning and whether we would take the steps to get to the point that we think we desire to reach. In the end, Paul Newman and \"Fast\" Eddie Felson is all of us. What good is reaching the mountaintop if all we did is lose ourselves and everything we love in the process?",

Basically, once Paul Newman gives up his former career to take up pool hustling, the movie slows to a crawl. We watch very long scenes of pool playing, very long scenes of him and his girlfriend...and everything moves so slowly, I lost interest and dozed off.\n\nThe concept was good, but it needed more than long pool-playing sequences. The scenes continued longer than they needed to, and we never learn much about the protagonist or what motivates him to want to be a big-time pool hustler. We see what he does, but never come to learn why he is doing it. Disappointing.",

The struggle of Newman's 'Fast Eddie' Felson is one that is rooted in deep character flaws; while he has the technical capability and talent to be the best, his nature forces him to push himself too far and fails to allow im to recognize his own limitations, often causing devastating results in his game as well as his personal relationships. But the romantic subplot used to demonstrate his faults is overblown and poorly constructed, with Laurie's Packard feeling like a one-note knockoff of the habitually drunk romantic interest archetype that seems to have pervaded theatre and cinema around the middle of the 20th century, when alcoholism substituted for personality from a narrative perspective. The film's big thematic statement is that it might not be wise to pursue goals recklessly and obsessively at the expense of those around you; okay? We're not exactly storming bravely into the unknown here, in a film that seems convinced of its own importance. What The Hustler does nail is the performances and the actual depictions of pool, with Newman, Scott, and Gleason each delivering sobering and entertaining work in equal measure. With this viewing, I'm of the belief that most of what this film accomplished was the reintroduction of pool to the mainstream, rather than breaking ground cinematically. (3.5/5)",

Fortunately they were largely met as all of the praise that people throw around was deserved with the gritty, tough tone of the film not relenting and the performances coming across as surprisingly naturalistic for the time. This is a film that will hopefully stay with me long after I have seen it with it's difficult messages about masculinity and the expectations we have of life. Unlike many films released in 1961 to great success this film has remained in the cultural zeitgeist and continues to be referenced in other films.\n\nAspiring pool hustler Eddie Felson, Paul Newman, works under the more cautious Charlie, Myron McCormick, and makes his way to a small town to play the famed Minnesota Fats, Jackie Gleason. He aims to earn $18,000 but his self destructive tendencies cause him to continue playing even when he has made that amount and he ends up losing all of his money. He parts ways with Charlie and strikes up a relationship with alcoholic student Sarah Packard, Piper Laurie, and the two live on money provided by her father. He spends his time trying to earn enough money through hustling to play Minnesota again and when experienced player Bert Gordon, George C. Scott, insults his character and then offers to sponsor him he takes him up on his offer. Packard is frustrated by Felson's decision as he has repeatedly faced punishment as a result of his arrogance while playing. She sleeps with the manipulative Gordon and commits suicide the next morning, pushing Felson to have an emotional breakdown and reconsider his cruelty to those around him. He returns to defeat Minnesota but agrees to step away from hustling altogether.\n\nThe most fascinating character in the film is Gordon who seems above everything but shows flashes of understanding just what a terrible person he is. He is cunning and calculated and both Felson and Packard are aware of this and yet both are conned by him successfully and he is able to extract exactly what he wants out of him. Seeing him mold and shape Felson in his own image is bizarre as the \u2018character' he talks is really a deep cynicism that allows him not to feel any emotions and use and abuse others. After the suicide of Packard, a woman that both men connect with to a degree, we see Gordon grow weaker and less embittered while Felson gains some measure of self respect. He sees what Gordon's behavior can create and works to distance himself from a figure so toxic and yet so alluring in his false confidence.\n\nFelson himself is one of Newman's most recognized roles and he plays him well as all of the attributes that prevented him from being taken seriously early in his career play into how Felson is not treated as a serious threat in the film. He has a smile that seems like that of an ignorant dope but much like Burt Lancaster he has cold eyes that convey an inability or simple lack of desire to feel compassion. In his interactions with Laurie he is particularly impressive as he seems to be sizing her up constantly and regarding her more as an object than a genuine girlfriend. Laurie herself was less impressive as she is serviceable in her role but there are times when you see her reaching for emotion and others where she goes so big that she verges on pantomime. Compared to the controlled vulgarity of Scott and Newman she seems to be overtly \u2018performing' and that takes you out of the film at certain points. Rossen was known for coaxing great performances out of actors and he was able to tap into the then unknown abilities of a young Newman.\n\nThe scenes of pool themselves are smartly not drawn out as we often get just a few shots of pool cues flicking balls over the table instead of extended sequences of them rolling around. Rossen knows that what we really care about is the emotion that goes into the games and so he focuses the camera on Newman as he experiences elation and then horror. He makes a lot of decisions like this that turn the film into the character study that it should be rather than a sports based drama that relies on plot twists.",

The tears are real as much as rotten the game is. But the director, Robert Rossen is concerned on both the aspects of this game, the up front razzle dazzle that can easily gather a crowd and the back stage drama that drives the fear in this high staked tense game. And let me start by the first game, the best game, of the film. Not only is it smartly calculated but also informative. For someone jumping in on this sport, for the first time, the baby steps are taken beautifully that marks both the magnitude and the rules of the genre parallel-y.\n\nAforementioned, the game or the onstage drama can never even be compared with the emotional conflicts that the broken lead couple goes through. Now so similar are these tracks placed that you find yourself immersed in them without telling apart what's the act or who is acting. Breaking down this game, analysing it, the commentary of Paul Newman as the infamous Fast Eddie is a sight to behold. Watch him fail, love, cheat and then fail again with a drunken voice and sober body language while playing, he makes sure he lives up to the title given by the crowd, Fast.\n\nEnters, Piper Laurie, her performance is as rich and powerful as her character. Not only can she empower him, but she gets to challenge the Fast Eddie and make him slow down. As a memory, she comes in and \"makes him up\" whispering and begging in one of the finest scenes of the film where mirrors are placed in front of each other, expressing to us, their interest and intentions, coming from The Hustler, you ought to note these things, trying to catch him out, you won't though.",

His black and white aesthetic helps smoke up the air with his dingy pool hall sets and sleazy cast of realistically tragic characters.\n\nRossen's direction leaves you with empty spaces of room filled with a few characters of magnificent presence. His shots hold on faces, hands, and cues to squeeze out all the tension of his shots with a horrifying suspense. I always felt uneasy watching The Hustler as you never knew what would happen.\n\nPaul Newman is gripping and upsetting as the hotheaded con artist \"Fast\" Eddie Felson. His quick wit and quick temper lead to tragedy of his own making. Newman plays the distracted, distraught, and forlorn loser turned professional pool hall hustler with an effortless skill. Newman makes Eddie look skilled as a pool player and affectionate as a lover. His frustration at being bested in pool is admirable, but Newman's troubled anguish at his equally relied upon relationship is the most convincing. Paul Newman was a cool actor, a funny actor, but also a realistic dramatic actor who characters always feel grounded.\n\nJackie Gleason is great as the calm veteran, whose experience gives him a patient terror. Gleason's massive Minnesota Fats is amiable, yet intimidating. His pool playing skills are cleverly formidable, but it's his cool calculated demeanor that makes Fats memorable.\n\nGeorge C. Scott is at his most sleazy and unethical as Bert Gordon. His gangster gambler is more reminiscent of the devil conning men into selling their souls, as Murray Hamilton's Findlay remarks to Scott. George C. Scott eyes up a room in a moment and glares at all the events taking place with a knowing presence that you cannot ignore. His performance is excellent and infuriating as Scott makes you love his likable blunt gambler, while despising his shrewd sleazy conduct.\n\nOn the other hand, Myron McCormick is endearing as Charley Bums. \"Fast\" Eddie's father figure is charming in an old hustler way with his honesty and sincerity towards Eddie. He gives it to Newman straight and you appreciate it, even though Eddie does not see the light as he does not heed Charley's warning.\n\nLastly, the most compelling performance other than Paul Newman's has to be Piper Laurie. Her alcoholic intellectual is a woman in despair. She's a strong woman dealing with despair, coping with past trauma, and hoping for something, or someone, better than she's got. I think Laurie captures what is so tragic about The Hustler's broken promise for an entertaining little hustler con. She makes it all so real as the consequences of \"Fast\" Eddie's choices are dealt out to her. Laurie is brilliantly charming and deeply disturbing to see a woman so hurt.\n\nAll in all, The Hustler is the perfect slow burn sports drama. The pool games are gripping and the humanistic drama with riddled with parables. I think The Hustler is worth seeing once.",

It starts off brilliantly, with the cocky upstart played by Paul Newman and the calm professional played by Jackie Gleason. This entire sequence (which must have been at least 15 minutes) was so tense and exciting that I wondered if Netflix had accidentally jumped me to the final scene. The problem with The Hustler is that it does trail off significantly in the second act. I understand the need for the romance angle in the story, but it was really slow going for awhile, particularly when Newman's thumb is busted so no pool is being played at all. I also struggled with Piper Laurie's performance, because she didn't seem to have much range. She was either sober as a nun, or drunk as a sailor and it was obvious from the start of every scene which way she was going. However, once George C. Scott shows up, the class of the film cranks up to 11. He is just perfect and his interactions with Newman are fascinatingly complex without saying many words. Also, I was glad to see that all those slow parts paid off in the final act. While the opening was spectacular, it is almost surpassed by the poignant final game. The financial stakes might be the same, but there is a lot more subtext in this match. One last thing that I will say in favor of The Hustler is that it was remarkable how brilliantly they cut a lot of the actual pool. Clearly many of the shots were not done by doubles, but the actors themselves, and they were not easy shots either. That kind of attention to detail, and commitment to a role is always impressive. I think the overall experience of watching this film was good, I just wish it didn't have that huge lull in the middle which didn't include enough pool to keep me fully engaged.",

            "content": "Probably the coolest movie about billiards that there will ever be.  So this is about a pool player (Paul Newman).  He wants to be one of the greats, so he takes his shot at the best player in the nation: Minnesota Fats (Jackie Gleason).  This is one of those movies that I had heard about, knew what it was about, but had never actually sat down to watch it.  There's no better excuse than the list to rectify gaping holes in my film education, and my wife and I took the time one lazy Saturday afternoon to watch this back in July.  Besides, Paul Newman is one of the coolest guys to have ever graced Hollywood with his presence, and he quite plainly doesn't make bad movies.  This is a really good movie, but it wasn't exactly what I expected it to be.  It starts off really fun, and the competition grabs you immediately as soon as he walks into a pool hall.  There are trick shots and the occasional bout of trash talk, and it makes you want to pick up a cue.  You can tell that our protagonist has his issues, and he may not be all that stable, but he comes off as more of a rascal than anything, and it is all fun and you can't wait to hear the next thing that comes out of his mouth, or see the next impossible shot he's going to attempt.  You're having such a good time, and then the movie brings you back down to Earth with the drama.  This man is a mess, and then he crosses paths with a potential love interest (Piper Laurie) who is as equally in need of an intervention as he is.  They're both alcoholics, and their negativity and bad habits feed off of one another.  It doesn't turn into a bad movie by any stretch of the imagination, it just ceases to be the fun time that you were having up to that point.  Paul Newman has screen presence for days, and when he is talking, you pay attention.  I love the black and white photography, it really makes you feel like you're in a smoky pool hall with all of these characters.  When it takes a turn for the serious, you do start to feel the length, which is really my only nitpick in this 134-minute movie.  These are the messy lives of imperfect people, and it is easy to see why this has gathered the acclaim that it has.",

The whole thing was a rectangle room and at the back end there was an exit only door with nothing obstructing its view of the sunshine. Walking through the dark, crowded alley, through the pool hall with its depressed and cynical atmosphere, then emerging with the bright sunlight in my eyes was like walking through another world.

At least he finally won one.\r\n\r\nFast Eddie Felson (Newman) is a gifted pool player from Oakland, California.  He is good that he can play and beat the best of them.  Eddie is pretty conceited about his abilities and likes his opponents to acknowledge his superiority.\r\n\r\nEddie meets Bert Gordon (George C. Scott), a gambler who believes he and Eddie together can hustle other players for money.  They go place to place scamming players as they go.\r\n\r\nThe film is solid all the way.  Newman is in top form and his contest with Minnesota Fats, played by Jackie Gleason, is dynamite.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v48/Zeppo1/Hustler_zpse712c2cc.jpg[/IMG]",

However, things are getting better, when Sarah (Laurie) being introduced to this male-crammed coterie, she lights up the screen instantly, a damaged cripple longing for a secure relationship, her chimera would eventually be shattered into pieces to cement her lover Eddie's (Newman) \"character\" which is prerequisite for him to be the top pick among the bunch. Laurie's intuitively destructive performance enables the film to be more affecting than the usual offerings where female-roles are decorative and neglectful.  \n\nNewman also stretches out in his best form to deliver the gamut of emotions through the narrative arc, deadly charming as he is, Eddie is a far cry being a complete likable fellow as he appears to be, even finally he beats Minnesota Fats (Gleason) and valiantly defies and censures Bert's (Scott) greed and vileness, he still bears a certain degree of responsibility to the tragedy occurred before, in the end, he is more a repentant sinner than a victorious hero. Each of the four actors (Newman, Laurie, Gleason and Scott) grabbed an Oscar nomination for his or her work, both competing in the supporting actor category, retrospectively speaking, Scott's flagrant menace isn't a too taxing requirement out of his comfortable zone, while Gleason's reserved taciturnity implies much more chewy undertones than he purports to be, which positively suggests his background story would spin another gripping and morally-ambiguous tale easily. Personally I give the edge to Gleason. \n\nOther than a sterling cluster of awards-worthy performances, THE HUSTLER is elegantly conducted by Robert Rossen, a gone-too-soon figure in Hollywood manufacture (passed away at the age of 57 in 1966), conscientiously teases out the best of his cast under a low-key production paddings and represents us a visceral parable on human nature's weakness.  \n\nP.S. The next step for me to dig into Newman's oeuvre is the unofficial sequel THE COLOR OF MONEY (1986), a Scorsese's production belatedly gave Newman a golden statue which he should have won decades ago.",

It has a lot to say about taking sports too seriously, especially when gambling is involved, and how one could sometimes put sport above relationships with people and the cost that comes with it.

But he won it with \"character\" and style. His body language alone spoke a thousand words. Way cooler than Paul Newman, who was nominated for an Academy Award but didn't win until 25 years later in the Martin Scorsese/Tom Cruise sequel, \"The Color of Money\". \n\nThe relationship between Eddie and Sarah was doomed from the start. Both of them were severe alcoholics, and Eddie, a foredoomed gambler. In the end, Fast Eddie had his way on the pool table, but he had lost everything else in life. He had hit rock bottom and was about to be taken out by George C. Scott and his goons. But he surrendered his will, stood up for himself, and because of that, was allowed to walk away a winner. Even the vicious, dark-hearted Bert Gordon (Scott) felt remorse for what he did to the young couple, particularly Sarah's desperate little life. \n\nThis movie has some complex characters in it that belong in a 12-step program.

            "content": "The only real problem with The Hustler is that in many shots it doesn't feature footage of Pool Balls so what happens to them is left up to the script to explain, and at times it fails to do so.\nThe other thing which isn't much of a problem but more of a personal opinions from me is that for such a long film I was hoping that Jackie Gleason's dramatic turn would get a lot more screen time, but I was disappointed with the little time he was given, despite a great performance. But like the performances of Ben Kingsley and Harvey Keitel in Bugsy I didn't find it enough to constitute an Academy Award nomination because it was just too brief and small in the storyline.\n\nHowever, The Hustler is still largely enjoyable. \nPaul Newman provides an excellent lead performance and creates a likeable character due to his determination and vocal charm. Fast Eddie is a realistic sports figure whose real enemy is himself, and his enemy can only be beaten by Bert Gordon.\nGeorge C. Scott's performance as Bert Gordon in a strong one because he is manipulative internally and hides it well thorough clever use of words so the audience never know what to believe of him. George C. Scott turns Bert Gordon's characterisation into a villainous and hateful character that never brings r obviously to the surface and gives a sense that George C. Scott is an actor who knows how to level his character emotionally with the script. His performance was great.\nAnd although it was small, Jackie Gleason gave an excellent dramatic turn to his career. With the same wise-guy look as in The Honeymooners, Jackie Gleason instantly turned Minnesota Fats around so that he's more of a prophetic figure to the development of Fast Eddie and therefore it's the influence and idea if him that makes him more important than Gleason's performance itself, and even then Jackie Gleason gives a performance that ensures he will not be second best to his character, as so they combine to form a legendary figure, that can be known simultaneously as the legendary and wise Minnesota Fats and the excellently dramatic Jackie Gleason.\nAnd in the other side of the story is Piper Laurie pulling her own in an excellent performance and great chemistry with Paul Newman.\n\nMore straight up in the thing that makes The Hustler a classic is that The Hustler takes a deeper look into the human psych of sports than many other sports movies, and primarily in the determination to win. Many excellent sport films such as Rocky theorise that the chase is better than the catch, but The Hustler explains the character's determination for the catch and how sometimes the chase doesn't matter, because there's a certain point in sports where winning really is everything. When there's that much money AND a reputation on the line, the player wants a win. The Hustler examines that theme excellently and even expanded it into other sectors of gambling. The Hustler is an entirely new look at sports which explains it's notoriety, and what comes next is the only question, so The Colour of Money is next on the to see list for me, and The Hustler should be next on the to see list for you, as it is admirable for not only its themes and acting, but the smooth soundtrack and cinematography, and smart screenplay and direction.",

Eddie meets a girl wth similar problems with drink, they have there ups and downs.\nOverall The Hustler is a great character story Paul Newman Embodies James Dean a lot but his performance in The left Handed Gun led me to the conclusion Paul maybe the original Rebel Without A Cause, and in the end the film really does want to get you down to pool hall !",

            "content": "\"The Hustler\" completely represents the peak of Paul Newman's star credibility during the 1960's. This was definitely the film that assured all audiences around the world that he was born to be a movie star, and he proves it in this film without a doubt. With some great acting, an all around great story, and Robert Rossen's ability to mix whitty complexities with all around popcorn entertainment, \"The Hustler\" easily proves why its a classic. \n\nPaul Newman plays \"Fast\" Eddie Felson, a newcomer to the game of pool who no one takes seriously. Over time he begins to prove to everyone in the game of pool that he actually has the ability to beat people.The one problem that Edie has is his overbearing pride. He doesn't recognize the notion that he might lose a whole lot of money. This gets him into trouble. But his one overall goal is to beat Minnesota Fats, played by Jackie Gleason. It's a classic rise to the top movie. The one great thing about Newman's character in this film is that he is in no way perfect. More times than not, his faulties get him in trouble, and he needs to find a way to get out of tough situations. But over the course of the film, his transformation allows him to become more wise and mature. \n\nPaul Newman does the stroy a great service by giving an amazing performance. This is easily one of his best movies and he shows why in his performance. We feel for him throughout the film's duration. Newman conveys his genius ability to real an audience in with his legendary screen status. Jackie Gleason also gives a very good performance. The movie's acting was certainly the best aspect to the whole thing. \n\nThis movie certainly wants to make you play pool. This is thanks to a lot of the great cinematography in this film. Somethinig that I liked a lot about how this film was shot was its juxtaposition camera angles, displaying balls as they roll in, and points of interest on opponents facial and physical mannerisms. Another thing that I liked to point out is that these visuals were tributed in \"The Color of Money\", the sequel to the film. I thought that was awesome. And it certainly is something to tribute, because the organic photography in this picture was as progressive as it gets. \n\n\"The Hustler\"is a timeless movie. Paul Newman gives one of his best performances, and along with the great acting by Jackie Gleason, we have two stars who never let up throughout the entire movie. But the best thing about the picture is that it doesn't try to be great for the wrong reasons. It doesn't try to be individualistic, and it certainly doesn't try to level itself above its viewers. It simply attempts to be a fun movie, and certainly is one of the funnest films to watch.",

It has a timeless nature, with the brilliant black and white accentuating the film's depressingly bleak tone. The performances and direction give every scene weight, helped by a script with biting dialogue. We see the progression of Newman's character in a very authentic and organic way on film, making the ending all that much more poignant and memorable. Most everything in the film rings true and realistic, save perhaps for Piper Laurie's character, who the film never seems to  quite nail down or fully explore. Overall, a methodically paced and absorbing drama, a true classic. \n\n4.5/5 Stars",

I think that the critics decided that this one would be great before it even appeared in theaters.  Paul Newman is always deserving of an Oscar nomination but for me, George C. Scott (who was also nominated for an Oscar) stole the show.  Jackie Gleason - why was he nominated?  The world may never know.  Despite its many nominations, it is no surprise that it lost out to \"West Side Story\" in most categories, but I still don't see why everybody adores it.  I would love to see a remake of this film, shorter in length and keeping the intensity of that pool sequence from start to finish.

There are parts of me which want to call it a great movie, like four stars good, which I'm sure most people do.  However there's another part of me that keeps asking, \"What's the point?\"  I know there are tons of great movies which don't have a point, but this one acts so much like it does that it leaves me baffled.  The entire film seems to be heading toward some great enlightenment at the end, and I'm not sure if it ever gets there.  Let me repeat:  I'm not sure.  It may, it may not.\n\nHere's a plot set-up for anyone who hasn't seen the film.  Newman portrays \"Fast\" Eddie Felson, an almost unbeatable straight-pool player from California who is dead set on beating Minnesota Fats, hailed by all as the greatest player alive.  Eddie shows up confident and ready to play Fats, and the two embark on a grueling 40 hour streak of pool playing.  However, this is only the beginning of the film, and acts more as an initiator of the plot than anything else.\n\nI went into this film thinking to myself, \"Which one is the Hustler, Newman or Gleason?\" What I found is that most of the characters except Gleason could fit the description.  The reason Fats is so cool (and so important to the story) is that he's way past that part of his life.  He doesn't hustle.  He just plays.   For everyone else, however, the film is about one person hustling another whether purposely or not.  The plot and all the character relationships seem to ride on the tension one would feel in a pool game, thinking, \"Is this guy hustling me or not?\"  For that reason, it is a very intriguing plot, and will keep you interested despite it's lengthy runtime.\n\nLet me first praise the acting because that's the part everyone knows about.  Paul Newman is astoundingly good in this movie, and that's not just because I want to be him so badly.  He plays numerous different moods in this story, and even undergoes a complete change of character motivation at least twice in the film.  Gleason is really good, but in this movie it might be more a case of looking awesome than acting awesome.  This is mainly because he isn't given much to say.  His lines become increasingly scarce until at the end he feels almost like an idea instead of a person.\n\nTo sum up there is a lot of really great stuff going on here, and the exploration of the themes does a really good job of making you think about it.  The best analysis is of the ideas of winning and losing, and the attitudes of the people who do both.  However, my problem is that there is a large build-up, and in the end I'm not sure what the movie was trying to tell me.  Man did it do a good job telling it though.",

I own it.\u00a0\n\n\"They Called Him Fast Eddie\"\n\nWell this masterpiece is a new favorite of mine. The Hustler is one of the best character driven movies ever made. It's easy to see how Scorsese drew influence from this with Raging Bull. The film is perfect in every single aspect. I loved everything about it. From the first epic pool battle between Fast Eddie and Minnesota Fats to the depressing and heart wrenching conclusion; this is a film that is just amazing in everything it is doing. Pool is used a backdrop for a character study on Eddie Felson, and the way everything is pulled together is just fantastic.\u00a0\n\nEddie Felson, played by Paul Newman, is a pool shark, a hustler. He has been moving around the country with his partner hustling bars and pool halls for cash. He's cocky and he's good, so he thinks there isn't anyone out there that can beat him. So he goes looking for the guy everyone claims is the best pool player in the country; a man who hasn't lost in 15 years, Minnesota Fats. Eddie doesn't just want Fats' money; he wants to destroy him. The first pool scene with Eddie and Fats' sets up the rest of the film perfectly. We know Eddie's personality and the conflicts he is going to face throughout the film. He doesn't know when to quit, be it if he is winning or losing. We wait a long time to see the reunion between Eddie and Fats and when it comes it isn't what you expect, because of the enormity of what just happened in the story. It just really doesn't matter anymore.\n\nThe acting in The Hustler is as good as you would expect. Paul Newman is at his best, with an Oscar Nominated performance. The supporting cast is phenomenal as well, especially Piper Laurie, who plays Sarah Packard; Eddie's love interest. Her character ends up complicating the film in ways I didn't see coming. George C. Hall and Jackie Gleason are also on top form, and all three were also nominated for Oscars. The cinematography won and Oscar and it is clear why, the film is beautifully shot in black and white. There's a lot of clever camera work and some amazing use of lighting and scenery.\n\nThis is a classic that is highly praised, but deserves even more praise than it has gotten. It's a masterpiece. I could watch this movie countless times and I would always be intrigued by it. The setup is amazing and when everything that happens, happens, it is devastating, but so well done that it feels almost natural; like that is what needed to happen. As of today, I have yet to see Scorsese's sequel The Color of Money(I'll be watching it real soon), but I am very interested to see how the aftermath of Eddie's life would be handled by such a talented director like Scorsese. I don't expect it to be to the level of The Hustler because I just don't think that is possible, but it should at least be interesting.",

It's a great drama with brilliant performances and a brilliant jazzy soundtrack by Kenyon Hopkins. This film tells the story of small time pool hustler \"Fast Eddie\" Felson (Paul Newman) who travels the country from Oakland, California with his friend Charlie (Myron McCormick), to take on legendary pool champ Minnesota Fats (Jackie Gleason), after playing for 25 hours straight, Eddie wins $18,000, but blows it all. As he leaves to head home, he meets alcoholic college girl Sarah Packard (Piper Laurie), who Eddie begins a relationship with. During the showdown with Minnesota, Eddie was introduced to professional gambler Bert Gordon (George C. Scott), who claims he can help Eddie win big, but after hustling the wrong people, Eddie ends up having his thumbs broken, but after they've healed, he's determined to take on Minnesota Fats again. It's a very engaging drama with some brilliant pool action, (Newman and Gleason learnt how to do pool to an almost professional level), but it's like an American equivalent of those Angry Young Men dramas that were coming out of the UK at the time, and Newman just reeks of coolness in this.",

            "content": "The Hustler was nominated for nine Oscars, winning for cinematography and art direction for a black and white film. The four main actors deservedly received nominations, although George C. Scott refused his. It was the second nomination for Newman, the first of three for Piper Laurie and Jackie Gleason's only nomination. The film deserved the recognition, but West Side Story ended up with 10 Oscars that year. Newman received an honorary Oscar in 1986 and won a best supporting actor Oscar a year later when he reprised the role of Eddie Felson in The Color of Money.\n\nThe film is quite complex. Although a sports movie on the surface, there's a strong romantic element. The story is essentially about strength of character. What would you do to get what you want in life? What if it means hurting people close to you? Is the goal worth the sacrifices? And, most important of all, how do we define success?\n\nNewman was an emerging force in 1961, but his popularity hadn't reached its peak. His portrayal of Eddie Felson was convincing. He only took the role because another movie he had committed to fell through.\n\nFelson begins the story as a pool player who is building his reputation. He wants to take on the best and prove that he's the better player. There are definite similarities between Felson's place in the pool world and Newman's status in the acting world at the time. Both were looking to make a name for themselves.\n\nWe learn in the opening scenes that Felson is a hustler. While playing a game with Charlie, his manager, he deliberately misses shots he could make. He also pretends to be drunk. The people watching are fooled and he wins $105 by betting that he can make a difficult shot and pulling it off. Then he leaves with Charlie and they look for victims in another town. This is Felson's life. He makes a living conning people who don't know that he has real ability.\n\nFelson isn't satisfied and dreams of making $10,000 in one night. In order to reach his lofty goal, he plans to play the best pool player in the country, Minnesota Fats (Gleason). Fats hasn't lost a game for 15 years and has heard of Felson. He agrees to the game.\n\nThe stakes begin at $200 and quickly build to $1,000 per game. Felson is cocky and talks a good game, but also backs it up with good play. He's soon ahead by over $11,000 and Charlie wants him to quit, but Felson says he'll play until Fats says the game is over. He doesn't just want to win, he's looking to humiliate Fats and break his spirit. After 12 hours, Felson is ahead $18,000, but still insists on continuing the game.\n\nYou can see where the story is heading. Fats freshens up, washes his hands and puts powder on them. Felson teases him on how beautiful he looks. Fats starts winning and Felson keeps drinking. He eventually loses everything apart from $200. Who was hustling whom?\n\nThe pace of the film changes after the initial meeting with Fats. Felson doesn't have the necessary stake money for another game. He meets Sarah Packard (Laurie) and eventually moves in with her. She has a limp from having polio as a child and enjoys drinking even more than Felson. The two are a good match and each has flaws.\n\nCharlie visits and we learn that he has $1,500 which was his cut of Felson's previous pool winnings. Felson is angry and decides to cut Charlie out of his life. Sarah wonders if she's next. This part of the film moves a little slowly and some viewers may lose interest, but I felt it worked and was essential to give the film depth and additional meaning.\n\nThe pace picks up when Felson meets Bert Gordon (Scott) who is Fats' manager and witnessed the first game between the two. Bert says that Fats was on the hook for the first time in 10 years, but Felson let him off. He calls Felson a born loser, but a loser with talent. He wants to be his manager and demands 75 percent of any winnings. He also issues a warning that Felson could get hurt if he wanders into the wrong pool hall and they realize that he's hustling.\n\nAfter learning a few life lessons, Felson takes Bert up on his offer. He takes Sarah for a meal and she comments that it's the first time she's seen him wear a tie. It's a sign that he is willing to change. The two go on the road with Bert and Felson plays billiards for big stakes. Billiards isn't his game of choice; he prefers pool. Felson loses initially, but something in his demeanor convinces Bert to continue staking him. He eventually wins enough for another showdown with Fats.\n\nThe final 10 minutes of the film show the second game between the two. Felson has changed since the first meeting and life has toughened him up. He's still brash, but won't take a drink while he's playing. I won't reveal who wins, but the film reflects on how we define winning and success in life.\n\nThe film has an authentic feel. The pool rooms are dark, seedy and potentially dangerous places. They match the gritty feel of the film. The pool scenes were shot in real pool halls rather than on a set. The only thing that wasn't convincing is the way the actors held a cue in a few shots. A professional player wouldn't have his head so far away from the cue and certainly wouldn't wear a jacket in case it touched another ball and caused a foul shot. But the actors did a good job and both performed most of their shots. The remainder were performed by former billiards world champion Willie Mosconi.",

The atmosphere likewise is excellent, forming a fine complement to the characters and their story.Naturally, the most fun parts of the movie are the pool-playing scenes, and they work even better than you could have hoped for.

You can see sort of a template for John Cassavetes and Gaspar Noe here - this whole nightmarish look into a world once romanticized by all these tall tales and somehow torn down by people who knew better than to actually propagate all this happy surreality that was going through films at this time.\n\nAlso, the whole pool story was kind of neat.

He moves, talks, and behaves the way you would expect a real person to and ends up creating one of the most realistic charcters in movie history.\r\n\r\nSome may say that the movie starts going down hill after Eddie meets the girl, and I probably might think so too but the acting is just so manipulative that it doesn't matter. People also bring up Jakie Gleason alot whenever they talk about this movie, honestly...why? I mean yeah he's in it and whenever he speaks you get some good acting to go with it but he's literally only in two scenes an he hardly has any dialogue.

I enjoyed The Hustler, but not as much as would have been desirable. It's interesting that a movie like this can suck in an audience even though most of the audience probably would find a film based on pool a little peculiar. And it is, for the most part.\r\nThere's no denying Robert Rossen's directorial skills in this movie. He was able to keep these pool games interesting and did a great job of balancing the drama with the game itself and the characters' personal problems. I especially liked the cinematography in this movie (side note: the same guy who did the cinematography for this film did it for Metropolis, which is a fan favorite).\r\nThe Hustler is not, I feel like, without its faults. The biggest fault is that it was really hard for me to connect with these characters. And that is saying something because I can usually find some kind of connection with the characters on screen. But I almost couldn't here. Newman's character stays extremely cocky for a majority of the film and his main love interest is an alcoholic who seems to like to complain about. Also prominent are crooked dealers, thugs who protect pool houses, bartenders with little sympathy, and a billiards player. The most likable character in the film that I could find was the enemy, Minnesota Fats. But perhaps I need to see this film again and try again with these characters.\r\nThe film gets really dramatic the more it goes, which is impressive considering this is a film about pool. Overall, I enjoyed myself, but I would have liked to have had more likable characters to invest in. But maybe that's just me being picky.\r\n7/10",

It was the equivalent of the fight scenes in Transformers: those scenes were filmed so fast that you couldn't tell what was going on. \r\n\r\nFollowing the games between Fast Eddie (Paul Newman) and Minnesota Fats (Jackie Gleason), the movie shifted into a bogus romantic story that I did not buy for a second. That romantic subplot really tested my ability to stick with the movie. I ended up stopping the movie half way through because I was so bored with the uninspiring plot. I finished the last half of the flick last night and was somewhat impressed with it. \r\n\r\nThis is not a pool movie just like The Big Lebowski isn't a bowling movie. After the first half hour, there are only one or two more scenes about pool. This movie is really about acceptance, defeat, and knowing what's important in your life. Newman and Gleason were terrific in the movie and their pool playing was fantastic. Some scenes were powerful and legendary, but the hokey romance really did damage to this movie.",

George C. Scott turns in another great performance as a manipulating money man determined to dangle the carrot in front of Fast Eddie's nose long enough for Eddie to lose everything. Scott's character personifies temptation (perhaps Satan himself) while Piper Laurie's Sara, an equally troubled soul as Eddie, offers redemption. What I enjoyed most about \"The Hustler\" is that it's a sports film where the main character's talent for the game he lives to play also blinds him and could ultimately be his undoing.

This simple story was perfectly told and constructed, and it was all around a fantastic character played by Paul Newman at his best, also Scott and Laurie's performances were absolutely brilliant. It's a film that must be watched several times to fully appreciate it and understand all its meanings and hidden little things, that are related to a lot of important aspects in real life. It's not a film that pretends to give a message... It's a really human film with very human characters, and we care for them, their destiny and their learnings are not forced, but natural and spontaneous, so in the end it's a very realistic film, and among the most solid and best done movies of its time and all time.

It shows how habitual gambling causes those to fall into debt and find their money elsewhere, in order to bet some more. In today's modern world, habitual gambling is mainly related to poker, slot machines, horses, sports, and casinoes, although sometimes in can be related to pool or billiards. It is also easier to find the gambling money, sadly from credit cards, since they are more popular today than they were in the 1960's. The acting from Newman and Piper Laurie is outstanding and the score is beautiful, maybe one the best of the 1960's. The cinematography is also very good. On the other hand, there are some technical problems with the cinemascope filming. Sometimes the movie is cut off a bit at the sides, but it has little impact on the plot or acting. Very good film.",

            "content": "A character study of an awesome proportion, it's much more than the theatrical antics of a small time pool hustler. Paul Newman portrays \"Fast\" Eddie Felson, a hustler who tours the country with his partner conning the money out of men to pay for their next hotel room, booze, and many dames. Still, Eddie has higher aspirations than to be a con man to secure a sizable nest egg, and so he goes up against the biggest fish in the pond, Minnesota Fats, played by the always entertaining Jackie Gleason. Though Gleason isn't a large presence in the film, he is the main goal for Eddie, the motivation for most of the film. It's a complex issue that rears its head in many antihero works, when the main protagonist gives up happiness for something bigger than themselves, and here Eddie is stuck between a rock and a hard place. It's truly an actor's film, showcasing the talents of Paul Newman and the very enigmatic and rarely seen Piper Laurie. Both are thrown into many scenes together with very little story and are forced to show the craggy underbellies of each of their characters. Though it drags at times, it's very volatile to watch their relationship, and the sacrifices each puts forth in order to keep Eddie from becoming a washed up has been, yet find some form of happiness. At the very end, it's no longer about the ideal Eddie holds of himself, but escaping the clutches of a system that would keep him underfoot. Besides Newman and Laurie there are some great small parts for Gleason and George C. Scott. Both come off as austere and stoic in the face of the storm but in the end they show their true colors, their lack of strength when the hero shows himself above their antics and backroom dealings. Eddie really is the entire film, falling between a mess of a human being into the hero who you root for when he's down by a large sum of money, the crowd starting to disperse, and the sweat and tears mingling on his face. Heavily Oscar nominated, The Hustler remains a classic in every sense of the word, sparking a sequel in the eighties called The Color of Money, starring Paul Newman, again as Fast Eddie, and big star Tom Cruise. I can't wait to see it in order to compare and contrast, but truly it's this film, so classic, so fraught with tension and sexual ambiguity, that will probably stay with me.",

Though the romantic subplot is supposed to earn the rest of the film its narrative relevance, and it does help to establish the characters as human, its climax feels decidedly forced and many of the interactions spawned from it make this forced conclusion all the more inevitable and therefore all the less interesting.\n\nOn the other hand, when pool is being played on film, it's sheer electricity. A few trick shots and some overconfidence go a long way in the right hands, and it's plain to see the appeal of billiards when Paul Newman and Jackie Gleason play out their mental chess match on the green felt.\n\nDefinitely worth a viewing, provided that you move directly toward the infinitely better sequel.",

In this case, pool is merely the backdrop for a finely observed portrait of honor, humanity, greed, determination, loss, and consequences.\n\nThe black and white photography looks absolutely gorgeous, creating a captivating atmosphere. The editing is well executed also, featuring a mix of dissolves, wipes, hard cuts, and brilliant intercutting that really elevates the tension during the game scenes. The music is also quite wonderful- nice jazz music that really brings the themes, characters, and situations to life: really timeless stuff.\n\nWhile all of the performances are absolutely perfect, this is truly Paul Newman's film. Gleason exudes a calm, yet menacing wisdom, Scott nails the greedy soulless vulture role (and keeps it from being cliched), Laurie gives a deep and heartbreaking performances as the moral center, and McCormick is also great as the old friend, mentor, and partner who really was a better fit than he got credit for. As I said though, this is Newman's film. This is one of those performances that will truly stick out in history, and that's saying a lot considering some of his other great roles. Newman is sharp, charming, and someone you care for, despite his flaws, no matter how big they are. His redemption is earned, although it comes at a terribly high price.\n\nI can't recommend this enough. I'm sure it already gets studied enough in film classes across the country (and rightly so), but the attention paid to it wll never be undeserved. As a bit of closing trivia, besides the earlier reference to Raging Bull, here's some more. Now, everyone probably knows that both Raging Bull and The Color of Money (the sequel to The Hustler) were directed by Martin Scorsese, but how about this one: Jake LaMotta appears in a cameo in this film as one of the bartenders-that's great.",

Stoic emperor of the tables Minnesota Fats (Gleason) plays Newman's flaws and takes him down hard, setting Newman upon an odyssey in search of his own self-worth and purpose. \n\nWhen Newman stumbles into emotionally and physically crippled shot-glass galpal Laurie, the duo are well-primed to share the scare resource of mutual human compassion - something surely not found either in a pool hall or a fifth of Scotch.

Here was a film whose strengths lie completely in its realistic and thought-provoking portrayals of personalities, conflicts, and personal relationships on various levels.  The acting is some of the best of the era and certainly groundbreaking when compared with what came before.\r\nIn some ways, the innovations of \"The Hustler\" may seem out of date now, when the works of Scorcese, the Coens, and the Coppolas have made intimacy, realism, and subtlty part of mainstream dramatic film making.  Even still, I would be surprised that an intelligent person who watches this movie and pays attention doesn't walk away thinking about their own life or society in general.

The Hustler although quite depressing and at times slow, has powerful performances, great photography, and is well directed by Robert Rossen. Paul Newman was always great at playing unlikeable characters, and deserved a lot more recognition in his early career for his acting, rather than his good looks. Overall I prefer it's sequel The Color of Money, as it's a lot more lighthearted, with a lot more pool hall action.",

            "content": "The Hustler opens up with a gripping and excellent opening montage of two men making small talk with a bar tender. They are Eddie Felson and his 'business' partner Charlie Burns. They are said to be traveling salesmen in town for a convention and Eddie is getting an award for being the fastest and best salesman. Eddie and Charlie start playing pool and betting each other that Eddie had luck making an impossible shot. First they bet at 10 dollars and then Eddie raises the stake at 20 and misses the shot. Charlie tells him he doesn't want to bet anymore and gives up on the game. The bartender after attentively watching the game decides to take on Eddie and makes a bet with him that he can't make the impossible shot. Eddie bets 105 dollars and the man decides to stake some money from his till. The next shot you see is Eddie and Charlie in their automobile with Eddie having an ecstatic grin on his face and a wallet in his hand. It is then obvious what Eddie's talent is: hustling big time money. \n\n\"Fast\" Eddie Felson is played pitch perfect by the one of the greatest actors ever to grace the screen: Paul Newman. He is a money grabbing pool hustler who loves making good hard cash to thrive on his pride. He has an overstimulated ego and is both charming and convincing with his smart quips and jokes and fast talk. Eddie doesn't know what's more important in life other than money and being the best.\n\nWhen he decides to take on Minnesota Fats (Jackie Gleason) after hearing from everyone that he is the best pool player, Eddie is ready to take on a big game knowing that he can beat him quick and flat if he plays it right. He wants to feed his ego if he beats Fats. However, he makes a huge mistake: he drinks too much whiskey and gets drunk. At one point of their excruciatingly long pool game, he has him beat at 18,000 dollars but it isn't satisfying so he decides to wager even more. He asks his partner Charlie for more money and he refuses. Finally he gives in and tells Eddie, \"be a damn fool\" seeming to know the consequences. After a near victory with Fats; he ends up losing it all. This absolutely puts a dent in some of his confidence and egotism and he holds on to the idea that he must beat Minnesota Fats. It's all Eddie can think about. It's all that matters to Eddie. \n\nThen, he meets Sarah (Piper Laurie) in a diner in a bus station. He is immediately attracted to her and decides that he must 'get' her. He finds out that she is a binge drinking alcoholic whose a bit crazed as he is. She goes to college Tuesdays & Thursdays and the rest of the time.. she drinks. She loves to drink. They start seeing each other and eventually Sarah invites him to live in her place. At first, Eddie is intent on the idea of using Sarah and to 'hustle' her but he ends up falling for her. They are perfect for each other because they are emotionally crippled and they bond together by having problems. They are both obsessive about something: him: the intensity of winning and success and her: drinking.  \n\nHe goes into business with Bert; a professional gambler ready to take Eddie for a fool and, Eddie, hungry for winning, pours  his pride and soul right into the devil himself- after being told from Sarah not to give in. This leads to her downfall when he refuses to listen to her and shoves her away. In the end, after Eddie goes through situations the hard way, he somehow wises up and learns what is meant to have true character.\n\nAll of the characters from the main ones to the extras deliver some of the finest acting. The cinematography is shot beautifully in black and white and it lends some character from the grungy shots of the pool hall to the grittiness of the characters themselves. The fact that it is shot in black and white also makes shadows appear more often hiding the actors faces much like giving them masks that they invisibly wear. The dialogue is clever and at times can be very fast paced as Newman delivers some witty comebacks that are par to the role of Fast Eddie. Jackie Gleason, although he appears in approximately 30 minutes of the film, is engaging as the calm and collected Minnesota Fats. Every second of his screen time is a delight. He plays Fats with an air of mystery and it is exciting and convincing.\n\nAll in all, it reveals a powerful message. The true nature of the film is a metaphor about corporate America and how greed played a part. It is dealing with how people were hungry for success during those times and how mentally challenging it was. The game of pool is the lifestyle that people lived. It is also a landmark film because it brought the 'anti-hero' into cinema and that was a revelation in itself. \n\nThis is what a perfect film is and Robert Rossen has created a masterpiece that should be seen by any true lover of film and anyone interested in the nature of the human condition.",

The games between Minnesota Fats and Fast Eddie were extremely enjoyable, with really nice smooth transitions and overlapping of shots to create a great sense of time passing. The quality of the pool itself was top notch as well.\n\nThe film wasn't just about pool though. It is more about having to accept the way life works. You can't live your life on dreams as in reality dreams mean nothing. You have to man up, take your shot and know when to quit.\n\nThough I did enjoy the film, I do not feel that it is a masterpiece. Original for its time maybe, but in my opinion you can't be sentemental about such things. I wouldn't go and buy a jacket that was made in 1961 as it would look dated when I wore it and probably wouldn't be as great in quality as some of the more mass produced jackets of today.\n\nOverall, I was fairly entertained, slightly gripped but felt rather emotionally detached from everything that was going on. The Hustler has had its time, but like good old Minnesota Fats, its doesn't hold up to the new improved players of the modern era.",

The great Paul Newman plays \"Fast\" Eddie Felson, a pool shark who believes he's only worth the amount of his winnings.  That is, until he meets Sarah Packard (the sensational Piper Laurie), and learns the value of self-appreciation and human relationships.  Unfortunately, for Eddie, this realization comes too late, and at a sky-high cost.  \r\n\r\nThe Hustler differs greatly from other sports movies because the ultimate victory does not come from winning, but from succumbing.  Eddie discovers that the only way he can survive is by freeing himself from the bonds of his pool playing.  He has the passion, but his pride is too great to know when he has had enough, and only through broken bones, betrayal, and death does he discover this.  And, at the end of the film, we are left to wonder if it is not too late for him.\r\n\r\nNot much can be said about The Hustler; it's one of those rare movies that you just experience.  You have to let its dark beauty wash over you to fully appreciate it, and, once you do, you won't forget it.",

George C. Scott, that guy is just intensity, great as a master manipulator who takes Eddie on to hustle for him. And finally,the great Jackie Gleason, who although only in 2 scenes of the movie, is stellar, graceful, calm, cool and collected. I get the feeling Newman may have had some of it rub off on him.

The Color of Money, with its flashy montages and awesome soundtrack, is more about the game of pool and the art of hustling.  The Hustler is more subdued and seems to be much more about the characters with the game merely setting the stage.  Honestly, I absolutely love The Color of Money and I didn't connect with The Hustler as much, but the original is still a classic that is worth watching.",

            "content": "As I've said before, one of the great joys of my alphabet project is that I get to all sorts of movies I've meant to see for years.  (And, no, we didn't do [i]The Color of Money[/i], and, no, we're not going to.  Tom Cruise, remember?)  I used to play pool a bit myself in college, though I was never terribly good.  However, I remember wanting to see this movie long before that.  Strangely, I remember the 1986 release of [i]The Color of Money[/i], and I think my curiousity was piqued then.  Even at the ripe old age of nine, I thought pool was about the coolest game going.  I couldn't play, of course, and I had no idea where I would learn.  But a whole movie about pool?  Sure, I was game for that.  And even at the time, I couldn't see that a 25-year-later sequel was the one to watch.  No, I'd want to see the original . . . someday.  However, when it came to actually choosing movies, this was just never one I thought of.  Netflix has been pushing it on me lately, but of course, I knew we were almost there.  Heck, I went so far as to check that the library even had it; if they hadn't, Netflix would have succeeded.\r\n\r\n\"Fast Eddie\" Felson (the delicious Paul Newman) is a young, cocky pool player.  I'm not sure I'd actually call him a hustler, honestly; everyone in the movie seems well aware of how good he is.  And he is very good.  Very young--Newman was 31 at the time and had credits stretching back nearly ten years, but [i]Eddie[/i] is very young, with all that signifies.  He is brash, boastful, over-confident.  Oh, he's good, too, but he doesn't know how to handle himself as a person.  He goes up against Minnesota Fats (Jackie Gleason), a great in the pool scene.  Oh, an aging great, and probably one who's not as good as he used to be.  But still great, and still well able to wipe the floor with just about anyone.  Eddie could have beat him had he not let Fats get to him.  Afterward, he hooks up with the dissolute Sarah Packard (Piper Laurie), a drunk with aspirations, and acquires Bert Gordon (George C. Scott) as a mentor/manager.  Bert thinks he can make Eddie one of the greats, if only he can tone Eddie down a bit.\r\n\r\nActually, it took me a while to recognize Piper Laurie.  After this film, she stopped making movies so she could raise her daughter.  It is her next film that most people know her for--[i]Carrie[/i], where she played the crazed mother.  However, I didn't see [i]Carrie[/i] until I was an adult, and I saw [i]Twin Peaks[/i] before that.  And, in many ways, Sarah has several things in common with Catherine Martell.  (N\u00e9e Packard, interestingly enough.  I wouldn't put it beyond Lynch to have done that on purpose.)  Neither are exactly going to win any popularity contests.  Both are a little too fond of the bottle.  Neither seem able to really connect.  Sarah wants very much to be a part of Eddie's life, but I don't think she really knows how.  I don't think she entirely knows how to be a part of her [i]own[/i] life, and it's what drives her to become the person she is and to end up as she does.  She's a second act.  She exists to drive Eddie from his failure in the first act to (it's a sports movie; this is not a spoiler) his triumph in the third.  She's a placeholder, and that's all a Sarah like this one could ever be.  The movie isn't about her.  It isn't about her relationship with Eddie.  It's about Eddie's relationship with pool, and she's not needed there.  Eddie needs the pool cue and the manager, and Sarah is just in the way.\r\n\r\nIn fact, for all its perfect sports movie ending, I think this can also be seen as a tragedy.  Eddie is a deeply flawed character, and in many ways, he's taken down by his own flaws.  Oh, yes, he comes from behind to go against Minnesota Fats again, as we all knew he would and must.  But his arrogance gets in the way, as it would and must, and he has essentially shot himself in the foot in the very place he needs to be most.  Earlier in the movie, Bert comments on Fats's style.  He accepts the challenge from Eddie, goes into the bathroom, cleans himself up, and comes out calm and ready.  Eddie would never do a thing like that.  He thinks he's ready for anything at all times.  He says he lost the first time because he got drunk, but he let himself drink enough to get drunk in the first place.  He doesn't take the game seriously, and Fats does, and that's the important difference between them.  That's why Fats wins, and it's why Eddie never really will.\r\n\r\nOh, I know.  I didn't watch the sequel; how can I know for sure that's what really happens?  How can I be sure he won't change?  And it's true that I don't know how things go for him 25 years later, when he's dealing with brash, cocky Tom Cruise.  (And, really, doesn't he essentially always play brash, cocky Tom Cruise?)  On the other hand, for 25 years, no one else really knew what happened to Fast Eddie Felson, either.  For a quarter of a century, the movie had to stand on its own and be analyzed without a sequel, without anyone being shown what became of him.  And, I think, it works very well that way.  If you have to rely on a sequel to tell people about a character, maybe you shouldn't have made the first movie at all.  Certainly you should have made the sequel sooner.  Since they didn't, I can only assume that we may speculate all we like.",

Though I haven't seen any of Rossen's pre-'Hustler' films, I sensed immediately that the man approached this material with confidence gained through extensive filmmaking experience -- there's just no other way to account for this movie's complexity of tone and outright assault on sentimentality. Maybe the only (very minor) disappointment here is Piper Laurie's character. I watched 'Lilith' immediately after this, and I feel like I detect a certain hesitancy on Rossen's part when it comes to handling female characters -- Laurie for all her screentime here gets a less thoroughly \"shaded\" treatment than Newman, and her scene-chewing might require a special sensibility to appreciate. Nevertheless, this film is so, so compelling.",

Enter Minnesota Fats (expertly played by Jackie Gleason) who is just the one to add some polish to the young hustler.  A romantic relationship with Piper Laurie distracts Felson too much for my taste, but the George C. Scott character as Fats' manager makes up for the diversion.  Scott is brilliant here?cocky and tough -- I think it is one of his best roles.  And, it is one of Newman's best roles as well?he perfectly is able to balance one that bridge between arrogant jerk and engaging sweetheart.

It was the equivalent of the fight scenes in Transformers: those scenes were filmed so fast that you couldn't tell what was going on. Following the games between Fast Eddie (Paul Newman) and Minnesota Fats (Jackie Gleason), the movie shifted into a bogus romantic story that I did not buy for a second. That romantic subplot really tested my ability to stick with the movie. I ended up stopping the movie half way through because I was so bored with the uninspiring plot. I finished the last half of the flick last night and was somewhat impressed with it.  This is not a pool movie just like The Big Lebowski isn't a bowling movie. After the first half hour, there are only one or two more scenes about pool. This movie is really about acceptance, defeat, and knowing what's important in your life.

Rather than breaking down the line between performance and self, though, The Hustler focuses on the thrill of doing something great, and the way that the whole rest of your life can seem insignificant next to that. In another way, though, The Hustler is indeed an old-fashioned morality tale, as one review I read pointed out, except that the morality is filled with shades of gray. There's no doubt that George C. Scott (excellent, as always) represents the voice of darkness, but the appeal here is far more insidious and selfish than simple greed. It's about winning, and the exhilaration of breaking someone else and proving your superiority. The fact that The Hustler goes to such dark places all while never feeling like its sermonizing is a testament to its greatness. Every major performance is a knockout; Newman and Scott are superb, but when are they not? But Jackie Gleason brings a smooth minimalism to his Minnesota Fats, and Piper Laurie is riveting as a broken woman who finds herself involved with Newman. The Hustler is a masterpiece from opening to close, and if you're worried about watching a long movie about pool, don't be; it's less about the sport than about the obsession.",

The tears are real as much as rotten the game is. But the director, Robert Rossen is concerned on both the aspects of this game, the up front razzle dazzle that can easily gather a crowd and the back stage drama that drives the fear in this high staked tense game. And let me start by the first game, the best game, of the film. Not only is it smartly calculated but also informative. For someone jumping in on this sport, for the first time, the baby steps are taken beautifully that marks both the magnitude and the rules of the genre parallel-y.Aforementioned, the game or the onstage drama can never even be compared with the emotional conflicts that the broken lead couple goes through. Now so similar are these tracks placed that you find yourself immersed in them without telling apart what's the act or who is acting. Breaking down this game, analysing it, the commentary of Paul Newman as the infamous Fast Eddie is a sight to behold. Watch him fail, love, cheat and then fail again with a drunken voice and sober body language while playing, he makes sure he lives up to the title given by the crowd, Fast.Enters, Piper Laurie, her performance is as rich and powerful as her character. Not only can she empower him, but she gets to challenge the Fast Eddie and make him slow down. As a memory, she comes in and \"makes him up\" whispering and begging in one of the finest scenes of the film where mirrors are placed in front of each other, expressing to us, their interest and intentions, coming from The Hustler, you ought to note these things, trying to catch him out, you won't though.",
