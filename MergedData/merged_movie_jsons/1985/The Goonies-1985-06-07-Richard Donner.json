            "content": "It was in 2001 or thereabouts that I watched and listened to the audio commentary track that is on the DVD version of The Goonies. Nostalgia is a wonderful thing, and seeing how the principal cast had aged (or hardly aged in Josh Brolin's case) was worth the price of admission on its own. But this is just one of The Goonies' selling points. Despite what the IMDb's ratings would have you believe, it is an immortal classic that warrants repeated and frequent viewings. It is not a coincidence that many of its cast and crew have repeatedly appeared in all sorts of productions before and since. Indeed, this was probably the first film that introduced me to the reality that the same actor will often play ten different parts in ten different films when I realised that Jonathan Ke Quan was the same brat that made parts of Indiana Jones And The Temple Of Doom so amusing. Seeing him in the video-enhanced commentary of the DVD nearly two decades later was a surprise and a half.The film revolves around a group of children and adolescents who live in the poorer, less trendy part of a beachfront town. Unlike an episode of Barney, every member of this principal group is given a background and a string of differences from their castmates. You will not see the teenaged Brand responding to the same situation in the same manner as the ten year old Mikey, and that is where a major part of the film's strength is derived. The only weakness in the characterisations is with Martha Plimpton and Kerri Green, who join the adventuring boys a little way into the film. Exactly what they are doing other than giving the character of Brand something similar to himself to bounce his more adult-oriented lines from is anyone's guess, but they do work in their limited capacity. It is just a pity that Chris Columbus' screenplay did not give them a little more to do, other than defuse one fiendish trap towards the end of the ride.Speaking of fiendish traps, the adventurers journey from one puzzling location to the next with barely a stop for breath. It works because unlike similar adventure films where the director expects us to be impressed by a fiendish-sounding name, the specific places that are visited by the Goonies have function. The bone piano shown in one such sequence, for example, would appear in the nightmares of children learning a regular piano for years after the film's theatrical release. It also gives Corey Feldman a good chance to act out a character who speaks very fluent Spanish. And while I am on that subject, who could forget the immortal scene early on in the film where Mouth deliberately loses something in the translation when Rosalita is shown around? But the prize for scene-stealing goes to John Matuszak, who plays the unofficial eighth Goonie, Sloth, with a weird aplomb that may well scare the willies out of parts of the intended audience. But then, in 1985, scaring the intended audience a little was considered a healthy part of making a film for those in the age ranges depicted here.They say you cannot have a good protagonist without a good antagonist to bounce off. Robert Davi, Joe Pantoliano, and Anne Ramsey provide antagonists so good that they utterly hose the rule about not working with animals or children. The Fratellis work so well here because they are working with children. The late Anne Ramsey played her part so well that the mere thought of watching her in anything scared the willies out of me for years. Nowadays, as I have fully realised the mechanics behind film for some years, I am keen as mustard to see some of her other work in such pieces as Throw Momma From The Train (now there's a title that brings images to mind) or Meet the Hollowheads. That a performance can produce two entirely different reactions in the same person at different stages of their life should tell you all you need to know about its quality. Robert Davi and Joe Pantoliano are somewhat overshadowed here, but the manic, cackling quality of their introductory act also left quite a lasting impression.You might have noticed that I have so far only mentioned the special effects in passing while heaping praise upon the acting. This is because unlike films such as the recent Star Wars prequels, the effects complement the acting rather than overshadow it. From what I am able to tell, all of the effects in The Goonies are practical, and some of them quite inventive. There is no use of blood squibs, which may disappoint some viewers, but there are enough mechanical sets and air vents to fill three films. Some of these effects did not turn out so well and were cut from the final film (the squid sequence being the most famous example), but unlike a lot of films that depend on special effects for a crucial element, everything shown in the final cut is in perfect sync here. Suspension of disbelief is never an issue, which is just as well considering some of the preposterous things that roll by the screen with a certain nonchalance.I gave The Goonies a ten out of ten. Like Superman or the original Lethal Weapon, it shows that Richard Donner knows how to make a classic. Now that it is twenty years old, it stands forever as a relic of a time when the world of those under the age of eighteen was far less oppressive. If you have not introduced your children around the age of ten or greater to its joys and moments, then shame on you.",

            "content": "Anyone who grew up in the 80's will list the Goonies as one of their favourite films, or at least look back at it with a misty eye.It had everthing you could want, thrills, spills, pirates, booty, adventure, freaks and bad guys. I just wanted to be a Goonie or go on a Goonie style adventure. Even the place where they lived was cool. A big old house in a picturesque bay town. You don't get houses like that in England. The only interesting thing you would have found in my loft would have been a dead pidgeon.Then there were the Goonies themselves who just seemed so cool. Data's gadgets and smart mouthed ..erm.. Mouth.We are first introduced to them one by one in the fantastic introductory sequence. The bad guys of the piece, the Fratellis, organise a jailbreak in a huge 4x4. In the process of doing so they speed past every member of the Goonies, introducing their character traits. Then they all get together at the leader Mikies house and just doss around for a while feeling sorry for themselves, because a property magnate wants to but there little town and turn it into a country club (although the bay looks like it would make a poor golf course, but hey). So this is the Goonies last day together and they have to do something about it. And don't they just.What follows is like a comedy Hardy Boys crossed with a game of Mousetrap. Some of the set pieces are genius (the pirate, One eyed Willie, had a penchant for elaborate traps to stop people pinching his booty) and the sets are equally inventive. The gang get themselves into various scrapes with the traps, or the Fratellis or both and somehow always come out on top.Richard Donner's direction is always brisk, the young actors performances are superb (specially the fantastic 'Chunk'), the senior cast is very good and the dialogue is chock full of hilarious lines.I must admit I look back at it through rose tinted glasses. I was in awe of it when I was a kid, and now when I watch it, it reminds me of my childhood and all the things that was great about it. I cant fault the Goonies, even now. I still believe it is the perfect kids film.I am probably preaching to the converted, but if you havent seen the Goonies, go and buy it now! And if you don't like it, what the hell is wrong with you!?!?!?",

            "content": "Every kid has imagined what it would be like to go on great and glorious adventures. Pirate ships, police chases, treasure chests full of gold and surrounded by human skeletons with patches over the eyes, the inherent excitement in the possibility of a cavernous wonder world beneath the very streets where they live. The Goonies is about a group of kids who have grown up together and are about to be torn apart because their parents are being forced to sell their homes. In the attic of one of their houses (Mikey, played by Sean Astin), they find an endless supply of fascinating things - treasure maps, paintings, cryptic writings in strange languages. They find a map that sounds promising, and decide to see if it has any value, hoping to be able to find enough treasure to prevent their parents from losing their homes. Not only was The Goonies a brilliantly written, directed, and acted movie, but it was also so much FUN! The adventures of these kids through the underground world, while being chased by the despicable villains known as the Fratellis, are fascinating to watch. The Goonies is a great cinematic experience. It has everything that anyone who was ever a kid could ever want. Even the elaborate sets are very convincing. The sense of adventure and hope that are presented in The Goonies is very uplifting and inspiring. The lovable characters are perfectly developed and endlessly entertaining. Many of them, particularly Sean Astin and Corey Feldman, delivered the best performances of their future careers right here in this early adventure film. This movie can be enjoyed by virtually anyone, which is one of its best values. It is truly timeless, and it should not be missed.",

            "content": "The first time I saw THE GOONIES was at a friend's house right when it was a \"new release\" on video. After the best times I had in my life watching it, the friend established a \"Goonie\" club for the fun of it. Perhaps your past childhood memories would have been the same, too! While the movie is a tad heavy on the stupid foul jokes, it does have the imagination of willing to trek around for some perilous adventures, plus a few spooks. There possibly was never a movie like this providing tons of fun and laughter during the time. The characters and their personalities were most original, including \"Data\" and his supply of gadgets, and \"Chunk\" with his obese but likeable image (love that \"Truffle Shuffle\"!). But \"Sloth\" easily stole the show with his own likeable personality, a goon with the weirdest face I've ever seen in my life! Just think of how fun it is to discover lost treasure, when you know it's only fantasy. Four key things come to mind with THE GOONIES: pirate ships, teenagers, the Frattellis, and Cyndi Lauper. They're actually \"good enough\" and they go together in this memorable journey! Kudos to Richard Donner for bringing me a movie that I've seen over 100 times and never stop enjoying! After all these years, I'm STILL waiting for a sequel!HIT PUREE!!!",

            "content": "Treasure hunts.  Who doesn't remember digging under the porch, in creekbeds, hollowed out logs, etc to find the buried treasure you just KNOW is hidden there somewhere?  The Goonies is a fun-filled ride right back into our youth where treasure hunts are no longer a thing of the past.I absolutely loved this movie.  It was just so much fun to watch when I was a kid and just as much fun when I watched it again as an adult with my own kids.  Of course the movie has moments of predictability, and no, the villains aren't all that intimidating...they're actually quite moronic. But that only adds to the charm of this movie as well as its comedic value. Although there are lessons peppered in (don't judge by appearances, right vs. wrong, etc), overall, The Goonies is a wonderful exploration of childhood friendships and imaginations...from Data and his many scientific creations to One Eyed Willy and his pirate ship.There isn't a character in this movie I didn't fully enjoy watching...you have the dim-witted, evil Fratelli's, heavy-set, melodramatic Chunk, Data with his \"booty traps...that's what I said, booby traps\" galore, the odd-looking but loveable Sloth, and Mouth with his, well, Mouth.  Those are only a few...there are many more.  A lot of great lines come from this movie along with memorable moments (the Truffle Shuffle).  I've seen The Goonies about a hundred times and I STILL enjoy watching it over and over again.\nThis is absolutely a pure, fun-filled movie to enjoy with your kids, grandkids, nieces and nephews, or simply by yourself.  Hang on and enjoy the ride!  The Goonies earns a solid 5 out of 5 stars!",

            "content": "Just prior to graduating with a degree in Film Studies a lecturer asked us, \"So what's your favourite film now?\" Whilst my peers spouted out Goddard films and obscure German expressionist shorts I sat quietly thinking; my favourite film has been My Favourite Film since I was seven... So when it came to me and I mumbled \"The Goonies\", I was expecting scorn, ridicule and possibly minor injury, but instead was met with concurring shouts and whoops and cries of \"Hey you gu-uys!\" from the rest of the class. You see this is the unifying thing about The Goonies; mention it in a room full of twenty-somethings and they'll whell up and utter \"Sloth loves Chunk\" or adopt a harassed Chinese tone \"Thats what I said...Booty traps!\". And if that room happens to be a pub, several chairs will scrape back and semi-inebriated grown men will lift their shirts, shake their bellies and revel in the truffle shuffle. People may say it's an Indiana Jones wanna-be I think that is the defining beauty of it all. When we first watched The Goonies it was like watching our dreams come true on screen! We'd loved seeing Indiana's adventures and escapades and in The Goonies we saw kids like us actually doing it! They got to be just like the mini-Indies we imagined ourselves to be in the playground. But its not just the adventure that makes us love the film, we love those Goonies themselves. They were like our friends. We got annoyed with them sometimes, and we wanted to protect them, and we laughed at their jokes and cheered when they had a brilliant plan. Identifying with those kids was what we loved and why, as adults, we quote them and 'become' them when talking about the film. I still want to be like Andy, having a perilous adventure sliding down tunnels and facing the bad guys on a huge pirate ship... but of course also making time to kiss Brand AND Mikey! I also think that this is why Goonies 2 is such a relevant and exciting concept. We've all grown up together and I'd love to see how the guys are doing now...I just hope it doesn't disappoint... So if you've not seen it do it right now, and if you have kids sit them down, hold their hand through the scary bits and enjoy! They'll thank you in twenty years time!",

They don't make movies like this anymore... of if they do, its children hurting other children (Cruel Intentions... etc).  I do miss that from the 80's... during that time you can have an adventure film that relies on humor and \"monsters\" without an overt display of violence and sex like in todays \"PG13\" movies.  Anyway.. I rant...\nI love all the characters from The Goonies.  Chunk is my fav (truffle shuffle, hostage crisis, Dead things Mikey! Dead Things!, and when he starts spatting off Hebrew when he is captured by the Frattellis).  Its amazing to see the changes in Josh Brolin (Brandon) from back then to his performances today.I have this movie although it must be a edited version because I heard there was an octopus scene in the uncut version.. Haven't seen it yet.I heard they were going to make a sequel.. My question.. Why!?! Don't ruin a good thing. Leave it alone and walk away.  Resist all urges for a money-grubbing \"typical hollywood second release\" scenario.I love the music from The Goonies as I am a huge 80's music fan.\nLastly, the scene is beautiful.  I live in Portland, Oregon and have traveled to Astoria several times.. It is a pitty to know that the last time I was in Astoria, the house featured in the movie was run-down and looked to be vacant.10/10.",

I was a little surprised honestly that this movie isn't on the top 250, because it seems like everyone agrees with me that this is just a plain excellent movie. After all, it is directed by Steven Spielberg, when has he ever misled us? I think this movie is sort of like a time capsule, because you can tell that it was made in the 80's, but it'll forever remain a treasure that will pass on from generation to the next.It's about these pre-teen boys who are about to loose their houses to the local rich guys who will turn their houses into a golf course if their parents don't come up with the money that's wanted. When Mikey, the leader of the Goonies, gets his hands on his father's treasure map that belongs to his museum, he shows his friends, including his older brother, Brandon, that maybe this could be their last adventure to find the treasure and pay off the rich guys! Brandon, his girlfriend, Andy, her friend, Steph, Mouth, Data, Chunk, and Mikey come together to find the treasure. But it's gonna be hard when on the run Fratelli's want the treasure as well and will try to get there first! The Goonies are just so lovable and I would always recommend this not only for the family, but for yourself as well. Because it has great lines, exciting scenes, and just a fantastic story. Not to mention all the future stars who are in this film like Sean Astin, Corey Feldman, and Robert Davi. There are a few slight goofs that you notice off the bat, but you get past them because it's just such a charming movie.10/10",

I will admit Richard Donner's direction was a little too leisurely and there are some parts in the middle half that are too slow and falls dangerously into cloying sentimentality. Still this childhood favourite of mine is great fun from beginning to end. No matter how thin the story is, it has an intriguing premise and Donner and Chris Columbus keep the action going strong and the adventure fun enough for the younger audience. The script is funny and affectionate, the music is memorable and in general the special effects are good. The image of the pirate ship was mind blowing and the cinematography and costumes are very well done. The performances are very good; while Sean Astin and Corey Feldman are the standouts of the child cast, it is Anne Ramsey who steals the show as Ma Fetali in a effortlessly over the top and deliciously evil performance, very like Diana Dors in The Amazing Mr Blunden. All in all, a fun adventure yarn. 8/10 Bethany Cox",

Although I'm usually a sucker for films involving the search for long lost treasure, this noisy, chaotic, poorly acted, desperately unfunny, unexciting waste of a big budget had me wishing I'd never bothered to see what the fuss was all about.When the most comprehensible lines of dialogue in the whole film come from a mentally disabled, drooling freak called Sloth and a character played by Anne Ramsey, then I know I'm in for a rough time. Quite why Spielberg and Donner opted for such an obnoxious collection of unruly brats for this film I'll never understand, the kids' incessant unintelligible screaming seriously grating on the nerves. Until now, I've always had time for Corey Feldman and Sean Astin, but here they are mostly unbearable; even worse are Ke Huy Quan as amateur inventor Data and loud-mouthed tub of lard Chunk, played by Jeff Cohen, both of whom deliver utterly charmless performances.If, like me, you've successfully avoided seeing this film for several decades, I suggest that you keep on doing so and save yourself the disappointment.",

            "content": "Working from a story by executive producer Steven Spielberg, screenwriter Chris Columbus (\"Gremlins\") and director Richard Donner (\"Superman: The Movie\") here fashioned an appealing old-time adventure for kids and the young at heart. A bunch of rambunctious kids in a small town are due to lose their homes to stereotypically sleazy developers. But in the attic of Mikey (Sean Astin) and Brand (Josh Brolin), they find a map that will supposedly lead them to a legendary pirates' long-lost treasure. They then embark on an underground adventure with no small amount of peril to endure. All the while, they're pursued by a family of criminals including Mama (Anne Ramsey), Jake (Robert Davi), and Francis (Joe Pantoliano).Although this viewer didn't really see this in its entirety until he was himself an adult, it still worked quite well, thanks to lively filmmaking from Donner and company, a cracking pace, an assortment of elaborate \"booty\" traps, and an engaging bunch of kid actors, some of them making their feature film debuts. It's a true marvel of production design (by J. Michael Riva), set decoration, and cinematography (by Nick McLean, who also cameos as Mouths' father). The score (mostly by Dave Grusin) is also appropriately rousing, perfect for a movie that involves a bit of swashbuckling at the end. This is spirited entertainment with a healthy amount of humour; Mouths' instructions to Rosalita (Lupe Ontiveros) and Chunks' confessions to the Fratellis are perfect examples. Columbus even works in a reference to \"Gremlins\" at one point.The talented ensemble also includes Corey Feldman as Mouth, Jeff Cohen (who opted not to continue in the acting business) as Chunk, Kerri Green as Andy, Martha Plimpton as Stef, and Ke Huy Quan as Data, the youngster who sees himself as a junior James Bond complete with (malfunctioning) gadgets. Top adult character actors and actresses (Ontiveros, Mary Ellen Trainor, Michael Paul Chan, Gene Ross) turn up as well, with an especially endearing role for pro footballer John Matuszak as the deformed Sloth, mistreated but kindhearted. It's too cute when his ears wiggle, or when he utters his memorable refrain of \"HEY, YOU GUYS!\".Although this is clearly an 80s product (complete with a fleeting appearance by the Cyndi Lauper music video for the theme song), this only adds to the appeal for anybody who grew up during that era.Seven out of 10.",

            "content": "I find it interesting that while no film has been made to be a sequel to The Goonies, 3 different video games were derived from this film. Not surprising in that the film itself resembles a video game in that private little world a bunch of kids called The Goonies find beneath an abandoned seaside restaurant on the Pacific coast.The head of the gang is young Sean Astin and acting like a den brother is older sibling Josh Brolin when he's not trying to get something going with Martha Plimpton. Among the rest of the gang is Kerri Green, Jonathan Ke Quan, Corey Feldman, and Jeff Cohen.The kids have an old map found dusty and forgotten in the attic of Astin and Brolin. But also at the same time Anne Ramsey a current Ma Barker has busted one of her Rhodes Scholar sons out of the local jail and they find the abandoned restaurant a most convenient hiding place. So while the kids hunt for the treasure of legendary pirate One Eyed Willie, another group of kids chasing them, the bad guys chasing them all and the law looking for the bad guys, it's all a merry chase.Going below that restaurant the Goonies find an adventure that would be the envy of Indiana Jones filled with all kinds of traps and devices to kill or at least discourage. Obvious that Steven Spielberg borrowed liberally from that film of his to use for this one with juvenile appeal.The Goonies after over 30 years is still great family entertainment. What could be better than watching kids on a pulp adventure they only read and dream about.Kids of all ages.",

            "content": "Mikey Walsh and his friends face separation as they all prepare to move away as developers buy up their properties.  The only hope is that they can raise enough money to keep the house.  When they stumble across a map relating to the long lost treasure of pirate `One-Eyed' Willy they go after the treasure but it leads them to tunnels under the hideout of the Fratelli family who are on the run from the law - the Goonies must get the treasure before the Fratelli's can find it.I haven't seen this film for many years and, when someone told me it was their favourite film I couldn't really voice an opinion (or at least, not an informed one).  Having now seen it myself I must admit to be a little at a loss to understand the sheer amount of cult love it gets; I can only put it down to us all loving something from our childhood in a guilty sort of way! The film is enjoyable but no more than that, and I wasn't sure who it was aimed at: it seemed to be too scary for young children but far too childish and silly for older kids.  The plot is a sort of Indiana Jones for children and it works reasonably well despite an excess of flaws in several key areas.The plot is silly and feels very disjointed, I was never totally sold on the treasure hunt nor the threat of the Fratelli's. It varies wildly between sickly sentiment (`I'm gonna take care of you', `you're my best invention' etc) and overblown action that doesn't really excite because it is so unrelated to reality.  The effects can be forgiven due to the age of the film, but really it should have been more dramatic considering.  The comedy also swings wildly from silly slapstick to some very funny lines; the whole thing is very rough around the edges and it is quite refreshing to see this in comparison to so many more `clean' and shrink wrapped kids movies - at least this has a touch of anarchy about it!  That said, I didn't laugh that much although I did enjoy the rough edges.It is funny to see the cast now, although few of them have really gone on to become adults who did great things.  Astin is a little too drab for the film, his role has to carry the story whereas the others get to have more fun.  Feldman, Cohen and Ke Quan all get to enjoy themselves and are good value despite occasionally being more silly than funny.  The adult cast are much better and it is a shame that they aren't used that well - Davi, Pantoliano and Ramsey are all good and I would have preferred to have had more laughs from them.  Like the film itself, it's all very rough round the edges in terms of performances, which is both a good thing and a bad thing.Overall I have not been won over to the extent that the army of Goonie fans are.  I enjoyed it even if I couldn't really get into either the comedy of the silly action.  It has it's moments and is probably best used to start and wean children off more childish stuff without making the jump right into adult films.",

It owes most of its sensibility to Spielberg. It's essentially ET with a pirate treasure rather than an alien. I do have a minor warning for really small kids.

This was something I could relate to as a child always seeking to escape the normal town environment and go on adventures into the nearby woods and hills.The plot is reasonably good but is really just a device to kickstart the adventure and provides a reason why it happens.What makes the film great are the Goonies themselves. This movie stars a collection of excited and energetic children. Richard Donner captures distinct characters and some wonderful interaction between them all. That is no mean feet when you have up to seven of them sharing a screen and continuously firing off humorous one-liners. The standout performance is Jeff Cohen who is effortlessly charismatic and funny as Lawrence \"Chunk\". This type of group is a cliched product of its time, with a leader, a joker, an overweight target, and an ethnic stereotype, but it's about the highest quality example of it you can find.The production values are excellent and stand the test of time, which you would expect from a Spielberg/Donner/Industrial Light and Magic collaboration. The underground sequences are wonderfully atmospheric and the pirate ship is a masterpiece of set design.I was an 80s child and remember The Goonies being almost a cultural movement on the schoolyard due to its popularity. Around about Christmas 1985 you could frequently hear \"Hey you guys!\" echoing through corridors and witness multiple overweight boys being ritually forced to do the 'truffle shuffle'.",

As we can predict, they decide to seek for\nthe\ngold and precious stones to help their parents who are about to be\nexpelled\nfrom their homes because they can't make ends meet and also because some\nwealthy men want to put their houses down to build a country club on it's\nplace.

They would always be there for each other, no\nmatter how deep their problems are. Even a rich girl, Andy, is accepted by\nthe group, in a very politically correct act, where no distinctions are\nmade. The scene in which the guys are stuck in a hole, is very touching\nand\nreally digs our sense of aid.Richard Donner directed this movie and another famous director, Chris\nColumbus wrote the screenplay, based on a Steven Spielberg's story. Matt\nSweeney was responsable for the special effects and the main theme ( They\n'r\ngood enough ) was written and performed by Cindy Lauper.After the film, none of the kids became famous actors.

The action speaks for itself , and there's a lot of it . Juvenile honors go to later famous duo : Corey Haim, Corey Feldman , and the endearing fatty boy Jeff Cohen . Imaginative and rousing musical score by Dave Grusin in John Williams style . Top-notch FX , as well as colorful and evocative cinematography by Nick MacLean . Lavishly produced by Steven Spielberg was reportedly on set many times throughout the course of filming . Nicely directed by Richard Donner , an action cinema expert with numerous and prestigious titles (Superman , Assassin , Conspiracy theory , Timeline , Lethal Weapon saga, 16 blocks ..).

            "content": "Yeah, I was a kid in the 80's decade and this was one of the first films I've seen since I was about 8, I loved it then and I still love it now. This film is one of my personal favorite films in general.Everything about this film is just perfect (in my book)because it succeeded where most family/kid films fail to do for me which is entertain me, the film kinda manifests that dream we sometimes have of escaping from our usual existence or boredom for a while and going on some wild and fun adventure. It's one of those family/kid movies done the right way where it's not watered down, insult our intelligence, or even pulling off gimmicks just for the sake of it.I really love the set pieces their all practical and built, from the caverns and pirate ship you can really see the effort they put into it. I love the traps which were inspired by the Rube Goalburg cartoons, just seeing how they work is a joy and looks plausible if not entirely probable (some principles work). The music is great that theme song from Cindi Lapper is one of my favorite movie themes. It has good action and suspense that is in constant motion you almost can't take a breath, my favorite is of course the infamous music challenge where the characters have to play a skeleton piano (which looks like something out of heavy metal cover art), that part kept me on the edge of my seat constantly thinking don't you dare hit that wrong note. But the humor is great there are physical gags and verbal humor that beautifully go together, the things you see and hear can be just hilarious, like seeing Brent ride a tricycle sort of the equivalent of the clown bike.But what really makes this film of course are all the characters themselves. There are a lot of protagonists and usually this isn't always a good idea but this film managed to make it work because they all have unique distinctive developed personas where you know them enough but also have a factor of relatibility, I even like that these kids (as well as three teens with them) aren't stereotypical or look like pretty boys/girls(which is a look I can't stand) but looks and feel like regular people. What makes them standout more along with the film is the sense of relatablity, making these protagonists feel more accessible. I even like the location that this film takes place since my aunt, uncle, and cousin live in Oregon state, as well as the neighborhood they live in, looks likes the type I lived in. And all these characters are geeks (I mean that in a good way) and underdogs which I like those kinds of characters because that what I and my friends are, weren't really the kind of kids that were popular but had a lot to offer. I even like their motive for their adventure and it's not for greed or glory which I always believe are the wrong reasons for adventure but simply to save their neighborhood by being demolished by some greedy butt head land developers.As for my favorite character, I'd have to say it's Mouth (played brilliantly by Corey Felman) whom is true to his name. His character is practically the interpreter of the adventure. I just simply love his charisma, he's just funny a real wisecracker, just has some of the best lines in the movie and delivers them well like \"Jerk Alert!\".The others are great Data whom has as many gadgets as \"Batman\". Chunk whom despite a big kid, isn't stereotypical he also has some great charisma and lines, he might seem a bit clumsy but by it's nature it's actually dumb luck which really works to his advantage.Brent and Mikey like the back and forth between them how the brotherly relationship is portrayed, kinda similar with the character Pete and Pete in the TV show \"The Adv of Pete and Pete\". Mikey being the younger one is the most adventious and daring, he's smart but naive. Brent is more grounded, I like the fact even though he's a man of muscle he's not a jock he's an underdog doesn't have a car and probably not much luck with ladies, he gets the most grief from his brother but he goes along (probably also out of boredom) since he has to watch over him even if Mikey is leading him to the road to Hell.Well that's all I have to say, \"The Goonies\" is a treasure.Rating: 4 stars",

            "content": "Loud kids, always talking over each other, going on a treasure hunt coming in contact with two criminals, their mentally deformed(mistreated and humongous)brother, and bossy mother..that's pretty much the plot. Asthmatic Sean Astin and his big brother(always working out)are about to lose their home and their neighborhood friends decide to look for the treasure of an old pirate whose map they find in the attic. To be honest I was inspired for some reason to watch this after revisiting STAND BY ME for the first time since I was a teenager. THE GOONIES is raucus and busy, with kids bucking for their time on screen. A cast of child actors, some of whom would become successful adult actors(particularly Josh Brolin, with Astin would hitting paydirt with RUDY and the Lord of the Rings movies), I'm not sure how director Richard Donner escaped unscathed without a stint in the nuthouse. Entering into my thirties, I have been on a nostalgia trip and this movie, truth be told, was more fitting to when I was 10, now as a father I deal with kids like these and so I shutter instead of necessarily grin with affection for these wild brats. Oh, I'm no curmudgeon, these kids are near and dear to my heart--I was their age when this movie was made and had a little brat in me as well, but I'd be lying if I didn't admit that a lot of the noise become a bit of an annoyance. Not too irritating, mind you, but putting together this many kids, crowding scenes with overlapping dialogue, can be a bit much from time to time. The energy and enthusiasm, though, is viable and rubbed off on me yet again, as always..I can not deny that. As you might expect, the Spielbergian schmaltz is laid on thick with the whole foreclosure subplot and how the Goon Docks kids ban together for one last great adventure hoping to save their home from being knocked down. Who'd of thought that caves were underneath the city containing booby traps with falling rocks, floors that fall away, skeletons galore, and even a pirate ship--those Warner Bros sets are utilized to the hilt. Even One-Eyed Willie makes an appearance. Kids should eat this up for generations to come even if we ourselves eventually grow up and find it less effective. Sloth and Chunk(with food always on the brain) are quite a pair, Mama's misbegotten(she dropped him on his face twice after giving birth to him, hence the facial malformations and child-like sensibilities)son becoming the hero at the end. Astin is the driving force behind the hunt, always motivating the pack to pursue the grand prize which might save Goon Docks. Feldman, as usual, is the obnoxious wisecracker whose use of the Spanish language is pretty funny, particularly what he tells the maid who can speak no English. I've got to be honest--Cyndi Lauper's titular song for the movie is awfully catchy.",

Romping along at a fair old click, the film never stops to pause for breath, thus dragging the viewers along for the ride.There is no expense spared with the production (the sets are delightful) and the cast are mostly engaging. There's some minor annoyances, such as the girls being adventure caricatures, but itches are easy to scratch if you have engaged from the off with its fantastical charms.It's a film that once loved in childhood should hopefully stay far beyond into your adult years. A junior Raiders Of The Lost Ark perhaps? Maybe not, but still one wholly satisfying action adventure experience, one that's standing the test of time for many of us with our fondly nostalgic glasses perched delicately on the end of the nose. 8/10",

The kids are out future. Whatever expression you choose, it can be applied to this good natured romp that sees modern day stars in their opening roles.Sean Astin, who leads the way splendidly, would soon be hailed to fail in the Lord of the Rings trilogy whilst Josh Brolin would take up award winning roles in No Country for Old Men.But of course this was the time before such accolades and so we settle for more subdued but more fun style acting in a charming adventure that has the energy and mystery of an Indiana Jones adventure, if not the sophisticated mythology and independence.The opening scenes see a charming if highly unrealistic prison breakout that starts our adventure off in thrilling fashion. Followed sweetly by the sharp and memorable introduction of The Goonies and you'll be forgiven for smiling from ear to ear. Jonathan Ke Quan's introduction is one to not be spoiled, but watch out for never has a young actor made such an exciting appearance.As we have a political message thrown in and some sloppy information encoded for historical emphasis, we are finally under way with the group setting off on an adventure to recover the treasure of One Eyed Willie. The idea sounds absurd, and in many degrees it is. In context the whole idea of getting treasure to save their house seems far-fetched and a last ditch attempt but thankfully we can almost ignore the obscurity of this goal and simply sit back and enjoy the thrills and comedy spills along the way.There are some marvellous set pieces juxtaposed with stunning semiotics of piracy. The boat itself is a symbol of true fantasy gold and the sweeping set montages do justice to the story's potential. The action and adventure side, whilst Indiana Jones obstacles, is nonetheless fun and exciting and true gold for the younger viewers.When combining two such different genres in comedy and adventure it is easy to give one away to the other but somehow writer Spielberg and director Donner maintain both in equal balance, which is a stunning achievement given the complexity of different personalities of The Goonies and the massive adventure on hands, which makes this a wonder in itself.Where The Goonies falls is it's lack of realism in context. There are too many close calls and just in time moments and there seems to be lacking any real consequence, maybe because the characters are kids to give the viewers a more relaxed viewing.But this 1985 release is visually stunning, balancing the genres on equal length and when the laughs come, they really do. It's no Indiana Jones substitute but it is a smash",

The end is stupid and without any kind of joy, the villains are not really menacing or frightening as I thought they would be, they are just dull. The film doesn't have the guts to take it self seriously any time. And I really hate irritating fat children in movies that just can eat and scream! If you want to experience proper 1980's adventure films you could see 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' or 'Stand by Me' instead.Richard Donner proved that he can direct entertainment with \"The Omen\" but \"The Goonies\" was a big mistake, with horrible bad uninspired direction - all the acting was worse than it could be and the film didn't have any atmosphere or mood at all.

A grab-bag of ideas, each one a surefire audience-pleaser (if you're under 12).

Chris Columbus is already popular with children's films and writes a good screenplay. The jokes are very tongue in cheek and laugh out loud. Many of them have adult connotations but nothing overtly vulgar. 'The Goonies', like many great movies of the 80s, has nostalgic value for me. While watching it, I felt like a child living back in the 80s (well, the good part of the 80s) and be a part of their adventure. I enjoyed the many pop-cultural references to the 80s and the energy. It was also funny to see all these actors like Joe Pantoliano, Josh Brolin, Martha Plimpton and Sean Austin who were so young. The kids were very likable even thought they were a tad too loud at times. My favourite character is Data played wonderfully by the very young Jonathan Ke Quan. Kerri Green and Martha Plimpton have some hilarious scenes. Josh Brolin is great as the protective older teen brother. Only a little more than two decades later when he would finally get his due. 'The Goonie' is purely classic children's adventure and a treat for those who were kids in the 80s and 90s.",

And the supposed great adventure our young heroes go on is not even particularly interesting.

A very simple plot but that would be OK if this treasure hunt was exciting. It is not. The kids find many obstacles in their way. There are booby traps to get through and some hapless villains on their tail. It all becomes repetitive rather quickly. Make your way through this trap, then that trap, then another trap. All along the way spout terrible dialogue and in many instances have many kids spouting that terrible dialogue all at the same time. These kids talk, and scream, over one another for two hours. Get me an aspirin. The acting is completely unconvincing. Child actors are capable of great performances. Not in this movie. We get grating performances from the whole lot of them. Sean Astin, playing the leader of the group, is probably most annoying of all though Ke Huy Quan, who you may remember as the incredibly annoying kid from Temple of Doom, runs him close.

I guess it was a good thing that my Friday Night zoom party decided that they would watch this one. Mind you, it was my recommendation, and I certainly get rather anxious when people agree to watch a movie that I choose, but it certainly went down quite well, so I glad about that.The film is set probably in Oregon, or someplace like that, but it is a seaside town and it is certainly quite rainy. Then again, considering that there does happen to be a pirate involved, I'm more inclined to believe that it is in New England or some place like that. Anyway, the local country club is expanding, and buying up all the property, and a bunch of kids look like they are going to be split up. However, while searching the attic they discover an old map to a buried treasure, and as such a treasure hunt ensures.It was suggested that there was a lot of elements of Home Alone in this film, namely because we have this group of eccentric crooks, one of whom has just escaped from gaol. The kids stumble upon their hideout, namely because the treasure map leads them straight there, and while attempting to escape, they discover a hidden passage, full of traps, that eventually lead them to the treasure. Yeah, so it is basically an adventure film, and is also a bit of a comedy as well.I can certainly see where Stranger Things got some inspiration from, since there were also a lot of elements in this film that appeared in the series. However, this certainly isn't a scary film, just rather a bunch of kids, and of course the teenagers that have been caught up in the adventure as well, attempting to find their way out of the cave system, and also attempting to find the treasure. Of course, there is a bit of a debate as to what they want to do, but of course the treasure hunt overides everything, particularly since they are attempting to get their house off of the country club.Another thing that I noticed is that while it is generally a kids movie, there are certainly some subtle elements that would no doubt appeal to adults, such as the scene with Michelangelo's David at the beginning of the film, and of course the guy who speaks fluent Spanish that acts as an interpreter for the house maid. Yeah, there is certainly a lot of things that work well in this film, and in a way it has still aged relatively well too. Another thing, as I have mentioned, it is one of the great 80s films that do bring back a lot of memories.",

There's a cause to fight for, humour in buckets, adventure, terror, crime and romance all encapsulated in a great little story and with performances from some of the best child actors of the eighties.As a child of the eighties myself, it will always have a little nostalgic place in my heart that will remind me to revisit it and often. One of those films that you should definitely share with your own children, grandchildren, nieces and nephews and anyone else who hasn't seen it basically. It sounds like a cliche, but they really don't make them like this anymore. Mostly because they wouldn't get away with it.It is a fantastically funny film with slapstick that doesn't hit you too hard, as well as jokes of a more subtle nature, with something that everyone can enjoy. I love the cartoon sound effects that they used.I can't help but wonder how much of this film was improvised or just what the cameras caught while they were still rolling, as it looks like the cast has a fantastic time making it and there are some bits that are just too brilliant to have been scripted.One of the only issues I have with the film, which I have carried with me since I first saw it, is Sloth. That guy still scares the bejesus out of me even now. I mean, why did they have to make his ears wiggle like that??? To be honest the entire Fratelli family are pretty scary. You certainly wouldn't want to meet them in a dark alley.The only other flaw that I can find, which is true of many films of a similar kind, is that they all shout and talk over each other and it makes it impossible to hear what's going on.Apart from that, this film will always be a classic and should be a marker that all children's adventure flicks should be held up against.",

Central plot regards a group of kids seeking out a treasure and a pirate ship. First issue regards the villains who are presented as juvenile morons for the family audience. Rather than be threatening and intriguing villains they are merely thugs and loud mouths. Many of the characters are interchangeable with the exception of Sean Astin who leads the group and has the spirit of adventure. Corey Feldman plays the rebellious friend very confrontational. Josh Brolin plays the standard older brother without personality. John Matuszak has the physical features to play Sloth who is kept chained up and eventually befriends the children. Kerri Green plays the ever familiar girlfriend material who will not realize it until the third act. Speaking of which, the climax and some of the humour is overly corny with images of decaying bodies that may be much for the intended audience. Director Richard Donner has created such great films as Superman: The Movie and The Omen. Here he presents a well made juvenile Indiana Jones adventure that may excite the imagination that we all had at that age as we sought out our own treasures. Score: 6 \u00bd / 10",

But they really could have done without that whole \"...we're on an adventure and it'll be ruined if we go up there with them...\" sequence.Ah, and of course there's the octopus - or rather, there wasn't in the original movie, even though Richard \"Data\" Wang (Ke Huy Quan) mentioned it. I bet that when the movie first came out, people were wondering \"What octopus?\". Apparently, some TV versions include the octopus scene. When I saw \"The Goonies\" on Joe Bob Briggs's show \"Monstervision\", he explained that the octopus scene was edited out of the theatrical version.All in all, there's nothing particularly bad about this movie; just a few unnecessary scenes. We now may recognize Francis Fratelli as Joe Pantoliano, who co-starred in \"The Matrix\", \"Memento\" and \"The Sopranos\". Mama Fratelli was of course Anne Ramsey, aka Danny DeVito's mother in \"Throw Momma from the Train\". The kids were mostly brat-packers, so most of them seem to have disappeared since \"The Goonies\".It's weird to think.

            "content": "The Goonies is right behind Stand By Me for best coming of age feature in the eighties. Stand By Me touched me in a way that I have never been touched before. It was an iconic, moving, intelligent picture than gave all four of its characters a believable history and insane likability. Not to mention, everything was raw, realistic, funny, touching, and sincere. It seems The Goonies borrows a few of the characters from the film, like Chunk who is clearly a lot like Jerry O'Connell's Vern in Stand By Me, but it makes them a lot more relatable for the youngsters and a lot cleaner and brighter in their personalities.The film centers around many, many kids that nickname themselves \"The Goonies\" who live in the \"Goon Docks\" of Arizona. Because of a growing country club, the house they all live in is heading towards foreclosure. The gang, made up of an optimistic asthmatic, a chubby coward, a mouthy youth, an Asian inventor, an older brother, a cheerleader, and a geeky female adolescent, discovers a map in one of their friends attic which tells the story of \"One-Eyed Willy\" and his untold amounts of treasure. The crew sets out to find the map and have one last Goonie adventure before they are separated.One of the many problems with this adventure are The Goonies themselves are being hunted by the Fratelli family, a group of thieves that are looking to steal treasure. The mother, or the boss, of the group is played by Anne Ramsey, an amazing and underrated character actor. She plays one of the creepiest, most taunting villains I can remember from a kids movie.It may sound like the teens are a bunch of caricatures, waiting to evolve into something bigger, badder, and more film-sustainable. But the characters are draw to look like mannequins, when in reality, they are portrayed effectively by great child character actors like Sean Astin, Jeff Cohen, and Corey Feldman. I think my favorite character was the lead, Mikey (Astin). His optimism reminded me of my own - as a young kid of course - and his overall cheery nature made him a very efficient protagonist.Obviously, the film is trying to mirror and duplicate the Indiana Jones for a younger, more pint-sized audience. It succeeds. There's enough wit, soul, and entertainment in the script and in the antics to keep fresh, while at the same time pay a thrilling homage. The sequences of peril are excellent, and the music always excites and compliments the scenes in true, Spielbergian style.The scene that has the best music is late in the film when the gang is sliding down a long water-slide that's not meant for sliding. It's complimented with exciting music, but also captures the innocence of doing something so bad then so good. It's difficult to explain, but you might realize it when you see it. Think of doing something bad, then doing something very fun, exciting, and somewhat dangerous. Like after you break something, you dart up the stairs jumping over obstacles and dodging everything like a stuntman.The Goonies is nothing but a fun, Spielberg adventure of epic proportions. This is also one of the coming of age films that furthers my sadness of the fact I have not had anywhere close to an adventure like this, nor have I had the loyal friends of this caliber. I believe that's because my life isn't a nostalgic eighties film.Starring: Sean Astin, Josh Brolin, Jeff Cohen, Corey Feldman, Kerri Green, Martha Plimpton, Jonathan Ke Quan, and Anne Ramsey.

            "content": "And it's a fitting coincidence that it stars Ke Huy Quan, the kid who loved Indy one year before, and Corey Feldman who didn't want to be called crazy, the year after.But it's not just a matter of chronology, \"The Goonies\" marks a climactic point in the 80's with all the craze for youth-oriented escapism and more-or-less comedic adventure movies, released the year of \"Back to the Future\" and when Steven Spielberg and Chris Columbus combined their talents again to make \"Young Sherlock Holmes\". I just watched this film a few days ago and looking at \"The Goonies\" again, I was thinking of that moment where Watson and Holmes are about to ride a sort of flying bicycle for the first time, a scared Watson asks \"where have I gotten myself into?\" to which Holmes answers \"the adventure of a lifetime\".The more I think of this sublime exchange, the more I appreciate its resonance in the very context of the 80's, and more specifically when Richard Donner directed \"The Goonies\". Movies were all about 'adventures of a lifetime' in that glorious decade, inaugurated with the iconic images of Indiana Jones escaping a giant boulder, children flying away from the Police to get \"E.T\" back home and so forth. The Goonies are like Elliott's friends playing Indiana Jones, living an adventure whose quest might not be as noble as in \"E.T.\" (it's a treasure, something tangible like in Indiana Jones) but it does carry some symbolic value like living the last adventure before one of them leaves the town, enjoying youth, or less pompously: to have fun. And even if some of them, like the big brother Brand (Josh Brolin) or the two girls (Kerri Green and Martha Plimpton) wonder where they've gotten themselves into, they stick together nonetheless and enjoy (once again) the 'adventure of a lifetime'.And I think the reason why the film isn't as humanistic as \"E.T.\" and borrows more from the 'Indiana Jones\" franchise is because Spielberg didn't want to make some sort of hymn to childhood, which explains why for the sake of realism, there's a lot of profanity and many moments where kids talk and shout at the same time and it's barely audible. Despite some similarities, we're far from the universe of Tom Sawyer and Hucklberry Finn where the two boys quietly wandered on the Mississippi River and where Injun Joe was really scary. In \"The Goonies\", there's no room for 'drama-realism' or 'dreamy-humanism' and Spielberg and Donner inject as many archetypes as possible. Sean Astin is Mikey, the voice of reason, the leader, the one who needs the treasure the most so his Dad can keep their house so it's not just about greed. He also respects the Pirate One-Eyed Willy, Mouth is the comic relief, Data is the nerd and Chunk (Jeff Cohen) is the fat insecure kid.And there are also a bunch of Italian-American gangsters, the Fratellis, played by Robert Davi and Joe Pantaliano, and Anne Ramsey's as their scary-looking Mama, the Fratellis contribute to one of the best moments of the film, the opening chase sequence and its catchy theme, and the hidden (and hideous) third brother Sloth (John Matuszak) would have felt like a gratuitous addition if his relationship with Chunk wasn't so touching and poignant. Only two outcasts can understand each other, the Fratellis and the Goonies were already outcasts, but when you're the fat, clumsy, talkative and misunderstood kid of the bunch (no way to go through life), maybe it takes a criminal Family's offspring who looks like a cross between Quasimodo and a Garbage Pail Kid to become your friend. In some weird twisted way, there are some Elliott-E.T. vibes in that relationship between Chunk and Sloth but I wonder if Steven Spielberg didn't mean that in a self-parodying way.Indeed, \"The Goonies\" is action-packed, filled with chases, screams, long slides, booby traps, romantic kisses in the dark, scary cadavers and skeletons, it's perhaps the most blatantly and shamelessly adventurous film of the 80's involving kids before a change of settings in 1986 with \"Stand By Me\". In Rob Reiner's film, the kids' quest will carry more macabre undertones, they go to find a body and get some publicity, but in the end, they choose the wisest solution and call the Police, it's the ultimate coming-of-age film. Kids grow up, their maturity also conveys the feeling of a lost innocence, emphasized by the epilogue that gives away the fates of the protagonists, and not all of them are pleasing. The 80's slowly slide toward the 90's realism so \"The Goonies\" is the last hurrah of kids-oriented movie, the same year where Marty McFly visits the past, where we get to the past of Holmes and Watson, the Goonies visit the past of their town Astoria, and fix one thing or two in their lives.In a way, it's like Spielberg revisiting his own childhood and translating his memories into the film. Of course, his perfectionism was more palpable in \"E.T\" which had a personal meaning and he directed it himself. There's some naivety in the way kids behave in \"The Goonies\", trying to sound too cool and too smart at the expenses of realism, but the film is so fast-paced and so oblivious to these subtleties that we ready to accept it's not \"E.T.\" and enjoy it for what it is. And maybe that's the secret of its everlasting appeal, more than 30 years after, improved by the nostalgia effect, the same than can make us enjoy a film like \"Police Academy\". So, \"The Goonies\" might have too many 80's actors, too many recognizable Spielberg's tricks, hell, even a Cindy Lauper song, but maybe these dating factors are the film's saving graces, making it forever a part of the most fun cinematic decade.\"Never say die\", like they say",

The rating is quite high, many people have seen the movie, there's been a video game inspired by it, ... and there's Spielberg who produced and wrote the film. Then it MUST be good?  Think again! The truth is that this is an inconceivable mess. Whoever thought this was funny, should be locked up and put away forever. There's not even a chuckle during the whole length of the film. And I can assure you that this film seems to be going on forever! So is it entertaining then? Surely not. This film is as boring and stupid as it gets. Imagine a bunch of irritating children( all with some sort of speaking disorder, it seems), yelling their way through the \"story\". Think of PROBLEM CHILD, LOOK WHO'S TALKING TOO, even the POLICE ACADEMY FILMS... get the picture? Not yet? Then picture three idiotic villains (does Joe Pantaliano even recall his \"performance\" here?), a search for a hidden treasure (it takes a while to figure that out)and some sort of friendly \"monster\" (that reminded me of THE TOXIC AVENGER!), all of which seems awfully out of place in this film. Of course, this is a children's movie, I can understand that. And, like so many others of its kind, it's stupid, very stupid. And I guess you have to be a kid yourself to enjoy such films. But \"stupid\" doesn't actually mean \"bad\". There are many enjoyable, clever and sweet \"family films\". But this loud-mouthed, dumb mess isn't one of them. Oh, and there's actually a scene in which there's being referred to GREMLINS, another Spielberg production from a year before this one. Check out that one instead, at least there's a whole lot more cleverness in it than here. And don't say that it's too scary for children, THE GOONIES is ten times more scarier. And boring.

Joining him is Data (Jonathan Ke Quan), who is handy with gadgets, Mouth (Corey Feldman), who always lets his mouth get the better of him, and Chunk (Jeff Cohen), a bungling chubby kid who is famous for his 'truffle shuffle'. Meeting up with them later is Mikey's older brother Brand (Josh Brolin) and two girls, Andy (Kerri Green) and Stef (Martha Plimpton). The map leads them to a seaside restaurant that appears derelict, but they soon find it occupied by wanted criminals who may just be after the loot themselves.So here it is. When we started the Childhood Memories Project, The Goonies was always high on the list to watch, and why wouldn't it be? Virtually everyone from my generation and the generations around me who owned a television when they were a kid would have seen this film many times, and, like me, loved it. It seemed to be constantly on one of the channels, and is the type of film that you can watch from any point and instantly become engrossed. It has everything a kids film could need - pirates, lost treasure, adventure, boys comradery, monsters (well, Sloth). And it has a sad element that could upset any child - the threat of moving away to the unknown and leaving those childhood friends forever. These things make the film timeless, and a true childhood classic.This was the first time I'd watched the film since my youth, and the first thing that struck me was how dark the film is. There's some scary stuff in here (if you're a kid!) - skeletal bodies, a frozen corpse with a bullet hole in his head, a huge deformed monster chained in a dark room, and Martha Plimpton. There's also a lot of swearing. It's not the type of thing you get in modern day kiddy s**t. Those films are too busy breaking into song or filling the screen with flashy effects to stop the X-Box and iPhone generation from losing concentration for 10 seconds and checking their f*****g Facebook account. The Goonies gives us the real dirt, danger and sense of adventure that came with childhood, where an abandoned railway line would provide a whole day's entertainment (in my case).I also found it extremely moving. I'm not sure if it was the nostalgic man-child in me that was transported back to a time where getting back home in time for dinner was the extent of my worries, or if it was from the many beers that I had. Either way, by the end I got all soppy. The Goonies is by no means a brilliant film, but the legacy it left behind it and the sheer scale of it's cult, nostalgic fan base is there for a reason - because it's the perfect childhood adventure film. And for that reason, and for the fact that I've never felt two hours fly by so fast, I'm giving the film five stars. This is the film that gave us the truffle shuffle and 'hey you guys!' after all. I just hope younger generations get to see it and are capable of appreciating it after being brought up in a world of Pirates of the Caribbean sequels, Miley Cyrus and Michael f*****g Bay.

            "review_title": "A Family Film That's Not Afraid To Get Dark",
            "content": "\"The Goonies\" is one of the greatest, most treasured films that the 1980's had to offer. It had everything that you ask for from exciting set pieces, fun-filled action, dead bodies, over-the-top characters, kids risking their lives to save their houses from being demolished by greedy contractors, evil criminals who want the treasure for themselves, and even a lovable, disfigured giant who becomes a likable hero. It's a family film that isn't afraid to add dark scenes in the narrative and that is why kids and adults love this movie very much. It's made for kids, but doesn't go so far as to insult your intelligence. It's a shame there's not more movies like this anymore.Located in the bay area of Astoria, Oregon also known as the \"Goondocks\" by the local kids that live in the area, a greedy contractor is on the prowl getting people sign a petition to have their houses demolished so that he can build his golf course on their property. The idea of losing their home does not sit well with the locals especially the children Mikey (Sean Astin) and Brand (Josh Brolin). The other kids in the area which includes fellow Goonie members Mouth (Corey Feldman), Chunk (Jeff Cohen) and Data (Jonathan Ke Quan) are also facing the same situations themselves unless they get the money to save their home or else they may end up parting ways forever.Their luck starts to change when the gang stumbles in Walsh's attic to discover the map that leads to the treasure of the sinister pirate One-Eyed Willie who's ship was trapped for centuries. Mikey believes that if he and his friends can find the treasure to One-Eyed Willie, and retrieve his belongings, it could save their homes forever. Joining them on their quest are other local kids including pretty girl Andy (Kerri Green) and brainy Stef (Martha Plimpton), the kids are determined to finding the treasure and bringing back to their families, but what they didn't know was that their quest was not going to be as easy as they had anticipated. Posthumously, One-Eyed Willie who was a very skilled engineer, kept people from taking his treasure by setting up booby traps that are very capable of killing anyone who isn't cafeful, even professional explorers like Chester Copplepot who died trying to get Willie's treasure. But our heroes have mangaged to escape death on numerous occasions, but that's not the only danger they're in. A group of evil criminals The Fratelli's led by Mama Fratelli (Anne Ramsey) and her two sons Jake (Robert Davi) and Francis (Joe Pantoliano) are also on their trail and will stop at nothing to get the treasure, even if it means to hurt them or worse. They even kidnap Chunk and chained him next to a gigantic, hidious beastly fellow named Sloth (John Matuszak) who eventually became his friend and joined the gang to save them and get revenge on his family after years of abuse. It's sure an adventure film that will make for a great story to tell their kids and grandkids when they get older.The Goonies themselves may look like the typical average kids you see everyday in our lives, but in reality they are anything but. They all have rather unorthodox qualities aqbout them that make them unique. You have the leader Mikey as the optimist and the most determined to get the treasure even if it means putting he and his friends in danger. You have Brand who's the jock of the group who is annoyed by his brother while at the same time underneath still cares for him. Then there's Mouth who is the troublemaker of the group who's fluent in Spanish (which helps because Willie's map is in Spanish), but also tell Spanish housekeeper Rosalita (Lupe Ontiveros) that the Walsh's are sex-addicted drug fiends. Following that you have Chunk, the eternally hungry kid who's also clumsy, but shows he has a heart, especially one he befriends the misunderstood Sloth. And then there's Data, an Asian kid who loves to invent things and is capable of setting traps that the Fratelli's also fall for. And to round it off you have pretty girl Andy who's Brand's girlfriend and Stef who's Andy's friend while also love to throw verbal jabs at Mouth which he delivers back. But no matter what we all like them and though their antics are over-the-top we root for them all the same.But the thing I like about this film that really makes me enjoy watching this movie is the feel-good moments. Sure it might be ironic and coincidental and predictable at times, but just knowing how they barely escaped and saved their lives which became more important than any gold diamond, their friendship is priceless. When Rosalita was looking through Mikey's marble bag and found expensive stones worth billions which led to Mr. Walsh tearing the petition it was moment of pure joy. And when Sloth broke the chains and became emancipated from his family's torment, the feel-good factor was off the wall.Even though I'm older now as I speak this is truly a time honoured classic that any movie lovers can enjoy. It reminded me of my childhood past. And though I may never get it back again, when I watch. I get teary in a happy way because this truly brings back the kid in me that has been lost for almost four decades.",

            "content": "As a child of the '80s and '90s, I don't know how I missed \"The Goonies\" when I was a kid. Was it because it wasn't science fiction or fantasy, the genres I preferred when I was at its target age? I don't know.It's one of those movies that I think is enhanced significantly in the memory of childhood. I doubt anyone who sees it for the first time as an adult would rate it higher than a 6 or 7.The movie is something to do with kids whose house is going to be taken from them by some rich guys who want to build a country club. They find a pirate map in the attic and follow it through some caves to find the treasure. On the way they meet a gang of bad guys led by the inimitable character actress, Anne Ramsey, and other great character actors Joe Pantoliano and Robert Davi. I guess they're just in the movie because it needs a bad guy.The kids in the movie - apparently calling themselves \"Goonies\" because they live in the \"goon docks\" area of Oregon - are the usual assortment of colourful characters whose personalities - and usefulness to the plot - can be summed up in one word, and indeed, they are - \"Mouth\" is the lippy kid, \"Data\" is the genius whose clothes conceal inventions, \"Chunk\" is the fat kid. And of course, there's the Average Joe protagonist, because all kids see themselves as average and need someone to identify with.Most of the movie takes place in caves where the Goonies follow a treasure map. This is a tedious location for a kids' movie, and the movie really seems to stall when they get there.In fact, most of the locations in the movie are boring. At least there's a pirate ship at the end. But for most of the run time, I was just waiting for it to end.",

Over the decades I've heard people just a few years my junior rave about this as if it were an Indiana Jones or a gremlins or the like. So finally at the ripe old age of 46 I've had a look. I cannot believe the hype for this. The director's overriding instruction to the actors, seems to have been, shout and scream and say your dialogue whilst everyone else is saying theirs. That will keep the audience thrilled and excited. It gave this member of the audience a headache. The storyline is weak, the characters 2 dimensional and the script is dire. I kept thinking these kids must be off their Ritalin. It was like an onslaught of annoyance. I get that people are nostalgic for movies they saw when they were kids. I still think jaws is one of the greatest films ever made, whereas people younger than me can't abide the plastic shark. But really, I'm amazed that so many people still seem to rate this.

The story is just so fun. It's the sort of thing that as a kid you wish had happened to you, and as an adult it can still capture you and make you feel young again.The characters were really fun, with brilliant chemistry between them.

            "content": "As a child, I loved The Goonies. The movie seemed to be a rite of passage for every kid growing up in the 80's, 90's, and even today. The movie appealed to me because it has treasure hunts! I mean, what kid does not want to go on a treasure hunt? As an adult, I was ready to dive back into the world of nostalgia. The end result? In terms of Spielberg-produced adventures, I did like Gremlins more. That does not mean I disliked this particular movie or anything. It is a fun, highly-energized adventure film with all of those Spielbergian trademarks we all come to know and love. I think I outgrew the main characters. They had wonderful chemistry and acted like normal children, but perhaps I was a little annoyed with them.Steven Spielberg did not direct the movie, only merely produced it. He oversaw the production, however. Spielberg was one of those innovators who introduced \"horror films for children\", the trend that grew massive starting in the 1980's. He took horrifying concepts and made them kid-friendly, and more fun. These films, while still a little scary, allowed children and adults alike to enjoy the film. Like Gremlins and Ghostbusters, The Goonies is one of those films. This film also was influenced by the first two Indiana Jones films. You see the falling boulders and the sharp spikes. As for the children themselves, I did see ET influences. For the most part, I think the influences were incorporated rather well into the film.The film was helmed by Richard Donner, who previously directed one of my favorite superhero films, Superman. This shoot was a new challenge for Donner because he worked with kids. He later mentioned the positive and negative aspects for working with children on set. In a sense, he was a teacher for these kids. I think Donner did an excellent job, because making these sort of films is not easy. As for the screenplay, it was written by Chris Columbus, who makes a living with these kind of scripts. Columbus did understand past Spielberg works pretty well.Mikey Walsh (Sean Astin) and his brother, Brand (Josh Brolin) live in a family that is being forced to move in order for a new golf course to be built...unless money is somehow raised to save their home. Mikey happened to stumble across a treasure map depicting a vast fortune hidden away. The two brothers along with rest of the \"Goonies\" gang; Chunk (Jeff Cohen), Mouth (Corey Feldman), Andy (Kerri Green), Stef (Martha Plimpton), and Data (Ke Huy Quan), set out to recover this fortune. Their adventure takes them to the evil Mama Fratelli (Anne Ramsay) and her three sons including the disfigured Sloth (John Matsuzak) who decides to help them. In order to find the treasure, they need to find a way past the Fratellis. Goonies never say die!The cast is filled with young blood who will go on to have excellent careers; namely Sean Astin, Josh Brolin, Joe Pantoliano (one of the Fratelli brothers), and Martha Plimpton. As for this particular film, the performances are fine. The kids definitely have energy to no end, but it can grow stale after awhile. The chemistry between the kids is great and it really feels like they have a bond, which I absolutely loved as a kid. I get why everyone loves Chunk, but I felt his character is too melodramatic and a little annoying. The Fratelli's are moronic villains, but there is a reason why they are everyone favorite's villains. Anne Ramsay, although a little over-the-top, is really fun to watch.Once The Goonies start a-rolling, the action and the thrills do not stop. Some people point out that this film has more to it than most action films. Whether or not that is to your liking will depend on your tastes. The film is loaded with special effects. Some are good, and some...not too good. The music plays well with the film as Cyndi Lauper actually delivered a hit song thanks to the movie. As a child, this film will satisfy your every dream. It has pirate ships, evil cooks, and the sense of adventure. As an adult, this will all depend on your patience. Although I cannot consider the movie a magic-inducing phenomenon it was when I was a kid, I still enjoyed this fast-paced adventure.My Grade: B",

            "review_title": "Spoiler alert: This film is awful",
            "content": "The Goonies is a headscratcher to me. It was created by some of the best filmmakers in Hollywood, Directed by Richard Donner, Produced by Steven Spielberg, and written by Christopher Columbus. I love much of the work of all listed, but I find The Goonies is one of the worst studio movies ever made. It is the ultimate in Hollywood schlock. Some will likely accuse me of not liking it because I do not have a good imagination. I can only say I disagree. I would argue those who like it do not have a good sense of things that suck.Goonies is a never ending series of very loud, annoying and preposterous situations that will have you rolling your eyes more than a Felix the Cat clock. First and foremost, the continuous dialog and general noise in this movie is enough to make it a form of torture. The audio is pegged at 10 from the opening and never once lets up. Secondly, the gaps in reality: it's just a kids film you say? Movies like Raiders of the Lost Ark and Star Wars intelligently made a kids genre entertaining. Ditto to The Bad News Bears, Home Alone or anything Walt Disney Produced. This film bashes you over the head with every clich\u00e9 and impossible situation imaginable. The characters are all one dimensional and unimaginative, most all of them have an adult wit and a snappy response for every thing posed to them like a kid from a bad sitcom, and I cannot stress this enough, all of them talk nonstop, mostly simultaneously, for the entire film.I am puzzled that Goonies is in the IMDb Top 500. I honestly believe it deserves to be on the IMDb bottom 100. My guess is people who like it saw the film when they were young and relate it to happy, nostalgic times in their childhood. If that be the case, be prepared for a shocker when you discover how poorly it aged. In regards to its genre, it may be found inappropriate by some parents, though maybe not by today's standards. There is a lot of dirty language and disrespect to authority in general. I suppose some people think it's cute when kids cuss, are disrespectful to their parents and do what ever the they feel. I think it ruins the fun of a kid's movie. On a side note; The Goonies also teaches kids that crappy film making is expectable behavior. It is not.The tech specs are fine, even very good at times, and the locations dramatic, but the story is absolutely preposterous. Kids alternately acting like stupid kids and then like genius adults, inventing and executing ridiculously impossible solutions to their problems, which frequently make no sense at all, (down this hole must be the only way out of this basement - but then why did one kid just climb out a window?). And what was with director Richard Donner's perspective of reality? Kids are yelling when they need to whisper, yet still not being heard. A teen age jock is bound by a single rap around his arms with one of those stretchy chest exercise springs? That same jock is unwillingly dragged by a car because the driver is pushing down on his hand as he holds onto the car door? There are a bevy of Batman the TV series escape opportunities - if you are going to kill a kid, just push him into a pool of water and walk away, assuming he's dead for sure. In one scene a kid is paralyzed with horror as he awaits the reveal of a monster, then suddenly, for no apparent reason, forsakes said viewing and starts making out with his girl friend. I will give you that certain liberties can be taken both in film making, and especially with this genre, but surely SOMETHING has to make sense or you lose your audience. Right? Hmm, a famous saying of P.T. Barnum comes to mind. On second thought, forget everything I just said.",

I think they're going to lose their home for some reason but I didn't really get a moment to really appreciate what was on stake impressed upon me.Then when they discover a treasure map and they've barely read it before they're out the door like it's nothing. But even after all this rush, it takes a long time for anything interesting to happen. They try and fill the already over stretched running time with sitcom style jokes like how the fat kid likes food or how one kid misleads the monoglot hispanic woman.We get very little impression much interesting is going to happen in what seems, for its first half, to just be some kids, a map and some bank robbers. It picks up eventually with some beautiful sets but boy, does this picture take its sweet time with everything.And everything in this movie is...sloppy. The way the dialogue is formed and how the scenes are visualized...I don't have the vocabulary an actual film scholar would have but I got the impression the the writers and the director were all a bit whatever about the whole thing.I like the child actors, they bring a lot of energy and charisma but they have no idea what enunciation is. I'm not one of these people that needs everything to be in RP to understand english, I speak in RP myself but I struggled to follow them.It's got heart, and I won't say it doesn't have its moments (though half as many as it seems to think it does) but there is a tragic sensation of a real classic that just didn't get the handling it deserved.It's aged quite horribly. If you haven't seen it, even by '80s movies standards it doesn't really hold up, your kids most certainly will not have the patience for it, I know I didn't and I saw it today, in my 20s.At least there is a cute girl and an even cuter one.

The \"characters\" are so unrelentingly stupid and irritating, the \"script\" is one bad sequence after another and loaded with some of the worst dialogue I've ever heard in a mainstream film. It is a career low for everyone, if you ask me. You know, I saw lots of movies when I was a kid (not in the 80s) and while I can think back with fondness on some of them, I'm also not living in my past - and I can recognize that while it may have been swell when I was five, while it may hold some nostalgia value, I can also recognize a stinker when I see one from my past.But that's the deal with 80s children - they don't grow up. Same with 90s and the 2000s. Nobody grows up - thirty is the new ten and the world is not a pretty place. The one redeeming feature of The Goonies is its Dave Grusin score, which is terrific.

I cannot recommend this to you as something to actually watch, but it is a terrific example in emotional manipulation.Start with the notion that you want to be as effective and manipulative as possible, which means you want to be cinematic. Then go to the notion of the most cinematic of notions, noir. It has emerged from film, is unique to film, and it works.The characteristics of noir are simple. It is a world apart from the world of the viewer, but it has representatives of the viewer in it. The world is characterized by a capricious fate that toys with humans. Randomness and traps. Odd coincidences that simply seemed arranged for the benefit of the viewer. In mature versions there is a hint that the presence of the viewer is the reason that fate is arranged so cruelly.Now imagine these three kings of pop brainstorming on a successful kiddie noir. It would have incompetent parents, and tons and tons of boobytraps. This would have to be faced by the kids with only each other to rely on. Each kid would see himself in some one of the carefully chosen characters.And there will be folds. The young kids will be folded into the older dysfunctional family. And the movie we watch will be folded into a pirate movie. In fact a specific Errol Flynn pirate movie.Hey, it works, in the sense that it sells tickets.

The film is quirky about a bunch of kids who may be spending the last time together before their homes are torn down and made into a golf course for the country club of Astoria. It had a great cast especially young Sean Astin who really changed from being Mikey to the Frodo's pal in Lord of the Rings Trilogy 15 years later. Who would have thought that Josh Brolin who plays his older brother, Brand, would turn out to be Barbra Streisand's stepson? Martha Plimpton still acts as well. I don't know what happened to Kerri Green who played her friend. Corey Feldman had a difficult adolescence, his estranged relationship with Michael Jackson, his drug problems, and family problems as well. Jeff Cohen went on to college and I don't know what happened to the kid who played Data. Anne Ramsay has a great role as Mama Fratelli with her two sons, one who just escaped prison, and the other as his accomplice. She has a third son, Sloth, but he is locked up downstairs. The beginning sequence is always worth watching over and over again. The film shows lovely sequences of Astoria, Oregon which I have yet to visit but plan too sometime in my life. Anyway, the film was dedicated to Mama Fratelli and the actress who played her. By the end of Ramsay's life, this film and Throw Momma From the Train finally gave her recognition. Ramsay was battling throat cancer. She had tongue removed between films and she was a beloved character actress. I love this movie. It reminds me of my childhood and I wished that children would have that kind of childhood today and that's why I'm glad that I don't have children because I can't imagine them being in today's environment.",

            "content": "\"The Goonies\" is definitely a cult film and people who like it don't just like it...they think it's the best film ever! However, my bet is most of these folks were kids who saw it in the 1980s. I was in my 20s when it debuted....and I noticed it was marketed towards kids, even more so than most of Steven Spielberg's productions, so I avoided it. And, after seeing it tonight....many years later, I realized I was right...I just wasn't in the demographics the studio was seeking out with this film. With the stars being kids, the jokes being crude, the adventure plot, and the logic often being tenuous at best, it clearly is NOT a film marketed towards adults. And, I am sure this added to the appeal of the film to kids...that it was THEIR film and adults just didn't get it!The film stars a group of four kids and three teens. The kids in particular seem like caricatures...not real kids. You have the fat kid, the brainy computer nerd Asian kid, the smart aleck kid who can somehow read 17th century Spanish and the 'normal' kid who is the hero. They are tropes more than kids. As for the adults, most of them in the film are crooks or jerks....as this IS a kids' movie and kids LIKE films where adults are the enemy...at least that's how it was in the 1980s.The group stumble upon a treasure map in the normal kid's attic and the map takes them to the hideout for three awful criminals. The kids manage to sneak past them and explore the tunnels beneath the house for pirate treasure...assisted by the teens and a weird guy named 'Sloth'. Eventually, the crooks realize what's happening and it's a mad dash to the treasure.As I said before, the film is marketed towards kids....with plenty of content that might have worried parents back in the 80s. Murder, a surprising amount of bad language and a scary plot...just the sort of stuff kids love! However, as an adult, you watch this and notice all the illogical plot elements and cheap cliches....stuff kids generally don't notice.My rating is a 2 for adults and 8 for younger kids. Adults will find it very rough viewing....even painful at times. It will also upset many parents because so much adult material is in the film. Kids will LOVE the adult material and like that it casts kids (albeit incredibly unrealistic ones) as the heroes. Overall, I'd give this one a 4...but strongly advise adults (unless they saw it and loved it in 1985) to avoid it like the plague.By the way, if you do watch, note when Anne Ramsey yells at the kids \"The only thing we serve is tongue!\". It's ironic, as soon after she made the film, Ramsey lost much of her tongue due to cancer surgery!",

            "content": "What is one's childhood without The Goonies? It's a childhood that misses out on unquestionably one of the most purely enjoyable and unbridled joyous adventures ever committed to screen and a movie that to this day stands the test of time thanks to it's witty script, fantastic child actors and a story that unlocks the adventurer that hopefully dwells within all of us.Coming from the great mind that is Steven Spielberg and directed by Superman/Lethal Weapon helmer Richard Donner The Goonies was and is the perfect melding of the Hardie Boys come to life and an adventure that is impossible not to enjoy. Much of the film's success lies in its un-tapping of what is essentially a longing in all of us young and old to discover treasure whether figuratively or metaphorically and the journey that our young \"Goonies\" take is the embodiment of this.Lead by the wise beyond his years and future Sam from Lord of the Rings Sean Astin as Mikey the group consists of the teenager older brother Brand (a young Brolin), wisecracking Mouth (an on form Feldman), poor old fat kid Chunk (Cohen), Asian inventor extraordinaire Data (Temple of Doom's Ke Quan) and female tagalongs Andy (Green) and Stef (Plimpton). This group presents one of the most fully formed and memorable gangs in cinema history a gang that can sit proudly along with the Breakfast Club, The Sandlot gang or any other iconic group of young adults. The gang's journey is given heart thanks to the meaning behind there want of riches, the want to save their homes and there friendships from being torn down by greedy land developers. The team behind The Goonies literally struck gold with the casting in this picture with a young cast many a film would die for and who are strongly supported by one of the nastiest screen family's your likely to see in the form of the Fratelli's who lock up their own disfigured brother \"Sloth\" (played by former NFL participant John Matuszak) who becomes a star of the movie.All the great casting in the world would not of made The Goonies such a classic if it were not for the playfulness the film finds in its traps and contraptions. The film is brimming to life with practical and special effects that hearken back to an almost teenage version of an Indiana Jones fable with skeletons, spikes, waterslides and pirate ships littering the scenery giving the film a sense of realism that would be lost today in a myriad of overused and unconvincing special effects. Those youngsters who will find themselves watching this film will be cast under its spell due to this much like I and hopefully you were at their age to.For the child and explorer in all of us there is no better tale to partake in than The Goonies, a film that has charm to spare and rewards for re-watch after re-watch. Much like the titular gang who never say die hopefully the film will live on and on and continue to put a smile on the faces of all who take the wonderful journey.5 truffle shuffles out of 5",

This was one of my favorites when I was growing up and I still like it after all these years. I can't explain it entirely, I guess it just appeals to the adventure seeker in me for it's sheer lunacy.Directed by Richard Donner (The Omen, Superman 1, Lethal Weapon 1-4, Maverick, Conspiracy Theory), written by Chris Columbus (Home Alone, Harry Potter 1 and 2; how such a good writer became such a bad director is beyond me), the film is loaded with gags that still appeal to young and old alike.\nBest of all is Sloth, the hulking mutant with the cone head who loves chocolate, Superman, and pirate movies and is strong as an ox.

It's an hommage to exploration and Fantasy at a time when Children were considered an emerging market for toy and film companies; hence the popularity of the film.The Goonies wouldn't work in modern times. It's not believable that kids would hop on their bikes and go on an adventure. Kids in the suburbs need mom's car to go anywhere.Throw in an amazing soundtrack and stellar editing...

            "content": "Simply because of the amount of films that I watch, I do not write that many reviews. However, being a 50 something, watching 'The Goonies' for the first time, I just felt that I had to write one on this occasion.My wife bought me one of those 'bucket list' scratch off posters for Christmas. A list of 100 films (104 including a couple of trilogies) to watch and I decided to start from scratch (pun not intended) and watch again, any that I had already seen.I had, of course, heard of 'The Goonies' before obtaining the poster, and had seen the copious amounts of favourable reviews. It is undeniably regarded as a cult classic. I know that a lot of you will undoubtably disagree with what I have to say, but goodness me, I cannot remember the last time that I was so disappointed when watching something that has been classed as a cinematic masterpiece.Many people have already said that if you are over a certain age and are watching this for the first time.....it might actually not be a good idea. Well, I watched this with my 15 year old son and, I have to say that he wasn't particularly enamoured with it either. With the pedigree of Richard Donner, Chris Columbus and Steven Spielberg, this could have and should have been so much better.My main gripe with the movie is the SHOUTING!!! After about 20-25 minutes, I was already fed up with it, but I stuck through it and watched it all. Yes, children shouting unintelligibly, and over each other, is excessively annoying, but the adults (to a lesser degree) were also doing it. Having said that, the adult characters were childlike anyway. The chief protagonist in the SHOUTING stakes was Chunk (Jeff Cohen).......quite simply one of the worst characters (if not THE worst) I have ever come across in a mainstream movie. He should have been left in the cave. Other main shouters were Data (Ke Huy Quan), Andy (Kerri Green) Mama Fratelli (Anne Ramsay) Francis (the usually excellent Joe Pantoliano) and Mikey (the main character...Sean Astin). Now when the main character has to shout just to calm the others down, it doesn't bode well.Sean Astin is actually very good, as is Josh Brolin. So you can see why they went on to appear in bigger and better things. Corey Feldman's character was remarkably understated compared to most of the others...and a pleasant surprise.Due to what I have already said, the plot unfortunately, became almost secondary. Yes, it is pretty lame if I'm honest, but could have been so much better. To think that a massive pirate ship and its treasure could have been laying undiscovered, where is was, is unthinkable (is that a plot spoiler?). Yes, I know the film is for kids, but I'm pretty sure that even the majority of them would think 'hang on a minute!' Sure the 5-10 year olds out there would probably be happy but you have to realise that the main children in this film are actually 12-15 years old, and therefore, the ages of the kids that it should be directed at.As I said earlier, I have seen many people saying that adults shouldn't be watching this for the first time. That can be said of many other films, all of which I have enjoyed. This though, has to be one of the excruciatingly annoying movies that I have ever seen.So why have I not given it 1 star you might ask? Reasons......it could quite easily have been better. It started well (shouting aside). And oh.....I loved Sloth!",

Using the term ugly would be too cruel to describe her appearance knowing now that she was a she, but boy, I just couldn't get over her characterization. The voice didn't help either.Well anyway, \"The Goonies\" is the embodiment of the kind of film one likes to look back on and reminisce about their own youthful experiences. For me, it summons up the adventure of my Scouting days hiking and camping, swimming and diving off Catfish Rock, and just the general camaraderie of hanging out with friends you'd like to stay young with forever. Back in the Fifties, you didn't have many fat kids around like Chunk because we were always outside running around instead of playing video games, so that's one concession I have to give the picture. 'Hey you guuuu-uys!' must be universal, because we used that as a rally cry whenever it was time to get together, which was just about every day after school and on the weekends.Our adventures of course could never match the one in \"The Goonies\", and we didn't have to watch out for characters like One Eyed Willie or Chester Copperpot. Or Sloth. But that's the fun of the picture, seeing how the gang gets into and out of their scrapes, coming of age, and triumphing in the end to win out over the bad guys and their own insecurities. If you're young or just young at heart, \"The Goonies\" offers up a fun time that captures the spirit of being alive, because after all, Goonies never say die!",

The Goonies is one of very few movies that revolve around children that I happen to enjoy. It's one of my favourite films from childhood.There are some things I don't particularly like, though. For instance, I don't think the bad guys were even needed for the film. The plot is a hidden gold mystery with pirates, and the addition of the bad guys shatters that whole pirate lore and turns it into a straight action film with baddies with guns chasing the kids. While their presence does add a sense of urgency and the kids are always on the run, this was not necessary. I would have preferred the story to revolve around these kids trying to survive all the booby traps. Also, the 'Sloth' character is too grotesque to be endearing, and I don't like him at all. They threw too much into the plot, and overburdened it needlessly. They should have kept it a lot more simple. It should have been a mystery with some clever booby traps, not the kids fleeing the bad guys. Especially if the bad guys are completely useless. I never knew whether to fear the baddies or laugh at their incompetence. At the end of the day, the baddies are too goofy to be scary. So what do we need them for? As useless punching bags for the kids to beat? I don't want that. Who wants that?",

It's the ultimate '80s kid adventure, as a crew of young pals seek lost pirate treasure beneath their sleepy coastal Oregon suburb. When compared to the stiffer, more highly-orchestrated kids' movies of today, The Goonies is refreshingly grounded. The stakes may be relatively small, but they feel insurmountable from a pre-teen's perspective, and that's what really counts. Led by a sharp-tongued Corey Feldman, the young actors do a great job of conveying that blend of quick wit and fading innocence. They might occasionally trip over words and step on lines, but that makes the production feel more alive, more real. Because, let's be honest, in a room full of actual grade-schoolers, there aren't a whole lot of quiet moments.The opening act, in particular, is a masterpiece of off-the-cuff jokes and effective scene-setting, as we get to know the gang and prepare the stage for their bicycle-powered expedition. Later chapters can get a bit cute, and pacing is sometimes a problem, but those shortcomings are generally smoothed out by the film's convincing practical effects, sweet character and overwhelming sense of childhood discovery. A veritable time capsule of the personalities, and production styles, of the period. And now I've got Cyndi Lauper running through my head again.",

The only hope is to try and come up with a lot of money and all of this is going on as the kids find a treasure map and set out to try and locate a legendary riches hidden by an infamous pirate. THE GOONIES is certainly a kid's movie but it's so well-written, acted, directed and fun that no matter how old you are you're going to get sucked into the story and the adventure. This has long been a favorite of mine because I think the story by Spielberg and the screenplay by Chris Columbus really hit on the type of adventure that a child would have in their mind. Everyone has been a child and everyone remembers coming up with some vivid adventures in their head. Sometimes you'd get together with your friends and go off on these adventures and that's pretty much what this picture is. The kids are performed by Sean Astin, Josh Brolin, Jeff Cohen, Corey Feldman, Kerri Green, Martha Plimpton and Ke Huy Quan. All of them fit their stereotyped roles very well and they really come across as a real group of friends. Robert Davi, Joe Pantoliano and the unforgettable Anne Ramsey play the bad guys chasing them. Together this is certainly one of the most memorable casts from the 80s and it's really amazing how well suited they all are for each other and they really add up to something special. The screenplay perfectly captures the fantasy/daydream side of a child's mind but it also delivers an extremely good adventure. Throughout the film there are a few nods to older adventure movies and you can't help but think the filmmakers probably had these same type of dreams when they were a kid and you can tell that there's a lot of love in the production. Another major plus is that the sets are so extremely well-done that you really feel as if you're in this dark, creepy cave. Being a \"kids\" movie from the 80s means there's a lot of stuff that would be a major no-no today including the constantly profanity, some mild sexuality and of course the dark and at times gruesome images. There are many scenes where the kids are in serious danger, which adds to some great suspense and it's one reason why the film never gets old. I certainly won't ruin the ending but it's quite moving as well. THE GOONIES is a classic example of an adventure and director Richard Donner does a terrific job bringing it to life. It's certainly one of those rare examples where in order for a film to work everything must have been in its proper place and that's exactly what this film is. It's certainly something special and something that it's doubtful anyone could capture that pure magic again.",

            "content": "\"The Goonies\" celebrates its 30th anniversary this year and I must say it hasn't aged as badly as some other films from the 1980s, yet it's not an outstanding movie by any means. Lets take a look at cast & crew first of all: Spielberg of course became an Academy Award winning superstar, but also many others achieved great things in their careers long after this film. Feldman became one of the defining kids actors of his generation. Brolin is an Oscar nominee. So is Sean Astin apart from starring in the epic \"Lord of the Rings\" trilogy. Ramsey became an Oscar nominee the same year that this one came out. Columbus is an Oscar nominee too. Plimpton and Pantoliano are Emmy winners. Ontiveros is an Emmy nominee. Davy became a really good Bond villain. So there is certainly lots of talent united in this film.Unfortunately, these almost 2 hours (fairly long for a kids movie) did not turn out a 100% successful movie. There are some nice scenes in terms of adventure, comedy etc. for example the one when Chunk tells that he knows who the 3 villains are and can describe them to the police unknowingly that he is talking to them, but there are some bad moments too, like in the end when the father tears the contract into pieces. A classic example of overacting and there are more of these when the script simply tries to be too ambitious for its own good. Another example would be the meaningful speech by Astin's character down in the cave. So yeah, not a bad watch by any means, but not a truly epic children's movie either as many people consider it. Something in-between. All in all, I recommend it, but one watch is enough. Actually I am a bit surprised they never made a sequel for this one just like they did for many other very famous 80 films, for example \"Back into the Future\".

            "content": "Having seen THE GOONIES when I grew up during the 1980s, I remember it fondly: a kind of Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew/Enid Blyton-style adventure put on the big screen, filled with excitement and danger and the kind of anything-goes mentality that made Spielberg films hits during that decade. Watching it now, as an adult, I'm slightly disappointed; the performances of a lot of the kids are shouty and grating rather than endearing, and despite the plentiful nods and jokes for the adults in the script, it just isn't as inventive as I recalled. In many ways this is simply an Indiana Jones film made specially for the kiddies.Still, there's plenty to love here, not least Richard Donner's focused direction and, of course, the hulking giant that is Sloth, who dominates all of his scenes. The villains are decent too: Robert Davi gets to show off some comic flair (and singing skills) but the real star is the irascible Anne Ramsey, who of course went on to greater fame in THROW MOMMA FROM THE TRAIN. There's also undeniable charm in seeing familiar child stars of the era (Jonathan Ke Quan, Corey Feldman) alongside those who have become better known as adult actors (Sean Astin and Josh Brolin).The imaginative plot elements include treasure maps, pirate ships, deadly traps, dead bodies and criminal gangs, but it's the central bonding of the Goonies themselves that holds it all together and keeps it so watchable. Maybe this is no classic, but it's still a good time",

            "content": "I didn't really watch movies as a youngster back in the 80's so I never saw this as a child, therefore, the whole cult of The Goonies is something that has simply passed me by. It seems to be one of those 80's movies that has a certain nostalgic power over those who saw it back in the day. I can only imagine that the reason for this is primarily down to the kids themselves, as the film is fairly generic and not overly original otherwise. But the boys do act in an unusual way for a movie aimed at children. They swear, make sexual innuendos and joke about hard drugs. So I suppose they act similar to how kids do in real life and I am supposing this is a major reason for the film's enduring appeal. It's not as saccharine as most family movies.It also has Corey Feldman in it, which I guess for some people gives a movie a certain 80's seal of approval. I noticed that the hobbit fella was part of the Goonie gang too. And the little Chinese bloke from Temple of Doom. Leaving the fat funny one who was probably the best thing about the film. It was also nice to see an old favourite of mine, Cyndi Lauper singing the catchy title tune. She really was great.I'm not going to detail the story as anyone reading this will surely know it already. But suffice to say, the film moves along at a cracking pace and does not outstay its welcome. The film has Spielberg Production written all over it and that is certainly not always a good thing. But it's actually really quite difficult to dislike this movie as it does possess a certain 80's charm.",

There's so much high-pitched screaming going on in this movie I've turned on my alarm clock just to relax a little. And generally I have nothing against stereotypes, but come on: 80% of the fat kid's lines is about food, the Asian kid invents gadgets, it's just sorta painful here. Why these characters get so much attention while the at the time still cool Corey Feldman barely gets to do anything is beyond me.

I mean, I get why it's popular. It has that Spielbergian charm to it. Small town Americana, young geeks finding their voice, affable villains who you love to hate. A lost treasure to be found, quirky characters, a good message.Yet I don't like it. I think all of the kids are either weeps or seriously creepy. Corey Feldman's Clark \"Mouth\" Devereaux is definitely the worst of the latter category. The way this preteen hits on women thrice his age is just messed up. It's supposed to come across as quirky and funny, but it's not. It's creepy. Jonathan Ke Huy Quan as Richard \"Data\" Wang is also weird in how he doesn't fit in. Here's a little kid that would put Inspector Gadget to shame, yet he's in this movie that has more in common with a tame Stephen King novel. His \"inventions\" steal most of the scenes they feature in, but not in a good way.That being said, all the characters are identifiable. I also like how the villains are really rather incompetent and kind of morons. Makes them funnier to watch and gives them personality.I can see why people like the film. It just isn't for me.",

            "content": "As much as \"The Goonies\" is distinctly an 80s film, there's no denying that sense of timelessness about it as a kids adventure film. It's got buried treasure, creepy yet conveniently klutzy bad guys, and that archetypal rag-tag group of kids who all go by nicknames. That's pretty much the foundation for live action kids movies for at least the next decade. Unfortunately, that kind of kids' entertainment has fallen by the wayside to make way for CGI in this century, but that shouldn't cheat \"The Goonies\" of its sense of magic, mystery and the courage of children who refuse to let rationality plague their thinking while they're still young.\"The Goonies\" follows a group of kids on the Oregon coast, all with their own amusing quirks, as they search for a treasure that would give them enough money to save their homes from being bought out by the wealthy folks in town. There's Mikey (Sean Astin), the fearless leader, Mouth (Corey Feldman), the smart-ass, Data (Jonathan Ke Quan) the crazy gadget nerd and Chunk (Jeff Cohen) the rotund, hunger-driven, paranoid, klutz. When the boys escape, they're followed by Mikey's older brother Brand (Josh Brolin) and his love interest, Andy--the teenage friendly subplot. Of course the treasure is buried beneath the house of some insanely creepy murderers named the Fratellis who are completely stupid yet no less creepy. Joe Pantoliano plays one of them. They're your standard villains and perfect for the fantasy element of the movie. Obviously this film tries to play off producer/writer Steven Spielberg's success with Indiana Jones by setting up underground cave booby traps as the kids go after the treasure. This is a very funny movie in both the cute family way and clever way too. The humor that comes from these kids is fun for children viewers because it's visual and funny for adults because of what comes out of their mouths. While this is mostly a boys-oriented film, it's definitely intended for families, although I was surprised by the swearing of some of the kids in the film.Considering Spielberg, Richard Donner (one of the 80s most famous directors) and future Harry Potter director Chris Columbus all played a part in the creation of this film, it should be no surprise this film has the imagination and the talent behind it to work on all these levels for all these different audiences. While I do think the movie kind of fizzles in the last half hour with all the focus on the treasure and escaping, the rest is so strong that you can get through it easily. This is simply a kids/family classic.",

The gist yes, but the details have been erased, which is what makes reliving it so much fun. It's not a great film, but it's different when you discover something as a child, the quality doesn't matter as much, it's something that speaks to you regardless. Now I grew up in Manchester, far from this seemingly exciting American suburb on the screen. The kids think their town is boring, but to me it was another world. One with big unusual looking houses, wide streets, bikes and adventure. Oh boy the adventure, the Spielberg kind (credited as a co-writer, but his stamp is all over it), wondrous and over the top. The Goonies live in a space without parents, although their escapades are in aid of them, but the screen time is all theirs, misfit kids on a treasure trail intent on making the most of \"our time\". Cue hefty doses of slapstick, teen movie tropes, booby traps, a rousing fantasy score and smaltzy sentimentality. I'd be lying if I said I enjoyed this as much as I did when I was a kid, but honestly it was close, it really stands up, good clean full blown fun.

The writing is brilliant and the characters are put in hilarious circumstances. The Chuckle Shuffle, the tricycle scene, Feldman speaking Spanish and every scene with Sloth were all legendary.

There are a few good moments along the way and Richard Donner directs the action scenes with his usual zing, but the kids' performances range from irritating to just plain lousy. The characters are worn out clich\u00e9s (the shy book-worm winds up the hero, the fat kid is a pig, the Asian kid is an inventor, etc), and the Chris Columbus screenplay is dull, predictable and uneven. It's saved somewhat thanks to terrific performances by Anne Ramsey, Robert Davi and Joe Pantaliano as the bad guys, not to mention more than a few glimpses of Kelli Green's underpants. The DVD includes the legendary octopus scene--and it's very clear why the filmmakers chose to cut it out. This, of course makes the scene at the end when the kids yell \"the octopus was scary\" make no sense, and anyone who isn't aware that there was once an octopus scene will think the kids are making up stories, when they have no reason to after all they've been through!

All they have to go by is a several centuries-old map. As if things weren't already difficult enough, there's a band of hardened criminals after them too...A fairly uneven movie. Is a decent adventure with some great moments, especially comedic moments, and some rollicking good fun, but is also quite silly at times. There's so many scenes that are random at best and sub-plots that add nothing to the movie. Anything involving the character Chunk you knew would just be plain irritating and involve a lot of mindless screaming...Performances vary too. There are some stars-of-the-future in the cast - Josh Brolin, Sean Astin, Corey Feldman, Martha Plimpton - and they give solid performances. However, consistent with the irritating nature of the character he played, Jeff Cohen almost ruins the show as Chunk. Kids will love the movie. Adults may be a bit more subdued in their views.",

Well, because the movie was and still is fun for all ages to sit down and watch. Plus it is a very memorable movie as well.The storyline in \"The Goonies\" is something that appeals to adults and youngsters alike. There simply is something for just about everyone in the audience for this 1985 movie by writers Chris Columbus and Steven Spielberg, and director Richard Donner.I thoroughly enjoyed the adventure back in the mid-1980s, and I just sat down to watch the movie again in 2020 with my 10 year old son, and the movie was every bit as exciting, adventurous and entertaining now as it was back in the day. So you can definitely say that \"The Goonies\" is a timeless movie.And having grown up with movies, it definitely is a fun experience and a blast to watch a young cast in \"The Goonies\" that includes the likes of Sean Astin, Josh Brolin, Corey Feldman, Martha Plimpton, Robert Davi, Joe Pantoliano and Anne Ramsey to mention but the most recognizable of faces and names.\"The Goonies\" definitely have that \"Indiana Jones\" feel to it, and that is most certainly something that I enjoyed back in the mid-1980s watching \"The Goonies\" and being about 10 years old then. And the adventure in the movie is, again, something that has an appeal to children and adults alike.If you have never seen \"The Goonies\", then you most certainly should take the time to do so, if you get the opportunity. This is a classic mid-1980s movie. My rating of \"The Goonies\" is a six out of ten stars.",

The story is fantastic and is like a teen Indiana Jones adventure movie. The cast is perfect. From Sean Astin's Mikey to Josh Brolin's Brand, all the kids are fantastic in the movie, and they really act like kids, screaming one over the other, insulting each other, doing stupid things and that's a really great thing.The action and the adventure moments of the movie are fantastic. It's just pure fun and entertainment and it sure has some of the best moments of this kind of movies (I specially like the part in the ship and the parts where they're trying to avoid the \"booty traps\"). The score by David Gruisin does no other thing than increase the fun and adventure of the movie.I would recommend you this movie if you're an adventure-action lover, specially if the movie is set in the 80's.",

            "content": "I grew up in the 80's.  I feel that it is a generation of films that'sa little more pure than what we have today.  There is a little more innocence in films like Raiders and Ghostbusters and Rambo and Back to the Future. But I guess if you were born in the 40's you would feel the same way about films in the 50's.  It's all a matter of perspective.  But watching a film like the Goonies brings me back to a time when my summers were spent not worrying about highschool, because I wasn't even there yet.  But we spent time going to the movies, \"sad risking\", riding our bikes and playing tag at the park.  It was a different time and a different feel.  And watching the Goonies brings me back to that time.  A time when friendship was different. Because when you hit a certain age, you have friends, but not the same way that you did when you were twelve or thirteen.  When we were that young, we all had friends like the Goonies or like the guys in Stand By Me.  And in a way, this film reminds me of Stand By Me.  They deal with different issues but they both have friendship at the core of the film.  And that is one of the reasons that makes it so enjoyable.  The Goonies is blessed with an all star production team.  From the direction of a pre-Lethal Weapon and post Superman, we have Richard Donner.  The producers are the Amblin team of Spielberg, Kennedy and Marshall and then you have the writing of Spielberg and Columbus ( Home Alone, Mrs. Doubtfire ).  With a team like this, you know you are in for a good time.  But what really makes this work in front of the camera is the great young actors of the 80's.  My favourites are Corey Feldman as Mouth and of course Chunk. Who can forget when he gets caught by the Fratelli's and he has to tell them \"everything\".  So he proceeds to gain their liking by telling them that he has pushed his sister down the stairs and blamed the dog and then making fake puke and dumping it over the balcony at the theater.  It is a very funny sequence.  Indiana Jones' Key Huy Quan is also priceless as Data, a James bond wannabe.  The cast of young greats really makes the picture.  The adventure the Goonies goes on is great for an audiene that enjoys an Indiana Jones adventure, and seeing that would be almost everyone, there are very few people that won't enjoy this film, although to be fair I think if you are under the age of 16 you will like it that much more.I have nothing bad to say about The Goonies.  It is funny, action packed, and has a lot to say about friendship.  And if you are my age, it brings you back to a time when life wasn't so convoluted and strange.  It brings you back to a time when going on an adventure that the Goonies go on would have been fathomable for you and your friends.  So how can you not like a movie like this?",

Every one of the forced-cutesy kids in the movie (thanks, Mr. Spielberg!) needs a good throttling. The fat kid is the constant butt of cliched, mean-spirited joking. I have no idea what the Asian kid is saying anywhere in the film. Corey Feldman is obnoxious and, oh.. just happens to be able to translate Spanish and treasure maps and anything else when need be. Uh huh.The plot is absurd: are we really supposed to believe the kids could so easily track down a 400-year-old treasure that everyone else has overlooked? Would a group of professional counterfeiters run off and leave evidence of their crime in plain sight, knowing that a group of kids is nosing around? I don't think so.This lame movie is par for the course for Chris Columbus (Mrs. Doubtfire, Bicentennial Man) and one of Spielberg's weaker efforts (right up there with Hook, which suffers from many of the same problems as this film).

It does get marginally better though, as these brats discover an ancient treasure map and have to compete with the menacing \"Mama Fratelli\" (Anne Ramsey) for the spoils. Robert Davi (\"Jake\") provides an additional slice of menace that could've been more effective had he been able to reduce the number of urchins a bit more effectively (indeed, a well placed rapier thrust could have belatedly rewarded us for the annoyance of \"Short Round\" from last year's \"Temple of Doom\"!). Sadly, their number is maintained to annoy and frustrate the much more capable grown ups throughout this increasingly predicable and slap-stick two-hour comedy drama. It has all the hallmarks of a Spielberg production and Richard Donner, to be fair, does up the ante as more action and less chatter starts to creep into the second half. The special effects are also quite effective and there is the odd comedy reference for those adults amongst us, but I just didn't get why this is so highly rated. It reminded me a little of the old-style Disney \"Witch Mountain\" films - but I think this is likely a film that will induce fond memories of childhood for those who still appreciate it now, I don't have those and so I didn't.",

Corey Feldman has never been a favorite of mine and I don't think anyone in this film had much of a future in acting save for Sean Astin, whose portrayal of 'Rudy' (in the movie of that name) I really like. His character here, ehh. And the only thing I like about Corey Feldman is that he had the courage to step up and expose the sexual abuse of young boys in Hollywood's film industry. For that, I applaud him, but that's not this movie. All the 'kid' movie characters he played reminded me of kids I actually knew back when, and didn't like then either.I found the 'Truffle shuffle' to be embarrassingly stupid (a fat kid having to pull up his shirt and shake his belly? C'mon...) and Corey Feldman's \"translations\" into Spanish for the Hispanic cleaning lady were juvenile and stupid and not at all funny. I saw that coming before the first subtitles hit the screen for what he was actually saying in his 'translations'. Time after time I felt like I was being left out of whatever this movie was trying to do to be entertaining, as clearly it was aimed at least 20 IQ points lower than my own.I guess I've dwelt upon young Mr. Feldman a lot here, but I should point out that I blame the role(s) he has played, not the actor himself.

            "content": "This is one of those 80's family films that probably gets talked about a lot, and I suppose rightly so, from writer Chris Columbus (Gremlins), producer and writer Steven Spielberg (E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, Back to the Future), and director Richard Donner (The Omen, Superman, Lethal Weapon). Basically the neighbourhood of \"Goon Docks\" in Astoria, Oregon is threatened by developers who want to buy the area for a golf course, unless enough money is raised to stop the construction, Michael 'Mikey' (The Lord of the Rings' Sean Astin) and his friends Lawrence 'Chunk' Cohen (Jeff Cohen), Clark 'Mouth' Devereaux (Stand by Me's Corey Feldman) and Richard 'Data' Wang (Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom's Jonathan Ke Quan) are hoping to find a way to stop it from happening. It is while rummaging through old stuff in the attic that Mikey finds what looks like the treasure map of the famous and legendary pirate One-Eyed Willie, he is sure that it leads to a hidden fortune, so he and his friends, who call themselves The Goonies, set out on a quest following this map in the hope of finding the valuable treasure to save the neighbourhood. Along the way though the Goonies get themselves in trouble getting too close to a family of fugitives, the Fratellis, the brothers Jake (Licence to Kill's Robert Davi) and Francis (Memento's Joe Pantoliano), Mama Fratelli (Throw Momma from the Train's Anne Ramsey), with Chunk ending up their hostage for a little while, however the hideous looking but much nicer member of the family, deformed brother Lotney 'Sloth' Fratelli (John Matuszak), helps him out. Mikey, Mouth and Data are eventually joined by Brand, as well as Andrea 'Andy' Carmichael (Kerri Green), and Stefanie 'Stef' Steinbrenner (Parenthood's Martha Plimpton), and they follow the map through a series of underground caverns, with many booby traps along the way to try and stop them in their tracks. They manage however to get through all the traps and reach the large pirate ship, getting on board Mikey is beaming to see the skeleton of One-Eyed Willie, the Fratellis try to steal the treasure for themselves, but with the help of Chunk and Sloth the Goonies manage to defeat the bad guys, and in the end they get a bunch of valuable jewels out of pocket in time before the signature for the construction is put down. Also starring Lupe Ontiveros as Rosalita, Mary Ellen Trainor as Mrs. Walsh, Keith Walker as Mr. Walsh, Charles McDaniel as Chunk's Father, Elaine Cohen McMahon as Chunk's Mother, Falling Down's Michael Paul Chan as Data's Father and Nick McLean as Mouth's Father. All the young leads are a likable bunch with their individual characteristics, Ramsey, Davi and Pantoliano are good exaggerated villains, the story is definitely inspired by the Raiders of the Lost Ark with all the effects and scenery to create a child friendly romp, an entertaining adventure. It was number 24 on The 100 Greatest Family Films. Good!",

My kids immediately picked up on the cussing, (I did not remember cussing, but the movie has a lot of cuss words for \"family entertainment\"). I myself was shocked by the 2 dimensional stereotypes, obese kid, smart Asian kid, rich jerk kid, obnoxious kid etc. (and I thought politically correct characters are badly written), and the discovery that the humor was sophomoric (dare I say baseless). Even with all that, the movie was still acceptable, until my kids asked to leave, stating they would rather rewatch National Treasure, because the movie was \"boring\" (I must admit the pacing was glacier) and the dialog was \"hard to follow\" (everyone screams over each other). Anyway although I will always have fond memories of this film, I'm now way to old to actually enjoy it, and my kids have no interest in seeing it again.",

When I was younger, I was always into the whole Treasure Hunting thing, always making clues and hiding them and having other's find them. The Goonies is basically a treasure hunt, and it's a damn good one too. I watched this mostly just because people were saying how great it was, and how it was one of the movies that inspired one of my favorite films from last year \"Super 8.\" Well before I praise this movie, first let me say a few things that bothered me.The character of Chunk, the fat kid, doesn't go in the caves with the rest of the group, and in the last act, we barely see him. Which is a shame. Also some parts seemed a little too adult, I could handle the skeletons, but I can't really see why they put in the scene with the statue's genitals falling off. Also Data's accent got annoying at times, he sounds like Short Round from \"Temple of Doom.\" But this movie really put a smile on my face, it's a classic adventure movie about finding a treasure. Like I said, I loved that stuff when I was younger, so this really brought a nostalgia feeling. The characters are great, sure they all fit into a stereotype: fat, Asian, cool, leader, but they all are so funny and likable. I like that they have both kids and teenagers on this journey. That way more people can relate. The villains are great, and the film had me laughing tons of times. I could say more, but I assume most of you have seen this film, and if you haven't, go watch it.The Goonies isn't quite as good as E.T., Close Encounters, or Super 8, but it's still a fun, nostalgic, and very funny ride. I will be buying this as soon as I can and it will go right on my shelf along with those other three.",

Brent taking care of his brother, willing to risk his life and watch out for him. His friends all have a skill or an ability that proves useful and support each other through the lumberous made. The poor are harassed by the rich and need to stop their houses being torn down for a golf field and the pirates robbing from the rich to give to the poor like robin good.Steven Spisburge adds his touch with the beautiful music, enchanting characters and delicately put together plot keeping you entertained no matter what age you reach. So many jokes you'll catch like the officer saying Lawerence remember the time you said green creatures were taking over the town (Gremlins) or when he puked at the theater causing everyone to (stand by me).

            "content": "The stage curtains open ...I'm always a little apprehensive in reviewing such good movies, like this one, because I'm afraid my reviews won't do them justice. Such is the case with \"The Goonies\", this classic film from 1985 - which was such an integral part of my teenage years growing up.The story starts out with a tight group of friends, who call themselves the Goonies, spending what is to be their last Saturday together - since they are all about to lose their homes due to foreclosures and have to move to different towns and cities. They want to go out with a bang, so they decide to follow a map they found among some pirate relics in an attic, leading to the hidden treasure of One-Eyed Willy, the greatest pirate of his time. Along the way, they come across the secret hideout of the Fratelli's - a notorious gang on the run from the law. With the Fratelli's on their tail, they endure exciting dangers in tunnels underground while learning the value of friendship, reliance and loss as they try to save their homes and way of life.This movie carries with it some very strong sentimental attachments for me, as I was the same age as most of the Goonies were when the film first came out.. The characters almost became like friends to me: Mikey, Brand, Chunk, Mouth, Data, Andy, Stef ... and even Sloth. With names like those, you know it has to be a fun movie.I can't give this film any higher rating or recommend. Yes, you have to suspend disbelief and just let yourself be entertained. It is a fantasy, yet extremely funny - and it still holds up well even today. I watch it at least once a year, sometimes more, and I can quote the entire movie - line for line (but don't worry, if you were ever to watch this movie with me, I wouldn't actually do that since I know how annoying it can be).

I hadn't recognized him) and his ability to be utterly corny to the point one would call a doctor, or Mouth, who is just plain annoying. The plot itself is like Indiana Jones for kids, without the traveling, plus a dysfunctional Italian crime family.Nearing the end, things got better, with the dazzling water slide and that terrific underground set with the pirate ship (though that town and its surroundings were great to look at as well). One character who was over the top also, but still has my sympathy, is Sloth. Mother Fratelli, by Anne Ramsey, was quite 'lovable', too. All in all, a kid's film that is just about doable if you can take all hysteria, though I'd expected to feel more sentimental than I do.6 out of 10.",

If you grew up in the 80's and you are one of maybe 5 people from the United States who have not seen this movie, then due yourself a favor and watch it. You have a quirky, ragtag group of friends that discover a secret treasure map in the attic and embark on one last adventure before their town gets taken over by some corporate big shot and they have to go to separate schools.The emotion this film captures, especially in kids that maybe had to leave friends they grew up with because they were forced to move, is touching. The laughs are plentiful and if you knew a fat kid when you were growing up in the 80's, you likely tried to make them do the \"truffle shuffle\". I also had my daughter for the longest time thinking that the guy who played Sloth looked like that in real life.

            "content": "Certain films seem to evoke childhood memories and playfulness. It makes adults remember back to times when they were children and when they cared about things more important than what adults worry about. It seems that once humans reach a certain age they lose their childhood fantasies and immediately become adults; but \"The Goonies\" seems to bring some of that back, and tells us that instead of worrying about pointless things, we should worry about family, friends, and neighborhoods. Yes, neighborhoods. That's what \"The Goonies\" is about.You see, the story is about a small strand of houses, called \"The Goon Docks,\" located off the ocean. But the houses are all going to be destroyed because none of the owners have enough money to keep them standing.And so a sad group of children, called \"The Goonies,\" are depressed and...well...sad. Sean Astin (now seen as Samwise Gangee in \"The Lord of the Rings\") , Corey Feldman, and a bunch of others are determined to get enough money to keep their beloved homes. In the attic of Astin's home, they find an old treasure map detailing the route to the treasure of an old pirate. Many have tried to get the treasure. None have succeeded. And so the boys (and eventually, girls, of course), embark on a journey to find the treasure so they can keep the \"Goon Docks.\"This film is like so many others from the eighties; \"Gremlins\" is a lot like it. The way the set decorations are, the way the special effects are...The end of the eighties really marked the fall of campy-looking sets; now we see tons of \"realistic\" sets that aren't nearly as fun depending on the genre of the film. Comedies like \"The Goonies\" not only have great sets, but also some great gags and great memories. It reminds one of when one was younger; the Goonies go on an adventure looking for treasure, and which one of us hasn't done that before? When hadn't we, as children, worried about things that meant so much to us (such as the Goonies' homes)?Yes, \"The Goonies\" may not be the greatest film to ever hit the streets, but it's pretty darn entertaining and a pretty nice ride.",

One of the absolute best (if not #1)\nfilms on this is \"Treasure island\" (1934) with Wallace Berry and Jackie Cooper. The twist here is modern and\nhas a sub-plot of poetic justice to it.Unfortunately, the story is nice but it's full of cliches and characterizations, e.g. The fat kid is always hungry\nand clumsy, the Asian kid is the genius, etc. Obviously there are no black people since Hollowood was and\nremains a \"white man's world.\"ACTING:\nQuite good acting, and you can see the early talents from Sean Astin and Josh Brolin.ENTERTAINMENT:\nValue here remains moderate to high depending on age and if it's your first viewingTEMPO:\nGood, but as with so many of Spielberg's work, the pace becomes increasingly frenetic past the half way mark ...\nbuilding towards the obsession with the \"great climax\" ... oh well.CINEMATOGRAPHY:\nOK in the beginning but becomes an obvious set of an indoor fun house (you have to be a wee one not to see)DIRECTING / WRITING:\nDirector: Donner was a TV director before this, and that formulaic method that all TV is based on is clearly present.His work is consistently good, but so full of predictable and safe cliches that the films lack creative nuance.Writers: This team represents the \"Council of Tripe\" who can churn out quality stories, but most of their work becomes\nthe same stories and messages with rotating sets and costumes.Is it a good film?

Micky (Sean Astin) the leader of the group finds a treasure map and an ancient doubloon leading to a legendary pirate ship underground. They have one day to find it before their homes are foreclosed.

A number of my friends really like it, and I remember seeing it when I was in Primary School. It is a simply a fun film with action and adventure, with a message of friendship. All the friends have their own character traits, like Mikey as the leader and the most committed to the quest, Mouth (Corey Feldman) as an little trouble maker, Data (Jonathan Ke Quan) the inventor and Chunk (Jeff Cohen) an child who wants to avoid trouble. There is also a good sub-plot involving Mikey's older brother Brand (Josh Brolin) and Andy (Keri Green) who slowly form a relationship during the film. Richard Donner is a good set-pieces director, and he is old-fashioned (and that's a good thing). They is excellent set-designs with good old style action. He used traditional techniques and not things like the birth of CGI and blue screen. He focused on this story and characters.

The fact Richard Donner (I also like) actually directed it passed me by at the time, but I think I can put the finger on my disappointment:1. Star Wars and Raiders of the Lost Ark had already fundamentally upped my expectation of what movies could be. 2. Speilberg's Close Encounters, Raiders and ET had all been fantastic 3. I had heard of Gremlims and Jaws but was too young to see them (I know Spielberg didn't direct Gremlins); but heard they were also good (I have a different opinion of Gremlins now...) 4. I think I saw Back to the Future just before I saw Goonies, and I really liked that film - and credited it to Speilberg (again he didn't direct though!) 5. I hadn't heard of 1941... ;-)I was expecting either Fantasy or Sci-Fi, but what I got was a bunch of cardboard cut-out kids going on what appeared to me (as a child) a rather childish adventure (the fantastical element was fairly minimal).  I did like Mikey, I didn't like Mouth (is Corey Feldmans top lip paralysed? it gets on my nerves for no good reason...), I did like Data (hey! I was a kid!), but didn't like Chunk (too stereotypical even for a  kid): result, mixed.Did I like it? Yes, it had lots of good moments, but overall I felt disappointed that there wasn't more to it.Last time I saw it I was about 15 (on video), so my views may be much better now - especially in light of it's cult following, and a number of rave reviews on this board.

This movie even when I am 80 will be one of my favorites of all time and I by then will have seen over 10,000 movies I am sure. It is also sweet to see Joe Pantiliano in a criminal character role before the days of The Sopranos as Ralph. Sloth by far is the coolest character when he and Chunk become best friends. The young actors in this movie with the exception of Astin and Feldman did not have much of acting careers. Goonies forever!!!",

Here's Raven's video review http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvpL7if8gGw and below is her written one. I remember watching it all the time when I was younger and I enjoy it as much now as I did back then.The cinematography is good because it shows the age of the film. I also think the visual aspects of the chain reactions leading up to the contraptions are cool. When I was little I traveled in the area where 'The Goonies' was filmed, which was pretty interesting to see.My favorite character is Data because he is very funny and all of his inventions are super helpful in the search to find one-eyed-Willy and his treasure. I think this movie is for ages 10 and up because there is some inappropriate language. However, I don't remember noticing any of that when I was younger and I recently watched with my little brother who is 7, and he didn't seem to notice either. I guess it really just depends on the maturity of each child.Overall, I give 'The Goonies' 4 out of 5 stars because it is very entertaining and it has a good story line.'The Goonie' is playing in August on HDnet movies on Kidscene.

Tons of bickering chatter, gratuitous product placement, hijinks-action and toilet humor make this flick, which could be retitled THE GARBAGE PALE OUTSIDERS VISIT THE TEMPLE OF DOOM, more suited for teens than children. Three villainous yet goofy thugs provide filler as they thwart the Gonnie's quest: which, despite the grandiose musical score, is really just a lot of running around. But the main problem isn't the plot - treasure hunts are always intriguing - but the Goonies themselves: it's never really clear why they're outcasts... or from what exactly.",

For me, this movie is just awesome because it offers the best afternoon of fun, thrills, adventures we can imagine: it's like a role-playing session with friends (except mine had no girls) and it's much better than animated movies! Those kids lived in a beautiful location, had great values for each other, their parents and this pirate trail is much intriguing than those of Caribean!

            "content": "Before tonight, it had been roughly 7 years since my last viewing of \"The Goonies\" (from an era where I bore the nickname 'Sloth' among a select few)...and at first, I didn't really know what to think. The hyperactive exclamations of prepubescent Sean Astin ('Mikey'), Corey Feldman ('Mouth'), Jeff Cohen ('Chunk'), and Ke Huy Quan ('Data')--the 'Goonies' of the title--kind of grated on my nerves with their novice, kitchen-sink performances (even considering the usual excesses of child actors, this was pushing it). But just as I was beginning to think that, the movie kicked into gear and began its enthralling course--yes, even at 25 years of age, I can say without a hint of shame that I had a lot of fun with this kid-friendly \"Temple of Doom.\" Our titular characters live in an overcast seaside community, set to be razed by greedy land developers looking to put up a golf course. While messing around with the antiques in Mikey's attic, our boys stumble across a 17th-century treasure map, and decide to embark on a quest to find the (implied) riches contained within. In their travels, they also run afoul of the slapstick quartet of 'Ma' Frattelli (Ann Ramsey) and her three sons (Robert Davi and \"Memento\"'s Joe Pantoliano), one of whom is a hideously deformed--but very humane--Charles Addams caricature. The Goonies also run into booby traps aplenty, and the story maintains a surprising amount of unpredictability, considering its target audience (while *mostly* a kid's movie, the material isn't inaccessible to older viewers).That being said, Steven Spielberg's story credit seems a bit dubious, especially when looking at \"The Goonies\" from a distance: he could have very well approached Warners with \"'Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom,' only with kids instead of Harrison Ford!\" and collected his check on the way out. Whereas Indy, Willie, and Short Round altruistically braved peril to save the children of an impoverished Indian village, we have the Goonies altruistically banding together to save their threatened community.Of course, this would be bothersome...if \"The Goonies\" wasn't so much damn fun. Like the endearing classic \"Ghostbusters,\" \"The Goonies\" is a similar 1980s gem, with a sense of creativity, adventure, and humor (including some fine one-liners), with plenty of crossover appeal to individuals who claim to have 'outgrown' this sort of film. If the film is dated in any way, it's only in the Cyndi Lauper theme song (which is still a bitchin' tune) that gives \"The Goonies\" its adventurously fun, young-at-heart identity.",

In fact, I had just gone to a free screening of The Goonies in the park and the audience was primarily people in their early and mid 20s. So it looks like the people who loved this movie as a kid will cherish even as they get older. I'm one of them. As one of the greatest adventure film, The Goonies were a group of kids out of the Oregon boonies (aka The Goondocks). The Walshes who's son, Mikey (Sean Astin), is the unofficial Goonies leader, knows that his folks need plenty of cash fast to cover the back taxes and save the Goondocks from the like of that sniveling Troy Perkins's father.Hanging around the house one afternoon and driven by the curiosity of what Mikey's father might do with all that cool junk in the attic, the boys come upon a great discovery: a map of One-Eyed Willy's (yes, there are obvious synonyms to be made from the name) \"rich stuff.\" So The Goonies are on one last adventure!Only, the map leads them to a bunch of fugitive gangsters called The Fratelli's (a terrific cast of villains featuring Anne Ramsey as Mama Fratelli; Joe Pantoliano as Francis; Robert Davi as Jake; and the late John Matuszak as the large, deformed and loveable Sloth Fratelli). When one of the Goonies get's captured by the Fratelli's, it doesn't take them long to figure out that these kids are sniffing a trail of treasure, and the Fratelli's want to get to it first, no matter what.Aside from a great story and a great soundtrack (featuring 80s queen, Cindi Lauper in the soundtrack and music video for the song, 'Good Enough'), you have a priceless cast and film crew. Sean Astin, Josh Brolin, Martha Plimpton, and Corey Feldman (to some extent) have surpassed their transition into adult roles, so they've been around quite a while. Nostalgic viewers should get a kick out of seeing them a squeaky voice little kids--except for the gorgeous Josh Brolin, who was already 17 at the time of the film's release. None of the kids are annoying as those cast in family films often tend to be (and with the exception of some of Sean Astin's dialogue, it is hardly corny). You have a good assortment of characters like fast-talking Mouth (Corey Feldman), braniac inventor (Data), and the hyperactive fat kid (who may be the most well known character in the film and turned Jeff Cohen into a cult star, despite his not doing much in movies afterwards).\nAnd of course, it is especially helped by filmmakers who always work well with family film material and young casts and scripts (like Speilberg with E.T.; and Chris Columbus with Home Alone and the Harry Potter movies), especially when it comes to the adventure genre. This movie really has a lot going for it and gives a lot of laughs from beginning to end.\nKids will surely enjoy this great modern pirate adventure! If you're a kid, it probably encourages you to seek out some Goonie adventure yourself, afterwards.",

I never saw this movie as a kid. I just saw it recently for the first time ever, and it wasn't the best childhood film ever-- sorry! I can't believe this movie is rated PG, it has some bad crudeness for a PG. But good points of the film I liked is the (slightly random) adventure and the development of the gaggle of kids, who are NOT perfect angels (if you thought that), none the less maybe that's why they are called the Goonies.PLOT: On verge of being kicked out of their neighborhood, a rag-tag group of kids randomly find a treasure map in their attic (I guess that's childhood-dreamish). But around that time a tedious family of criminal have their hearts set on the treasure too (oh joy). They set out for their excursion hoping to find riches so that they can pay the financier allowing them to say in their neighborhood. Soon, 3 teens join them as they delve deeper following the map while escaping the petty criminals. It actually has sorta an exciting atmosphere to it.CHARACTERS: Mikey,the protagonist is childish, simply and likable. His weird dialogue towards 1-eyed Willy really erked me. He's sorta clean. Data I liked, he was clever and funny, very clean most of the time. Mouth was kinda annoying but kinda sincere, but like a annoying toughboy. Chunk, he grew on me-- though I didn't like his use of profanity in his 1st scene. The infamous truffle-shuffle (I don't get th name) was kinda sad and pointless, many people said it was offensive to over-weight people (it gotta agree) but I guess it was used to force laughter out of children (I didn't laugh). I still just kinda liked Chunk though, he was pathetic and fun. Brand was nice (to his bro, that scene was good) and intelligent but his tough-guy rendo was typical and idiotic, his love interest with Andy grossed my out (she looked young). Andy herself was cute and smart, but her use as the sensual object erked me-- she was just a young girl, let her be one. Stef, I really liked her. She was awesome, with her geek's getup, she rocked! She was calm, pure, caring, passionate and panicked very little. Sloth scared me most of the time (always smiling) but he served well. The Fretelli were petty and demented-- singing spontaneously, trying to kill kids, and ultimately dull as hey were used as comical villains. That Mama Fretalli was wicked, not scary just sadistic. I felt sorry for the kind Roselita, a Latina housekeeper. I hated how Mouth made fun of her.The acting just about good enough, but still the kids seemed fake, being in a shallow cave with horrific booby-traps they should have been out their minds scared making it realistic, but it's a kid film (still can't believe it though). At least the kids had fun doing the movie.One scene in Mikey's house is the crudest, sexually horrible, unhumourous and unneeded. The kids cussing makes them lose innocence fast. Mikey's mom looks like she takes horrible care of her kids. There's a horrible scene where the younger kids bribe each other with porn (not a magazine fortunately, just something lesser). There's a gross scene with these men at the showers (upper torsos shown, fortunately) and a disgusting scene with a man at the restroom.In the end, everything gross ruins the film. Maybe you'll like the bad kids or not, I know crudeness can be expected from kids, but this is overdoing it. It would have been so much better without the crudeness!",

I have to say the DVD and its bonus features (i.e. deleted scenes, a \"Making of The Goonies\" featurette, current audio commentary with Donner and the actors, etc) are excellent! Mikey, Brand, Chunk, Mouth, Data, Andy, and Stef follow a map and go searching for buried treasure via caves and waterfalls in an abandoned restaurant along the Oregon coast. They do this because they believe it (the treasure of legendary pirate One Eyed Willie) will save their homes from being torn down by land developers who want to build an upscale golf course. The problem is that a group of ex-convicts (the Fratellis) also want the treasure, and are using the abandoned restaurant as a hideout. Moreover, the Fratellis will crush anything and anyone in the way of their goals. Can the Goonies find the treasure before its too late? I must say \"The Goonies\" has it all: stereotypical but likable characters, awesome visual and sound effects via Steven Spielberg, Richard Donner, and Industrial Light and Magic, as well as integrations of 1980s pop culture (Cyndi Lauper's \"The Goonies 'R' Good Enough\", Mouth wearing Prince's \"Purple Rain\" shirt, etc). Product placement is also highly evident: Baby Ruth, Rocky Road, Domino's Pizza. The sets, costumes, and props are wonderful as well (I have a Hawaiian shirt similar to the one Chunk wears).

After all this teen Indiana Jones featuring the pre-pubescent Breakfast Club holds a similar place for as many 30 somethings as Stand By Me does, and like Stand By Me this film holds up remarkably well.If you were going to make a movie that appeals to teenage boys what do you think you might put in it?Bikes, inventions, skeletons, nutshots, potty humour.Adventure, near misses and close escapes? Booby traps, codes and challenges.Criminals? Monsters??TREASURE MAPS & PIRATES???How about all of the above? The Goonies are four pre-teen buddies with clever nicknames that also serve to explain more about them than 15 minutes of exposition would:Mouth \u2013 The loud talkative one.Data \u2013 The nerdy inventor one.Chunk \u2013 The fat obnoxious and clumsy one.Mike \u2013 The ummm\u0085 one named Mike? He is asthmatic if that helps.The first prison escape and ensuing car chase neatly intros every principal character that will appear in the film within an entertaining 5 minutes. Clever stuff really.After a couple more rambunctious pre-teen conversations \u2013 and a plot device that finds them with the desperate need to find big cash quick or their house will be foreclosed to make way for a golf course \u2013 the boys unexpectedly come across what appears to be a pirate's treasure map from 1632, made by the renowned local pirate One Eyed Willie (aren't they all?).So the four Goonies, along with Mike's older brother Brandon (Josh Brolin\u0085 Yep No Country for Old Men himself) and his cheerleader target of (PG13) conquest Andie and her buddy Steph unwittingly along for the ride; off everyone goes for an adventure.To ramp up the action a notch further the local crime family the Fratellis are injected into proceedings so that they might pose a threat by staying one step behind the kids at all times. Don't worry kids, the Fratellis are an old Mum and her two boneheaded sons, no-one gets hurt and there is never any serious peril or danger.With all the major players identified and in play the hunt leads all and sundry into a vast underground series of caves and tunnels, with booby traps and dangerous terrain all around, the traps were lain by the late Mr Willie who it was alleged would rather die wealthy than spread his booty around\u0085 unlike Jessica Simpson \u2013 who will only die wealthy\u0085Each Goonie gets their respective chance to shine as they come across each new obstacle or elaborate puzzle, the girls are their to provide love and lust interests and to shriek when the situation demands \u2013 and if all that isn't enough a fourth \"forgotten\" Fratelli, the hideously disfigured ogre-ish Sloth pops his magnificently unique lump head into the fray\u0085 Again don't worry he's not a bad hideously disfigured, massively muscled ogre, he's a good guy (great 80s makeup job though!).Everyone learns something from the experience, there is some immensely entertaining action sequences and the whole thing is as light and realistic as a Miss Universe contestant, thankfully it makes more sense though.What sets Goonies apart is the little touches, despite the large number of characters in the group everyone is distinctly different, but aside from just the broad strokes mentioned above there are little touches that lend further human qualities to the boys that go beyond mere caricature \u2013 the asthma inhaler, the inventions, the clumsiness and strange stories \u2013 they all help.The plot is necessarily preposterous at all times, everything is skewed towards fun and escapism, and as mentioned previously this has been purpose built to entertain, amuse and inspire young boys \u2013 just like Britney Spears. That's three pop-culture potshots at obvious targets in one review \u2013 my parents must be so proud!Final Rating \u2013 7.5 / 10. As with many things The Goonies all appears effortless and straightforward, but as we should know it takes a lot of effort and planning to make things look this easy, even then this has the added bonus of being consistently fun and engaging. There's a reason this has an audience 25 years on when Due Date will be forgotten in 25 days.",

The \"Goonies\" are a bunch of kids who live in a sleepy coastal town. They are on the verge of having to sell their homes and move away as greedy developers have acquired their land. Only a massive cash windfall can prevent this from happening. One rainy afternoon, they are fooling around in the attic when they come across an old pirate map. They decide to hunt for the treasure (it might, after all, be their final chance to get the money they need). But the route to the loot is riddled with  deadly traps and puzzles, and things become even worse when a trio of murderers get involved in the race for the treasure as well. Many of the film's young actors went on to bigger things (Sean Astin in Lord of the Rings, for example). They show quite a lot of star quality and manage to give performances beyond their years under the assured direction of Richard (The Omen) Donner. In many ways, the film plays like a juvenile variation of the Indiana Jones movies, and is a very competent and fast-moving yarn for those who like this sort of thing. It's not a film that was ever destined to win any awards, but if fun and adventure is your kind of thing then you could do a lot worse.",

Seeing this movie for the first time at the age of 8, I was one of millions of kids who were blown away by this Family action / comedy.A modern day fantasy that is still as good when it came out almost 20 years ago, the story of beating the odds, good verse evil, finding hope in the most unlikely of places, the under dogs winning the day, and the age old take of discovery is what Goonies is all about. An interesting cast which makes the movie, the story is an adventure of youth and exploration, even though they never leave their home state. A terrific movie for the entire family.",

            "content": "OK, so this is a bit of a cult film for people of a certain age. I am (maybe) a little old to have been captured by it (I was in my 20's when it was released), but having seen it a couple of times I can see why it got the following it did. The first time was on TV and it was a version that had been cut back quite a bit to allow a daytime showing. This didn't really work (for me) and so I got the DVD which has a much better, uncut, version of the film. I will give you my thoughts after this brief summary.The Goonies are a bunch of kids who live in Astoria. They are; Mikey, Mouth, Chunk and Data, joined on this particular adventure by Mikey's brother, Brand, and two girls, Andy and Stef. All of their houses are under threat of foreclosure as the local country club looks to expand. None of the families can afford to stay and it looks like they are all going to have to move away. On their last day the boys are messing about in Mikey's dad's attic when they find an old pirate treasure map. Mikey is a bit of a dreamer and persuades the others to go looking for the treasure. Throw in a criminal family, the Fratelli's, and you got yourself an adventure you just won't believe! I'll leave it there or the Spoiler Police (pirate division) will have me walking the plank again.Beautifully made with some excellent special effects (remember, no CGI back then) and a great score, it's great to look at. All the kids did an excellent job; Sean Astin as Mikey, Josh Brolin as Brand, Jeff Cohen as Chunk, Corey Feldman as Mouth, Kerri Green as Andy, Martha Plimpton as Stef and Jonathan Ke Quan as Data. The Fratelli's were also pretty good, so honourable mentions go to; John Matuszak as Sloth, Robert Davi as Jake, Joe Pantoliano as Francis and Anne Ramsey as Mama.With a story by Steven Spielberg and having been made very much in his style, I can definitely see the appeal. The dialogue and the style put me very much in mind of the old 1930's black and white comedies that featured kids as the main characters. Don't ask me to name any of them, I lost those brain cells many years ago. If anything, I did find it a little too long and some of the jokes did tend to get a bit tired towards the end. Having said that though, it's still a fine film and well worth a look if you happen to come across it\u0085 Recommended.My Score: 8.1/10.IMDb Score: 7.5/10 (based on 74,589 votes at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes Score: 63/100 (based on 41 reviews counted at the time of going to press).",

There are loads of graphics scenes of death, even though they are \" just\" skeletons arranged and decorated to portray gruesome deaths. I wonder what teenagers think of watching daggers in the eye sockets of a skull. I find it disturbing.Another thing that bugs me is the constant hysterical screams and the incessant talking by some of the characters. The neurotic behaviour is way over the top. If they are so chicken to start with, would they even be in the treasure hunt in the first place?

            "content": "I'm sorry to inform that the Goonies were not good enough for me.I know this movie is famous and all, but it kinda grossed me out with the crudeness. I never saw this movie as a kid. I just saw it recently for the first time ever, and it wasn't the best childhood film ever-- sorry! I can't believe this movie is rated PG, it has some bad crudeness for a PG. But good points of the film I liked is the (slightly random) adventure and the development of the gaggle of kids, who are NOT perfect angels (if you thought that), none the less maybe that's why they are called the Goonies.PLOT: On verge of being kicked out of their neighborhood, a rag-tag group of kids randomly find a treasure map in their attic (I guess that's childhood-dreamish). But around that time a tedious family of criminal have their hearts set on the treasure too (oh joy). They set out for their excursion hoping to find riches so that they can pay the financier allowing them to say in their neighborhood. Soon, 3 teens join them as they delve deeper following the map while escaping the petty criminals. It actually has sorta an exciting atmosphere to it.CHARACTERS: Mikey,the protagonist is childish, simply and likable. His weird dialogue towards 1-eyed Willy really erked me. He's sorta clean. Data I liked, he was clever and funny, very clean most of the time. Mouth was kinda annoying but kinda sincere, but like a annoying toughboy. Chunk, he grew on me-- though I didn't like his use of profanity in his 1st scene. The infamous truffle-shuffle (I don't get th name) was kinda sad and pointless, many people said it was offensive to over-weight people (it gotta agree) but I guess it was used to force laughter out of children (I didn't laugh). I still just kinda liked Chunk though, he was pathetic and fun. Brand was nice (to his bro, that scene was good) and intelligent but his tough-guy rendo was typical and idiotic, his love interest with Andy grossed my out (she looked young). Andy herself was cute and smart, but her use as the sensual object erked me-- she was just a young girl, let her be one. Stef, I really liked her. She was awesome, with her geek's getup, she rocked! She was calm, pure, caring, passionate and panicked very little. Sloth scared me most of the time (always smiling) but he served well. The Fretelli were petty and demented-- singing spontaneously, trying to kill kids, and ultimately dull as hey were used as comical villains. That Mama Fretalli was wicked, not scary just sadistic. I felt sorry for the kind Roselita, a Latina housekeeper. I hated how Mouth made fun of her.The acting just about good enough, but still the kids seemed fake, being in a shallow cave with horrific booby-traps they should have been out their minds scared making it realistic, but it's a kid film (still can't believe it though). At least the kids had fun doing the movie.One scene in Mikey's house is the crudest, sexually horrible, unhumourous and unneeded. The kids cussing makes them lose innocence fast. Mikey's mom looks like she takes horrible care of her kids. There's a horrible scene where the younger kids bribe each other with porn (not a magazine fortunately, just something lesser). There's a gross scene with these men at the showers (upper torsos shown, fortunately) and a disgusting scene with a man at the restroom.In the end, everything gross ruins the film. Maybe you'll like the bad kids or not, I know crudeness can be expected from kids, but this is overdoing it. It would have been so much better without the crudeness!",

            "content": "The eighties were above all the greatest decade for imagination. They were the days of more adventure, science fiction and action movies than one could count ants in an ant colony. They were the days when legendary Directors like Spielberg, Lucas, Cameron and Scott dictated movie making and redefined the whole meaning of movie-going. A time when CGI was scarce and unnecessary for make believe, yet where realism was at its peak and brainless audiences didn't require something blowing up every 5 seconds before they lost interest. In other words, it was the decade of wonder and patience. These directors pulled us into their vivid worlds - the worlds we only dreamed about - and we believed and loved every minute of them. Today films are so fast food, I just don't care anymore!It is this why I must write about 'The Goonies' (produced by Spielberg). Is there one guy in the world, born in the 80's, who wasn't affected by the release of this joy of a film? For whoever liked the Indiana Jones trilogy, this was an extension of that vision. It is a roller-coaster ride from start to finish. A pirate treasure story including caverns, mind boggling originality in booby traps, adventurous, inventive and resourceful kids just like Indiana willing to risk their lives for the desirable exotic adventure experience and the biggest and coolest water slide on the face of the Earth. Adventure was every kid's obsession and here is a film realizing that obsession - kids could relate better here than in Indiana Jones due to the leads being your kids next-door kind of 'kids'. This is why many from the eighties consider it their favorite film. This is not to say that this film hasn't got its fair share of obvious flaws, however the story, the acting and directing (as assisted by Spielberg himself) outweighs completely everything else.The story takes place in the coastal US town of 'Astoria', surrounding four friends around the age of 12'ish who call themselves \"The Goonies\" - Goonies being another name for an Albatross of some sort. Composing the gang are 'Mikey', played by Sean Astin (Toy Soldiers), 'Mouth', played by Corey Feldman (Stand By Me), 'Data', played by Jonathan Ke Quan (Indiana Jones and The Temple Of Doom) and 'Chunk', played by Jeff Cohen. Unfortunately for these kids, their friendship and their lives as they know them may be torn apart due to their houses being bought and broken down by a rich, greedy bureaucrat who wishes to build a useless Golf Course on that very same piece of land they live on. To the gang's coincidental surprise, however, whilst sorting through Mikey's dad's attic antiquity they come across a priceless and legendary Pirate Treasure Map. The gang figures if the legend is true and the Treasure is found, they can pay back for the houses their parents couldn't afford to keep. With little interest from the rest of the gang including his own brother, Mikey finally convinces them about the treasure hunt, reminding them of the importance of finding it and regaining their properties. With Mikey's resourceful and smart head, Data's ridiculous yet ingenious inventions, Mouth's unstoppable mouth, and Chunk's ever growling stomach, 'The Goonies' set out on an adventure, who along with Mikey's brother, pick up a few other friends along the way to join them. Unfortunately the clues that lead to the caverns of the lost treasure intersect with wanted thieving criminals known as the 'Fratellis'. However, this is not the only obstacle the Goonies have to conquer - for Spielberg and Richard Donner showcase their highly inventive and famous booby traps that still excite. What follows is the unforgettable pirate adventure story of 'One Eyed Willy'.The acting in this film is flawless. The kids, especially Corey Feldman who has always been a teen actor favorite of mine, had so much enthusiasm in their roles, that you are convinced they are for real. The Fratelli's were funny, but none funnier than 'Data', my personal favorite 'Goonie'. Set Designs were a marvel. Who needs graphics when you're working with Spielberg? The caverns looked so real, like it was an actual place - dusty and dirty and all....Most impressive however was the cinematography and the music, both which establish the atmosphere of the film so vividly and brilliantly. Every time I watch this film, I think of Cindy Lauper's great song. The orchestral music is also wonderful adding an authentic feel of adventure to the surrounding sets. Cinematography was masterfully realized and I loved the beautiful scenery of the coast and the caverns.This great film, although filled with many flaws, is one of my childhood favorites and even in this day and age with the world gone Topsy turvy, I still love this movie to bits - as well as I loved it the first time I saw it. It was directed by Richard Donner, but feels like a Steven Spielberg movie. It has his signature all over the place. I can only summarize this film in one word. It's a 'classic'. A must see for those who are young at heart and who have always had that longing for adventure.",

I actually found myself rooting for these characters and ended up liking their individual traits even if they might be a bit shallow, but in some way that docent matter. As the group isn't some big band of superheroes, but instead just a group of kids and teens having fun accidentally stumpeling across a treasure map.If any of us found a treasure map as kids we would go mental, and dive right into the adventure head first without thinking of the consequences. - Just go and have fun - Just like the goonies did.\nThis is something we all wished happened to us as kids no matter if you grew up in the 80's, 90's, 20's.I can definitely see the charm that the 80's kids would have gotten from the goonies. It's just a pure quirky movie, with funny and dumb jokes, thats great for basically everyone. It docent evolve or do anything ground breaking, and is even predictable in a few areas, but it defiantly succeeds in just being a good time and im glad I watched it at least once.7/10",

It had virtually everything going for it: treasure maps, kids in control of their destinies, pirate ships, deformed and misunderstood Sloth, humour with outcast and overweight Chunk, revenge, 'booby' traps, evil/creepy Italians, and I could go on and on. There's a lot this film has going for it, and its highly engaging plot ensures that children will not be bored. Even, it is a little bit silly. The kids make this film what it is, and they are the ones that save the day. They outsmart the evil Fratellis and get the treasure. And, who could not find the scenes with Sloth and Chunk highly amusing, especially when Chunk confesses everything that he has done wrong? This is a pure gem.

            "content": "There must've been at least one or two kids in every household who would punch the hell out of you if you'd never saw \"The Goonies\" or know some of the scenes and characters. I was one of those household kids who cherish this 1985 classic as if watching \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" as a kid where every weekend when I didn't need to do homework, one of my favorite eighties classics would be playing in the VCR from Ghostbusters, Goonies or Raiders of the Lost Ark.The Goonies is about a group of four young boys who are considered losers and outcasts to the popular kids. Mike (Sean Astin) is the leader of the group where he's always being teased and corrected in conversation by his older brother Brandon (Josh Brolin) who's trying to fit in with others. Mike's friend include a chatterbox know-it-all name Mouth (Corey Feldman), an inventor and James Bond fanatic Data (Jonathan Ke Quan), and chubby and great liar Chuck (Jeff Cohan). Mike and Brandon are upset that a group of rich snobs have seized the property of their parents house along with the rest of the community where all the houses and docks are going to be tear down for a country club to be made. Mike and his friends investigate the attic with Brandon where they try to seek any hidden treasures around the city before tying up Mike's brother.There is a subplot behind this comedy caper where the group of boys see that other people are at an abandon building with the treasure being hidden inside. More things are hidden inside as well before Brandon rescues Mike and others for any huge embarrassment. New characters enter from pop tart cheerleader Andy (Kerri Green) to geeky Stephanie (Martha Plimpton) who not only know Brandon and the kids but get involve with them as well with one thing happening over the next.\"The Goonies\" is a funny movie where despite a few harsh languages here and there, especially the young kids saying a four letter S word (and I don't mean suck), there's nothing offensive about it.",

Also at any given moment in the film, at least 2 to 3 characters are speaking at the same time, usually shouting. It gets annoying quickly. That said, the characters are likeable enough, although only a few are memorable. I recommend this for children, not adults.",

            "content": "The Goonies is a wonderful children's film featuring suicide, torture, a deformed man chained up in a confined room, deadly booby traps, a frozen dead body, kidnapping, gunshots, foreclosure, an old lady threatening to cut off children's tongues and skeletons. It's probably the best family horror movie of all time. But seriously, it's hard to believe all this stuff is in a kid's movie. It just goes to show how powerful tone is. Because the music is never too dark and there's no nudity or swearing and because the children are all basically guaranteed to survive to the end, no-one bats an eye.The Goonies works because of its energy and innocence. It's a bunch of children being children, going on an adventure to find a hidden treasure in order to hopefully save their parents from having to foreclose their houses. None of the actors are slack, they all jump right into their roles. It reminded me of the raw energy of Star Wars, the way Luke and Leia say silly lines so sincerely and they seem so passionate about everything they do.The characters are a big part of the movie's success. They shout over each-other, tell each-other to \"shut up\", laugh and scream together. They make fun of each-other which is one of those signs of long term friendship. They know Chunk so well they can count down to when he'll drop something and break it. They infuriate him enough to make him unwittingly break down a door and then thank him afterwards as they walk over his body. They make him do a silly dance before letting him into a house. The gate is opened by a wacky, overly complex sequence of events including a chicken laying an egg and a balloon popping. I'm guessing Data invented it.I really liked the music by Dave Grusin. I'm not sure I've seen any of his other movies. But it sounded interesting all the way through. Not simply underlining the action or on the other extreme being distracting but adding lots of colour and variety. I really feel like I need to listen to the soundtrack to properly appreciate all the details and get familiar with the music.There is a lot of slapstick comedy in this movie. Joe Pantoliano asks for a sword from his Mother. She hands it to him and he yells as the blade part goes onto his hand by mistake. I was reminded of Home Alone and Baby's Day Out. The movie achieves a safe, silly, comedic atmosphere where everything just becomes fun. There is danger but it's fun danger. We hold our breath as the bad guys get closer and then laugh out loud as they slip and hurt themselves. We gasp when a bad guy appears out of nowhere and then cheer as another character swoops in to rescue the day.I get the impression many people love The Goonies from childhood and have watched it regularly for decades. I saw a lot of 80s movies as a kid but somehow The Goonies was left out. I don't know if it's great but it's a very likable and fun movie and I can see myself growing fonder of it with time. I think it's perfect family entertainment that a lot of children would find hilarious. My favourite things about it were Chunk, the bumbling and arguing villains, the sense of adventure and the cast of quirky, funny characters.Sean Astin is the heart of the movie and gives a solid performance that puts many adults to shame. He has braces and takes a puffer for asthma making him seem more vulnerable and innocent but he's not weak at all. I have to say, I loved when Chunk started confessing every naughty little thing he's ever done. And of course the part when he suddenly stopped talking and noticed some ice cream. Anyway, good movie.",

They never shut up for a moment in most of the scenes. Donner's \"don't tell it, yell it!\" direction makes for a fingernail's down the blackboard effect. The fat little kid, for whom there are not enough meals in the day, is particularly annoying - also because there isn't much funny about obesity, particularly in a 10 yr. old.

I never watched the film back in the day, so I have no nostalgic reverie for it. The late 70's to mid 80's had the greatest comedy/adventure and adventure films ever made: Indiana Jones, Jaws, Close Encounters, E. T., BIG, Back to the Future(s)! But Goonies doesn't belong on ANY list of fun-film greats. It simply sucked. Pure and simplistically- just like the 'worse than luke warm' adventure plot. Did I mention the non-stop, yelling chatter?

It has all the elements of a child's imagination: pirates, booby traps, villains, perils in the chase, good buddies, a map, the threat of losing all they hold dear. It captures the imagination.

I was 10, roughly the same age as the lads and here was a film with a raucous sense of humour, strong child characters and large-scale plot which has made this film a multi-generational classic, with our parents, us as parents and our children all investing in the spirit of adventure of The Goonies.Named after the Goon Docks of which they inhabit, a group of kids, after finding a treasure map, decide that this is their last chance to save the town, which is to knocked down in favour of a Country Club. This leads them on an adventure through the booby-trapped underground catacombs of the town, as they follow the map to One Eyed Willie's treasure.They get mixed up with the Fratelli's, a matriarchal crime family who get wind of the treasure and follows them into the caves.The first ting that struck me about this, is after all these years what that it was still fun, enjoyable and even though I might not bother watching by myself, I would defiantly enjoy seeing again with the right audience. The raucous nature of a group of children together in a room is captured so expertly here, with a young Sean Austin, now famous for his portrayal of Samwise Gamgee in the Lord Of The Rings trilogy, holding the pack together; but the chaos is portrayed perfectly.The language is good here too, with casual swearing amongst the kids, meaning that this must be one of the rare family films to truly capture the interplay between tweenage and teenage kids. Overall, this is a classic for all the right reasons, with the story by Steven Spielberg with only goes to further reinforce his status as one of Hollywood's greatest visionaries and a sharp, tight screenplay by Chris Columbus, who penned Gremlins the previous year and went on to direct the first two, but the weakest two Harry Potter movies.There is also the questionable issue of the way that the Fratelli's treat Chunk. When you think about it he is threatened with torture after being kidnapped and spending time with the murdered corpse of two 'Feds' who have been shot in the head, murdered in cold blood.I love this, treating the horror in a mature way, allowing it to used as humour but in a way to playfully scare kids, which it does. It is fun, but I do wonder where the PC brigade would let some of these plot points go in to a child friendly romp in 2011? I hope so, as it is the combination of elements that made this film what it is today.",

I feel there is a lot of nostalgia tied to a movie that hits a generation of individuals at just the right time for them to be memorable to these people. Sometimes, these cult classics are movies that I didn't get around to seeing-especially when they were relevant to my friends. For whatever reason, The Goonies (1985) has eluded me for 35 years. I can certainly see its appeal, but I mostly just watched it and wondered why people thought it was so great.I will say that this film is a trip down memory lane in the sense that I don't think I've ever seen a movie with either Sean Astin or Josh Brolin as young as they were in this one. The fact that many meme-able moments from this film have lasted in the popular culture zeitgeist for so long is a testament to its powerful nostalgia. Having never seen The Goonies until now, I already knew it was about pirate treasure and the adventure a rag-tag group of kids embarks on to recover it.All this being said, The Goonies is weird. I felt like its first act dragged along, and it didn't get interesting until about half-way through (when it entered its Indiana Jones phase). Plus, there were almost too many subplots that seemed to be included to pad the run-time on an already light plot. Sure, each of the kids had their own adventure along the way, but did it need to include \"Sloth\" (John Matuszak)? If anything, I found The Goonies to be a bit insensitive to the disabled, as well as to Asians-with the Asian stereotype being played for laughs more often than not.A cult classic that I couldn't get into, I give The Goonies 3.0 stars out of 5.",

            "content": "This past weekend a local theater in my hometown showed Steven Spielberg's \"The Goonies\" on the big screen. I made it a point to go, as this is one of those movies that I know that I'd seen a time or two when I was a kid, but I also somehow managed not to ever see it in a theater when it came out. That may have been due to the slight bit of language in the film, which my mother probably deemed inappropriate for a seven year old. But what I know is that this is the kind of film that I either had watched at a friend's house during a sleepover or on TV with alterations, and as such was a movie that I had seen in bits and pieces, but perhaps not all the way straight through. At the very least I hadn't watched it in a very long time.Having now viewed the movie in a theater as an adult, I can say that it's an 80's masterpiece. The film follows a group of boys all of whom appear to be about 12 years old, along with their older, high school aged brother and a couple of girls from his school, all of whom set out (some unwittingly) on a scavenger hunt to find a buried treasure. The hunt finds them encountering a group of thieves who had robbed a bank in the movie's opening scenes, and the basic gist of the film is the hunt for the treasure while trying to evade these antagonists.What makes this movie special is that it's such a wonderfully told story, with fun characters and childish humor that is at both one and the same time juvenile and yet endearing. The film is perfect for youth who are coming of age, with a style that encompasses both child fantasy and adult themes. It's a great film for 11-15 year olds, but also for adults who just like fun movies. As I mentioned above, there is a very slight bit of language in the film, so perhaps my mother was right for not letting me see it as a seven year old. But, again, older kids should love it.The real genius of this movie, though, is that it's a perfect example of an iconic 80's teen movie. It's wonderfully hokey but still a real pleasure to watch.

Chunk's behavior may make the viewer want to cast him out, but his friends never even consider it. In a way, the boys' fellowship is emphasized by contrast with the relationships among the teenagers portrayed which already are distorted by dominance issues and sexual attractions.

It's The Hardy Boys with Annie, The Breakfast Club, and Romancing the Stone thrown in.The most interesting thing is how Columbus' script handles the kids. Compared to the script for Home Alone, where Hughes treated an eight-year-old like an alienated teen, Columbus makes these kids into the archetypes we've been seeing all along--only slightly better than 'Gremlins'.  There's the fat kid, the jock, the nerd/inventor, the braggart, the worrywart, and their feminine counterparts.  This is more collective than his pedestrian work on the 'Harry Potter' movies.Since this is really Spielberg's movie, he is the most concerned about getting the right crew.  As such, he brings along his better editor, Kahn, and the sound crew from Raiders.  Furthermore, Steven gets a director known for self-play to manage everything and lets Donner organize the rest of the crew.Astin probably learned a few things about exploring for his later roles in the Lord of the Rings trilogy.  Feldman also took a few cues from this for both Stand by Me and Lost Boys--there's even the lardass spin-off.  Davi and Pantoliano are Columbus' obvious inspiration for the Wet Bandits.Spielberg reuses material from his second 'Indiana Jones' movie including Ke Quan and the environment.  The production design is Star Wars in detail, a Henson level of detail.  The biggest problem rests in the photography.  Nick McLean is one of the worst cinematographers ever and his work on Spaceballs and now TV, it's clear that he was never meant for cinematic images.  Image if Spielberg had ringed Dean Cundey, Allen Daviau, or even Bill Butler into 'Goonies' instead.  Even the finale, crucial for a kid/family film like this, is done in a humdrum and bored fashion.But this film is simple.  It's filled with Spielberg's usual 80s symbolism, but none of the sentimentality of E.T.  That's 'Goonies': a Star Wars story set in the a child's reality.  That's the most interesting aspect.

            "content": "The Goonies is a mixed bag of a film. On one hand, it delivers a delightfully mysterious journey for lost treasure. On the other, it is full of conveniences, clich\u00e9s, and a lot of noisy banter. Without experiencing the apparent widespread nostalgia for this movie, it therefore feels a bit overrated. This being said, there is much that makes the film overall worth a recommendation. The cast is undeniably fun to see, as many have either gone onto greater success or were at least stars of the '80s. This especially pertains to Astin and Brolin, who happen to play brothers within. Astin gives a solid act in the main role, too, clearly displaying his role's determination to find the treasure of One-Eyed Willie. Further, the character's motivations stay consistently geared towards this just for the sake of his family's welfare. This emotional component undoubtedly drives the plot past many other treasure hunting stories. There is a good amount of comedy, as well, a result of Feldman's and Cohen's often funny dialogue and interactions with others. Who really steals the show are the antagonists, though. Ramsey is great as the criminal mother, between hilariously bossing her grown children around to the ruthlessness she characterizes. As far as the actual adventure, the traps to be maneuvered prove intriguing and even build tension in multiple scenes. This is helped by a very good score. Unfortunately, this film additionally falters on many of these fronts. The acting all-around is fine, but most characters are one note and rather clich\u00e9d. The audience never gets to learn about most of these characters beyond their suggested personality. There is additionally a romance aspect that has no business being inside the film, as it completely takes away from focusing on the brotherly bond that could have been emphasized in an impactful way. This is especially a shame considering there are just way too many roles present, leading to the aforementioned relentlessly annoying moments where characters talk over one another to create noise more than anything else. Happening all too often, there is no time to rest, and this is not because of any sort of quick pace. This feels awkward when there is simultaneously not all too much plot beyond a few traps. How conveniently certain skills are planted and thereafter used is obviously blatant, too. Overall, then, The Goonies is at least worth a one time watch, but maybe nothing more for those not caught up on nostalgia.",

The actors are doing a nice job, you can't complain about that, and the story itself isn't even boring nor weak. What I didn't like was the odd malformed guy. I did neither like his character nor his physical appearance. He's so dumb, in my eyes. So, what do I make of The Goonies? It's oversubscribed and unrealistic, the characters are unidimensional and the plot is witty but surreal. However, it has some good and entertaining bits.

Once a film reaches that status any form of critique based on technical or artistic achievement becomes meaningless. Perhaps the reason this film strikes a chord is that it spoke to a generation which still hadn't been polluted completely by video and computers.  Videos were still pretty new and most households did not have a VCR.  AOL was just three letters in the alphabet.  Kids still had the opportunity and time to explore and use their imagination.  In this respect the film speaks to all childhoods up through the 1980's and can be enjoyed by all generations up to that era.  Of course, today's children can also enjoy the film but unfortunately they may not identify with this type of adventure.  However, it may inspire today's kids to go outside and use their brains and imagination instead of their remotes or keyboards and therefore giving this film more strength than it had the first time around. Incidently, during the eighties Mr. Speilberg enjoyed placing Disney icons in his films (try looking for them in E.T., Poltergeist, the Indy films, 1942, etc...)  In this film, his production crew copied the set pieces of the Disneyland ride Pirates of the Caribbean for the Pirate Ship/Treasure Cave scene.  In an era when movies are turned into rides (especially Speilberg movies like Jurassic Park, Back to the Future, etc...) it's neat to see a ride turn into a movie!",

            "content": "Tonight's movie review is in memory of the great Richard Donner the man who was behind the awesomeness Lethal Weapon series, Scrooged, Conspiracy Theory and the timeless movie Superman. Since this review is paying tribute, tonight's movie review will be children epic adventure The Goonies (1985). Believe it or not this is my first time watching this film this past week and since then I have gone back and forth to question why this particular flick has influenced so many shows and movies including Stranger Things.The story to me is straightforward, what would a bunch of bored kids get up to on a rainy day? Well, in this case, they settled on an adventure to find hidden pirate treasure whilst evading a bickering family of Italian mobsters known as the Fratelli's. The kids are from a blue-collar \"Goon Docks\" district of Astoria, Oregon and a bunch of them are trying to figure out how to save their homes from demolition. When the kids find a map written in Spanish which will lead to pirate treasure, they use the motto of \"our time\" and go onto an epic underground cave adventure. The treasure belongs to the infamous pirate, One Eyed Willy.The film itself starts with a Jolly Roger symbol then a jailbreak and a car chase which has a throwback to the 1930s and 1940s slap stick chasing where the homage is the Spanish housemaid in the middle of the road of a car chase. We see heaps of 60s to 80s throwbacks including the iconic Prince's Purple Rain printed t-shirt worn by 80s child actor Corey Haim and the James Bond theme played while the character Data uses his gadgets to swing from house to house. All this is good and all but there are some mirky weird remarks including the statue reference - why?? And the supposedly funny translation from English to Spanish scene - again not so childlike for a kid's movie. There is one thing I have noticed in the film, the lack of diverse characters. And this isn't getting woke or anything, it was just weird only seeing every specific stereotype except for one diverse family.The movie itself is okay and has some cool parts including the cave waterslide part - any kids true dream to get on that slide and fly mid-air into a pool of water in the end. The scene where the Andy has to play the correct notes on a a skeleton style organ was cool as. There are some coming of age scenes including the pash between Andy and Mikey and Andy and the older brother Brand. All the kids are great and do an awesome part in the film. The scene stealer to me is Chunk, our typical American kid who loves to eat and loves action and is a klutz. Plus, his interrogation and confession scenes were hilarious. The villains in this film are great and the one who really stole the show to me is Anne Ramsey, including her determined look chasing the kids in the cave to telling Corey's character Mouth whether he would like to eat tongue after he was ordering a few Italian dishes. Sean Astin as Mikey was cool and showed that it doesn't matter if you have an asthma pump when you are a kid, you can still achieve anything. And of course, you have you have Sloth, every child's hope that monster lookalikes are in fact good wholesome individuals. Plus, he was wearing a Superman t-shirt.This plus the Cyndi Lauper rack of \"The Goonies 'r' Good Enough\" were a good mix and yes I did watch the Cyndi Lauper clip and it was weird as much as the film where colourful pirates are chasing Cyndi with a sheik in the background is impatiently waiting to demolish a family home. Plus, you have the Hibachi scene!!Going back to the film we see retro kids riding their bikes with mates, seeing a teenager reading guns and ammo in the restroom and a first kiss. But to me this isn't a classic 80s kids film. At best a once or twice over, not a cult classic to me but it's still a good time, overall 7/10.",

I just watched it again on DVD, and it is still pretty good, although somewhat uneven. I think it would have been even better if it had taken place in an old house or a forest or something, instead of the set-like tunnels it actually takes place in.

Because in my opinion, the older ones serve as reminders of how it used to be.I remember when I was that age, and I watch them on bikes and hanging out in their 'goonie' world. It is (excuse the oxymoron) almost exactly how I used to act with friends when the world was our own magical empire. We were never out to hurt anyone and we knew everyone in the neighbourhood and they knew us. The worst thing that could happen to us as kids was getting called in to supper when it got dark.I'm giving this film a ten, because of what it represents and how it does things. It reminds me how things used to be before I had to start being responsible for my life on a bigger scale.I think, though society has changed and kids are just not the same anymore (me being second generation in my late twenties), there is a goonie in everyone somewhere, and this film brings it out, and makes me laugh every time. It takes me back, excuse the clich\u00e9, to the wonder years.",

These include: when Chunk spots the police chasing the Fratelli's and runs over to window and spills shake on himself. Also, the part when Chunk does the dance at the Walsh's house so they will let him in, when Jake Fratelli is too stupid to know what up means, and when they find the hidden treasures.I like how Chunk takes in Sloth at the end.

This really brings back the magic of childhood with its sense of wonder. The Goonies themselves are all memorable in one way shape or form. Sean Astin definitely deserved an award for this role as the de facto leader of the group, but you've got to hand it to Jeff Cohen (Chunk) for his acting ability. In fact he steals half the show with his antics (long live the Truffle Shuffle!). I love the traps the group encounters as they're all creative, my personal favorite is the bone piano; you certainly don't see that everyday. But the ending is just great when you find out hope is restored when Rosalita finds the gems to save the homes that Mikey stashed in his bag. I end this review with this quote: \"Hey you guys!\"",

Everything about this film, from production values to special effects to sets to music to camera work to editing is A+ and deserves all the accolades it can get. Apparently I need to add lines about the characters to get over the ridiculous minimum requiring padding even if you've said all that needs to be said in a line or two. Sean Astin is cute, asthmatic and vulnerable and will grow up to be a good character actor, and type cast as a Hobbit because he is short. Josh Brolin, Martha Plimpton and Corey Feldman continued on to OK careers as older characters. In short, the whole is much, much more than the sum of its parts and is altogether a work of genius.After another 5 years my opinion has not changed one iota. This is a 10+ fivestar film for the ages; it appeals to kids of all ages and adults also because we (I'm 65) can at least identify with at least one of the weirdo goonies. Forever.",

They make their way to a cave within the mountains to get to the X, while being pursued by a group of bandits. Classic story that everybody knows and loves, and I haven't until now.Actors Sean Astin, Josh Brolin, Corey Feldman, and others as kids, trying to find a pirate treasure, how can you go wrong. The characters are all unique in their own ways, and are fun to be around. Even the ones that are annoying, you learn to love. Chunk is a classic character, but when I saw him, it's like \"oh, they're trying to make him annoyingly charming, oh brother he's just annoying\", but by the end of the movie, he was one of my favorite characters, so funny. There's so much fantasy and excitement in the film, it just lifts you up and makes you want to experience it yourself.One thing i'll complain about is that writing in the first half of the film is just kids screaming at one another and not being able to hear what anybody is saying, it gets a bit thinner later one, but still. That's about it, other than that I enjoyed the film to no end. Such a good adventure that, while i'm sad to have missed out on as a kid, am so glad that I got to be a part of now.",

When you mix fantasy with reality, it should be handled very meticulously, there should be a fine line that not only separates fantasy and relaity both but also respects both the varieties. The Goonies literally fails here; when it began with some mild performances, I was put off by how the loud kids were, sure kids are meant to be loud and childish, but how come did they talk like how mature men do? How did they used the terminology of some aspects that was completely out of their thought process?Maybe this was the film made for kids and they liked it but I'm not sure if I should consider it as a coming of age film. No. It might have been a hit back when it released in 1985, but today it looks as if it just doesn't matter. I didn't care for most of the actors, except Josh Brolin cause he acted with sense. The guy who spoke fluent Spanish too was good enough. Everyone else didn't just catch my mind. I expected some real strong emotional bonding like the kids ahd in Stand By Me. Here what I saw was just simple mischiefs and trying to carry out abrupt laughter through them.

I first saw this one sixteen years ago and, as anyone from the era can tell you, it only gets better as you get older. Who knows what it is about this film?  I don't think it was inteneded as anything more than a good matinee time-killer, but when Spielberg and Donner set out to make this one with a cast of virtual unknowns, they created a true classic.  True, it's a cinematic mess, but a wildly entertaining, inventive, cinematic mass with a dose of good ole fashioned nostalgia.  I imagaine that if I had just now seen this movie for the first time, it probably wouldn't have had the same effect on me.  It does something that no other movie (with the exception of Back to the Future) has done for me. It takes me back to those rainy days, when I was a kid.  I still remember. You see, my house was the \"kool-aid\" house of the neighborhood and all my friends hung out there.  When the weather was too nasty for riding bikes or whatever, you could bet that the Goonies would be in our VCR and we would be kicked back with popcorn and sodas, laughing our asses off at Chunk doing the truffle-shuffle or the bumbling Fratelli brothers bickering and pulling guns on each other.Over the years, I've owned probably a half-dozen copies of this movie and I just got the DVD last August.  It was really cool to see the entire cast get-together for the audio/video commentary and see them arguing and laughing just like in the old days.  It's still a mystery to me why they never did a sequel.  With the popularity of this one, Hollywood would definitely have another Harry Potter on their hands.Although it may not have the same sentimental factor, I urge anyone who hasn't already seen this film to give it a try.  It's great for kids and who knows, maybe 8 year-olds who see this now will look back on it the way I do. Donner, If you're reading this, please round up the old cast, call up Spielburg and get to work on the Goonies 2.  We NEED it.",

Everyone's entitled to their own opinion and mine is that the action and characters are just plainly implausible and the whole film is just a bore from start to finish. I hear the excuse of \"it's a kids film\" and to me, that just seems like a poor excuse for a film you think is infallible because it's a nostalgic movie and was one of you're favourites growing up however sometimes people don't want to accept the truth and yet the truth is that it's actually just a ridiculous and stupid 2 hour mess!!! I have a good friend who I rely on for film recommendations and she said to me \"you've got to accept that it's an 80's kids film\" and I do, it's just that Back to the Future was released in the same year, merely 2 weeks apart, with the same certificate, and to me there isn't a comparison between which film is better.

In that film, Spielberg's tale was about a archaeologist, who tries to retrieve the Ark, which was stolen by the Nazis. The concept of \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" is also used in the new adventure film called \"The Goonies\". The Goonies tells the story about a bunch of kids, who lives in Astoria, Oregon. They like to go on certain types of situations together, considering that they're all misfits. When one of the kids stumbles upon a treasure map in his own attic that belongs to an old pirate named One-Eyed Willie, the Goonies set off on their last adventure. The problem is that greedy real estate buyers want to foreclosure the house and the kids must save it before it is gone. Well, the Goonies runs into troubles on their own as well, Three bumbling bad guys are also chasing and going after the Goonies as they descent more and more underground. I thought the underground set design was impressive though I had some questions about the caves and one concerning a well but, nevertheless, convincing. The idea of the underground caves is probably set to be a kids' hideout of some sort. But, never mind about that. Anyway, the film gets better as the kids falls through all kinds of booby traps. The booby traps are sort of ripped right out of the Indiana Jones movies, specifically the first one and the second one. The ideas behind this movie gets even more better. An giant man named \"Sloth\", who has a grotesque, deformed looking face, joined the gang, and also several girls are added to the list of characters. There is a lot of fun in The Goonies. I admired its energy and its style. But, there are questions that I ask myself when watching The Goonies. Those questions weren't important as the movie. Basically, this is nothing more than a funny, exciting, thrilling teenage adventure story. One other thing that I didn't mention. Some of the young actors who played the Goonies, like Sean Astin and Josh Brolin were good as the roles they presented. And, also, I enjoyed the supporting characters as well. Anne Ramsey, who plays the mother of the two criminals who are chasing the kids in the underground caves is pretty good is this movie. She's convincing and intimidating as the supporting character. \u2605\u2605\u2605 3 stars.",

The Goonies is the cr\u00e8me of the crop when it comes to 80's cult classics and the legacy is almost unmatched. The story is a simple pirate treasure hunt tale taking place in 1980's Oregon. But as the Goonies navigate their way to One-Eye Willy's treasure, their journey is full of heart and friendship. Not to mention a long list of iconic quotes and scenes. The Wishing Well scene alone can be quoted by every cultured swine between the \"goonies never say die\" line and the \"it's our time down here\" speech. With action, comedy, and emotion, this film is the perfect balance as all things should be after 35+ years providing nostalgia for multiple generations.Yeah.... So Samwise Gamgee plays Thanos's kid brother in this film. Pop culture icon, Sean Astin, and Josh Brolin lead the rest of the cast with Jeff Cohen, Corey Feldman, Ke Huy Quan, Kerri Green, & Martha Plimpton by their side. Cohen's performance as Chunk is legendary. And Plimpton as Stef is such a mood. My favorite thing about the cast is how well they are together in every scene. Their chemistry on screen allows all the kids to just be so present with every line and sequence. Comedic dialogue always hit and the emotional scenes made me believe they really were a close nit group of friends.No question that the Goonies became a staple image of the \"oddball group of friends\" and you can really see that in similar stories, like Strangers Things (even without Sean Astin in season 2). Firstly, the film perfectly captures the spirit of an innocent childhood adventure while also being a coming-of-age story. Paired with that, this is a pack of quirky outsiders that thrive when they're together. The Goonies, themselves, are insanely relatable. So we're emotionally attached to these kids as they begin they're exciting journey to find treasure. It's a simple and effective formula that just works.",

But reading some recent comments I just want to add a few words.This movie passes the test of years very good.  I saw it few days ago for the first time, together with my teenage kids who watch South Park, Resident Evil and other action, horror, violent movies made last few years, that I never heard of (and don't want to).  But they were delighted watching Goonies.  My fifteen year old sun said \"Now I'll have also something to recommend in school!\".  And I like that the main characters are \"real\" kids.  Today so many movies show early years of movie heroes.  First it was in cartoons (\"Young Tom&Jerry, then Bungs Bunny\"), but later we have young Indiana Jones etc. It seems noone has imagination to make new kids characters, so I'm expecting to see young Schindler as a kid-hero of WWI, or young Rocky as sport star of his college.  Some scenes probably couldn't be made today, especially in \"PG\" movies, because US censors and movie-makers protect children (releasing South Park in the same time - \"not for children\" of course, so they get even more interested in it).  But this scenes make the characters much more real, and give the movie less sterile look as many recent movies have (unless they're made in France, Sweden or somewhere else in  Europe).And one remark that might be dropped out and swept away by the administrators, but I'll write it anyway.  I read a comment posted by DonFreidle.  It was a bit surprising, so I took time to read his comment list, and found out that he signs himself each time from different place or even continent (Europe, North or Latin America...) and his comments are sometimes distasteful, sometimes humiliating - all of that is his right if he feels it and it's his style; but these comments are often misleading (read e.g. what he wrote about Kubrick's 2001).  Suggestion: when you decide to watch some movie or not according to comments in IMDb, and find something like this (he is not the only one, of course!) read some of poster's other comments to understand him as the person and make a final decision only after that!

            "content": "The Goonies is a movie that's inevitably going to show up on most all lists dealing with films of the 80s. While it does include its fair share of references to a good bit of 80s culture, the biggest draw I found with the movie is in the story. By no means is this a claim to boast it as being the most original story, but the smaller decisions to use a younger cast, focus on a classic pirate storyline, and root it with such relatable dialogue and characters is where the magic happens. \nThe Goonies thrives from the kids. The careful casting, writing, and direction that went into making each kid their own special character is what has propelled the movie for decades. The stoic nature of Mikey plays perfectly off the perfectly named Mouth. The inclusion of the gadget based Data gives the movie a nice geeky side, and the cherry on top is in the form of the scene stealing Chunk. Then while the movie makes the smart decision to maintain its focus on the kids, the short fray into the teenagers subplots provides an enjoyable draw for the adolescent age group as well. Parents of today can then turn around and reminisce on the adventurous joys that came with being a kid in the 80s.Unfortunately a common argument that plagues a certain amount of films of every decade, but can stick out at times here is the technical aging of The Goonies. The dialogue dubbing, outdated special effects, and cheesy one liners can be distracting at times. In addition, the teenage subplot while minimal feels very artificial and last minute. However, at the end of the day, The Goonies lighthearted, feel-good story, dialogue, and characters cement it in the Pantheon of 80's Classics!",

            "content": "Released in the summer of 1985, The Goonies is the film that I always bring up when I challenge one's coolness. Everyone is entitled to their opinion but what you need to know in order to appreciate this film is that it's purely and simply, a fun adventure film. While yes, the script isn't the most clever ever written, I think that Chris Columbus brings enough character development and well written action scenes along with a lot of heart that makes it a really well laid out screenplay.Steven Spielberg had been in the spotlight for 10 years at this point, thanks to the success of Jaws (1975), Close Encounters Of The Third Kind (1977), Raiders Of The Lost Ark (1981) and most especially, E.T. (1982), which was in its day the highest grossing film in history. All films are absolute perfection in my mind and show us why we go to the movies to begin with. Spielberg was now everywhere and not only the most powerful director in Hollywood but also the most powerful producer. By now, he was even showing his talent as a producer and it was one hit after another. With Poltergiest (1982), Gremlins (1984) and the mega hit Back To The Future (1985), Spielberg could do no wrong and proving that unlike most directors and producers, he clearly knows what the audience wants but also what works and what doesn't.Which brings me to The Goonies. Spielberg originally came up with the story but brought in Gremlins writer and future director Chris Columbus to write the screenplay. He then hired Richard Donner, best known for films like The Omen (1976) and Superman (1978), to direct the film. In my opinion, one of the things that makes this film work so well (besides the script and the actors) is Richard Donner's direction. He brings a sense of excitement and also, tension to the screen. From the very first scene involving a jailbreak, this is a director who knows how to make a movie I think, his camera work and directing of the actors is amazing, it gets you hooked into the story which I have to give credit to Donner. Sometimes I wonder if the movie would have been just as great if Spielberg directed the film himself and don't get me wrong, Spielberg is one of the best directors in my mind but Donner's approach is something to be acknowledged. I actually think it's his film in a way.So yes, I do consider this a cinema classic. It's a film that we can all connect with. I remember one review on IMDb pointing out how this film unifies us and I couldn't have said it any better. Anytime you say The Goonies, people know exactly what you're talking about and they always quote a line from the film. This is the true definition of a cinema classic in my mind, a film that is loved all over the world and it's not just a part of pop culture. I would place this movie up there with Citizen Kane or Casablaca as silly as that may sound to some. If you're a movie lover like me who loves to go to movies to feel uplifted or just have a good time, then this movie is for you.",

            "content": "The Goonies is another of my favorite movies of all time. Who hasn't watched this many times over the years? When I was growing up many friends wanted to go on adventures like the kids in this movie.Mikey, Mouth, Chunk, Data and Brand are the Goonies. They find a treasure map and all except Brand think it will lead to something. Something that will save their homes. They have to over come obstacles and booby traps as well as being chased by three dangerous criminals, the Fratellis. They enlist the help of Andy and Stef along the way. Another enlistee is an unlikely ally in Sloth, who is a Fratelli, but is mistreated because he is physically and mentally impaired.The Goonies first encounter the Fratellis at an old restaurant along the coast. The restaurant is the starting point for the treasure map. They decide to wait until the Fratellis leave to explore the restaurant. The Fratellis come back unexpectedly while the Goonies are in the basement. Their only way out is to go through a secret passage in the fireplace. Chunk is left behind because he got trapped in a freezer when they found a dead body. Chunk escapes the basement through a window but is later picked up at the side of the road by... the Fratellis.Meanwhile Mikey, Mouth, Data, Brand, Andy and Stef continue on with the treasure hunt. They come across several booby traps and the remains of a former treasure hunter. They find a key around the neck of Chester Copperpot, the dead treasure hunter, and then set off a booby trap that drops large boulders from high above that are meant to crush intruders.Next the Goonies find a well and they think for a split second that they have found the treasure. Unfortunately all they found was a wishing well. A suitor of Andy's, Troy, happens to toss a coin in the wishing well. The Goonies throw the coin back up and he offers to help them out of the well. Mikey talks the others into continue on the treasure hunt.Back at the restaurant the Fratellis question Chunk. After finding out that the tunnel in the fireplace really exists the Fratellis leave chunk tied up in the same room where Sloth is kept. Chunk and Sloth become friends. Sloth breaks free and helps Chunk to get free. Sloth hears his echo coming from the tunnel in the fire place and follows it, leaving Chunk no choice but to follow.While in the well the Goonies find another booby trap that nearly kills Data, but he saves himself by using his \"pinchers of Hell\". They climb down into another tunnel. Having decided to get a pitstop out of the way Andy decides that it is time to make a move on Brand. Brand sends Mikey to see what Andy wants and ends up getting kissed by Andy. Andy thinks it was Brand that she was kissing.The next obstacle is a log bridge over a raging river. Data is the last to cross and he sprays oil along the log to slow the Fratellis down. It works.The next booby trap the Goonies find is a piano made of bones with a skeleton as the a head piece. Andy has to play the notes on the back of the treasure map in order to help the rest of the Goonies to continue on their quest. If Andy fails to play the correct notes the floor will drop away and they will fall to their deaths. Each correct note opens a door little by little so they can keep going. Andy is able to play the correct notes just in time as the Fratellis are right on their heels.The Goonies escape and come to a water slide type obstacle. The treasure map turns out to be real. The Goonies find the treasure of One Eyed Willie. The Goonies start loading the treasure into their pockets. Mikey empties his marble bag and puts several jewels inside. But before they can gather any treasure and get away from the Fratellis, the Fratellis show up and capture them. Chunk and Sloth catch up to everyone and help the Goonies to escape.As the Goonies and the Fratellis escape the cave that One Eyed Willie's ship is in the cave walls begin to fall in, eventually allowing the ship to set sail again. The police find the Goonies and the Fratellis walking up the beach. The Goonies' parents are called and they all have a joyful reunion. Eventually the jewels are found in Mikey's marble bag and they help to save the homes of the Goonies' families.I was six years old when this movie came out. I loved watching this movie every chance I could. Now that I have it on DVD I can watch it every day if I want to. For a kids movie it's pretty good, even nearly thirty years old. The acting is pretty good for a bunch of child actors, not forced. The action is pretty good; the story was pretty good. A lot of comedy; a lot of laughs.",

            "content": "June 7th marked 30 years since the audiences first got to know the \"Goonies\". Whoa! Has it been so long? And is anybody still remembering this film apart from me? I honestly didn't expect there were so many people feeling so strongly about the movie, but it seems Goonies has indeed achieved cult status over the years (and decades). In retrospect, this is hardly surprising, considering the multitude of 80's films, both small and big, that have turned into classics. And Goonies exemplifies all the good qualities of the film fare of that time that made them unique. As for me, my story with the Goonies goes back a long time. I first got to see it on VHS in 1988 (apparently I was a little young to catch it in cinemas when it was first screened), instantly loved it and then by a fortunate turn of events I got to own a videotape copy of it. Over the next five years or so, it would be the subject of countless sessions, alone or with friends that got equally infected by the Goonies bug. There where times where I would get to watch it 4 times within the same day. I haven't kept track, but I figure my number of viewings must be approaching triple digits, definitely the one movie I have watched the most times, even though it isn't my favorite. From some point on I got detoxed, but even now I never decline a chance to see it again when it plays on TV. The film has also aged very very well, you can hardly tell it was shot 30 years ago, again, a testament to the production values of that time. Based on an idea by Steven Spielberg at the pinnacle of his creative period and scribed by a then up and coming Chris Columbus (before his mega-successes with Home Alone and the Harry Potter franchise), Goonies is an adventure cleverly employing good old recipes but at the same time infusing them with loads of originality. Lost pirate treasure hunt has never been done with more fun and brio than here. And the movie is also bursting with great humor and immensely quotable lines (a trade that seems to be almost extinct today), thanks to its superbly written script. Richard Donner's direction is top notch and takes full advantage of the terrific ensemble cast of all ages. Almost all of the about a dozen characters are fully fleshed-out and some of them easily turn iconic. Quite a feat for a little children's adventure! And let's not forget Dave Grusin's fabulous score. Or Cyndi Lauper!Above all else, Goonies is a film filled with the children's magic and wonder of the early Spielberg fare, and even if he is not behind the camera this time, his fingerprints on the final product are indelible. It really is a shame that similar movies are hardly made anymore today. Columbus managed to recapture some of the early Spielberg magic with the first of the Harry Potter films, it didn't last long though and wasn't picked up by other directors. I know I would definitely sign up for a new movie of this sort any day, even if I'm not a kid anymore. Sadly, most are now preoccupied with remakes and franchises instead of coming up with original ideas. I hope the Goonies is left untouched by the remake avalanche.",

My parents must have been attempting to get me and my brother into something.  I still love this film very much, even to this day, as an 18 year old.  Some of the comments on here are pretty negative.  Every American child around my age, maybe even older, has seen this at least once.I loved each character, especially Mikey, who was so cute!  Each character had a unique personality, and all of them had some memorable moments.  Two parts particularly tickled my fancy:  When Chunk is tied to a chair and is told to spill his guts, he confesses absolutely everything he has done. It's amazing what you can get from Chunk!  Also, the part where they slide out of the sewer system into the underground with the Pirate ship was classic, because Corey Felman, who as Mouth doesn't shutup, yells \"F***!\" when he comes out.  I actually found out how they did so many takes of that scene, and in every one of them, Feldman yelled the same word over and over. Eventually, they gave up and put it in the movie.  I also like Kerri Green as Andy, and Martha plimpton as Stef. Data and Brandon were also great characters.If you like kiddie flicks, or want to relive your childhood, I highly recommend this film!

            "content": "What is entertaining about this? I fail to understand what is so great about it. I am 13, I should be the target audience. I saw this movie during a kids film camp, and everybody thought it was so hilarious that.. what? Is it funny that a fat kid jiggles his fat and that there are kids cussing and whining. What really shocks me is that the kids in the camp loved this and hated \"Spirited Away\". IS MY GENERATION THAT STUPID?! I'm going to analyze this film a little further to prove my point, though:ACTING: The actors themselves aren't awful, although they become so annoying at times, you kind of wanted them to die. The one playing the kid with asthma was not captivating at all. He was bland and never showed any real emotion. The others weren't bad, and they probably did the best with the script they were given, which lead to my next point...SCRIPT: Oh yeah, this is where the movie gets awful. The script is just all around unoriginal. In 4th grade,(before I saw this film), I would write adventure stories that were at the same level of this. These stories I wrote were all, honestly: There's a group of kids they go on an adventure underground involving many obstacles like:balance beams, swinging axes, etc. they find treasure, then get out and return to normal life. Sound familiar? I mean, nothing original or interesting happens. I guess you could argue that the piano scene was O.K., but even that wasn't fantastic. The characters were beyond shallow, all bogged down to just stupid quirks. They have no depth and just come off as whiny. Don't believe me? Well, how much development do they have besides fat kid-wimpy, loves food,lies Asian kid-invents things main character- asthma, whispers teenage boy- works out other kid- tries to be cool, but is annoying. YOU NEED TO DEVELOP! but the one element of the movie that really pisses me off is the deformed brother that the villains were keeping in their basement. The fact that they could stoop that low to produce comedy is just horrendous. And what was funny about him? Was it funny that he couldn't talk properly and communicated through yelling? Was it funny that he was wearing a superman shirt? No, it's actually kind of sad, and I'm surprised a lot more people don't hate this movie for exploiting people born with physical deformities like that. They deserve as much respect as people, and this just cruelly makes fun of them.EFFECTS: The main reason I gave this film such a high rating is because the effects were really great. It wasn't beautiful, it was all very brown and gray, but I guess that isn't awful. That was at least pleasing to look at.Well, this is getting pretty long, so I think I'm going to stop. To summarize; while the special effects were great, that doesn't make up for undeveloped characters, a plain, boring script and just O.K. acting. I really, REALLY hate it, but if this is what appeals to you in a film,and it appeals to a lot of people, then just keep enjoying it. Just, don't ask to me to watch it with you.",

            "content": "There was a time before disassociated, mean-eyed teenagers, wore hooded tops, carried knives, bothered people on street corners, and passed the time drinking cider and daisy-chaining one another. This was a time when Michael Jackson moon-walked his way into the hearts of millions, Indiana Jones cracked his whip from jungle to desert, James Bond shot and slept his way around the world without a hint of self-mocking post-modern irony, and kids watched, enjoyed, and wanted to be in, The Goonies.Written by Stephen Spielberg, and directed by Richard Donner, The Goonies is a hugely entertaining film that encapsulates the naivety and sheer sense of adventurous fun that will forever be associated with the 1980's. The film follows the adventures of six friends led by Mikey Walsh, (Sean Astin) who in the best tradition of Robert Louis Stephenson's Treasure Island, find themselves hunting for the hidden treasure of the legendary infamous pirate One Eyed Willy. This is no idle adventure however as finding the booty will enable them to save their homes which face demolition to clear the way for a luxury country club.The film works so well because along with an exciting storyline, witty script, clever balance between comedy and tension, Spielberg, Donner, and the young cast have invested it with a youthful and at times anarchic energy that grabs the audience from the opening jail break right up until the closing credits. Anne Ramsey, Joe Pantoliano, and Robert Davi, play the villainous Fratelli family with just the right mixture of fun and menace. Mama Fratelli's 'tongue' is the only thing on the menu reply to a cocky request for food by Clark 'Mouth' Devereaux (the very funny Corey Feldman) is guaranteed to garner laughs aplenty, but through closed mouths of course.As well as the obvious nod to Stephenson, the film also lends from Bond, (Ke Huy Quan's gadget inventing 'Data' models himself on 007) Indiana Jones, (Spielberg's influence can be seen throughout the film but not least in the booby-trapped hidden caves) and also The Hardy Boys, and Scooby Doo. The tradition of youngsters roving off to have adventures and solve mysteries is not new, it can be seen in Ransome's Swallows and Amazons, Blyton's The Famous Five, Hitchcok's The Three Investigators, Lewis's Narnia books, and many other sources. They have all gripped our collective imagination at one stage or another and happily The Goonies does the same.The success of the film is helped in no small way by the impressive set design and location of the film in the leafy town of Astoria, Oregon. If ever there was a place in which adventure was to be had Astoria is it. Sit back then, relax, and free yourself of cynicism, because as an audience it is 'our time' to enjoy the magic that is The Goonies.",

I myself use the name in most of my monikers including for these reviews here at IMDb.With the advancement of film making capabilities The Goonies is starting to look dated, but I still enjoy every minute of it.

            "content": "The Goonies is a film that I think can be enjoyed by people of all ages, unless you're a pretentious film snob who will dismiss any film that wasn't made by Ingmar Bergman, Federico Fellini, Vittorio De Sica or Stanley Kubrick. The Goonies certainly isn't by any stretch a groundbreaking piece of cinematic history or a masterpiece deemed worthy of mountainous praise, but it is a movie that is cherished by children and adults alike for its simple, but lovable qualities.To keep it brief, the plot follows a group of children living in the Goon Docks suburb who are forced to move away from their homes that they love to make room for the development of a golf course. The children discover an old treasure map that supposedly leads to a fortune in precious stones and jewelery and so they go looking for it to save their homes.A very basic premise, but that isn't the only source of the film's appeal. The characters Mikey, Mouth, Data, Chunk etc are all lovable and are played wonderfully by some of the best child actors ever. Sean Astin (Lord of the Rings) and Corey Feldman (Stand By Me) especially. The other characters are very likable and all deliver great performances In combination with a likable cast of characters and a dire situation, The Goonies has a strong adventurous quality that cannot be easily replicated in a film such as this. The comedic value, although often very cheesy, is very high, notably the antics of Chunk.You'd think that I grew up with this movie considering the positive comments I have about it, but I really didn't. I only saw the film a year ago and instantly fell in love with it. It's a film that perfectly reminds us of the wonders of childhood and why children should appreciate the limited moments they have. It's also a film that manages to cheer me up regardless of how upset I may feel. Because of this, The Goonies demands infinite rewatches.It does sadden me that my parents never exposed me to The Goonies as a child, but I know that after experiencing it again and again, I will not make the same mistake and I sincerely hope that after reading my review that you will do the same. The creative minds of both Richard Donner (Lethal Weapon, Superman, The Omen) and Steven Spielberg (Jaws, Raiders of the Lost Ark, Schindler's List) should be praised.The Goonies is a film that takes you out of a complicated world, spiritually transports you back to childhood and entertains you marvelously from the opening scene to the end credits. I love this movie and if you're willing to lighten up, I'm sure you will too. Thank you for reading my review.10/10",

The menus are fun to play with, the special features include outtakes (including the infamous octopus scene), full length commentary featuring donner, and all the goonies (except sloth, who is deceased).  The best feature is the two part music video for Cyndi Lauper's \"Good Enough\" song. If you've never seen it, i'll describe it: it features lots of the original WWF wrestlers (remember when wrestlers were like super heroes and super villians not just a bunch of oversized rednecks?) like Andre The Giant and Rowdy Roddy Piper! The dvd is presented in widescreen, so you get that great movie experience you come to expect from DVDs.  The cut is remastered, of course.Nostalgia is very important with a movie like this.  It might not have the most original plot, or the best acting, but for anyone who grew up with this movie, it's possible that this movie can instil the greatest feeling of nostalgia in us 20 somethings.  I practically have to hold back the tears everytime I hear \"good enough.\"  Having the music video to remind me of those old saturday afternoon wrestling matches, a making of feature, and a brilliantly restored print, really brings out the nostalgia.

The pacing of the film and its set-up is perfection - the children have seeminly no way to save their beloved homes (the most important place to yound adolescents) but their is a glimmer of hope with a fluke attic based discovery; and we've all, at some stage, gone snooping around in the attic looking for treasure (usually only finding our dad's secret porn stashes, sadly).The Fratellis are the best crime family ever created (after the Corleones) it really is as simple as that.  Check out Ma Fratelli giving a young Sean Austin (Mikey) a glass of whisky, and when he looks on in shock, stating \"It's wet ain't it!\"Sloth is a living god, as is everyones favourite chuck-a-lunk Lawrence \"Chunk\".  Fieldman shines as \"Mouth\".My only problem with the film is that it was not made with the intention of ageing well - its cleary an eighties film - which is no bad thing if you are a buff of the era, but may be hard to stomach if you're new to the film.A bit of a sleeper hit, and a modern classic. 7/10  Highly recommend it.*For imdb users in Africa and India this may not apply.",

It was a thrill-ride of adventure, jokes, comraderie and sheer 80s icons too numerous to name (the combination of Corey Feldman, Sean Astin, Anne Ramsey, the kid who played Short-Round and a soundtrack featuring Cyndi auper is lethal in its 80s-ness). Seeing it again not only brought back memories, but reminded me of how a good movie can sometimes be the one that is so much fun it masks the absolute absurdity of its plot - something about a group of outcast kids searching for pirate booty to save their neighborhood from greedy developers (like I said, absurd...but so 80s, you know?). Add to the pros of \"Goonies\" its kitschy band of ragtag characters, some of whom stay with you (Sloth, Mouth and the irrepressible Chunk) and some who don't (the older brother, the girls), and you have a movie that stands the test of time, for better or for worse. Damn fine movie. The Goonies were, and are, good enough for me.",

It would be great to see a reunion movie of our favorite characters going on one more 'Goonie' adventure.  Probably won't happen, though. Sean's involved with that LOTR trilogy now.

            "content": "Some films defy true objective criticism since they hold so much affection in the hearts of viewers, and this would be one such movie. The '80s is one of the foremost decades for producing movies that were \"of their time\" and this is no exception. For many, the enchantment is closely tied to nostalgia for their childhood, and it is certainly true that many of the markers in our lifetimes are cultural references.However, as with \"Gremlins\" \u0096 which is slyly referenced in this movie \u0096 nostalgia tends to overlook the technical aspects of film-making. Objectively, \"The Goonies\" does not fare so well. Part of the problem is inherent in most of the cast being young children, and then asking them to all shout or scream loudly at once with their high-pitched voices, and have a murky sound mix try to cleanly catch the dialogue. Another problem is that once the gang set off on their quest down myriad tunnels and caves, with a restaurant fireplace substituting for the rabbit-hole, it is not easy to follow the trail and put together a sense of exactly where they are in each scene and how it ties to where they were in the last one. There are also times when the \"this is our time\" speeches by Sean Astin's character come off as being a little too heavy-handed.Yet another problem is the cutting of a couple of filmed scenes that cause slight disjoints in the narrative. Suddenly the treasure map is significantly damaged without due explanation, and there is a reference to an octopus that is nowhere to be found in the final print. The deleted scenes which explain these plot points are available on DVD.The film could also have used clearer elucidation in other places, including the attic scene in which the map is discovered, and perhaps a word or two of exactly why a pirate ship was off the Oregon coast pursued by the British as soon as the early 1600s. Not that the origin of the back-story makes or breaks this movie, which should be seen first and foremost as pure escapist fantasy. On that basis, the film comes through pretty well, and while it is not a particularly great movie, it does enough to merit the place it has in so many people's hearts.",

I haven'tbought the DvD yet, but I heard it's great, I'm really looking forwardto the audio commentary. My favorite parts in the movie are when Chunktries to give the candy bar to the deformed guy and it hits his head and then he cries, and Chunk gives a hilarious scream, the deformed guy,Sloth, is the most hilarious character, him and Mama Fratelli. Anotherone of my favorite scenes is when the Goonies are running from theFratellis and then Data puts the water from his shoes and it makes theFratelli's slip, and I loved the opening with the wonderful music andthe police chase introduces all of the goonies. I totally love thismovie. It's beautifully acted, directed, and written.

Even the car chase scene at the start which I hoped was gonna be exciting...was played simply for laughs and nothing else. The kids are likable enough...But only Feldman seems to Really deliver.My other Complaint was Sean Astin...I got nothing against him as an Actor....Its Just his Character..... His Character is so weepy and sentimental and goodie two shoes, that he got on my nerves after a while...When he lectures the others about continuing to find the Gold...or Crying to his dad about how he felt they had Failed....All Im thinking is...SHUT UP sean, I dont give a damn, Spare me.I liked Robert davi and joe pantiolo as the baddies...they bring something to the Film...

My friend told me it was a bit like Indiana Jones, so I was expecting a mixture of Spy Kids and Indie, which could be quiet good. But this was not the case.The film starts with some rather childish jokes, but I thought to myself, that this is a children's film. But then people started swearing and talking about drugs and sex, nothing too serious, but I wasn't expecting the `S' word. This made be wonder what the target age group for this film was. Of course there could also be censored versions of this film, but the one I saw was not.One of the children is Jonathan Ke Quan, who played a very similar part in Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom. I found his Goonies Character extremely annoying. He has these gadgets, like a boxing glove on a spring attached to his chest, which seemed kind of stupid to me. If you find jokes like this funny then you may enjoy this film. If not, you probably shouldn't watch it.The film starts of rather quickly and the bad guys are soon introduced. One of them is Joe Pantoliano, from The Matrix and Memento. I liked his character in The Matrix and Memento, he seemed kind of smart and made a good bad guy. I thought he might be the same in The Goonies. No such luck, in the Gonnies he plays a really stupid bad guy with a wig that drops of, he reminded me of Daniel Stern in the Home Alone movies.The Story, which is by Spielberg who doesn't do that much writing, could have been better. It didn't seem interesting enough. And not that much really happens in Chris Columbuses Screenplay. I can't really remember much of the middle of the film, which normally means I either fell a sleep or I got really bored and started daydreaming. I had this problem with Gangs Of New York.At the end of the film, I felt that Sean Astin's character, Mikey should have been more developed. The story seemed to be mainly about him, but he didn't really have many lines. I suppose a child wouldn't really be bothered by this much. But a good children's film should be suitable for older people too. Or it wouldn't really be a Family Movie.I can't think of anything good to say about this movie, I didn't like it much. It wasn't all that bad though, I still found it slightly entertaining. But I enjoyed Spy Kids a lot more. I give this film 3 out of 5.",

This is not an endorsement or a review about the quality of DVD over VHS, but this is one film that truly deserves a re-visitation in its digital format.  Richard Donner daunted - yet driven - succeeds in directing a child cast in a Hardy Boys/Indiana Jones adventure about friends who seek long lost buried treasure to save their doomed homes from being torn down.  With so much at stake, Donner swiftly spins a lightly brushed, heavy-hearted film with strong character interactions, development and teamwork.  There is a great sense of innocence in all the characters, who fight for what is right and predictably overcome great odds (what do you expect from a good family film?).  The visuals are sometimes breathtaking (almost like a homeage to the seaside coast of Oregon).  The soundtrack is intermittenly sweeping.  It's a funny, over-the-top kids adventure that wins because it gave, and still gives kids a sense that they can do anything if they stick together and never give up.  \"Goonies never say die!\".

In this case here, it's to stop evil bad guys from hurting them and saving their homes from foreclosure and having to move away.Watching this movie now does bring back some serious nostalgia, even if a lot of the dialogue is really cheesy. ;) Perhaps the best aspect of this film is the adventure tied to it. Watching a bunch of kids overcome obstacles that stumped adults and the hilarity that comes with trying to outwit their nitwit enemies, the Fratellis, makes for a silly and entertaining adventure!

This film has lots of rough and tumble and could be described as somewhat rambunctious but isn't that what being a kid is all about?",

            "content": "This may sound really puerile, but this film has been one of my personal favorites for years.  Sure, it's about a bunch of obnoxious kids with perfect one-liners, a family of Italian crooks, snobby country club owners, booby (that's what I said, BOOBY!) traps, a goliath who looks like he spent the summer in a meat grinder, and more, more zaniness.  This all accumulates, of course, into a plot of finding a lost pirate ship, inexiplicably trapped within a cave by the sea.  The clever kids must use these jewels to salvage their small beach town from manipulative rich people.  (The special effects along the way are better than the computer ones recylcled astronomically today.)  I've nearly memorized all the lines, and the opening scenes never cease to appease me: THE TRUFFLE SHUFFLE!  This film is resourceful if you're looking for stuff by Sean Astin (\"Rudy\") or the director Richard Donner (\"Lethal Weapon\" series).  The screenplay is also by Chris Columbus, if anybody remembers who he is.  For a swashbuckling morality tale, I'd recommend this to anyone with an enduring inner-child.",

The boys are followed by Mickey's brother Brand (Josh Brolin), Stef (Martha Plimpton) and Andy (Kerri Green). Through their adventure they meet twisting passages and outrageous booby-traps.

We would imagine, pretend and if I was a treasure hunter in some respects I think this movie shows how I would go about doing it ... mistake after mistake I would make but somehow I'd keep my sights on a goal and wouldn't stop til I reached it. Chunk had some funny lines including the one where he was asked to tell everything and he then proceeds to tell the bad guys his whole life story and then tells them the worst thing he did which was to pretend to barf and then he threw fake barf over the railing and it landed on people and it made everyone around that start barfing .... pretty funny life this kid had.It was also interesting to see product placement in the movie as that was not a regular thing back then and only in the last 3 or more years has it become common.I like the Chinese guy's gadgets and how they always seem to be flawed but at different points through the movie he somehow saves them from hurt or death but at the same time causes a few nerve-wrecking moments.Anyway it was a fun movie .... better than what has come out of theaters this Summer of 2005 although Star Wars was pretty good ....",

So many films aimed at kids are too cutesy and gloss over the more serious points in life. This film doesn't and has a realistic feel to it, maybe not in the actual events portrayed but in the feelings of the children in facing a family crisisWhen I was a kid this film scared me pretty good and its not silly like Scooby Doo or tosh like Inspector Gadget. More like Indiana Jones or Star wars. I'm 28 and I don't care who knows I still watch it!!!I thought the acting was good considering some of the complicated lines, Chunk I found very funny and he has some classic scenes in the film. The stereotypes are fun and are not done in a negative way, the bad guys are truly bad and played without overdoing the humour - we can still laugh at them and be frightened without going too far either wayI think this was destined to be a cult film because its not one of those forgettable easy to market films, the effort went into the script and the story telling instead. Theres not even any real hero's, just a bunch of everyday kids doing cool stuffI would recommend this film to anyone with children who don't get scared too easily and every adult, don't be boring and have some fun!Major Spoiler: I always noticed how they didn't get to keep all the treasure in the end, only a few jewels.

I came home from a long Saturday night and it happened to be on. As I was watching all the nostalgia came rushing back to me(about where Cyndi Lauper starts singing \"Goonies R Good Enough\"). What a great movie, you will never see something like this made today, it had some mature themes(although nothing really that bad) and kids were allowed to be kids back then. What's great about it is that the kids are real, swearing and all, and are not being tracked on GPS like many kids of today. Some people complain about the acting and the dialogue, but what are people expecting from a movie targeted towards children and preteens? The main attraction in movie's like this is the adventure, and with a man like Spielberg behind it, the adventure sure didn't disappoint. Adding the production values of a summer blockbuster adventure to a children's movie was pure genius. Anyone who can't appreciate this movie was probably forced against their will to do the \"Truffle Shuffle\" when they were younger.",

This was when Widescreen was a brand new cinematic invention, and we thought it was way cool to see this movie being shown of such surround screen magnitude in a theater that for our time (the 80's) was known as \"upgrading\". The sound quality had much improved, thanks in part to LucasFilm studios, and the cinema scope (modernized for 21st Century) difference was incredibly awesome. We sat in the theaters, completely mesmerized by all the special effects, sound, and camera takes that previous teen films really didn't offer too much of. And the incredible 'water slide' scene towards the ending, alongside that magnificent pirate ship, sent shivers down everyone's spine, with incredible tingling sensations. We were all still commenting about the incredible experience, many years later.This film touches me in so many emotional ways, embellishing from back in my childhood:: Here we have a group of misfit kids, who call themselves the \"Goonies\", being they live in a historical old section of a seaside village the wealthy yucks want to selfishly demolish in order to build a fancy golf course, with no recognition or acknowledgment of the residents' place, considering the area the \"slums\" or \"goon-docks\" (moderning,'back woods hillbilly-types') as they are thought of the \"lesser\" people's. Saddened and deeply troubled by the assumed outcome, brother's Brand and Mikey bond together, and try desperately to think of some way they can possibly help their working-class parents, along with the rest of the working-class neighborhood parents, keep the village free from the greedy hands of the developers. If only money was not the sleazy issue. As the story continues, along comes Mikey's small group of closest pals, nicknamed Mouth, Data, and Chunk, who fully understand their pals' plight. And humorously, bend to the affections of Brand (who inadvertently cannot take the boys anywhere, being he 'flunked' his driver's test), with methodical teasing the inability to cruise the town, etc. (mainly Mouth's comments). In order to ease the tension, sadness and pain, the boys farewell takes them into Mikey's attic, where a sudden turn of events brings them upon an old pirate treasure map. Of course at first the kids are skeptical, considering it just a piece of dad's untouched, stored antique collection, until one of the boys remembers rumors of an old legend of the village, of pirate adventure. Mikey is at first the only one who takes the legend seriously, and pockets an old Chalst found inside the map. Soon after, he convinces his pals to go searching for this buried treasure, because \"what if\"??? If there is indeed a secret buried treasure out there, then they already have the map to go find it, ease the boredom, do something exciting and adventurous for a change, and not continue moping around the house, feeling sorry. Alas, Mikey and friends go treasure hunting, only to run into the infamous Fratelli clan, notorious bank robbers on the loose, but then manage to escape, and continue embarking on their treasure-hunting journey towards the riches each of them only ever dreamed of. The Fratelli's get hot on their tale, once they find out about the map too...Then meet Sloth, the kindly 'Giant' who gets befriended by Chunk (whom the Fratelli's take hostage), then escapes, and goes searching after the friends. Throughout all the special effects, the Indiana Jones-like adventure, and musical score, next up we get first-hand at the camera-revealing pirate mystery, as the incredible buried \"lost\" ship is finally revealed in all its resplendent glory. The Frateli's eventually catch up with the \"Goonies\", threatening to defeat their riches pursuit, but are then taken down by Sloth and Chunk. The Goonies escape from the hidden cave, but not without sobby farewells....as the cave starts to unravel...Here come the Press and the worried folks, at the end, the kids getting their moments of news fame as the Fratelli's are finally apprehended. Then the climactic moment, while the Press is interviewing everybody....a secret legend is finally revealed a historical fact. \"Holy Mary, mother of God...\" the officer rasps. The pirate ship is seen, finally escaping its 300 year imprisonment, as the kids and Sloth watch it sail away...in the sunset. Mikey makes his final remarks, and blows the ship a kiss (ahhhh, thanks One-Eyed Willy).PEANUT",

And would I really have to kill so many people? The danger still has to be real, though. And I'd want my friends to be there. But where would I ever be able to find an ancient treasure trove that offers all these nuances without leaving my home town? Hmmm....My 9th favourite movie of all time. Sean Astin gives another flawless performance...and at age 12 to boot! Everyone else in this movie rocks, too. Every scene works perfectly and is filled with humour, thrills, and a lovely yet very true-to-life sense of friendship. This movie gets better each time I watch it, largely due to the fact that in becoming more and more familiar with the gang, they become good friends of yours. Which means you get to be one of the Goonies too.",

There's lots of skeletons and booby traps along the way, plus the threat of the Fratelli's, a family of robbers and murderders, catching them. From the silly chase scene at the start, to the grand finale, The Goonies is infectious entertainment. Although flatly directed by Richard Donner, the special effects and the kids are great fun to watch. The kids act like real kids, and the sharp script by Chris Columbus gives them realistic dialogue. The action scenes are standard Spielberg fare: bats attacking, skeletons popping out, and a deranged piano organ.Some of the fright effects can get a little grisly for younger children, and the film is usually edited when shown on television.

Since I was only 5 at the time, there are scant images remaining from that first showing. One being my Dad laughing his ass off during the interrogation scene between Chunk and the Fratelli's and a poster for Psycho II out in the lobby. It wasn't until this film came to video that I started fiending for it like a speedfreak on pay day.From a one year period between 1987 and 1988 I must have seen this movie at least 2-3 times a week. I knew every line by heart and I even went out and bought as many packs of the Goonies Trading Cards I could get my grubby little hands on. I always kept on getting the card where they get attacked by the octopus. This always p***ed me off because there was never any scene with the octopus in any frame that I ever saw. I must have seen the flick about 75 times by then and still no frickin' octopus. Damn Richard Donner and his scissor happy editing.Anyway, by the time I got to third grade I was so burned out on the movie that I refused to watch it for over ten years. But when I did finally see it again, the magic was still there. This has to rank as one of the best kid flicks of all time. I say that because it doesn't tone down on the swearing content. Some parents would argue with me on that point but it's time to face the truth. Unless you haven't been to a school playground since 1965, you know that little kids are capable of saying stuff that would make a Hells Angel blush. It's a kid flick for real kids.And what the hell ever happend to Chunk? I know Mikey went on to become Rudy and he's gonna be in Lord of the Rings, Brand is now engaged to Minnie Driver, Martha Plimpton does mostly stage stuff, and Corey Feldman is...well...Corey Feldman. But Chunk fell off the face of the Earth. I thought that was him as the guy at the motel front desk in Memento but it turned out that it wasn't. Somebody help me find Chunk!",

The truffle shuffle scene was one of the greatest scenes in cinema history ( I can do the truffle shuffle but choose not to). The scene with the blender was also hilarious.Sloth and his wiggling ears are also legendary.

The storyline was great, the musical theme was terrific, and the actors in it were funny and well performed.  I liked the way the seven teenagers calls themselves The Goonies, I don't know what it means but it sounds like a perfect nickname. I liked all the charaters including Mouth, Andy, and Brand but my favourite is Data played by Jonathan Ke Quan, he was really funny and hilirious, using all those gadgets as if he's Inspector Gadget.  Kids will love this movie and I would also recommend other Steven Speilberg and Richard Donner's movies like E.T, Superman, and Jurassic Park.",

I remember seeing it for the first time at my cousin's house on T.V. when we were eight. Then, it was just a funny movie that had a funny fat kid, some other funny kids, and a funny-looking guy who yelled funny stuff. Now, it's definitely the best.It's about 4 boys (Mikey, [who was always my favorite,] Data, Mouth, and Chunk) who are about to be separated because their housing development is going to be torn down to make room for a snotty country club golf course (headed by none other than the boys' least favorite person's father)The boys go up in the attic and find a treasure map. Thinking that they might be able to find the treasure and be able to \"save to goon docks,\" they set off on what will be the biggest Goonie adventure they've ever done!It's rated PG, although there's an awful lot of swearing. No \"f-words\", but they say \"shit\" about every other sentance, and \"damn\" occasionally, so if you're gonna watch this with younger kids, think about it first. In all, I rate it a definite 10, for hilarious mishaps, fun quotes, great fun, and 'the funny fat kid'. :) (It's in English, by the way.)\"...con las cucarachas, por DOS semanas, sin agua y sin comeda!\" - Mouth, in the \"Translate into Spanish for Rosalita\" scene",

It's a great movie about a bunch of misfit kids - the loudmouth, the overweight kid, the wallflower, the high-school jock - they are all here, and together, they spend a day following a local legend for pirate's gold. Unknown to them, first class criminals are hot on there heels for their share! The Goonies has aged pretty well - Cyndi Lauper with her bubblegum soundtrack, An excellent group of kids and a hilarious Anne Ramsay as Mamma Fratelli, Chris Columbus' funny dialogue,and Spielberg's genius.

            "content": "On the eve of the 30th anniversary of this excellent entry in Spielberg's cinematic opus, it is wholly appropriate to explore the film's roots in the depression era antics of Hal Roach's \"Our Gang\" comedies. Those of us who, like Spielberg, grew up in the 50's with TV's version of \"Our Gang\" in the form of daily episodes of \"The Little Rascals\", quickly recognize in \"The Goonies\" Spanky McFarland's adventure as portrayed in the Little Rascal's \"Night n' Gales\" (1937). In that adventure, Spanky, Alfalfa and the gang are caught in a storm and must spend the night at Darla's house. There is much ado about the gang sharing a bed with Darla's father, skillfully played by Johnny Arthur, and after some comic bits, the boys fall asleep and dream about, what else but, pirates' treasure. The dream scene that follows with the Rascals finding a pirate ship and chests of gold and jewels and a giant pirate who protects it all lends itself beautifully to Spielberg's skillful rendering of the Goonies in discovering the treasure of John' Matuszak's Sloth. The squeals and screams of fear and the visual muggings of the Goonies as Sloth chases them are not just reminiscent, but rather they are identical to Hal Roach's scenes in which the Rascals are chased by the angry giant. Of course, this is where the similarities begin and end, as \"The Goonies\" grow beyond the fantasy dream world mischievousness of the Rascals and develop into a full-scale celluloid study of a group of prepubescent misfits growing up in an adult world that is seriously tainted with an inability to dream, to wonder, and to create the child's world of unlimited adventure.",

I believe that everyone can identify with at least one of the characters, which is a rarity in what is considered a children's film.If you were to ask anyone my age (males especially) if they remember \"The Goonies\", I guarantee that a wide smile will stretch across his/her face, and I know that he might then go on to unfold many a tale of his childhood adventures with his closest friends.  This ability to bring out some of the most important remembrances of our past is what makes this movie so powerful; \"The Goonies\" will forever be the defining film of my generation's youth.",

After the best times I had in my life watching it, the friend established a \"Goonie\" club for the fun of it. Perhaps your past childhood memories would have been the same, too! While the movie is a tad heavy on the stupid foul jokes, it does have the imagination of willing to trek around for some perilous adventures, plus a few spooks. There possibly was never a movie like this providing tons of fun and laughter during the time. The characters and their personalities were most original, including \"Data\" and his supply of gadgets, and \"Chunk\" with his obese but likable image (love that \"Truffle Shuffle\"!). But \"Sloth\" easily stole the show with his own likable personality, a goon with the weirdest face I've ever seen in my life! Just think of how fun it is to discover lost treasure, when you know it's only fantasy. Four key things come to mind with THE GOONIES: pirate ships, teenagers, the Frattellis, and Cyndi Lauper. They're actually \"good enough\" and they go together in this memorable journey! Kudos to Richard Donner for bringing me a movie that I've seen over 100 times and never stop enjoying!

Whining about children yelling in a movie mostly cast with children, is kind of idiotic.That being said, The Goonies is one of the quintessential movies of the 80's, and it has never lost its shine. This movie is easily a 10, it will always be a 10...even after you've watched it over and over. It never gets stale. I loved it at 15 years old and I love it at 40 years old. It captures a little bit of everything...action, romance, drama, adventure, suspense..all wrapped in your childhood. If you want to have a good time, sit down and pay attention to this movie. A fun rousing adventure. Each of the actors and actresses (as well as writers and director, basically everyone involved) should be given a posthumous Oscar award, for touching people so artistically.

I saw it recently at the cinema for the first time, after years of watching it on TV and video, with about 500 other like minded people my age who all had the same feelings i did. Although the print was pretty bad is was still the greatest cinema experience of my life. Admittedly, if you hadn't grown up with the film and all the things that go with it, then you might not love it as much watching it for the first time as an adult.

            "content": "Richard Donner has always been known for making fast-paced and fun movies. Most people probably associate his name with the Lethal Weapon series.  But whenever I hear his name, I always think of The Goonies.The Goonies is one of those movies that always brings out the kid in me. Everytime I watch it, I fall in love with it all over again.  This isn't the usual teensploitation flick, filled with glamorous, ultra-cute teenagers with whom you can't relate.  These are characters you can relate to.  The kind you could swear lived right down the street from you.  It's hard to not become attached to them and their circumstances.  So when they fall head-first into the adventure of a lifetime, they take you along for the ride.The awesome thing about this movie is that you feel like a member of the group all the way thru the movie.  You feel like one of \"the goonies\".  All the way from the beginning to the end.  It all starts when they find a mysterious treasure map in Mikey's (Sean Astin) attic.  This then triggers a chain of events which eventually puts them into an adventure of Indiana Jones-esque proportions.  As they dodge the many pitfalls and problems that come their way, you find yourself rooting for them, and almost feeling like you're a part of the action.  Never will there be another movie as fun as this one.The acting in this movie is top notch, considering the majority of the actors and actresses were pre-teens at the time of filming.  Like I said, these characters are everyday characters you swear were ripped straight from your childhood.  Sean Astin is great as Mikey, a teen in his early, and awkward, pubescent years.  He's kind of the all-round average guy, but is the glue that holds the group together, thus being the hero.  Josh Brolin is great as his older brother, Brandon.  He does everything you picture an older brother to do: picks on Mikey and his friends and acts like a toughguy, while at the same time adding some guidance and looks out for his younger bro.  Chunk, my favorite character, is played brilliantly by Jeff Cohen.  I never fail to laugh at him bumbling around and shooting his mouth off.  Corey Feldman is in top form here as \"Mouth\", playing the part of the cool guy (as usual).  Jonathan Ke Quan is hilarious as \"Data\", a child genius with all kinds of quirky little inventions to help his friends out along the way (yet not very skilled at using them just yet).  Kerri Green is great in being the pretty face of the movie as Andrea (\"Andy\" for short), and is a possible love interest of Brandon.  Martha Plimpton is good as Andy's friend, but doesn't have too many lines.  She does provide good chemistry between her and Mouth, though, hinting at a possible relationship in the future.  The Fratelli family is portrayed quite well by Davi, Pantoliano, and Ramsey.  I'd say they do a sufficient job at being as scary as possible in their given roles as a family of hot-headed criminals out to find a stash of treasure, thus bumping heads with the kids and posing much of a threat.This movie might not carry the same worth with others as it does with me, given it's nostalgic value.  So I must admit that my views may be a little biased.  But, I feel that this film works on all levels at providing comedy, adventure, and thrills galore.  If you're looking for a fun movie to watch, I HIGHLY recommend giving The Goonies a chance.  I know very few people who have been disappointed with this movie, so I think it's definitely worth a shot.  It's too hard not to fall in love with this move and it's characters.",

I hadn't sat and watched it for over 10 years, plus i hadn't shown my daughter it. Being 4 1/2 i wasn't sure if it would keep her attention. However, she instantly got into it. I can remember my parents desperately scraping around for a VHS to record it from the television and yet here i was sitting with my child watching it. I didn't see that coming. Not only do you love this film as a child, but you love it as an adult also, wishing for your childhood back. The Goonies is a family classic, 6.9? Its worthy of a lot more!",

I thought I would put my fond memories of the film to the test (a dangerous thing to do usually) and go out and hire it. I was pleasantly surprised to find that this film manages to be entertaining two decades later.For those of you that haven't seen it, I'm not sure if I can promise a great movie experience, because I know much of my enjoyment of this film is connected to fond memories of my original (multiple) viewings way back when. But I would like to think that it is still a decent film for kids and young teens, and it goes without saying that for those of you reading this who are thinking about watching it again after many years distant from the last time, I highly recommend a revisiting of this film.This film is a fairly straightforward adventure movie, but very well done, and the feeling of empathy one has for the main characters is the thing that carries the viewer to the end. Twenty years is long enough for subtle but meaningful shifts in the cultural values of a society, and I did cringe slightly at times, but that is to be expected and not an indictment on the film.",

            "content": "From the start of the opening credits of Ma and her two sons fleeing through Astoria at high speeds whilst introducing us to a small band of kids who we lovingly came to know as the Goonies, to a pirate ship sailing into the distance which puts POTC to shame with it's authentic grace 'The Goonies' is one of those movies which aimed to please and did so much more.It's the grand adventure which every child young and old wishes they could have lived and nigh on twenty years later still impresses. The eighties produced some memorable movies in it's decade and 'The Goonies' along with others stands the test of time. With the small band of heroes Mikey, Mouth, Chunk and Data with the addition of some older but non the wiser teenagers of Brand, Andi and Steph we are taken on the grandest adventure with the simplest of terms. A treasure hunt. Every trick in the book is thrown in, A car chase, a treasure map with cryptic clues, dubloons, pirates, underground caves, dead guys, bad guys, pirate ships and skeletons. And of course Sloth.It's the stuff fairy tales couldn't get enough of and yet it was so real you almost wished yourself to Astoria to live the grand adventure itself. You can't help but laugh at each small intricate detail to the sarcasm of Mouth and how to 'pack the drugs' to poor Chunk relaying his life story to save his poor fingers from the blender. Throw in Mikey to touch the soft spot in your heart and raise a tear, and Data who has a gadget to get you out of every situation. Andi and Brand provide the romance, although in saying Mikey gets a look in too and Steph tries and fails to provide the adult expertise before reverting to perfect sarcasm battles with Mouth. And all this whilst being chased by the Fratelli's.All in all, praise upon praise cannot say how good 'The Goonies' is, I was five when it was released, and it's been a favourite from then, although I do remember being scared of Sloth at the time. I killed off the version I watched and re-watched and re-watched recorded onto video from all those years ago, bought it on VHS and killed that version too, Thankfully DVD's are that little bit more hard wearing. I hope to be watching it in another twenty years time and still loving it.",

I literally wanted to BE Kerri Green and, of course, would have loved to have had an adventure like the Goonies had (and to have kissed Josh Brolin).We went camping this last weekend in a yurt and there was a dvd player in it. I took Goonies and watched it with my 11 year old 3 times. He loved it. Much like my older son did (who owns a \"Goonies Never Say Die\" t-shirt) when we watched it together when he was about 10.It's classic. It's a solid story that kids everywhere can relate to.

Another added plus is I work with the mentally impaired a lot.  John Matuszac's portrayal of Sloth is very realistic, and I think he should have gotten on Oscar for his portrayal.

But the villans, especially Robert Davi as Jake Fratelli, keep this movie moving along. Mama Fratelli (Anne Ramsey), evil and partial to her son, Francis (Joe Pantoliano)growls and sputters delightfully. Robert Davi, however, crooning Italian opera, made the biggest impression on me. This movie made me a big fan. His delivery, presence and comic badness coupled with that incredible singing voice and unforgetable face keeps me looking for his name in newly released films.

It would make a lot more sense if you did it that way. This movie was created with love and it shows in every single scene. The adult actors in the film were superb, the children actors did an amazing job, even Mouth who grew up to be, well not so great. I love every single one of them and every single time I see this movie it brings back the great childhood memories I had living in my childhood home. It also makes me want to turn back into a kid and go treasure hunting like they did in the film. I plan on doing this with my daughter. The music was awesome and fun, the settings were really well done and the ship was a real freaking Pirate Ship.Listen this isn't really a review just something to try and get you to see this movie with your kids or if you do not have any, then with yourself not going in and expecting a modern story because its nothing like that. Its a movie to be enjoyed with the heart and soul of a child looking for adventure not for adults looking for a serious down to earth film.",

The best part of the film for me is any scene with sloth! He is a true screen king! If you want to watch a film with your kids or girlfriend or if you just want to enjoy an easy well scripted well acted funny film the goonies is the answer.

How wrong I was!Basically ,& I know its a clich\u00e9, but they don't make movies like this anymore. Its a typical lads fantasy movie & I'd put it up there with Rob Reiners Stand By Me (also released in 1985) as one of the greatest 'bonding' films ever made.Surprisingly it comes from the director of the classic horror film The Omen, but not surprising is that a certain Mr Spielberg has put his stamp all over the film. The cast are all likable characters - especially the sensitive Mikey, the loud Mouth, the inventive Data, the lovable Chunk (who could forget 'The Truffle Shuffle'!), the clumsy Fratelli family (especially the brilliant Anne Ramsay - now sadly deceased) & the heroic Sloth (\"Hey you guys!\").Some of the actors have continued their success - Corey Feldman (Mouth) went on to the aforementioned Stand By Me & Gremlins (then sadly made less successful films), Sean Astin (Mikey) has made himself immortal in the movies as he played Samwise in Peter Jackson's awesome Lord Of The Rings trilogy, Josh Brolin (Brad) has continued to work in films & Martha Plimpton has gained critical acclaim for her theatre work.The movie has all you need for a couple of hours of pure escapism - a treasure map, an secret underground passage, booby traps, pirates and of course the good old \"good vs evil\".The Goonies has stood the test of time 20 years later. If you remember this film from your childhood I urge you to re-visit it - you won't be disappointed. A bone-fide movie classic!",

There are lot of times in the movie when you might feel 'that's silly' but it might be a nice watch for the kids. Kids might have lot of fun watching a bunch a kids trying to pull off a breath taking treasure adventure. But for an adult mind it looks too childish and at times boring. I gave this 6 considering it might be lot of fun for kids under the age group of 15 or maybe 12 but I would have personally given it only 4 or 5 out of 10.Maybe I expected a lot from this as the story was from Steven Spielberg. But the whole movie is based on some impulsive events that take place all in one day. The connectivity is loose at many instances and the humour is real immature or too juvenile. The movie starts with a small introduction of each character but is very lame. Overall it's good if the kids want to watch some adventure flick but otherwise it's a total waste of time.",

            "content": "There was a time when boys would spend a whole day watching their favorite heroes, dreaming of riding a crusade against Darth Vader's Empire or fighting the enemies among the Knights of the Round Table. Just like in the Fantasy Island, where Mr. Roarke and Tatoo would make all one's wishes come true, The Goonies has the special talent to bring our childhood fantasies back and remind us how great those years were.In this 1985 movie, a bunch of kids find a map which indicates the spot where the evil pirate One-Eyed-Willie buried a big treasure stolen from English ships in the 1500's. As we can predict, they decide to seek for the gold and precious stones to help their parents who are about to be expelled from their homes because they can't make ends meet and also because some wealthy men want to put their houses down to build a country club on it's place. Dangers, traps and even a family of thieves - the Fratelli - are after them.As the film goes on, we can see how closer the friends get and how supportive we all should be. They would always be there for each other, no matter how deep their problems are. Even a rich girl, Andy, is accepted by the group, in a very politically correct act, where no distinctions are made. The scene in which the guys are stuck in a hole, is very touching and really digs our sense of aid.Richard Donner directed this movie and another famous director, Chris Columbus wrote the screenplay, based on a Steven Spielberg's story. Matt Sweeney was responsable for the special effects and the main theme ( They 'r good enough ) was written and performed by Cindy Lauper.After the film, none of the kids became famous actors. Corey Feldman and Kerry Green took part in some teenage comedies, while Sean Astin showed up in \"Memphis Belle\" and Ke Huy Quan was the young Indiana Jone's chinese taxi driver in \"The Temple of the Doom\". The only one who joined some serious projects was Martha Plimpton.But these are just technical details. What really counts in \"The Goonies\" are the two hours of humanity, pleasure, inocence, friendship - and even the first love - that only children can show in their eyes. In fact, it's a small journey to our past, to a time when your deepest worries were about the girl (or the boy) on the next chair.",

            "content": "\"Hey you guyssss\" GooniesIf you like adventure, mystery, comedy you would love this film. Goonies is based on a group of young boys named Chuck, Mickey, Mouth, Date and an older brother named Brand and two older girls named Andy and Stef searching for a lost pirate ship. The adventure the group runs into on the way to the treasure makes this movie not only comedy but also an emotional journey for the characters and the audience. Filled with puzzles, boobytraps and constant reminders of how many came before them the group works together to create a close bond through the adventure. The group realizes that after this they will all be separated and will never have an adventure like this again. They will be separated by time and distance.Before the movie came out the names alone of the director, Richard Donner, and the writers, Chris Columbus (screenplay) and Steven Spielberg (story by) already had a reputation for having good movies. Donner directed The Superman movies which were a hit. Spielberg is accredited with E.T. and Indian Jones with many other hit movies following. Chris Columbus was a screenplay writer for Gremlins which was referenced in the movie Goonies. With these three involved Goonies was destined to be a good movie.The group tested their luck hiring both a mix of seasoned and new actors to play leading roles in the movie. The new actors included Mikey (Sean Astin), Chunk (Jeff Cohen), Data (Ke Huy Quan), and Andy (Kerri Green). All of these actors had experience acting in one or less movies. The seasoned actors included Brand (Josh Brolin), Mouth (Corey Feldman), and Stef (Martha Plinpton). These actors all worked well together to make you feel like you were part of this group. The group of characters in this film have continued to make other notable films.The characters brought the overall feeling of the movie due to their high acting skills. Although some of these actors were new to acting they took on the role they were assigned well. Between the serious characters, the comedians, and the floaters the audience is able to identify with the characters and build a connection to their personalities. The director and writers made the characters consistent throughout the story which gave an understanding to the audience of what to expect from each character. From the beginning of the movie Mikey took on a serious role. This was first seen at Mikey's house when Chunk was trying to get in and Mouth would not unlock the gate until he did the Truffle Shuffle. Mikey made sure that they stopped playing around and let him in. Speilberg and Columbus showed throughout the movie that kids will be kids at even scary times. During suspenseful moments the group continues to crack jokes and still act like young boys.I would rate this movie 10 out of 10 stars! Spielberg, Columbus, and Donner have created a movie that is good for all ages. Goonies is the bomb go and watch it.",

The Goonies follow the map and wind up in caves deep underground and have to keep their wits about them to get to the coveted treasure. The characters are extremely comical, and there is an element of romance between Andy (a cute cheerleader) and Brand (Mikey's older and hunky brother).

While I might not have searched for buried treasure, we all have those moments from childhood that we would like to live again. The Goonies is my piece of mind packaged in an endearing tale of friendship, adventure, and that timeless experience of childhood.",

I watched it and instantly fell in love with it. Even though at times it's corny and unrealistic, the enthusiasm in the little people and the amazing story makes up for it completely. One friend I showed it to, disliked it, however I am under the impression she is a crazed lunatic, who has had the disadvantage of pretending to be mature and therefore missed out on the wonder that is 'The Goonies'! You can quickly connect with the characters and their need for excitement and adventure. One can laugh at their jokes, and generally all the crazy things they say; scream at the bad people and the giant squid and join in their amazing adventure. This film shows you seven children's last desperate attempt to remain in the home they love, with the friends they have been forced to make after the rest of the world rejected them.

It has a dreamlike innocence, without being mawkish, that is sadly lacking in many of today's films for children. Even better is the fact that this is achieved with a cast of kids who are not perfect, but reflect how kids really are.

            "content": "Watched this movie as part of a course about writing for children.First, the film is for kids and it's noticeable. The solutions proposed to the conflicts in the story and also some of the situations do not seem realistic. There is a lot of humor on the verge of being gruesome or raw or a bit offensive. For example the scenes with the corpse that fell on the fat kid Chunk or when he finds himself in the trunk with the corpse. The children themselves are cartoons. One is the inventor, INSPECTOR GADGET style, the other is the cool guy with the slick talk (and also knows 17th century Spanish), the third is the fat guy who is fixated on food and the fourth is the \"normal\" kid. A lot of the jokes are related to \"Chunk\" (the kid) being fat and all the prejudices regarding overweight people (e.g. They are obsessed with food).If they were making the movie today, a lot of things would be taken out, especially some of the jokes about overweight people ('Chunk' has to take off his shirt and squirm and shake his belly and only then the kids open the gate for him). Occasionally, from time to time the movie has a good joke. But a lot of the scenes are played for laughs with not a lot of additional added value except from kids entertainment.In conclusion - a film intended for children with some terrifying and frightening scenes (for example Mrs. Fratelli threatens to cut Chunk's tongue, threatens to put his hand in a food mixer, a dead federal agent body falls twice on Chunk). I personally found these scenes very unpleasant to watch. I do understand how very young children can enjoy this movie somehow. But unlike another children's movie called \"E. T.\" it doesn't really hold water for the adult viewer. It's a pretty good movie but definitely not a classic (at least in my eyes). In the MeToo and PC era of today - a lot would have been edited out and rightfully so.",

This movie is pretty much an ode to childhood exuberance, dealing with such fantastical issues such as pirate ships, hidden treasure, bad guys, booby traps (or booty traps whatever's your poison) and the art of having fun.The Goonies themselves are fairly likeable, though they do have a tendency to talk over each other; but I guess that's what kids do. Joey Pants and band of bad guys make for excellent villains, and give our heroes a good run for their money.All in all, get your purple rain t-shirt and head band start bopping away to cyndi lauper and her terrible theme song!",

He gave me a few little in-depth stories about the parts of the movie he was involved in and I found it quite interesting.

Years later I would have the chance to see the house where the the \"Walsh family home\" was located (on a tour of Astoria, Oregon).Astoria, a safe harbor town in the peaceful pacific northwest is a rarity in this day and age. The film seemed to bring the town to life. Not featured in the film is a quaint street car line. It is quite a lovely place to spend a weekend and certainly the continued success of the film has contributed to its survival.One of the most interesting spots to visit in Astoria is the classic JC Penney store. The store on the outside resembles something from the 1930's. Inside you'll find much of the same contemporary merchandise you'd find at any JC Penney store in any mall. But Astoria, seems to have a magical ability to preserve its history and stay current at the same time.Same is true for this film. It doesn't SEEM like a 27 year old movie.But it is.Actually it isn't. The movie is the same. We are just all 27 years older.Watching it today through the prism of a man with 27 years of life experience doesn't make it any less exciting.The car chase on the beach.The creative gadgetry of \"Data\" sliding down the home made zip line. \"Data\" had a zip line BEFORE any one knew what a zip line was.Chunk knocking over the statue and \"breaking Brandon's mother's favorite part\".A very private part by the way.Jeff Burleson and Geoff Chisholm (we took the whole staff to a screening in Sisters, OR on Maple Lane at Loker Avenue) heartily recommend this film for anyone who loves teenage adventure, wholesome goodness and the hard work of Steven Spielberg BEFORE he became STEVEN Spielberg.",

There is a few things that can be better, like kids not knowing where to go or what to do instead of them solving all the problems immediately. One thing we all want is an extended version, Is it real the octopus scene? The scenes at the town buying maps where good, and also introduces the bully and the relations with the girls.

            "review_title": "A Goonies Film Review",
            "content": "The Goonies is about a group of young adults that guide themselves into an adventure on the quest to find a legendary lost treasure. The film illustrates the importance of working as a team to beat impossible circumstances. Sean Astin plays the main character Mikey, who is first to discover an old treasure map in family home's attic. His brother Brand is played by a young, Josh Brolin. These two play opposites character wise. Brand is more athletic and strong while Mikey is smaller and has an external weakness of asthma. However it is Mikey that is the one who guides the group of misfits through an underground, booby trap adventure and discover the treasure. The brother's family home is about to be foreclosed on unless their parents can come up with the money.Other stars of the film include Goonies: Kerri Green, who plays Andy, a cheerleader and love interest to Brolin's character, Kerri Green, who plays Stef, Corey Feldman as Mouth, Jeff Cohen as Chunk, and Ke-Huy Quan as Data. The group is constantly on the run from the Fratelli crime family, who in the opening scenes helps one of their counterparts escape jail. Anne Ramsey plays Mama Fratelli, who discovers what the \"goony\" group is up to and prompts her sons Jake and Francis, who are played by Robert Davi and Joe Pantoliano, respectively, to chase after them. There is one more son, Sloth, played by John Matoszak, who is deformed and has a growling Frankenstein-like dialog. Sloth is left behind along with a captured Chunk who soon becomes friends over the love for food and they join forces to go save the \"goonies\" from the Fratellis who are on their trail. Each goony character played an important role in helping the group advance further in discovering the treasure. Those that stood out were: Mikey (Astin) who is the encourager that will not give up in helping his family and will not allow the group to give up either, Data (Quan), is equipped with special gadgets that help the goonies get through the trail to the treasure and Mouth (Feldman), is able to interpret the map which is in Spanish and helps to give the film a funnier edge with his smart antics. The character Sloth (Matoszak) ends up becoming an honorary goony for his attempts to rescue them from his family. The Goonies was an earlier kiddy version of the Disney film, National Treasure (2004), which stars Nicholas Cage as a treasure hunter who is looking for mysterious and unbeknown artifacts. Unlike The Goonies his adventures are around the entire country not just below one Oceanside suburb. Perhaps both films draw from the film, Indiana Jones (1981-1989, 2008), which stars Harrison Ford as a part time college professor and part time adventurous historian, who travels the globe to rescue artifacts from the wrong hands and put them in a museum. All these films focus on defeating the odds and a hero shining through at the end. However, I believe Goonies was the first to focus on a group of children on this type of quest. The film uses techniques in camera angles and lighting to give a more realistic feel to the viewer. There are points were you actually forget the adventure is really only taking place underneath a town. Throughout most of the film, low key lighting is used to draw the audience into the setting of the dark cave the group is in. It gives an eerie feeling while at the same time allowing for the element of surprise of what may be up next. It was also very natural like you are right there with the characters, especially when they use candles and flashlights as the main light source. A diagonal camera angle was used in some scenes to present an approaching feel. Especially when the group was traveling into the unknown as one. The characters are in a grouping of shortest to tallest from front to back to give this angle an even greater effect. These techniques were needed to bring the audience into the actions on the screen and engage their interest further.All the elements tie in to make this film enjoyable to watch and be a part of. Each character was able to hold your interest with their unique talent and ways. Each scene of their adventure will allow you to seem as if you are part of the effort to find the treasure. This film gives great significance to the word teamwork and will encourage those biggest to smallest to stop at nothing to make a dream reality.",

Josh Brolin was the perfect big brother for Sean Astin (son of the Riddler from the 60's Batman series). Mouth being scared and then becoming brave at the end was cool. I also remember Cyndi Laupers music video from this movie, I just don't remember the song that she sang, but the ending of the video was funny with her saying Mr. Spielberg get me out of here. This is a movie that I look forward to sharing with my kids. The DVD has the full movie being played with the cast (in current time) giving their thoughts during the commentary.

Its also not made for people who intend to make harsh judgements about the acting or the political correctness of the characters - its made for people who either arent looking for or couldnt recognise those things... It's easy to just dismiss a film like this as badly made just because you didnt get it, but if you try and watch it as its meant to be seen, it could reward you...The Goonies was one of the first films i rented more than 10 times as a kid... Theres something about the exaggerated stereotype characters that helps the film still have an emotional effect on me 15 years later - Mouth's 'this was my dream...' speech still makes me wanna go out in the street and shout goonies never say die... The film kind of grew up with me, too - when i first saw it at 5 years old, a lot of the jokes were lost on me, and re-watching it over time has let me get more from it each time...If you're gonna watch this film for the first time, dont go into it expecting some kind of classic work of cinematic art or even something that rivals Indiana Jones as an adventure film - The Goonies was specifically for the young (or people who dont want to grow up), and if you're over 14 and watching it for the first time, you'll probably have to try and see it from a kids perspective - its worth it to, just for an hour and a half, forget you've grown up and appreciate the fact that it's a kids fantasy adventure film...Oh, and if you saw it as a kid and havent seen it since, its definitely worth watching again - especially if you can get the chance to see it in public with other people who grew up with it...",

The story is good. The acting is okay, though the characters are quite memorable. Who can forget Data, Sloth, Chunk, Mouth, etc.? I know I can't. The music, especially the theme by Cyndi Lauper, is firmly set in the mid-80's which really adds to the nostolgic effect (I still have the 45!).

The next time you see sky it will be over another town, the next time you take a test it will be in some other school. Our parents want the best stuff for us. It's their time up there,and its our time down here. That's all over the second we ride up Troy's bucket.\" I also love the Cyndi Lauper song \" The Goonies are good enough\", and I love the Orchestra music also.",

It resembles a mixture between a Little Rascals movie and an Indiana Jones adventure film. The Goonies incorporates a treasure hunt-- action theme that the whole family would enjoy. It is a true 1980's classic written by Steven Spielberg and Chris Colombus. The movie takes place on the Pacific northwestern coastal town where a group of the \"weird\" kids at school convince each other to search for the hidden treasure on One-Eyed Willy's ship. Each iconic character has a unique attitude that brings such life to the movie. Whether it be between the junk food driven teen named Chunk, or the next Inspector Gadget named Huy-Quan, when they're all together, they'll make for an adventure film that will keep your attention the entire hour and 54 minutes.The Goonies also incorporates a heartwarming relationship story between a popular teenager and his lame younger brother that will leave you with a smile on your face. For a movie that was popular when my parents were kids, being made over 30 years ago, is still considered a classic to my generation today. June 7th was announced to be \"Goonies Day\" by the mayor of Astoria, Oregon where the film was shot in 1985. This legendary motion picture is a timeless film that will carry on for generations to come.",

Nearly all of the comments that i have currently read on this superb adventure film have mentioned the fact that it gives you warm and welcome memories of your childhood. I am only 14 years old myself, but even i can remember watching this film every christmas with my family and we all loved it! I think that most of the actors in this do a great job. It is a film which shows off the young talent of the eighties, and a lot of the actors have gone on to do bigger and better things. However, in my opinion Sean Astin steals the show, he is superb and although all of the characters (including his) are stereotyped, Mike Walsh is a young hero in this film and i love him. However, you could say that i like this film so much just because of my adoration for Sean Astin, but all of the other actors do a superb job as well for example Corey Feldman and the boys who played Data and Chunk (can't remember their names at the moment!) Josh Brolin also did a great job. The story line and script were superb and i love this film to bits. It has to be one of my favourite films of all time.",

            "content": "In 1985 Steven Spielberg directed a movie titled The Goonies. There is much more to this movie than what simply meets the eye. The Goonies, follows a group of young hooligan boys around their hometown of Astoria, Oregon as they search for a mysterious buried treasure. The Goonies, one of Spielberg's funnier films focuses on younger people, because of this, many movie critics are harsh in their reviews towards. These reviews will sadden those who truly love the movie The Goonies. If watched superficially, what appears in is a bunch of annoying kids running around their hometown without parental supervision as they search for hidden treasure, as well as bad acting and not great filming. But The Goonies teaches lessons that are simple, beautiful, and even for some life changing. \u00a0Although the movie is focused on the younger generation all, old and young alike can enjoy and learn from these lessons.\u00a0Critics have stated, \"The storyline was weak.\" Another said, \"The story is annoying.\" These critics have only ever watched this movie with a superficial lens, sadly they have failed to see what the movie is all about. Spielberg directed this summer popcorn film in such a way that it can be learned from. These lessons come to us as the Goonies express attributes through their actions as they adapt to the life crisis on hand. One of these examples happens when the young Goonies follow a map to an old summer home, and despite a scary looking family occupying the house they press on to see if they can find the next step on the map. Through this experience the young Goonies teach us the lesson of determination and courage, the attributes are vital in order for us to get through our own life crises. As the Goonies press on they face many traps created to kill them or make them so scared that they would turn around but, these young boys and girls have something driving them. A drive is something that will always help us to get through our lives crises, it will push us not to quit and to do whatever is necessary to reach our goals. Finally, the Goonies show an incredible amount of maturity for their age, with maturity they were able to see and understand what really was important. Having a clear understanding about what was really important to the Goonies, they were able to know what they must do in order for them to get through their crisis. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0These are only three examples of how the Goonies personality traits throughout the movie can teach us to better prepare ourselves for when crises come into our lives. These of course are not the only lessons to be learned form The Goonies, but it is a good start. The Goonies is much more then just a silly kids action/adventure movie, its for all generations to learn and grow from. Steven Spielberg produced this movie knowing that he could hide some awesome lessons from the beginning of the movie to the ending credits. As you watch this movie don't just watch it it superficially but to watch it in a deeper way, for in this way will you learn from its lessons, you will soon bee defending this 1980 classic much more.",

Except almost none of the lines was more significant than any other. Plus they were all screaming at once.Apart from that topic:\nI have a problem with the original writing. I felt, for the characters in the plot, plus for myself, a viewer, pretty insulted by the mountainous improbabilies and its dropping of its own story path. Preparing all along, it seems to make sure that they failed. The boobie traps were not so much of a problem as the writing traps.If they were after the treasure, and found it, why did they give up so easily when the old woman grabbed their hands and told them to give what they had to her? And even more so once she was arrested?? In the real world, she would have been so overwhelmed, as they were, that she wouldn't care a bit if they got a few million while she also did.While she was crooked, surely she was not \"evil\". Why the spite?And to top it off, after they surfaced, at the end, and she and sons were arrested, the treasure was still there, so the story insults us (as well as those kids), by just totally ignoring the fact that they could now, undisturbed, go back in and get it ( !! ). Then when the ship sailed away ... it was on the ship. So just get in a boat and go get it there.Not to mention that it took the Goonies a long dangerous path to get to the treasure, then all of a sudden, there she was. ( Duh! ). Did she know a shortcut??I'd rather it had been written more intelligently. Go for the gold, get the gold, and live happily ever after. So the message for kids here is: \"Don't aspire to anything great, because it is impossible to attain\". Triple-Duh.",

The plot is about a group of outcast friends (they call themselves the Goonies) who find a treasure map of a long lost treasure. The kids, who are about to lose their houses decide to try and help their parents by embarking on the adventure of a lifetime. On their search for 'the rich stuff' they uncover the hideout of the Fratelli's, a family of bumbling bad guys. The child actors are amazing. My personal favorite is Mikey, (played by an adorable Sean Astin) the leader of the group. You may also see some other familar faces, like Corey Feldman-the wise cracking 'Mouth', Josh Brolin-macho big brother 'Brand', and Martha Plimpton-Andi's friend 'Stef'. This movie is a great childhood classic. I highly recommend it even if you are just a kid at heart. It has great 80's styles and feeling. It is a movie you can never get tired of, (believe me, I've seen this movie atleast 30 times!!!! And it is still one of my favorites.) If you haven't seen this movie yet go out and rent it!

The action is fast, the script (co-written by Steven Spielberg and Chris Columbus) is very good, the actors performed very well and the Richard Donner's direction is almost perfect.It's certainly a very good entertainment for all your family.",

The funniest character has to be Chunk (truffle shuffle), the best looking Andy (obviously), and the most annoying Troy (grrr).

All the characters act absolutely filthy and braindead (which is sad because these actors went on to do much better things in their lives). The script (yes, there is a script) is just so awful I'm starting to either wonder if the MPAA was dumb or if the script-writers just didn't even care what the age for this film is. In fact, the actual age is so confusing that when I look up Corey Feldman on this site, his bio lies to me about the films he starred in (the site claims that \"Gremlins\" and this film are \"kid-friendly\" even though when you watch them, you'll realize that they're actually not). Anyway, back to this. The story is cliche. The Goonies themselves are so annoying and are just constantly fighting over each other. They yell, swear, fight, and start literally doing not kid-friendly stuff (such as looking up people's skirts and making jokes about a statue's penis). The most annoying character of all, Chunk, gets kidnapped by the villains and literally just cries and whines his ass off for like five minutes in front of them. Literally right in front of them. While the villains threaten to chop his fingers off. What was Spielberg even thinking? You are such a legend and you think that will entertain the kids?! Then he feeds the deformed guy I can't even remember the name of Baby Ruth (wow.) Then the other brats find the ship, Chunk reunites with the kids, then the ship just sails off and eventually sinks. I just don't really care anymore. I know all of you guys like this film, but throughout the movie, I was hoping for all the kids to fall to their deaths or something like that. All I will say is, if you want a good Spielberg film, just watch Jaws, Close Encounters, E.T., Indiana Jones, Jurassic Park, Back to the Future, and all other stuff. This did not deserve my time at all. Even Gremlins is better compared to this. And the fact that my mom likes this film makes this whole thing worse. Just avoid this.

I will admit Richard Donner's direction was a little too leisurely and there are some parts in the middle half that are too slow and falls dangerously into cloying sentimentality. Still this childhood favourite of mine is great fun from beginning to end. No matter how thin the story is, it has an intriguing premise and Donner and Chris Columbus keep the action going strong and the adventure fun enough for the younger audience. The script is funny and affectionate, the music is memorable and in general the special effects are good. The image of the pirate ship was mind blowing and the cinematography and costumes are very well done. The performances are very good; while Sean Astin and Corey Feldman are the standouts of the child cast, it is Anne Ramsey who steals the show as Ma Fetali in a effortlessly over the top and deliciously evil performance, very like Diana Dors in The Amazing Mr Blunden. All in all, a fun adventure yarn. 8/10 Bethany Cox",

Having a few bad people thrown into the mix to make things more difficult creates tension and the possibility of failure. A love interest was obvious at the ages of Brand & Andy, and is a sidebar comedy situation in itself. The way the entire story is neatly sewn together to allow the kids to reign supreme in the end, as well as a parallel of One-Eyed Willy's booby traps that are similar to Mikey's gate-opening design sequence multi-stage mechanisms, show how they both think on the same page on many levels.",

            "content": "The Goonies\n\nThis film is one of my childhood favorites. I practically grew up with this film.\n\n \nThe story is about a gang of criminals on the run while an innocent group of kids get caught up in an adventure. Four of them are a group of boys determined to save their house from being demolished. Another one is the older brother to the boy Mikey (who gets the idea of saving the house) and two girls, one called Andi who is in love with the older brother Brand and another girl tagging along with Andi. Eventually all the kids are caught in a wildcat adventure of getting money to save their house by finding some treasure while along the way they come across the bandits who want the treasure too. \n\nThe film is similar to an Indiana Jones film. It even has the same kid actor from Temple Of Doom. However it's more kid friendly but has the same structure of an Indiana Jones story. Lots of comedy and adventure and thrills. Most of the comedy stems from the fish out of water aspects of where the characters are. As stated, these kids have reasons why they have gone on this adventure. Mikey is the one who gets the idea of saving the house, while his friends, Mouth (the blabbermouth) Chunk (the big eater) and Data (the tech whiz) come along as their homes are in danger of being demolished too. As you can tell by the names, Mikey's friends are pretty eccentric yet have potential talents. Mouth, despite barely shutting up, uses his mouth to his advantage with his gift for Spanish. Chunk may be obsessed with food but he ends up saving his friends after coming in contact with one of the less mean criminals. And Data's inventions prove to be pretty useful along the adventure as silly as they can be.\n Holding this group together is Mikey. The most normal of the group and the guide for the audience. He's pretty much the most relatable low key member of  the group. He's fearless and the most determined out of all his friends despite being the least eccentric.\n Then there's Mikey's brother Brand. He doesn't mind too much about moving and comes along reluctantly as he's trying to protect his brother. It's only when Andi comes along that Brand decides to come along. In turn, Andi comes along because as long as she's with Brand, Andi doesn't mind going on the adventure. While she does overcome her naivety along the journey, learning about the dangers she has put herself in, its not all for the bad. Andi uses her piano skills to help during a perilous part of the adventure. Like Andi, Steff doesn't have any idea of the perils of the journey either but comes along as she shares close ties with Andi. However, unlike Andi, Steff is more cynical and sarcastic and not as na\u00efve as Andi\n\nThe Goonies is a great adventure flick. Even as an adult I still like it. I would recommend it to a friend who would likes fun adventure films.",

I will say that rewatching it as an adult took some of the magic away as some of the booby traps they navigate through felt redundant and some of the banter didn't really land, but as a result Chunk was even greater comedic relief to me this time than he had been before. The romance subplots felt a little tacked on too, but otherwise the villains were excellent and the child actors acquitted themselves well. The production design was solid, though I have an issue where I noticed that 1982's Poltergeist and 1993's Jurassic Park had practically the exact same prop tree in it and realized that Spielberg has an ultra-distinct style of prop/background design that has made other movies he's involved in look less realistic to me. The score really follows the action well and crescendos at all the appropriate moments. I'll surely rewatch this again in a few years.",

The obvious comparison, again, is \"The Monster Squad\" and the key difference is, in the latter, there's always the sense of real danger for the kids, while in \"The Goonies\" the sensation of urgency and danger is completely dilluted thanks to the Spielberg-disneyesque production company having all its footprints over the film.",

Despite my lack of interest in censorship, showing the underage Andy's panties in the car scene is creeperstown from Spielberg, and the family can't have that anymore. I don't care about catering to teenage audiences, when an old man is shooting a girl's crotch in an otherwise family-friendly film, the issue, no matter how brief (pun intended) is a huge mistake, and really gross.\n\nSorry Steven, we're wide awake in the family these days...",
