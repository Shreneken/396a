            "review_title": "My third favorite Kurosawa film- deliberately paced (not painfully so), heavy on tragedy, and glorious in overall artistry",
            "content": "I would agree with Ebert's review on a point, that Akira Kurosawa, legendary director of such samurai classics as Seven Samurai, Yojimbo, Hidden Fortress, and Kagemusha, as well as human dramas like Rashomon, The Lower Depths, and Red Beard, could really best direct this film in his old age. There's something about his version of the doomed King Lear of Shakespeare, his Lord Hidetora Ichimonji that could be truly captured by someone in old age. Not to say that directors can't make great films when they're young, or in middle age, about a man in the dark days of the golden years (About Schmidt, Tokyo Story, Bob Le Flambeur, and Kurosawa's own Ikiru come to mind). But it's clear that Kurosawa must've seen or felt or understood at least an element of Hidetora's character, something that goes beyond tragedy that is stuck with all who are mortal. At one point when Hidetora is in a wandering, dazed state he says \"I am lost\", to which his companion/caretaker Kyoami responds \"Such is the human condition.\" Was Kurosawa lost as an artist and filmmaker as he tried to get his epic (which at the time of it's filming was the most expensive Japan had seen, and got some extra backing from outside European backers) off the page and onto celluloid? Hard to say, but the end result displays that even in his later days he could create a work so wonderful, so sad, so brutal, and so human that it will remain timeless. If Kurosawa deserves praise for look of the film, the pacing, the editing, every single painstakingly storyboarded (painted) shot, and his direction with the two battle sequences as well as with the quieter, more compelling scenes with the actors, the man who plays Hidetora deserves some as well (like any production of King Lear, including Godard's wild treatise with Burgess Meredith in the lead role, the actor is as important as the writer). Tatsuya Nakadai, who had roles in past Kurosawa films as a young man in Yojimbo (the gunslinger) and Sanjuro (the opponent), is awe-inspiring. Early in the film, after a mind-shattering dream, his character decides to split up his kingdom unto his three sons (Jiro, Saburo, and getting the first castle and all control, Taro), he still feels in control, and has the look of a Lord with just the right level of stubbornness and, unfortunately, naivety. Then, as everything he owns crumbles before him, there is one scene that struck me as remarkable, and then for the rest of the film I couldn't take my eyes off of Nakadai whenever he was on screen. It involves the first battle sequence, in which one of his son's comes to take over a castle, and killing all of Hidetora's men. Look at Nakadai in the scene where he's sitting down stone-faced amid the chaos going on outside, and then as he somehow manages to walk out, the fellow soldiers making way for him. He then sees one of his sons, the betrayer, and he doesn't say a word- he's already decided that his son Taro has gone too far with his position, as he rules over his domain and scares the peasants right out of the picture- and he simply walks away, as his family continues to crumble under corruption of the mind and heart.It's a sequence like that though, where the great Lord makes such a radical change, where Kurosawa and Nakadai have some of their greatest time ever on a screen. As the filmmaker treats the battle, up to a point, like a feudal-Japanese version of a Eisenstein battle (no talk, no sound effects, just the eerie, sorrowful score here applied by Toru Takemitsu) with devastation and visceral nature taken to a poetic, thoughtful level, the actor's eyes and body language are, well, indescribable almost. And if Nakadai gives the finest male performance of the film, credit is equally due to the pivotal female character, Lady Kaede (Mieko Harada), who is like a Lady Macbeth taken to the next level. This is a character that's seen Lord Ichimonji destroy his castle when she was young, and now that she has her son(s) right in the palm of her hand, she'll have her revenge in guise of ego-feeding. I may not be able to recommend Ran on one level, despite it being on the painter's equivalent of a splendorous, seething portrait of royalty. Kurosawa takes his time telling the story, and to some it might even feel longer than his epic Seven Samurai. This is a work heavy on emotional nuance, on how the characters (in particular Hidetora) look unto their surroundings, how the presence of destruction and war and slayings are traumatic as opposed to being 'cool' in a stylistic way. If you're looking for a slam-bang action thriller look, elsewhere. But if you're looking for a mature film about life, death, loss, and the bonds that are kept within families, the mind, and how we accept and give forgiveness (a blind character named Lord Tsurumaru is stunning from a certain point of view), this is it. As well for the Shakespeare fan it's an absolute must-see, and it may even turn some onto Shakespeare's classic due to the fact that this film, much like Throne of Blood, contains none of the language style used in the source.",

            "content": "Akira Kurosawa's 1985, Ran, is based one of Shakespeare's greatest works, King's Lear. The Film proudly stands along with his other classic such as Seven Samurai, Yojimbo, Roshomon, Sanjuro and the Hidden Fortress. He is a master in the art of filmmaking, no one can film an epic battle scene quite like Kurosawa. This is recognized as the most expensive film ever made by Akira Kurosawa, it was at that time, Japan's most expensive film ever. Being at the age of 75, he still showed us, he's one of the best in the business.This movie is about an aging lord, head of the Ichimonji family, decides to retire and to pass the power to Taro, the eldest of his three sons. He will however have to banish Saburo, the youngest one, who dared to speak the truth to him. Soon, the former lord is chased away from the castles of his sons and becomes mad when he understands that one of his sons is trying to kill him. The three brothers are fighting for control of the Kingdom, as their lust for power grows every day. Four armies are facing each other on the prairie. Lord Ichimonji's former peaceful kingdom is nothing but a distant memory.Akira Kurosawa redefines what an epic film is, with astonishing story telling, entirely believable characters and real life battle scenes without the use of Special effects/CGI. He retells the story of King Lear in his own way and no one would recognize that it was actually a adaptation beforehand. But just like Shakespeare, there is humor, irony, death and not a happy ending. Everyone who played a part in the production of this film, deserves some kind of recognition. The acting is pretty much excellent and certainly believable.10/10 Kurosawa is a Genius",

After all it is Shakespeare and one must be patient with it if they are not a fan of the old school theatre.Colourfull clashing armies, The lord awaiting his fate in a burning castle, a brilliant execution scene (I consider the BEST I have ever seen film ever), and the blind being left in the hands of Buddha?While Seven Samurai will always be his perfection, Ran is more than an enjoyable movie that should be seen.

            "content": "With RAN (1985) Akira Kurosawa seems to be setting up a macarbe trap.  The first section of the film is slow, following an aging warlord (Tatsuya Nakadai's best acting in a long wonderous career.) dividing his castles amongst his unsavory sons.  The action is slow, people talk in low tones, it's almost at snail's pace.  But then, a battle scene like nothing you ever seen before explodes on the screen.  The film takes a 180 degree turn and becomes more and more sinister, more compelling.  You can't look away. \nAkira Kurosawa (1910-1997) was responsible for elevating Japanese cinema to a front-runner in world cinema.  Two of his films, RASHOMON and SEVEN SAMURAI were made in less than ten years after World War II.  These films put a spotlight on Japanese culture.  Some of his later films, THE HIDDEN FORTRESS, THE BAD SLEEP WELL, YOJIMBO and HIGH AND LOW became the basis for a good percentage of the major American films produced after 1960.If you sit down to see RAN, be prepared for a jaw-dropping experience.",

            "content": "'Ran' is the Japanese word for chaos, riot, dissension. Akira Kurosawa's masterpiece is indeed a feast of destruction and perdition, charged with symbols and powerful in pictures like it is found very rarely in today's cinema.The dusky story is based on Shakespeare's 'King Lear'. In the film a Japanese warlord celebrates his own downfall. Kurosawa devised this with a radical film language which works with certain imageries of colors, rapid cut sequences and a sophisticated sound design. When the colorful flags of the different armies get intermixed in a battle, when the peacefully quiet wind (which carries the soundtrack) swells to a raving storm or when long wide shots suddenly segue into shots of details that follow hot on each other's heels then you realize Kurosawa's incredible style which deeply influenced the cinema worldwide.The drawings of the characters are equally terrific. Hidetora's jester is for a certain reason always at the side of the warlord. Their relationship alters as the film continues: Jester and warlord change their roles which makes it hard to distinguish both. Just as the sky turns from blue to grey with dark clouds, the violent past of Hidetora is catching up the aging lord. His trail of murder and predation is not forgotten, the brutally conquered land still carries the old scarves of war and exploitation which now burst out again.The viewer can take this monumental work as a warning to the destructive power of war, which is even decades later at present and beset those who seed the violence.",

            "review_title": "Greatest rendition of a Shakespearean Epic",
            "content": "Ran is probably cinema's greatest rendition of a Shakespearean Epic, ironically coming from an oriental film-maker. Adapted by Kurosawa from Shakespeare's King Lear, Ran undoubtedly features amongst the best works of the master auteur. It captures with sheer vividness and surreal resplendence, the true essence of human struggle for survival, highlighting the cruelties associated with life. Ran is strictly indicative of the sole consistency of life i.e. Change, an attribute that not only makes the humans vulnerable but also gives them the hope to rise after a fall.The story focuses on a senile warlord, who owing to his senescence is rapidly losing his strength and his ferocious grandeur that he had earned through years of relentless savagery and ruthless slaughter, ergo he renounces to his three sons, hoping them to establish a sort of a triumvirate with the eldest son having a slight edge. His two elder sons accept the proposal with rapturous glee, but his youngest son seems bemused and questions the wits of the patriarch for taking the untimely decision. Though arrantly annoyed by his son's audacious defiance, he tries to console him, only to find him inconsolable. Deeply hurt by his son's impertinence and censure, he reluctantly banishes him and enthrones the two elder sons. The rest is rather worth a watch than a read, for there is nothing that can better the sumptuous elegance of Ran.The brilliantly captured scenes are breathtaking to say the least, especially the war scene that depicts fate casting the final blow to the ruthless reign of the warlord. The brutality and the bloodshed depicted in the very scene can make even a cold-blooded appear jittery. Ran portrays the poetic justice in such a relentless and abominable fashion that one can't help but sympathize with the narcissistic warlord, who spent his life arrogating and annihilating the innocent souls. The plaintive score gives the movie a much desired tone, a mood that not only supports its melancholic backdrop, but also immensely adds to its poignant beauty. The final scene featuring the blind boy, deeply clutched by his haplessness and gross solitude, though doesn't feature an utterance of even a single syllable, the playback of the mystical flute makes the scene haunting as well as mesmerising and worth a thousand words. Ran is a classic example of Kurosawa's brilliance and perhaps a consummation of his apotheosis.A must watch for eclectic viewers and admirers of pristine cinema. Highly recommended: 10/10.",

They turn against each other and against their father.Based on Shakespeare's King Lear 'Ran' is a very good film. It was very expensive and you can see that. Over ten years Kurosawa was busy on this project and in 1985 it was finally there. Very well made, with beautiful costumes, music and cinematography, a great direction and some good performances.

            "content": "In another lengthy samurai epic, Akira Kurosawa approaches the boundaries between family members and the damaging affects of one of his rather common themes - reckless ambition. This is very clearly a Kurosawa film, a respectable trait that is most clear in the cinematography, in which Kurosawa uses many extensive shots with little to no camera movement, as well as the common natural setting, characterized by the far-reaching landscapes of sweeping hillsides. Ran has a fascinating plot about an aging King who considers passing on his empire to his three sons. Lord Hidetora is well into his 70s (maybe Kurosawa saw part of himself in this character?), and he addresses the fact that he cannot go on ruling forever, despite the fact that he fought for his empire for over 50 years. His youngest son disagrees with his proposition of passing on leadership yet maintaining much of his control, yet Hidetora nonetheless divides his kingdom into three parts to his sons, hoping that they will remain allies. As an incentive, he demonstrates with arrows that a single one can be broken easily, but three arrows together cannot be broken as easily. The three sons, Taro, Jiro, and Saburo do not agree with Hidetora's philosophy and, as new leaders of their respective portions of Lord Hidetora's kingdom, they soon begin to fight each other for full leadership. Hidetora is attacked by his own sons and cast out of the kingdom, left to wander hopelessly from castle to castle with no one but his goofy jester at his side, who stays with the Lord entirely out of duty to him. One of Hidetora's three sons eventually returns and tries to patch up their damaged relationship, but before they can do that, he gets killed and Hidetora is left alone again, and the empire that he worked for during most of his life is left in ruins. As is also common in Kurosawa's films, there are a lot of interesting and significant characters in the film that play a substantial role in the story. When we first meet Lady Kaede, the woman who was married to Taro but then forced her way into marriage with his younger brother Jiro (the new Lord) upon Taro's death, she is holding a knife to Lord Jiro, threatening him with blackmail if he does not accept her as his wife. The first thing that makes her interesting is that her objective in marrying Jiro is to ensure herself a comfortable life, and so she can avoid fading into obscurity as the widow of a past Lord. Her blackmail threat has a lot of damaging potential for Jiro, and he accepts her as his wife. From the very start of her role in the film, her ultimate goal was to bring about the downfall of the kingdom in order to avenge her family who had been killed when Lord Hidetora was in power. This is not expected or even hinted at previously in the film, and it gives her character much more depth.There is some great irony in Ran that occurs after Lord Hidetora is banished and is left wandering the endless plains. He and his jester come across a run-down wooden shack at the foot of a hillside, and they approach it, asking for help and shelter. The occupant, after explaining that his home is too poor to offer any shelter, turns out to be a man who, as a boy, had had his eyes gouged out under the orders of Lord Hidetora in exchange for sparing his life. Once the jester and Hidetora are inside, the man explains that he will offer hospitality in the only way that Hidetora left him able, he will play them music on his flute. In this scene, Hidetora is confronted with the terrible suffering which he once imposed, and it is horribly ironic that he is forced to take shelter from someone that he once devastatingly mutilated without a second thought. In Ran, as was also the case in Kagemusha, which is a very similar film in time period and content, Kurosawa again employs a subtler style of directing. Again, he focuses more on the story than on cinematic trickery, and with spectacular results. The extensive use of the motionless camera is stunningly effective, but he also uses it in a different way here. Ran opens with a series of stationary shots of a group of horses standing majestically with their riders on the top of a flowing hillside. Virtually the exact same image is shown from a fairly wide variety of different angles and distances, indicating the vastness of the plains and the power that these characters hold (or will soon hold) over them. Again, a musical score is entirely absent throughout the vast majority of the film, and the same lengthy scenes are employed to a large extent to communicate the story of the film. An example of one of these exceedingly long takes can be seen early in the film when Lord Hidetora first announces his what he intends to do with the leadership of his kingdom. The ending of Ran is definitely realistic, for many reasons. There are no myths perpetuated by it; close family members do not always stand together, even the noblest intentions are not always realized, and no one lives happily ever after. Ran is the story of a man in a position of power who makes a trusting decision that backfires devastatingly, and the ensuing madness is not altered to make way for a happy ending. It seems that Kurosawa was trying to capture the militarily charged atmosphere that is present in times of war, and the things mentioned above are some of the many efforts he made to make it all as real as possible, even at the expense of the audience's emotions.",

            "content": "I am not certain, but I think Ran was Akira Kurosawa's last big feature. Visually, It might be his most distinctive. Being in color opens a lot of doors to cinematography, and makes it easier to see how much artistic creativity went into the sets and costumes. There is something else distinctive about Ran. It is his slowest picture. You need extreme patience to make it through this very long movie, and you also need to understand the context of the story.Ran is Kurosawa's retelling of Shakespeare's King Lear, which many scholars say is his most difficult tragedy. The premise is identical, revolving around an old monarch who is ruined by the corruption of his sons, after he gives them power and authority. (In King Lear, they were daughters, not sons, of course.) Ran starts and ends strongly, but the problem comes down to a huge, plodding middle section. This part of the film will really test your attention span. Kurosawa deliberately makes sure that nothing happens, because he wants to evoke one single emotion...isolation. He places his principal character (and a couple of others) in the middle of nowhere, with no story progression, music, or major dialog. There are perhaps one (or even two) too many similarly grim scenes.The battles scenes are the biggest in Kurosawa's forty year body of work. Not only do they feature swords and spears but guns, cannons, and a cast of thousands. The interesting thing about those scenes is that Kurosawa, doesn't intend them to be rousing or exciting. Instead, there is a strange emotional feeling generated. The most memorable part of Ran is the very last sequence, which is visually brilliant and really disturbing. He makes a metaphor about the frailty of humanity by showing a blind man in a very particular place.Ran will leave you thinking long and hard. I have not seen a film like it and I don't think I ever will. It is not my favorite Kurosawa, but it is very much worth watching.",

            "review_title": "The Greatest Shakespeare Film",
            "content": "Throughout his career Kurosawa strove to achieve what he called \"real cinema\", proclaiming that \"in all [his] films, there's [only] three or four minutes\" of such quality. Many would argue that he was his greatest critic. For if not in \"Seven Samurai\", then definitely in \"Ikiru\" and if not in \"High and Low\", then definitely in \"Rashomon\" he must have achieved this plateau of greatness. Well, if not in any of his other films, then definitely in \"Ran\" Kurosawa finally came to the apex of cinematic artistry. With the both lyrical and grandiose tone of its craft, its beautifully spare imagery, its haunting score by Toru Takemitsu, and its lead Tatsuya Nakadai's masterful understated performance, \"Ran\" is perhaps the most fully realized epic ever made.The tale, which is an adaptation of Shakespeare's \"King Lear\", begins as Lord Hidetora Ichimonji and his court are out hunting. During a break in the hunt, Hidetora proclaims his adbication from the hight seat of the Great Lord and bestows his lands unto his three sons, dividing them up equally. He declares his oldest to be his successor in power. When his youngest son and one of his faithful nobles, express their concerns on this idea, Hidetora foolishly banishes them both, mistaking their advice as insolence. With this opening scene, the peaces are aligned and soon 'chaos' as the film is aptly named will break out throughout the land. From here, we see the downfall of Hidetora and all those who surround him. The film retains all the themes of the original play, but also thanks to Kurosawa's own input addresses a slew of even more varied ideas. Like Shakespeare, Kurosawa is greatly interested in the responsibility of the leader and the hypocrisies and ironies of an autocratic system. The most obvious though not the central theme in the whole film is war, and Kurosawa explores this theme to its full extent throughout the film. In perhaps the most grandiose battle scene every filmed, he demonstrates the destructive consequences and the paradoxical beauty of conflict.Here, Kurosawa implements the camera with masterful skill not once employing the editing/photography tricks and gimmicks so often seen in films (even the good ones) today. This director has an awareness of the past and the history of film, but also the creative spontaneity of a true genius. In \"Ran\", he focuses on the more methodically simple yet artistically complex montage of Eisenstein, and on the strict compositions of Ozu. He employs the most basic and yet most artistic of techniques. Each shot is planned to precision, and each cut is made for a purpose. The coreagraphy and blocking of each scene is simple and powerful, and Kurosawa allows the actors to play out these scenes without the intrusion of the camera or the editor. Thus, the director prevents the style from eclipsing the already powerful material he has to work with. Simply put, \"Ran\" is a masterpiece that flows and develops like an opera, from its forebodingly peaceful ouverture to its bloody Shakespearean heart until its final, quietly subdued, and sorrowful denouement.",

            "content": "Based on Shakespeare's King Lear, this film follows the story of the aging warlord Hidetora who, in an attempt to restore peace, divides his kingdom between his three sons - Taro, Jiro, and Saburo - and retires from his duties. However, one of his sons sees this as unwise and is banished by his father, leaving his two brothers in charge of two of the three castles left in their hands. It isn't long before they are overtaken by greed and eventually betray their father, leaving him in the hands of a philosophical jester and a loyal retainer. This betrayal ultimately leads to war, dividing the family and driving Hidetora insane.The remarkable script, which contains many of my favorite lines from any film, still manages to break its way through the confinement of subtitles and reveals itself to be one of the richest Kurosawa ever wrote. He has obviously worked equally hard on the look and feel of the film - the cinematography being excellent (example: the long, continuous shot of Saburo's men charging on horseback across a river).There's also something rather frightening about it that I can't quite put my finger on. The first battle, which is the film's turning point, is the most horrifying, yet strangely beautiful, battles ever filmed. A good effect used is the loss of sound, with only Toru Takemitsu's haunting score to be heard. The entire battle lasts less than ten minutes and there is no uplifting or bombastic music to be heard, but in my opinion, it's Ran's finest scene, and thus the finest scene ever.What Kurosawa managed to get rather than give though was excellent performances from his actors, none more brilliant than Tatsuya Nakadai's Hidetora, Mieko Harada as Lady Kaede (a woman similar to Lady Macbeth but with a different hidden agenda), and the strangely-named Peter as Kyoami.",

            "content": "Realizing that it is practically heresy in the film world to criticize a Kurosawa film, much less downright dislike it, I'd like to precede my review by saying that I have absolutely loved every Kurosawa film I've seen \u0096 until now. \"Ran\", Kurosawa's 1985 film based somewhat on Shakespeare's \"King Lear\" is the story of an elderly emperor who hands down his kingdom to the oldest of his three sons. While the oldest and middle son fan over each other, saying that they are not deserving, etc. it is the youngest who speaks his mind about the subject, incurring the wrath of his father and ultimately, banishment from the area. Meanwhile, the two older sons are making a mess of things with the kingdom, leading to wars, fratricide and the dismissal of their father, even attempting his murder. None of their motives are noble or honorable, only avarice and power motivate them, leading to tragedy for all.Going into this, I knew that this was not going to be a light story by any means. For anyone who has read or is familiar with Lear, it is a story that is pretty much slogged through, though it is wonderfully told. \"Ran\" can pretty much be described the same way. While I certainly appreciated the good acting, the unbelievable costumes and the set design as a whole, I found myself unable to become engaged in the story. The pacing was extremely slow, certainly not an easy thing to deal with during a film that lasts about 2 hours and 40 minutes. Unfortunately, for myself at least, it is the pacing, visuals and story that can really make a foreign film a success for me, and I found that \"Ran\" only had one compelling element out of the three, which managed to save it from being an absolute dud, but not enough to make it as awesome as Kurosawa's other films are. (And in using the word awesome, I really mean the word \"awe\") Because of the costumes, at times arresting imagery, and the ultimate fate of Lady Kaede (which bumped up the film by an entire point for me because of its bluntness) I'm not completely panning the film. While I feel the film was a bit disappointing, I'm more disappointed in myself for not being able to like it as much as I would have wanted, since it has had such amazing reviews. But since you can't like them all, \"Ran\" gets a 5/10 from me.--Shelly",

            "content": "What a wonderfully varied medium film can be! Here we have a film that is both truly great and in a different way a clumsy mistake.By now you know that this was made by a master filmmaker at the end of his life -- in preparation for ten years and Asia's most expensive film. He intended it to be his last, his masterpiece.The Good: This work of art is a sequence of masterfully composed images. The camera remains stationary or virtually so, and each scene is richly rewarding in all the visual dimensions, including motion. The costumes are the most cinematic I have seen. There is a use of grasshopper sounds that is the best example I know of amplifying an image by sound. The frame of the picture is the landscape -- little takes place indoors, and that action always refers to some larger, exterior motion. In my experience, this is the best complement of Wells' Othello, the most masterful use of interior space I know.I give it a ten because it is a masterpiece in this area of cinematic communication, one that seems exceptionally underaddressed.The Bad: The Master attempted too much in trying to match his cinematic virtuosity by swallowing Shakespeare's Lear to produce an equally rich story. In this he fails -- so many problems here. First, Shakespeare wrote plays for a barren stage where the images grow from the mind, supported by super-rich language and interwoven visual metaphor. The scene grows from our understanding of the character and what that character says. Kurosawa tries it backwards here by placing characters is a vast scheme that came from his own mind, off-screen as it were, and it doesn't quite work.As it happens, Ran's emphasis is on grand motion. Little time is spent on character development, except with the scheming wife of the first son (a story element that has little Shakespearean counterpart). Lear is a play about demons and leaves the question open as to how many are from opportunistic devilment and which are internally generated. All this is discarded here, as well as the Gloucester counterplot. Among the great losses from the source are the continuous examinations of what sight means and what it can conceive. How fertile that would have been as dramatic scaffolding for Kurosawa's vision.There's a problem with language as well. Not knowing Japanese, I cannot judge how rich or intricate in metaphor is the film's dialogue. But the sound and dramatic utility of the speech is about as far from Shakespeare as you can get. Shakespeare uses his actors' speech to simultaneously move the dramatic action and to serve as a surrogate for the viewer's mind. Both the story and your own ruminations on the story are contained therein. This depends on a continuous, predictable assumed rythmic base which is articulated by a rich consonant based, cheating rubato. Japanese consists of staccato vowels that I suspect are overly dramatized in the short blasts we get from these characters. Could hardly be more unShakespearean. I assume there is a Noh legacy being mined here instead, which is not available to this western viewer.A side note: after seeing these battle scenes you'll never appreciate Speilberg's blatant ripoff in the first part of Sgt Ryan.",

            "review_title": "Masterpiece: arguably Kurosawa's best",
            "content": "\"He who knows others is wise. He who knows himself is enlightened.\" - Tao Te Ching\"Ran\" begins with a gorgeous sequence, director Akira Kurosawa treating us to several shots of soldiers on horseback, perched like gargoyles on a series of grassy hills. We assume these men are guarding the borders of some ancient Japanese kingdom, but it turns out they're running security escort for King Hidetora, an elderly warlord who is out hunting with his three sons.The film then quickly becomes a loose retelling of Shakespeare's \"King Lear\", Hidetora announcing his retirement and then proceeding to divide his kingdom equally between his three sons. In true Shakespearean fashion, Hidetora then stands back and watches with sadness as his spawn squabble and wage war, each interested in acquiring more power and respect than the other.But \"Ran\" is not simply a three-way battle between sons. One of the things that becomes apparent with repeated viewings are the subtle power plays being made behind the family. For example, rival warlords form alliances with the three brothers in an attempt to instigate battles between them, and the wife of one brother, Lady Kaede, moves like a serpent, constantly plotting against the King and his sons.Initially we sympathises with King Hidetora. After all, the poor guy loses his family and is forced to watch helplessly as his empire crumbles! But gradually we learn more and more about Hidetora's past; Kurosawa reveals that Hidetora was himself once a ruthless warlord who destroyed kingdoms and killed thousands. By the film's end we've thus witnessed a grand cycle being reset. Hidetora built his empire through violence and bloodshed and lost it likewise, one ruthless King essentially falling whilst another rises to take his place.So \"Ran\", which means \"chaos\" in Japanese, is less about King Hidetora's personal tragedy than it is about human tragedy on a much larger, more cosmic scale. Observe how Kurosawa uses various distancing techniques (he frequently cuts away to shots of cloud filled skies) in an attempt to convey the feeling that we are watching these characters and their petty squabbles from the heavens. With shades of Jancso (\"The Red and White\") and Kubrick (\"Paths of Glory\", the sublime \"Lyndon\"), Kurosawa's camera grants us the vantage point of enlightened Gods.Interestngly, \"Ran's\" aesthetic style is completely different to much of Kurosawa's early work. Kurosawa's pace is slow, his camera rarely moves, close-up shots are rare, the film's acting is stylized and mannered (drawing from Japanese Noh theatre, though perhaps also Brecht?) and characters are held at a distance. Most find this grating - none of the ingratiating of say, a David Lean epic - but this is a more mature, deeper and less imitable Kurosawa. Whilst his earlier features have been imitated to death, perhaps to the point where they have lost some of their power, \"Ran\" remains sublime.Gone also are the usual Kurosawan moral platitudes. There is little preaching here, and few of the trite moral lessons and dips into sentimentality that mar many of Kurosawa's early films. Indeed, it seems that Kurosawa only matured into a \"serious\" artist in the years leading up to and after his failed suicide attempt. He achieved a sort of gerotranscendence with his later films, shifting to a more transcendent vision of the world. These films thus have a very holistic view of time and space, life and death, moving away from ego-centricism to a more cosmic world-view. Perhaps such an artistic shift was spurred on by Kurosawa's own existential crisis in the early 70s.King Hidetora himself achieves gerotranscendence after a failed suicide. It is then that he stumbles upon a blind man who was once the victim of his past savagery. Forced to directly confront his past, his self image no longer based on illusions of heroism and glory, Hidetora promptly becomes a tormented spirit. Kurosawa has him wear a white face mask from this point onwards, tearing across the landscape like a ghost.\"Ran\" ends with a powerful sequence. An army marches in the foreground whilst, far in the distance, a blind man walks dangerously close to a cliff's edge, tentatively tapping away at the earth with his walking cane. The man's walking cane then hits open air, he stumbles slightly and the film abruptly ends. Kurosawa's point is clear: humanity is blind, perpetually on the verge of tumbling down some dark abyss. But note too how the blind man is elevated, far above the army down below. He may risk falling, but he, unlike most in the film, has begun his long climb back toward virtue. \"Ran\" is packed with similar, cleanly drawn \"metaphors\", though at times Kurosawa's dialogue is ridiculously direct. Entire sequences of the film spell out Kurosawa's themes, character dialogue signposting the director's moral messages at every turn. It's all at times very hokey (subtler in Japanese?).Needless to say, Kurosawa's compositions and use of colour are dazzling. At times the film seems like a series of landscape paintings and the master's soundtrack is also fairly experimental.Note to younger viewers, preconceptions in tow: there are no \"cool\" samurai battles here, only a melancholic battle sequence which Kurosawa shoots without sound. Such sequences are nightmarish rather than gratuitous, Kurosawa balking at the horror that other directors salivate over. \"Ran's\" stylized acting also takes some getting used to, requiring several viewings to fully absorb the film's various character motivations, traits, names, nuances and faces. One character, a copy of the court jester in \"King Lear\", is particularly annoying until we properly tune in to his role. Like Shakespeare's jester, he exists outside the story, designed to comment on man's follies.9.5/10 - Despite some heavy-handed dialogue, this is arguably Kurosawa's best film, and one which rewards (or gets richer with) repeat viewings, something few films genuinely do.",

Shakespeare wrote King Lear as a mirror on the human condition. We do not have to be kings and princesses to identify with the father's desire for the well being of his children, even if his own life was one of cruelty and pain. We see this theme throughout great literature and film. What Ran has done is to provide the viewer with many small moments within the pain to realize the beauty. Even the moment of epiphany for Hidetora, when his actions achieve his madness, is one of surpassing beauty. As the storm rages outside the small house of the prince he blinded, whose parents he killed, whose sister he forcibly married off, the simple sounds of the flute provide an intense focus on the here and now. It is at this moment when Hidetora recognizes that he himself sowed the seeds of his own destruction. There is no dialogue, no swashbuckling, just the terrible beauty of the music. As with many of Kurasowa's films, despite their epic scope, it is the small paint strokes that make up the master's canvas.",

And indeed it was, for me second only to Seven Samurai as his best film and one of the finest movies ever made. As with any Kurasawa film, it is superbly made with the camera work in look and technique masterly and the colour and period detail really sumptuous. The battle sequences are even more epic in scope and emotional impact than Seven Samurai, aided by the spectacle and camera work. The music is rousing and haunting, almost sometimes paying homage to Mahler, the script is literate and thoughtful and the story intensely moving. Add to that Kurasawa's ever immaculate direction and the truly remarkable lead performance Tatsuya Nakadai and you have an even more brilliant film. Rounding off is the truly Machiavellian performance of Mieko Harada as the daughter-in-law figure. The over-two-and-a-half-hour length and slow pacing didn't hinder Ran in the slightest, at least to me anyway, though some not used to Kurasawa's style may be deterred. In conclusion, there wasn't much I really could add to the wonderful reviews already, but I do think Ran is a superb film with much to admire. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

            "content": "This movie came as a big disappointment to me. I really adore Japanese culture and history and I am a big fan of Asian cinema. I was looking forward to see a film that is considered as a masterpiece by many and has risen to world wide fame.I was surprised to see so many flaws in this film that I don't even know where to start. First of all, the movie is far too long and lacks of fluidity. The story is extremely predictable and develops no tension at all. The script is very poor and unoriginal. It steals several ideas from many other theatre plays and movies. One always feels that one has seen the same story elsewhere before and in a much better way. The beginning is overlong and should have been shortened. The middle part with the scenes in the field and the destroyed castle include many lengths. The ending is not well told and finishes too abruptly on the other side.The battle scenes are a complete fail. We see a shot of soldiers shooting in a forest. In the next shot, we see five soldiers yelling and falling from the horses to die on the ground. Repeat the two shots five times and this is what the battle scenes of this movie are like. There is no action, no aesthetic and no emotion in those scenes. It rather looks like a chess game than a true battle.The dialogues are amongst the poorest ones I have ever witnessed in cinema and I have seen thousand of movies. They are extremely wooden and sometimes so ridiculous that I had to laugh out hard. The scenes including the arrogant, philosophical and schizophrenic fool are annoying. When the old lord gets insane and just always says the same couple of sentences throughout the second half of the movie and shares many scenes with the fool, the whole thing looks like a parody in form of an old fashioned theatre play for kids. Some intellectual people will now talk about the irony that the fool always tells the truth and switches roles with his master and that the poor old man saved the fool and that this action started all the intrigues but this is no excuse for so many poor and repetitive dialogues.The characters are not credible. The movie tries to include many hints at traditional Japanese culture but these elements are exaggerated and don't seem authentic at all to me. The role of the fool that insults everybody around him but stays extremely faithful to his old master once he has gone insane is ridiculous. A man that shows this kind of disrespect would have been executed in traditional Japan. A woman like Lady Kaede would have never been so successful with her predictable intrigues. Any credible husband or brother-in-law would have given an order to execute her. The fact that Lady Sue could easily escape from the castle and go to her brother is not credible at all even if she got help. One would have followed and killed her and the traitor that refuses to obey his master and its sister-in-law would have been executed, too. It also seems strange to me that the lord's adviser finally kills Lady Kaede without getting the order by his superior while the lord stands next to him and doesn't react. I'm not an expert of Japanese history but from what I have seen from other movies, read from several books, known from history lessons and heard from Japanese that I could meet, many of these scenes don't seem realistic to me at all if I think about the severe code of honour of this country.After so many negative aspects, let's mention some positive things. Even though the characters aren't credible and the dialogues are wooden, it's not the mistake by the actors but by the writer and director. The acting itself is well executed and should be praised. It's the only thing that kept me watching this flick until the end. To give you an example, the interpretation of Lady Kaede or the annoying fool are well done from an objective point of view.At the time of its creation, this movie was Japan's most expensive production ever. Akira Korusawa was a big name and he got some good connections. You can see this by the inclusion of many supportive actors, excellent settings and especially many valuable costumes that are created with much detail. The film is quite colourful and beautiful to watch. Only the camera cuts are stiff and some potential is wasted there.Concerning the story, even though the whole thing is predictable, some of the intrigues are still well done. After a weak start and before a weaker second half of the movie, we have around forty-five minutes or so that are really entertaining and have some plot development. This is the strongest part of the movie.In the end, there are some positive points to mention but the weaker ones are in majority. It's definitely not the mistake of the costume makers, the actors or the light and sound engineers that do an almost flawless job. It's the fault of the poor writers and the headless director. Shame on you, Mister Akira Korusawa. Even a big name can't save this film that must be considered as a failure at the highest level. It's not the worst thing I have seen but still below average. I definitely don't recommend this movie to anybody apart of fans of gorgeous costumes and old fashioned theatre plays.",

When the kingdom is divided among the sons in this version of King Lear, we just know that the person who bares himself honestly is going to become an outsider. The acting is sensational, with masterful personal encounters. Kurosawa even managed to keep the fool as an integral part of the story. Others have eloquently dissected this movie. What I have to offer is that there is such a poetry to the visual aspects of this film. While the battle scenes are among the goriest and grizzliest that have ever been put on celluloid, there is a dance here, a wave of the most intense coming and going as we watch the soldiers fall. It tells how potentially good men can be influenced by the forces of evil. The wife of the first son is purely vengeful, and horrifying. She is nearly a carbon copy of the woman who played the wife of Mifune's Macbeth character in \"Throne of Blood.\" I have been reviewing the Kurosawa canon and am convinced that this may be his finest work.",

            "content": "\"Ran\", which means translated \"Revolt\", bit this is not really used as a title for this film, is a Japaese/French co-production from 1985, so it will have its 35th anniversary next year. This movie is linked inevitably with Akira Kurosawa, by many considered the finest non-American filmmaker of all time, and it is a late career effort by him. He had already been in filmmaking for way over 40 years when he came up with this one we got here thatg turned into one of his career-defining movies. It is of course in contrastg to most of his earlier stuff in color and runs for over 2 hours and 40 minutes. I guess it was a tribute to Kurosawa that the Academy really appreciated this one as it also could have been a film that could have gone completely under the radar. However, it scored 4 Oscar nominations, one of them being for Best Costume for which it took home the award. And I think all these nominations are not undeserving. On the contrary, one or two acting nominations, for Nakadai and Haradai perhaps, would have been appropriate too. Butg lets get into the film. This is the story of an influential old Lord (played by a much younger actor by the way) who hands on the power to his sons. Too late he recognizes thatg he made a huge mistake that may not only endanger his heritage, but also his life eventually. But while the sons are pursuing their violent path, there is a new threat rising with a women full of revenge. Can the last remaining son help his father find a way out of his misery? Watch for yourself. One thing I want to emphasize here is that I mentioned earlier Kurosawa made many b&w films, but the way he uses colors for this film proves without a doubt that it is a shame he did not make more color films. For example before and after this film, there is a break of five years each. Anyway, with colors I was referring to red, yellow and blue mostly here, the colors symbolizing the sons and their armies. Things get heated for the first time when the old patriarch kills one of his soldiers' sons who was about to kill one of the old man's guards. Blood is not thicker than water in this case and the blue son (lets call him that) predicted it correctly. It takes a long time for the father to understand and a really rocky journey during which he turns from one of the most influential men of his country into an old bum you could say that is considered insane by many.However, he is not, he only may seem that way. His final words and actions show that and even if his body is ailing, his mind should not be mistaken for being gone. I want to elaborate a little bit more on how this film is so different than what an American or probably also European movie about this subject would have looked like completely away from the country where it is set. With this I am mostly speaking about the blue son. We may have seen a from zero to hero storyline involving him \u00e0 la Gladiator and this would have resulted in a much weaker movie without a doubt. But this is never his movie, not one bit. He is basically gone for almost the rest of the film after he is sent into exile by his father. Even if he was the only one getting it right, this does not mean he is at the center of the story. When he returns, he is killed off pretty quickly and that sure came surprising, even if the father's words about how he has so much to talk about with his son somewhat indicated it would not happen. But yeah, I expected the dad to die, but he sure is a fighter. And when he finally concedes, this results in probably the best moment of spoken language and dialogue, well rather monologue, and again this comes from a character we hardly know anything about when there is an elaboration of how nobody should blame the Gods for humans being greedy and violent enough over centuries to destroy everything and everybody around them in their insatiable hunger for power and always wanting more. Instead on the blue son, the film focuses on the power struggles for those who are in power actually, the yellow son, but evenmoreso the red son, who runs into a woman who is even more ruthless and cold-blooded than he is in exacting her revenge for those she lost and losing them destroyed the last bit of empathy inside her. I must say while watching the film I struggled a bit with this character also how she uses her power and almost kills the red son out of nowhere. It is interesting how women (wives) were far more than quiet bearers back then. But the more I think about this character, the more I like it and I think it is a worthy addition, also shown by the fact that I mentioned the actress deserving a supporting actress nomination at the Oscars. But she was probably too unknown for that. Anyway, fittingly she gets also killed all of a sudden by another minor character. It feels realisic. It is never about the big players doing the crucial deeds here, but just anybody for whom it feels right looking at their anger.Yes this is a really long movie, but in my opinion it felt far shorter than over 2.5 hours I must say. It is definitely with all the customs, traditions and very style-focused sequences not a film that will appeal to everybody, but if you manage to make a connection, then you are in for a high-quality movie. Like mostg other Japanese films, they are doing completely without comedy. Even the foxhead scene that may seem funny to the untraiend eye has far more dramatic depth than just the intent to make you laugh. And even if my rating may not make you think like that, this is one of the most powerful anti-war movies I have seen. It is uncompromising, realistic and not scared of taking untraditional parts when it comes to story-telling. And completely away from the story, this is really a mesmerizing watch visually in terms of cinematography, costumes, make-up and art direction. Something every film student should see really, not just those from Japan. I can see why many years after Kurosawa's death and even more years after films like this one have been made, so many still cite him as a gigantic inspiration and dedicate their works to him. I was lucky enough yesterday to watch the film on the big screen, a really rare occasion for such an old movie, but I am very glad I took it and if you happen to get the same chance I highly recommend you to take it. The more I think about this film, the more I like it. There were more thna just a few scenes and moments that deserve a higher rating than 3 out of 5 stars, but overall this is what I am going with at this point. Maybe I will increase it on rewatch we'll see. Also I want to call this film a formidable period piece as, even if there were firearms included, it plays several centuries in the past. This genre is not just about English royalties, but here we have a very different approach showing everybody how it needs to be done. A real powerhorse of a movie and I am glad it got the attention it received back then and is still seen by many today. Also a huge success from the technical perspective if we look at sound effects mostly and yes the soundtrack is really good too, but also visual effects (the scene where the red and yellow army chase down the old man is a true spectacle and I am saying this as somebody who normally couldn't care less about visual effects). So many high-quality production values here. And to end it all, finally a few words on the very last scene, the blind woman at the abyss. Well, I understood it as follows. She may be blind, but still manages to recognize the abyss before falling into a most certain death. Those who see are not that lucky. Or not that smart you could also say. So you could say Kurosawa leads the human a mind a bit ad absurdum eventually. But that's what he has done all the way before that too because there is no reason to all the insanity in here. That's all folks. Don't miss out on this one.",

Saburo is the only son who says that is not happy with that decision,speaking against his father. This one,being fooled by flattery of the two older sons,decides to banish Saburo of his lands.After this, what comes is a series of perfidiousness of his older sons,and even his daughter in law, lady Kaede,who wants to revenge her family,since they were the true owners of the castle, and were killed by Hidetora.Hidetora becomes mad, and totally exiled from his lands. And he discovers that his son Saburo, was the only one who really was loyal to him.There are many messages in this movie;one of the them,clearly is that not all the compliments are honest, and they can have bad intentions behind. Sometimes,someone near you can look insolent,but is only being honest. It's better a horrible true, than a fake lie,although not all the people are prepared to listen to the true. Not to mention that sometimes, you think that the person who is going to help you,really doesn't care about you,(like Hidetora's older sons) and you find all the help you need, in people you expect to not even be concerned with you. (like Saburo,the exiled son, and even Tsurumaru, who has lost everything he had, including his eyes because of Hidetora, and even on this way, he helps the old man with shelter.)Kurosawa also shows a vision about the mankind: We only search for war and sadness, instead of happiness and peace.

Here, heavy with meaning symbols are extensively presented, which not only makes the plot appear very drawn out but also hard to grasp: they are so abstract at times that picking up on them is rather unlikely, unless you have a profound literary background knowledge and a trained eye of course.\nThe strong influence of classical theatre is also only a plus for the more educated: for instance characters proclaiming their thoughts and feelings is a necissity on stage, but in film this feels kind of out of place. The same goes for the demonstrative use of the names of the scene of events: it's obviously a legitimate means of conveying critical information and also meaning in a script of a play, but film offers so many more and much more effective options than that.\nAlso: Why is \"going insane\" such a must-have plot item in a classical drama?All in all it's a movie that definitely will have its place in the collections of enthusiasts, but to everyone else it might just be too tough to chew.

Certain characters continually question what is happening around them, and through these questions, the themes of the movie are forthcoming. The most obvious theme is that of war. Here, once again, Kurosawa reminds us that modern warfare is not a place of honour or duels, but massed attacks on faceless enemies, shooting each other from a distance. I will discuss the battle scenes later in this review; they help us examine the chaos that is again consistent throughout the film. It seems that no one in this movie has any control over the events that are transpiring; not even the ultimate manipulator Mieko Harada as Lady Kaede has true control. This lack of control seems to mirror the idea put forward by the only character who is continually able to tell the truth without ramification. Shinnosuke Ikehata (credited here as Peter) is the fool who says 'Are there no gods... no Buddha? If you exist, hear me. You are mischievous and cruel! Are you so bored up there you must crush us like ants? Is it such fun to see men weep?' Even if god exists then the only pleasure he enjoys is watching mankind destroy itself in the chaotic mess that is war. The final scenes see chaos erupt, as through the good natured actions of one man, 4 armies are dragged into a bloody battle. Which leads us to the idea of futility and death. The pointlessness of life is summed up once again by the fool. 'Man is born crying. When he has cried enough, he dies.' Death comes to us all, yet it is far bleaker than that. If there is a god then they allow everyone to suffer. Even a noble character, like Saburo, dies an ignoble and futile death. Everyone within this movie is both hunter and hunted. It is a bleak world indeed.Then we have morality. There are very few 'good' characters here, but there are three exceptions to this. Saburo, Lord Hidetora's third and youngest son, who because of his love and loyalty to his father is unable to not speak out at the foolishness he sees around him, which leads to his banishment. Tango, a loyal servant to Lord Hidetora who is banished with Saburo, but through love for his lord disguises himself so as to stay near him. Finally there is Kyoami, the fool. He again is loyal to his Lord, however, he voices ideas of leaving his side numerous times, but again his sense of duty and even affection keep him with his master.The movie itself is near perfect. Stylistically it is almost like watching a play. Both the staging and the style of acting are clearly very influenced by Japanese Noh theatre, with the slow and deliberate style of acting used, and the mask-like appearance of age notable in the make up of Nakadai as the seventy year old Hiderota. Every shot looks like a masterpiece, perfectly framed. Kurosawa trained as an artist, indeed he painted the storyboard for every shot in the film. The framing is perfect and in most senses the camera does not move at all, or if it does, it is simply to keep the perfection of the shot intact. Kurosawa was a master film maker, this is clear throughout. His confidence with film is breathtaking: only a director totally sure in his craft would dare leave the long, motionless pauses at the end of almost every scene, punctuating what has just happened and allowing the audience to grasp the full implication of the actions taking place.Kurosawa is, of course, well known for his ability to direct action, and this movie recreates war in a way few others have ever managed to do. There are two great battles here, one in the middle and one during the end. The final battle is perfectly staged, riveting, and speaks volumes of the futility that the lust and pride of Jiro Masatoras, Hiderotas second son (played by Jinpachi Nezu) has led to. But for me it is the first battle that is the one of the greatest moments in cinema. Due to council given by a traitor, Lord Hidetora has led his household, which includes 30 warriors, to the castle of the outcast Saburo. It is a trap, and Taro Takatora (Akira Terao), his first son and Jiro strike. What follows is horrific. This is the purist language of movie, and a thing of true genius. On the battlefield, even in the world of the Samurai, there is no honour, no real glory, only ugliness and death.It is interesting to note that seeing someone actually kill another person in this movie is rare. Considering the acclaim Kurosawa has garnered for the sword fighting sequences in so many of his movies it is interesting to note that not once do you see a sword kill another person on screen. Indeed, there are only two times we really witness one person attacking and killing another, other than mutual suicide. The first is entirely shown at a massive distance, the figures barely distinguishable, and the second, despite being amazingly gory, does not actually show the death itself on camera.Yet with all of this emphasis on framing, shot, symbolism and colour, Kurosawa manages to bring to the screen some of the greatest performances I think I have ever witnessed. I have to cut short my praise of what is a faultless cast and talk about Mieko Harada giving perhaps the finest performance in the movie. Driven by anger and vengeance she becomes something other than human, she is some kind of succubus, a temptress, a fox-spirit. Harada is at all times compelling, her every movement one of cold perfection and as we hear her silk robes rustling as she glides along the wooden floors we see before us an unforgettable creation of pure evil.",

            "content": "Lord Hidetora announces his plans to step down as Lord of his lands and, whilst he does keep title and men, all will pass to his eldest son, with his younger two sons each taking control of the second and third castle. Youngest son Saburo derides his foolishness, claiming that this will split the kingdom and that natural divisions will rise up, but he is dismissed by all and banished by Hidetora for his dissent. So the change begins and internal wrangling occur immediately with Taro's wife Kaede stirring up ill feelings in him against his father.The things about mediocre films is that often they are easiest to watch and so often I pick them over more interesting fare simply because it seems like the easiest thing to do. So-so films offer you little but conspire to take little from you other than time. So I regularly find myself in a position where I have seen lots of films but yet cannot comment on some that are considered classic. Recently I was in Paris for a week break and stumbled upon a showing of paintings and sketches by Akira Kurosawa and, having been watching some of his black and white films of late I paid my money and went in. The paintings were mostly designs for his films and yet again I found myself wondering why I had not seen these films even though I knew of them and had read about them on lots of critic's list. LoveFilm helped me again by supplying Ran off my list a few months later and I'll be honest and say it sat for a few weeks in favour of lesser stuff.Finally seeing it I regret leaving it so long because it is a great film that paints on an epic scale as a clan collapses on itself but still manages to tell the story at a personal level of the corrupted and the corrupters. Unmistakably King Lear in construct, the film is engaging throughout as we have battles and treachery all around but yet the descent into madness of the Lord is still an interesting section to the film, as is the treachery and bitter hate of Lady Kaede. It is a fascinating tale and one that benefits from the richness that Kurosawa is able to give it. His use of open landscapes and convincing period locations adds quality to the film and the whole thing is shot with a great eye for beauty and colour \u0096 credit to the cinematographer. The script is functional at times but mostly we have real characters portrayed, which makes the film more engaging as they betray and are in turn betrayed. The cast use this very well but a couple of performances do stand out. Nakadai will appear a bit overdone to Western eyes in his heavy white make-up but this must be accepted in the way it is done, which is a cultural reference. Behind this though his performance is great as he starts powerful and wise but falls through rage into madness. It is a powerful theme of the film that part of his fall is a recognition of what he himself has done in the past and how that is coming for him whether real or imagined. Harada is the second turn that sticks in the mind as she is sly evil personified; not the most subtle of characters perhaps (I preferred the similar character in Throne of Blood) but she dominates her scenes and is quite intimidating as a screen presence due to how well her ruthlessness comes over. The sons are all well played in different ways with Terao, Nezu and Ryu all having different types of material to show what they do. I liked the fool played by Ikehata and how the script used him opposite the Lord and the massive supporting cast of generals and extras are all convincing and stout.Ran does have a hard time going for it in regards modern audiences; not only is it subtitled and over twenty years old but it is also a rough adaptation of Shakespeare \u0096 not really anything that a MTV viewer will jump at. However it is worth the jump because it is a great film with consistently interesting themes, strong performances, great direction and a story that runs in the hearts of the characters but is played out on an impressively epic scale. Well worth seeking out and another reason why Kurosawa has the reputation that he does.",

            "content": "This was my fourth Kurosawa film and my favourite to date. Previously, I'd started off by watching SEVEN SAMURAI (a great film), then trying out KAGEMUSHA (which I thought was okay, but too constrained by budget). Next up was an early classic, RASHOMON, which was a fine human drama, and now comes RAN, Kurosawa's final historical epic and the film that he claimed KAGEMUSHA was a mere warm-up for. I can see that. RAN is an epic film, truly epic and one of the best-shot films I've ever seen. Every frame of the film seems to have been painstakingly composed and the result is a bright, colourful, and vivid production that fully brings to life the castles, costumes, and characters of feudal Japan.Tatsuya Nakadai, returning from KAGEMUSHA, here plays Lord Ichimonji, an immensely powerful ruler who concedes that power to his three sons at the film's beginning. However, his plans quickly go awry and before too long he finds himself ostracised from Japanese society and a literal outcast. This film is a loose reworking of the Shakespeare classic King Lear (another favourite of mine), something I really enjoyed as Kurosawa takes elements of the Shakespeare plot without following it slavishly. One of the best inclusions is the fool, who comments on the on-screen antics the same way as he did in the Shakespeare play.It goes without saying that RAN is a tragedy and, indeed, it must be one of the most tragic films I've ever witnessed. Those looking for a happy ending should go elsewhere as this is all about doom, despair, and overall the failings of human nature. There's a fine cast of stand-out performers but one of the best has to be Mieko Harada, whose Lady Macbeth-style character is vengeful and terrifying. Nakadai, unrecognisable in ghostly, age-old makeup, is outstanding as the lord losing his mind, and Kurosawa is there to capture every little nuance. The most dramatic part of the film is a massacre set in a castle which is full of on screen death and destruction and successfully depicts the ferocity of battle better than 99% of other films do.Like most of the Kurosawa historical epics, this is a lengthy and slow moving film, one that emphasis characterisation over action, plot over incident, but it's well worth sitting through. In the end, I found this one of the most rewarding films I've ever watched and anybody who professes themselves to be a fan of the cinematic medium should have it in their collection.",

            "content": "The combination of excellent cinema and Kurosawa isn't anything new. In Ran (chaos), he paints his own vision of one of Shakespeare's finest works, 'King Lear'. 'Ran' looks more like an oil painting rather than 'water coloured'. While in 'water' paintings, the colour's are fading, in oil, the colours have a stronger presence signifying their message. He uses various colours to tone the depth of his characters and the relationship between them, to present the mood of the setting and to tell his story. With very brilliantly sophisticated sound effects he brings a raw feel while effectively using the background score in parts. Using his artistic technique, he pays close attention to detail in almost every scene (e.g. the wind, the makeup) without worrying about limiting his final piece to a usual 1.5 hour movie or whether the pace is fast or slow. Of course there must have been some editing but everything in the final piece flows beautifully, revealing a story of love, honour, betrayal, misunderstanding, lust, murder, jealousy, manipulation, greed, madness, redemption, forgiveness and destruction.Tatsuya Nakadai breathes Lord Hidetora Ichimonji. He had starred in many of Kurosawa's films and in 'Ran' he is absolutely a stunner. This is more than an example of great acting because he made me completely forget that I was looking at an actor. Another noteworthy performance is Mieko Harada's as the venomous Lady Kaede. She displays the power of her manipulation and evil intent through her body language while her words are secondary.Immense additional credit must also be given to Kurosawa for skilfully mingling a Shakespearean tragedy into a traditional Japanese historical epic. Clearly he'd done his research well and put a lot of hard work into his painting. The background is signified with much of the Japanese cultures and religious reference.I won't give much of a synopsis as you'll find them in other comments and those who've read King Lear may have an idea. All I'll say that this movie is for those who appreciate real cinema. It is not what others will call 'everyone's cup of tea'. It does make you reflect to the real world how one's expression can be misinterpreted, how life itself is not a happy ending, how dangerous trusting the wrong person can be and how important it is to trust the right person (even a family member), how greed can eat up a person, how the consequences of our actions dictate whether the mistake we made is significant or trivial and how na\u00efve we all are.",

And, for some reason, this is not among my favorites although it is one of his highest rated films on IMDb. Perhaps I'm just being too picky, but I think MAYBE its popularity is because it was made somewhat recently and some of his older (and I think more interesting) films are sometime forgotten. After all, MOST of the IMDb reviewers are old enough that they could have seen this film on the big screen, while very few could have seen his earlier films in all their glory. The other reason why I think it's a little overrated is that his version of Macbeth (Throne of Blood) is the best retelling of Shakespeare and so Ran, despite it being wonderful, pales if you see them one after another (like I did). And finally, the characters and their interactions are just sterile--with little understanding or life to the them.So what DOES this film have going for it? Well, the word is SPECTACLE. Like KAGAMUSHA (which came out around the same time), it had a big budget and glorious locations. It is simply a gorgeous film to see. Some watch Kurosawa for the spectacle, I tend to look more at the characterizations which are really secondary in this film.Give me a film like Kurosawa's IKARU or SCANDAL over a film like this.",

He sticks mainly to only the skeleton of the play and makes as many deviations as possible, the most remarkable and successful being to let the fool stay on with King Lear throughout the drama to the bitter end, while in the play he is lost half way without an explanation. Instead of troublesome daughters there are troublesome sons, and the youngest proves to be the only true and correct one of them, like Cordelia, and meets with a similar fate but more militarily. In comparison with his earlier masterpiece \"Kagemusha\" there are less horses here and less beautiful music, while the main character of the film with its many devastating battles and massacres is rather apocalyptic, with some marvellous contrasts to the general doom, especially by the female interaction and the blind flutist, who makes something of a frontispiece and symbolic figurehead to the entire epic, adding some profound symbolism. Above all, Tatsuya Nakadai as the troubled old king is the best and most convincing Lear type I have ever seen, transcending even Laurence Olivier's characterization by mere physical acting without speech - his finest part is when he sits totally unmoved while everything around him is burning in the apocalyptic siege of the castle after the first hour. His long white hair, his wild eyes, his impersonation of the ultimate despair by mere movements and expressions - is enough to make this film only for his sake one of the most outstanding and indispensable films in all history - and it was Akira Kurosawa's ultimate masterpiece, made when he himself was 75 years old.",

I find some of them great and others just so-so, even if they're heralded by the professional critics. Having just watched Yimou Zhang's \"Curse of the Golden Flower\", I was pretty well conditioned for another film about Orientals in a dysfunctional family attempting to take each other out. The disconnect I have here is why all of a sudden the three brothers would have turned on each other without their father, Lord Hidetora Ichimonji (Tatsuya Nakadai), having an inkling that they were so mercenary and self serving. I'm also put off by the histrionics and aping aspect of some of the principals. As an example, the facial contortions of Hidetora reminded me of John Belushi doing his eye squints as the Samurai character on 'Saturday Night Live'. Somehow it takes away from the seriousness of the character, as when Hidetora jumps off the cliff and winds up none the worse for wear in the valley below.Maybe it's just the frame of mind I was in when I watched this film. I didn't have a total appreciation of \"The Seven Samurai\" until a second viewing, so that might be the case here as well.

            "content": "Review in one sentence: This movie has zero energy. What follows is my fragmented, chronological lambasting of this \"masterpiece.\" The characters are cardboard cutouts with very little in terms of actual development. The opening scene begins with an argument between Hidetora and his three sons. It's almost like it assumes retroactive character maturity that was never established to begin with. It would have been nice to see some color in terms of personality, with each of these three key players given some screen time before the big fallout. In the seemingly endless line of miscalculations made on the part of our favorite \"masterful\" filmmaker, Akira Kurosawa (\"AK\") decides to provide *his* kind of \"color\" \u0096 vague one-liners. The \"pranks\" of the third son are referenced, but we get no actual development of his character (he does have one good moment later on). As for the other two sons, we don't even get AK's fuzzy caricatures. This viewer was left wholly indifferent by all of these sons, and their opaque motivations didn't help matters.Even worse is the portrayal of the vitally important fifth character. In AK's infinite stupidity, he chooses to have the key puppetmaster (Lady Kaede) simply state that her father and brothers were murdered by Hidetora and that her mother committed suicide. There is ample opportunity for a flashback (or a lengthy opening historical segment) that actually fleshes out her character while allowing the viewer to experience her sorrows directly, but AK simply settles for dull monologue by a one-dimensional personality. At one point (early in the film), she's sitting down and simply states that she's happy to be living in her old residence again. It's an utterly robotic, emotionless, tedious series of statements that are boring as hell. Only AK could portray vengeance in a manner this dull.We get the first battle and see a bunch of generic guys killing each other with no reason to care who actually wins. Some women that we don't know kill themselves along the way. There are some decent visuals though. Not bad, but not exactly scintillating.After the battle we get some of the vintage overacting that shows up in most of AK's films. Hidetora goes crazy and frolics in the grasslands. When his two buddies show up to comfort him, he stares into space, opens his mouth as wide as a Pez dispenser, and has a hissy fit while his jester runs around singing. It's a total disaster of dramaticism. But that's not all. Hidetora's buddies carry him to some random shack, only to learn that the resident just so happens to be a dude that got his eyes gauged out by Hidetora years ago. Impractical coincidence alert! So what does this blind dude do to the man who handicapped him for life? Does he curse him? Does he lunge at him with a knife? No. He plays a sad flute song. Hidetora then promptly throws *himself* through a wall. Such a \"masterful\" filmmaker, AK is.We go back to Lady Kaede, who magically goes from stoic carelessness to knife-wielding lunatic in 5 seconds flat, then takes another turn to hysterical crocodile tears only a few minutes later. Hey AK, that flashback would have been REALLY helpful. And do you know what else would have been helpful? A little relationship development between Kaede and the two sons to help the viewer in understanding exactly why these powerful men are wrapped around her little finger. You did have 160 minutes to use here. Why not use them properly for a change? Over 90 minutes in and we finally get a well-written moment when a stone fox-head is returned to Lady Kaede. Then again, even a broken clock is right twice a day. Of course, AK immediately follows this brief success with another laughable attempt at manipulation. The blind dude and his sister (who has become a target for assassination) are escorted to safety. His sister spots an old castle and tells him about it. He asks where it is. Now, any thoughtful sister would give her blind brother some idea of where this castle is. Perhaps she could take his hand and point it in the right direction. Unfortunately, this is one of those \"masterful\" Akira Kurosawa movies, so she simply blurts out \"Over there!\" The blind dude turns to the right, turns to the left, and asks \"Where?\" Some sad music accompanies this hopelessly incompetent scene where AK so blatantly reminds the viewer that \u0096 yes \u0096 the blind dude is, in fact, BLIND! Good ole AK wanted the viewer to feel sorry for the blind dude, so he constructs this ridiculous scene to pile it on. I laughed. The direction here is so terribly amateurish that only fanboys could possibly deny AK's clumsy incompetence.Hidetora gets amnesia and babbles senselessly. Stuff like, \"Who am I?\" and \"I'm lost.\" \"Such is the human condition\", replies the jester. Give me a break. In a truly hilarious moment, the jester tells Hidetora to simply jump off a cliff if he's so disturbed about everything. Hidetora promptly jumps off a cliff. I laughed. Later on, Hidetora suddenly remembers that he has three sons. I'm serious.We get the final battle, which is pathetic. First of all, the blue samurai army somehow gets their hands on some semi-automatic rifles. What on earth are semi-automatic rifles doing in this period piece? Next, the editing is atrocious. The sequence is so badly cut up that one wonders if a young Paul Greengrass was hired as the action director. Third, the battle strategies suck. The red army rides around in circles while the blue army shoots them down. Not good.AK finishes things off with his patented overdramaticism. Hidetora even goes so far as to say \u0096 out loud, no less \u0096 \"Things are getting dark.\" Wow. Just wow.",

To be fair if you combine Shakespearean tragedy with Samurai swords, medieval castles and fuedal savagery, you can't really go too far wrong.This was produced and directed by Akira Kurosawa, the most beloved of all Japanese filmmakers. His work is much more accessible than arguably Japan's finest ever film director, Ozu. This is probably Akira Kurosawa's most popular film after Yojimbo and Sanjuro. This is one of the few Akira Kurosawa films shot in color. This movie can also lay claim to the fact that George Lucas and Steven Spielberg ponied up the dough to fund and release it to a worldwide audience. That almost made up for Howard the Duck and 1941.If you're not familiar with the story of King Lear, here is the deal. It's finally time that an aging senile king must divide up his kingdom between his three daughters. Two are conniving moles whose tongues only ever drip honeyed platitudes to their Father. Since they tell him what he wants to hear, he hands them the largest pieces of his royal pie, while the third, the honest and pious but bluntly speaking youngest daughter is pushed to the side. Being the wisest, she bides her time, fully expecting her older sisters to annihilate one another and ready to step in to salvage whatever is left of her Father's kingdom, whom she only wants to preserve in order to honour her ailing father. Clearly the tragedy is that her Father should have chosen her over her nasty cold hearted siblings.So swap that for an aging Samurai lord and his three Male heirs and you basically get the idea. To complicate that family tragedy, old enemy armies stand at the border, massing to attack his land, while the old senile fool is dithering over who gets to eat pie and who gets stand in the shadows. This is one excellent samurai action war film. It's a good primer in getting acquainted with the art and story telling of sensei Kurosawa, himself an actual member of the Samurai class, so it is something of a poignant thing for him to tell stories purely exploring the national character of both feudal and modern Japan.I own the bluray version of this movie and the picture is stunning.",

            "content": "A period epic brought to life in exhausting detail, Akira Kurosawa's Ran is a splendidly crafted tale of power, corruption, treachery, vengeance & insanity and is efficiently realised on the film canvas with its meticulous set pieces, sweeping camera-work & committed performances but its overlong runtime & glacial pace may not go well with everyone.The story of Ran follows a powerful but elderly warlord who hands over his vast empire to his three sons after choosing to retire. Expecting his sons to maintain harmony amongst themselves & keep the kingdom united, he vastly underestimates the corrupting nature of power he had just bestowed upon them and haplessly watches them turn on each other as well as him.Co-written, edited & directed by Akira Kurosawa, Ran is an ambitious production by all means and Kurosawa leaves no stone unturned to recreate the era his narrative is set in. Making effective use of colour palette, long-shot photography, vast landscapes, period-specific costumes & extensive list of extras, it delivers as an epic but what benefits it most is the strong foundation in the script.Despite all the chaos brewing in the kingdom, Ran is mainly about the downfall of a once mighty king and covers his descent into madness. Taking inspiration from Shakespeare's play, it weaves an original storyline that's quite interesting and its central character's arc is just as compelling but the slow pace at which its plot unfurls and the many meanderings in the middle does make it a difficult sit at times.Coming to the acting department, the entire cast delivers sincere performances and play their part responsibly, with Tatsuya Nakadai impressing the most as the elderly warlord in what's a powerfully gripping & highly expressive rendering that nearly overshadows the input of the rest of the actors. Also worthy of mention is its background score that brims with a haunting vibe and aptly captures the film's somber mood.On an overall scale, Ran is a competently directed, deftly written, expertly layered, elegantly shot & brilliantly performed cinema that does many things right over the course of its 162 mins runtime but is still not without its shortcomings. There are moments in it that linger on for too long and the dull pace, even if it is deliberate, doesn't help its cause either. All in all, Akira Kurosawa's last epic is an ambitious showcase of power & madness but it isn't as rewarding as I expected it to be.",

His first big hit was Rashomon in 1950, and then came Seven Samurai in 1956, which was then exploited by Hollywood in 1960 when it made The Magnificent Seven, an enormous hit at the time. They say imitation is the highest form of flattery. But even Hollywood could not imitate the classic, Rashomon, the thriller made years before The Seven Samurai.And Hollywood has not been able to produce such a sumptuous feast for the eyes as Ran, as well. This film explodes with color and images. One cannot really see it all in just one viewing. Yes, it has King Lear overtones, but it far exceeds any Shakespearean production on film that I have ever seen. See for yourself and you will be in for a grand visual treat.",

This time, instead of instilling a sense of heroism or justice, it feels like senseless bloodshed, with important characters killed off unceremoniously or stumbling around in a daze. The character drama that underlies this sad, showing the futility of conflict when driven only by personal ambition. The real standout here is the portrayal of Lady Kaede who really is a demon, instigating all the chaos around her for personal revenge. However, the film does drag on at times, involving too many characters. At least the jester was funny.",

Inspired by Shakespeare's play King Lear, the film stars Tatsuya Nakadai as Hidetora Ichimonji, an aging Sengoku-period warlord who decides to abdicate as ruler in favor of his three sons.

            "review_title": "A monumental achievement",
            "content": "The one movie that this reminds me most of isn't Kagemusha or Throne of Blood or any other film by Akira Kurosawa. No, the movie Ran most reminds me of is Fanny and Alexander by Ingmar Bergman. Both films feel like culminations of careers, two master filmmakers putting everything they'd learned about the craft of filmmaking into a single, epic film. Sure, Bergman's film didn't involve massive battles between armies, but it was epic in its own, smaller way, a saga. Kurosawa, perhaps playfully, called his previous film a dress rehearsal for Ran, and it's hard not to see Kagemusha in that light. The cast is largely the same. It uses similar sets, costumes, and story, but that feels dismissive of Kagemusha, which is a tremendous exercise in its own right. That being said, though, Ran is on another level. Comfortable again in control of the production (despite his near blindness), Kurosawa put together one of his most visually beautiful and emotionally fulfilling films, told on an epic scale, and adapting a complex work like Shakespeare's King Lear with skill and deftness.Ichimonji Hidetora (Tatsuya Nakadai) is 70 years old and has led a life of blood and death to achieve peace in his region of Japan. On a hunting trip with his three sons and two neighbors, he announces his plan to split the administration of the land in three to enjoy a retirement. Head of the clan will become his eldest son, Taro (Akira Terao), with the rule of the two lower castles being passed to his middle son Jiro (Jinpachi Nezu) and youngest son Saburo (Daisuke Ryu). Saburo is instantly against the plan, insisting that the time of peace they are in is ephemeral and could fall apart much faster than Hidetora seems to realize. For this bit of honest, he is banished from his father's lands, quickly gaining the favor of Fujimaki (Hitoshi Ueki) who invites Saburo to come and live with him to potentially marry his daughter.Things begin to disintegrate quickly at home. Hidetora leaves the main house of his castle, moving to the tower with a retinue of thirty men and his mistresses, but Lady Kaede (Mieko Harada) feels that she has greater station than Hidetora's mistresses, causing a public scene where the women must kneel to her retinue. When Taro, at the suggestion of Kaede, decides to reclaim his father's banner as his own being the new leader of the clan, Hidetora's jester Kyoami (Peter) gets nearly killed before Hidetora shoots one of Taro's men. This is not how Hidetora dreamed up the situation. His diminished station, his son's wife holding herself up higher than his own mistresses, and the taking of the banner make him so angry that he leaves the castle to stay with Jiro. Jiro, though, sees an opportunity for claiming what he sees as his rightful place as leader of the clan, only denied him by being born a year after Taro. One of the impediments to that is his father.By denying his men entry into the castle, supposedly at Taro's orders, he angers Hidetora enough to force him to leave, but Hidetora has nowhere to go anymore. The men of the third castle would never take him in for banishing their master, but when they abandon it to join their master in Fujimaki's lands, Hidetora heads there, into a trap, where Jiro and Taro have conspired to murder their father, with the added twist of Jiro conspiring to murder Taro. In one of the most impressive physical production moments of Kurosawa's career, the castle is burned to the ground while Hidetora becomes like a ghost, the lone survivor of his retinue along with Kyoami, and allowed to wander the wilds a broken man.This central sequence is amazing. It's one of the most bombastic and, alternatively, intimately focused pieces of filmmaking Kurosawa ever put on film. It's heartbreaking as we watch Hidetora finally break, realizing the depth of his mistake in trusting too much in the goodness of man and not listening to Saburo, going so far as to cast him out for telling him the truth. He becomes a hollow man.One of the interesting things about the film is how well balanced the epic and intimate portions of the film are. We never get lost in the movement of armies. They are merely extensions of the characters themselves in intimately scaled conflicts. So, when Taro and Jiro's armies show up at the third castle, they are really just a larger manifestation of the two characters in their fights with each other and in rebellion of their father. When they are on the battlefield or in a chamber, the intention of what we see never shifts. Kurosawa just moves the same action from chambers to the burning of a castle, so when we quiet down in terms of the bombast of battlefield action and return to the chambers of the castle where Lady Kaede, now a widow, seduces Jiro, twists him around her finger, and convinces him to murder his wife, the daughter of a conquered warlord named Su\u00e9, he relents.Saburo, hearing all of the death happening in his father's lands, returns with a small force to try and find his father. Jiro takes this as an opportunity to kill Saburo and discover the location of his father in order to kill him, and the final act is a delicate interplay of motives, characters, and movements that brings everything to the appropriately tragic conclusion. There is death everywhere, and it's made all the worse by Hidetora realizing how it's entirely his own fault. How he had completely misjudged his children and human nature, unleashing the chaos and death that swept over his lands and destroyed his legacy along with it.This really is a pinnacle of Kurosawa's career. He had made so many great films, but this is very near the top. As a distillation of King Lear into a Japanese idiom, it's wonderfully adept. As a family drama, it's involving. As a tale of madness, it's crushing. As a grand entertainment with armies clashing against each other, it's thrilling. This is literally every cinematic lesson Kurosawa ever learned and put up on screen in one concentrated dose. This is the work of an old master in full control over the production, made all the more impressive considering he was essentially blind by this point.",

            "content": "Late Japanese master of cinema Akira Kurosawa has many masterpieces to his name - \"Seven Samurai\" (1954) (my personal favorite), \"Rashomon\" (1950), \"Yojimbo\" (1961), \"Throne of Blood\" (1957), \"Kagemusha\" (1980) and the film I'm commenting on here, 1985's \"Ran.\" Having seen this movie in its entirety for the first time earlier today, I'm simply amazed by the epic scale of the picture, the performances, the use of color and imagery (by Emi Wada), and Kurosawa's master direction.\"Ran\" is a unique collaboration between Japan and France. \"Ran\" (which means \"revolt,\" \"chaos,\" or \"fury\" in Japanese) is Kurosawa's epic adaptation of William Shakespeare's tragedy \"King Lear,\" and surrounds the aging 16-century Japanese warlord Hidetora Ichimonji (Tatsuya Nakadai) after he unwisely decides to give up control of his kingdom to his three sons - Taro (Akira Terao), Jiro (Jinpachi Nezu), and Saburo (Daisuke Ryu) - with the land divided up equally amongst them. Hidetora falls prey to the false flattery bestowed upon his by two oldest sons - Taro and Jiro - but angrily banishes his youngest child Saburo when he speaks the truth about the insanity of his father's actions. Madness, bloodshed, betrayal, and all-out war soon follow.Kurosawa is by far the greatest foreign director I've ever encountered in my 26-and-a-half years on this planet. I've already mentioned a number of pictures that I've seen and consider to be classics, not just of Japanese cinema, but of all films (I consider \"Seven Samurai\" to be the greatest foreign-language picture I've ever seen). What makes \"Ran\" so powerful is its strong performances, inventive use of color and costumes (which won an Oscar at the Academy Awards for 1985 for costume designer Emi Wada) and having looked at the picture, there's a certain air of timelessness to it: it feels like it could have been made decades ago back in the 1960s, yet it's only 27-years-old! (This last statement could be because of the restored audio and picture on the Blu-ray edition of this film, from which this comment is based.)The film also plays on two common themes in Kurosawa's work, the battle between reality vs. fantasy (the flattery of Taro and Jiro to their father for his decision, and the madness Hidetora soon falls into), and the lust for power (and the bloodshed that ensues as the three newly crowned warlords battle each other for ultimate control of the land). Perhaps is this no better seen here than in \"Ran.\"This is another Akira Kurosawa masterpiece to behold!10/10",

            "content": "It is not uncommon for an artist's output to wane a little in age. Not so with Akira Kurosawa. Even in his late period, his work continued to be inspired and masterful. Ran (1985) is the most regarded of these late works, a ravishingly beautiful and yet bleak adaptation of Shakespeare's King Lear.The Noh-influenced performances and choice to transpose Willy Shakes to 16th century Japan recall Kurosawa's earlier Throne of Blood (1958), which told the story of Macbeth; however, this film is far more downbeat. In Throne of Blood, the tyrant-protagonist is taken down by the people. Though the cycle of violence will go on as long as greed and ambition live within mankind, there is hope that they will always be taken down. But here? Ran is so much more tragic in its view of people and the human condition.As Renoir once said, everyone has their reasons. Here, there really aren't any white or black hats. The treacherous Lady Kaede is a victim of Lord Hideotara, who had killed her entire family. The tragic Hideotora has killed many innocents in his quest for power, yet we still pity his fate and ultimate inability to live peacefully with his sons in his advanced years.From the boar hunt in the beginning to the film's haunting closing image of the blind man on the edge of a cliff, Ran is a nearly three hour movie that doesn't feel its length for a moment. It is perhaps Kurosawa's final bonafide masterpiece, but that is arguable. It's much harder to argue this one is anything less than great.",

            "content": "After reading the script written by Kurosawa, the scriptwriter Hideo Oguni advised him as follows\nHe said, \"The audience is different today than when King Lear was written. In Shakespeare's time, the audience knew firsthand how important a powerful king was. They knew how tragic it was that he was dying and that his sons were fighting one another. In the audience minds, there was always the fear of invasion from another country. But that's not the case for today's moviegoers. The script has to explain that how the King was strong, how he was smart, how he was feared, how he was loved...\nShinobu Hashimoto, the screenwriter famous for \"Seven Samurai\" and \"Seppuku\", also expressed the same opinion in his autobiography.\nBut Kurosawa ignored their advice and made the film as he had written it. Even though the masterpiece he made in his prime was made thanks to their advice...\nAnd then they made this terrible failure. In the original story, there is a character named Kent. That person tries to protect Lear. It shows how good King Lear was, how respected he was and how important a position he still holds today. In trying to protect King Lear, that means simultaneously trying to protect the nation. Whether it would work or not was very thrilling to the audience at the time.\nShakespeare used this kind of device in his works, but Kurosawa did not. In his script, Kent was reduced in size and the misery of the King was magnified. The reality of the drama as a large scale drama was lost and it became a mere drama about an old man becoming miserable.\nIf the king, who had been wielding the power, suddenly became an old geezer, the people around him would be more panicked. In the original story, the children were his daughters, so their rash behavior, ignorant of politics, was realistic. And there was prudence in the behavior of their husbands. In the 'Ran', the new kings are acting like morons as the daughters of King Lear. The new king and his entourage should have behaved more cautiously because they were afraid of the former king's influence. If the story was depicted in such a way, the potential of the third son when he teamed up with the former King would be implied and the audience would be able to enjoy the movie to the end even if the former King become more miserable for a while.\n... The pictures are not beautiful at all and the acting is at the level of arts and crafts. This is a bad movie of a bad movie.",

            "content": "Ran is a second-rate retelling of the Lear story, so the flaws in the plot are easiest to explain with reference to King Lear. These are some of the important differences: the subplot is dropped; Goneril and Regan are turned into effete men; an injured and vengeful daughter-in-law is introduced; the Lear-figure (Hidetora) is a warlord rather than a king; the mad Lear scene is weakened to insignificance; the sons try to kill old Hidetora by having a few thousand men fire at him as he sits in a castle; and the additional character of Tsurumaru, a boy who was blinded by Hidetora at some point in his murderous career, is introduced.Hidetora is a smaller man than Lear; he has the stubbornness without the nobility. His abdication is also a lot sillier. Lear errs by trusting that people will treat him decently: Hidetora errs by supposing that they will forget that they hate him. This is also much more implausible. After all, there is nothing monstrous or unnatural about the daughter-in-law's attitude towards Hidetora; she just wants her back, and with reason. This diminishes her, and in spite of Kurosawa's attempt to make her a sex maniac, she is not as large or as interesting as Goneril/Regan.Unlike Lear, Ran does not give us a sense of the insignificance of Man in nature. The \"majestic\" (read pompous) scenery shots don't make us feel that Man in general is helpless\u2014these are no giants to be dwarfed by Nature, just a murderer and an injured woman and several wimps.The strong stoical undertone of Lear is lost for obvious reasons. Samurai cannot be stoics; they are people who are trained to kill themselves whenever the going gets inglorious. It is amusing but not profound that Hidetora cannot find a dagger to kill himself with when the need arises.So what's left of Lear? Only this: People in the world are evil. If you hurt them they'll hurt you when they can. You should be good even if you suffer (like the blind boy), because general goodness and suffering are the only way to avoid family feuds and make the world a better place. Which is all very edifying, but also very trite.It must also be noted that because of the lingering, ponderous, \"epic\" pacing of this film, it goes on for twice as long as it should. What to expect: 160 minutes of intense tedium as this misshapen hulk of a film drags itself laboriously towards its predictable close.Watching Ran is like running for your life for 2 hours and 40 minutes, but with none of the excitement.",

It was directed by the acclaimed Akira Kurosawa who made such outstanding films as \"Seven Samurai\" and was in his mid 70s when he shot this work. The title \"Ran\" is Japanese for \"chaos\", but can also be translated as \"confused\" or \"disturbed\". and the characters show all these attributes in a multi-layered narrative.The king-like character in 16th century Japan is Lord Hidetora (played by Tatsuya Nakadai) and, instead of Shakespeare's three daughters achieving catharsis, we have three sons seeking power and revenge with - in one case - the support of a daughter- in-law of the Lord who rivals Lady Macbeth for her cruelty (Mikeo Harada is the striking actress). The film begins with some long, brooding sequences but later we have some wonderfully choreographed battle scenes with horses and arrows aplenty.

Ran is so much more concerned with all the tiny details that anime skips on that I can't help but be amazed with Kurosawa, not so much his prowess, but his commitment.  Kurosawa's eye is both poignant yet far away, creating a feeling one-half stage play, one half 60s movie.  He avoids close-ups and prefers the lavish grandeur associated with his paintings.  In most aspects, this works.In actuality, I am more in favor of his exposition scenes and less concerned with his depiction of war.  I am sick of battle scenes, have seen enough of them in movies to last me a lifetime and very few have been any good.  While Kurosawa is keen to use a flurry of images to create a sense of confusion and motion, the editing and music do not lend appropriate moods.  Had he gone for more detailed one-on-one shots, the kind John Woo loves to cram in his gunfights, I would have better things to say.  The inclusion of nature throughout is more sophisticated than The Thin Red Line, kudos.Sound and text are two areas that take the biggest beating.  In the first battle, the music drowns everything out and creates no atmosphere in itself. In the second one, the cacophony of gunfire, not to mention the repetition of horsemen getting shot, boils everything down to monotony.  If modern effects technicians touched this up on par with The Wild Bunch, it would be worth your ears.  As others have said, the script is no match for Shakespearean dialog, but I find the plot to be more refined and stimulating compared to the original King Lear.  No more eurocentric biases.Overall, this is a brilliant Kurosawa film more than worth watching. Perhaps he and Kubrick were the only 80s directors to really understand what auteur theory was.

For this he got acclaimed mostly throughout his early career, when he made movies like \"Kakushi-toride no san-akunin\", \"Shichinin no samurai\", \"Rash\u00f4mon\" and \"Yojimbo\". Many people however seem to forget that Kurosawa never stopped making great movies. Reason why his later movies aren't acclaimed as much is because they were all less revolutionary and refreshing, while his earlier works was still very much unlike anything else and influenced lots of western film-makers.The story is told in a typical slow Kurosawa way and also itself features lots of typical Kurosawa approaches and angles in it. The story itself is based on Shakespeare's King Lear, set in the early days of a small Japanese lordship. It has themes such as power and greed in it, which also provides the movie with plenty of intriguing characters, who all have their own agendas throughout the movie. It's characters, themes and definitely the directing of it all is the reason why \"Ran\" works out as a great Japanese epic.The movie often doesn't use to many words to tell its story but the words that it does pick are effectively and carefully chosen. The movie tells the story slowly and things take a while to unravel. But ultimately in the end it turns out to be all very rewarding, like so often is the case with movies being told in such a specific manner.It's a grand movie, with big looking settings, set in the natural environment and on the in- and outside of some large constructed castles. The movie also has lots of extra's in it, of course mostly during its big battle sequences.It's a very stylish movies, of course mainly thanks to Kurosawa's directing. Kurosawa was almost completely blind at the time of making this movie but it didn't prevented him from delivering a visual masterpiece. Each shot and every frame are carefully thought about it seems and everything is planned out and executed into the smallest detail. The movie used three different cinematographers for some reason, who all provided the movie with some beautiful as well as powerful shots.A great late Kurosawa epic!9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

            "content": "\"Ran\", how such a short, such a light, almost feeble word can be so poetic, so colorful, so tragic, so meaningful ... and so cinematographically beautiful ...\"Ran\", what can you say about \"Ran\"? First of all, the movie strikes by its stunning visuals, the use of colors and the beautiful landscape shots ... this was one aspect of Kurosawa that obviously couldn't emerge from his earlier works, and I was so used to watch epics in Technicolor, that I wasn't very impressed in the beginning. BUT Kurosawa is so talented, what am I saying, such a genius, that even the use of colors serves as a clever plot device, it's not just to make the movie look better, but also to give you a clearer view of the battles, and the need of colors to distinguish between the armies highlights the central element and most tragic element of the plot, which is that these blood bathed battles are internal, it's between brothers, it's between the sons of a man, who sees all his hopes and dreams annihilated, who witnesses the failure of a whole life, which makes the massacres more and more sickening and heart-breaking especially because it all ends up in the same dominant color in the end.The movie is not just a cinematographic achievement, it's a movie about the power that ultimately corrupts people's souls, a movie showing that greed, for lack of a better word, is bad and leads to destruction and ultimately, self-destruction. The movie is guilty of preaching but not during the preaching scenes, it tells you not to trust those who say they love you or those who throw flowers in your path. Indeed, people who wants the best of you won't feel the need to appear sympathetic in front of you ... unfortunately, power not only corrupts but it also blinds and drowns in the ocean of greed, your intelligence, that can only survive on the boat of humility ... the same humility the Father lacked in the beginning, before realizing when it was too late, how wrong, wrong and wrong he was. Epic Tragedy! Just like \"The Godfather\", \"Ran\" is about the eternal Shakespearian theme of power and succession, but whether the succession in Coppola's crime epic was successful, in \"Ran\", it was a tragic and bloody failure ... how can greed be so destructive? no movie could have illustrated this with such intensity than Kurosawa's masterpiece. And yet, the movie strikes for its beauty, its poetry, and its universality, the king of yesterday can be as worthless as a bum the very next day, your own blood can betray you, to satisfy a pitiful feeling of jealousy, and a thirst of revenge and power. And sooner or later, you pay for your sins. In fact, life is so vicious, that it gives you the chance to satisfy your darkest schemes just to lead you faster to self-destruction ... life as the seemingly indifferent Gods mentioned in the film, are they? regarding indifference and lack of love and empathy, isn't the film inviting us to question ourselves \"well, aren't we, too?\" \"Ran\" means 'Revolt'. Well, it sure inspired me one feeling of revolt ... towards the Academy, the Master has been snubbed so many times, for \"Rashomon\", \"Seven Samurai\" and \"Ikiru\" ... I couldn't believe \"Ran\" won only one Oscar and ... for costume design, but time speaks for \"Ran\" now, and the movie is rightfully recognized as one of the greatest cinematic epics and directorial achievements. The movie redefined epic like \"The Godfather\" did for Gangster movies, it gave it a new poetic and tragicomic dimension freed from any dull Manichaeism and other clich\u00e9s, and to use another cinematic comparison, if \"Monty Python and the Holy Grail\" makes \"Ben-Hur\" look like an epic then \"Ran\" makes any modern epic look like \"Monty Python and the Holy Grail\" ... For one simple reason that doesn't take a long philosophical analysis : \"Ran\" is entertaining as hell, there isn't a single dull, boring or sappy moment, forget the battles scenes, even the dialog, the shots on the clouds, the character development are insightful and masterfully directed ...\"Ran\", Kurosawa's masterpiece (I feel like writing a pleonasm) is pure cinematic poetry ... my Respects, Master Kurosawa!",

Kurosawa was a master of cross-cultural fusion, he started by doing very Japanese music that were re-made by the Western creators, then he took some of the great writers and playwrights themes and gave them a Japanese adaptation. 'Ran' (Chaos) is a perfect blend of the Shakespearean 'King Lear' with the Japanese samurai legends. It is both classical and Japanese, it is universal.The film is of a visual beauty and complexity that words can hardly describe. Action scenes, costumes and the color palette are worked finely to the latest detail. The text has poetical beauty and moral strength and tells a world about wisdom and insanity, getting old and loving one's children, about death, love and treason, and above all about human madness.

I also highly enjoyed the story itself - its shows that one has to know how to give a power to the others, even if others are his family and how it can turn out if its done not in a right way - something to be learned even in these times.Overall, \"Ran\" is a pure classic.

            "content": "Ten years in the making, Akira Kurosawa's Ran took it's toll on director Akira Kurosawa. Following a highly successful career in the 1950's and 60's, Kurosawa fell out of favour with modern audiences and producers due to his traditional film-making styles and topics. Japan had experienced it's own New Wave, where directors used innovative techniques to look forward, rather than looking back. Eventually backed by Sidney Lumet, Kurosawa developed his labour of love, based on Shakespeare's King Lear, and made Kagemusha (1980) - a 'warm-up' for Ran - while developing the project. He storyboarded every scene with beautiful artwork, ensured that every costume was made by hand, and even built a castle to torch it down for the movie. On top of this, his wife passed away during filming (Kurosawa took only one day off work to mourn), and by the film's completion, Kurosawa was almost completely blind.Such dedication and rigorous planning doesn't always work out, but Ran is Kurosawa's final masterpiece. The term 'epic' is thrown around far too often these days, but if one film could really be labelled as epic, it is Ran. Epic in scale, length and scope, it's a complex, exciting and bloody movie, capturing the tragedy of Shakespeare's play, and invigorating with it's Machiavellian intrigue. The ageing warlord Hidetora Ichimonji (Tatsuya Nakadai) decides to pass his throne to his eldest son Taro (Akira Terao) so he can spend his remaining years in peace. To his other sons, Jiro (Jinpachi Nezu) and the youngest Saburo (Daisuke Ryu), he leaves two large castles. Saburu objects, calling the decision folly and foreseeing instability, and is banished by his father for his loyalty.Before Taro's backside has warmed his new throne, his wife Lady Kaede (Mieko Harada) is whispering doubts into his ear. With Hidetora still residing in the castle, Lady Kaede tells Taro that his crown is hollow and his men will never earn his respect until his father is removed. After Hidetora kills one of Jiro's men who was about to kill his fool Kyoami (Funeral Parade of Roses' (1964) Pita), Jiro banishes his father, who then seeks refuge with Jiro. But Jiro has plans of his own, and seeing Taro as a weak leader, pretends to side with Taro in preparation for a future betrayal, and also sends Hidetora packing. With nowhere to turn, the broken and increasingly senile old man wanders to the ruins of a castle he conquered in his warmongering days. But when Saburo hears of his brothers' betrayal and Lady Kaede's scheming, war begins to brew.Kurosawa's precise planning pays off, as Ran is a gorgeous canvas of colours and scenery, to the extent that any scene could be paused, printed and hung on the wall as a piece of art. The costumes, a sumptuous blend of red's and yellow's, bring the battle scenes to life. Bodies litter the ground, streaming with bright red blood that give the movie a grim and apocalyptic feel, and when juxtaposed with Hidetora's mental decline, makes it feel like the world is literally crumbling around him. The acting is surprisingly subtle and subdued, especially when compared to Kurosawa's earlier works. Nakadai is outstanding as the lost old man, though he is helped by some impressive make-up, but the film belongs to Harada, whose ruthless conniving truly embodies Shakespeare's text. Quite simply one of the finest films ever made.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",

            "content": "Akira Kurosawa had given the world so much throughout the 50's and 60's: Seven Samurai, Throne Of Blood, Ikiru, Rashomon, Yojimbo to name a few. These are 5 brilliant movies in their own right that any director would want to have had their name attached to in any way, shape or form.But the 70's, 80's and 90's seemed to be difficult for Kurosawa to make movies: He only made 7 films from 1970 up until his death in 1998. He was getting trouble for funding his movies, some people criticised him for being too western and old-fashioned. Kurosawa even attempted suicide at one point, but thankfully he survived. He had wanted to make \"Ran\" for over a decade, but he couldn't find the funding, until Serge Silberman helped him out with the funding.So it was 10 years in the planning, the entire storyboard was painted by Kurosawa, the costumes were designed by Kurosawa and created over a 2 year period, 1400 extras and 200 horses were used in the battle scenes, Kurosawa's wife even died during the production of the film. After all the difficulty in making the film, how did \"Ran\" turn out? Extremely well, extremely well indeed.Ran is the story of Hidetora Ichimonji, a powerful Warlord in feudal Japan. A man who has spent almost his entire life fighting for control, and has decided to hand over his power to his 3 sons, hoping to restore peace to the land after a lifetime of bloodshed. However, his youngest son Saburo voices his concerns bluntly, which Hidetora does not appreciate: He banishes Saburo and one of his vassals who defended Saburo (The fiercely loyal Tango).What follows is a glorious exploration of greed, sexual politics, ambition, madness, loyalty, corruption, war, faith and revenge. Beautifully photographed, hauntingly scored, with incredible acting and brilliant direction culminate into one of the most emotionally shattering and incredible movies ever made. Not only is it the best film Akira Kurosawa ever made, it is also one of the greatest movies ever made. Akira Kurosawa has cemented his place as one of the greatest director's of all time with this film.",

            "content": "There are many longer reviews written about Kurosawa's \"Ran\", so I will keep it short and only outline why I think the film is hugely overrated and very disappointing. The film has great potential. Visually it is very impressive (in spite of a few disruptive cuts in the cavalry scenes), and the music and sound support the images extremely well. Very deservedly it was awarded the Oscar for best Costumes. But in the domain of storytelling I found \"Ran\" lacking. It positively reminds of Classical and Shakespearian tragedies and aspires to tell a great tale of the demise of an empire and family dynasty built on bloodshed, but the characters and their motivations are sadly unconvincing. Kurosawa spends much of the three hours on lavish images, yet he does not really develop what lies beyond the surface. The Great Lord and his three sons remain character sketches, and so the old Lord's emotional ups and downs and his sons' violent struggle over his succession seem jumpy and unconvincing without a deeper development of their motivations and family story. The only exception to this is the scheming wife of the Great Lord's oldest son.Granted, I don't understand Japanese and so have to rely on the subtitles. Furthermore, a Japanese viewer may probably read far more in the faces, gestures and intonation than someone only quaintly accustomed with Japanese culture. Nevertheless, this is no excuse. The movie simply does not achieve what it aims for. Apart from the visual pleasures the result is fairly shallow, too slow and overlong (although I generally prefer longer films). To me \"Ran\" is completely over-hyped. If you want tragedy, there are plenty of decent Shakespeare adaptations on film. If you want great storytelling and characters watch movies like those of the Cohen brothers (e.g. \"Millers Crossing\" or \"Barton Fink\"). And if you are after the great images and the Asian flair watch one of the three recent Chinese Martial Arts epics. (Out of which \"Hero\" is probably the most interesting with the moral and political questions it provokes.) It pains me to say this, but in my view Kurosawa's \"Ran\" is simply not worth watching - at least not for entertainment.",

With material limitations I think Kurosawa was unable to fully realize his vision while here we have all cylinders firing as this was the most expensive film in Japanese history up to that point (converted to current dollars, it cost 30 million, a huge amount for the standards of the day!).This film has it all: massive battles, treachery, love, complex and interesting characters and can be understood fundamentally as a film about old age and its effects on the reduction of decision making capabilities of individual decision makers (that's sounded terrible, didn't it? :) ).So concluding this is the best film out of those five, that I have seem from Kurosawa. Highly recommended. I gave it only 9/10 to differentiate from the truly \"best\" films ever.",

            "content": "Kurosawa had fallen out of favour by this time in his career. Ran had been meticulously storyboarded by the director himself, painting colours and conceptualising the masterpiece in his mind years and years before he finally got the funding for what was the most expensive Japanese film at the time. The third and last of his Shakespeares, Ran tells the story of the old King Lear figure Hidetora. But there is a key difference; Shakespeare never delved into the details of the old king's past conquests and rulings, but here Hidetora is painted as a warlike persona, brutal and ruthless in his day. Fast forward years, and the ageing warlord cannot even commit seppuku with the katana he so once viciously brandished. The opening shots are almost garish in their use of colour. We do not expect the three heralded sons to be kitted out in the bright primaries of red, yellow and blue. We get wide shots of the clear blue sky, of endless grassy hills from all directions of the four riders as they look each way. Kurosawa's penchant for waiting for the perfect weather conditions pays off, because after banishment the clouds suddenly come out, and the grass is dull in the billowing wind. When Jiro's crimson army arrives to face Saburo, a cloud envelops the plain, and again when his envoy rides across the plain, bringing with him a false message of truce and an ominous shadow alongside. In 1985, hundreds of extras wait for that ten second shot. And in that harrowing and massive scale clash at the castle, the foreshadowed storm finally enters the film and serenades the massacre. It is a magnificent battle scene, with many things happening. Kurosawa chose to construct the entire third castle against a muddy hill and places his soldiers against the grimy backdrop, intensifying the colours emblazoned onto their uniform which signal their allegiance. His multi-cam coverage is never more evident here; placing cameras inside the battle itself and cutting judiciously to reveal horror after horror; a corpse being trampled by galloping horse, a solider struggling amongst the lifeless bodies of his comrades, another clutching his dismembered limb, and that magnificent shot of a crazy Hidetora, stumbling into the midst of the battlefield, while red and yellow sides watch him intently and the remains of a great castle burn from above. The cameras seldom dolly in Ran; they tilt and pan to reveal the action from a objective, omniscient view. There are sparse use of close-ups. As Ebert says, we are like gods, witnessing these atrocities of unfathomable nature. The Western orchestration punctuates Takemitsu's Eastern score; Kurosawa's divergence from tradition makes it all the more horrifying. Hidetora's ornate costume changes into rags, and his face becomes ghostly in his anguish and madness, deep gashes and burned eyes, the Noh influence stylising his mask-like Shiwajo as the weary old man wandering and contemplating his sins. Harada's Lady Kaede is another character of Noh influence. Observe how precise and elegantly she shuffles into the room, uses pointed questions to direct Kurogane to murder for her, before shutting him out. She drifts down onto the ground cross-legged, silent but so evidently displaying her sexual hold over Jiro. She explodes in emotion; the insane cackles as she seduces Jiro, closing each shoji one by one, and in that final moment where she confesses her vengeance and true motive. How long has she held Hidetora's atrocities in her mind? Kurosawa visualises her end in a sudden release of anger and bloodlust; no gore, but a painterly splash of blood on the back wall. A stark and powerful image. Shakespeare's play is perhaps not as focused as Ran is, with its multiple story lines and scattered soliloquies. Kurosawa's screen adaptation conjures images of sheer scale and horror like no theatre stage could. In that final scene, a blind Tsurumaru wanders and drops the image of Buddha into irrecoverable ruins. The gods have abandoned all sympathy. The camera paints a picture he will never see; a tiny helpless figure dead centre in a desolate, hellish world near sunset. Weren't we hunting boar in the idyllic bright hills just moments ago? How finite power is, and how even swifter seized power is lost.",

To sum it all up means to spell the title of this epic: \"Ran\", which stands for \"Chaos\", and this is exactly what you can expect when things get out of hand in a once thriving land. The film is a loose rendition of Shakespeare's \"King Lear\" and begins with what an old warlord thinks to be a good idea: to abdicate and make room for younger blood. But his three sons have their own agendas and soon clash to decide upon the right of succession until everything that reminds of the once glory days is irretrievably gone.\"Ran\" lasts nearly three hours, has beautifully choreographed battle scenes, sharp dialog and is packed with lots of strong main characters: aspiring and falling warlords, conniving wives, a faithful, wise jester, a symbolic blind man on the edge of a cliff, to name just a few...

            "content": "Born in 1910 Japan, Akira Kurosawa first studied painting before moving into film in the late 1930s. A well-known director in Japan throughout the 1940s, his 1950 production of RASHOMON launched him to international acclaim--and throughout the remainder of his long career he was widely acknowledged as among the world's greatest film directors, the creator of such films as THE SEVEN SAMURAI, THRONE OF BLOOD, and YOJIMBO. Released in 1985, RAN would be among his final films and is generally felt to be among his finest.Kurosawa often borrowed plot lines from Western literature, and with RAN--the Japanese word translates loosely as chaos--he lifted the basic story from William Shakespeare's KING LEAR. In Kurosawa's retelling, the Lord Hidetora Ichimonji (Tatsuya Nakadai) divides his kingdom between three sons: Taro (Akira Terao), Jiro (Jinpachi Nezu) and Saburo (Daisuke Ryu). When youngest son Saburo upbraids his father for foolishness, Hidetora banishes him--only to find Taro and Jiro turning against him just as Saburo predicted. Kurosawa shapes the Shakespearean story to 16th Century Japan, so it would be easy to belabor comparison with the original; at the same time, however, it is worth pointing out that he actually captures the story more effectively than any western filmmaker has to date.As in many Kurosawa films, RAN alternates moments of great stillness with rapacious action, enclosed spaces with wide vistas. In stillness, the film focuses upon its actors and their intrigues--perhaps most notably the perfidious Lady Kaede, a truly dark character frighteningly realized by actress Mieko Harada. Indeed, all the cast is remarkably fine. But the great centerpiece, and the great performance, of the film is Tatsuya Nakadai's Lord Hidetora, whose mixture of good intention and folly leads first to humiliation and then to madness. Perhaps the single most stunning moment of the film occurs when Hidetora, betrayed by his sons, walks down the tower steps of the third castle following a vicious battle. It is difficult to imagine many actors who could perform such a scene; it is equally difficult to imagine many directors who could stage it.Few directors are able to convey the sense of chaos, destruction, and fear with which Kurosawa endows battle scenes, and RAN is no exception. There are several, and the battle of the third castle (in which Hidetora is bested by sons Taro and Jiro) is easily among the finest battle sequences of Kurosawa's career. Presented without any sound except a simple, eloquent music score, flash-cutting between different groups in the struggle, the result is a unique mixture of beauty and horror--and in my opinion unequaled by any other film I've seen.It should be noted that RAN, unlike RASHOMON, THRONE OF BLOOD, YOJIMBO and many other Kurosawa films, is in color. I have long been used to the remarkable shading of Kurosawa's black and white films, and I missed it--but only for a moment. Kurosawa proves no less adept in color than in black and white, and RAN's use of color is remarkable. For this reason I particularly recommend the Criterion Collection edition of the film over any other; it is very fine. But regardless of the particular version, this is a film which must be seen by any one who appreciates Asian or world cinema, truly a masterwork by a great master.GFT, Amazon Reviewer",

            "content": "To anybody who is in love with the art of film-making, Akira Kurosawa is a favorite name. Throughout his unfortunately not-so-successful (financially) career, he made a string of remarkable pictures that changed cinema overseas rather than in his own country. But what many people miss, I think, is how varied he was in his talents and tastes, and the way he dipped the tone of his pictures from one end of his career to the other. Look at his early pictures such as \"Yojimbo\", which more or less glorified violence and then look at his later ones such as the marvelously artistic \"Kagemusha\" and \"Ran,\" in which there is no atmospheric similarity.\"Ran\" is loosely based on the Shakespeare classic \"King Lear,\" which I have had the pleasure to read. Combining elements of the play with some Japanese legends and myths, Kurosawa weaved a terrific story that not only exposed violence as harrowing and gut-wrenching, but made us ask a question: \"Why do human beings kill each other?\" The answer was not definitive, but it was clear: for petty reasons. In the picture, an aging tyrant (Tatsuya Nakadai) divides his kingdom amongst his three ambitious sons and the two corrupt ones turn against him. Banished by his own flesh and blood, the tyrant is forced to live like an animal in the wilderness while his one noble son attempts to save him, and along the way, looses his wits and comes to terms with the horrible things that he did to gain his kingdom.There's a substantial different between King Lear and Lord Hidetora. Lear, as far as we know, was innocent and not worthy of having his daughters turn against him. Hidetora, by contrast, deserves it. Instead of retiring peacefully, he sees the monster that he was in youth. And what's brilliant is that Kurosawa decides not to flash back and show us the horrible things he did, the kingdoms he burned, but to tell us through other characters and see Hidetora react to them. The key character in this is Lady Kaede (Mieko Harada), wife of one of Hidetora's sons, who is so cold-blooded and vicious that she makes Lady Macbeth seem as pleasant as the girl nextdoor. Harada is utterly brilliant as this vengeful psychopath, who is worked into one of the screen's most detestable villains. Every time she appears on screen, the audience (and the scene) grows silent, waiting in fear of what she's about to do. She's like a cobra, gliding along with his silk gown dragging behind her, hissing, posed to strike at any time. Her key to her viciousness is not witty dialogue (though she has that) but her silence.And the violence theme. Kurosawa painted a field red with blood in the climax of \"Kagemusha,\" but as he put it, \"Kagemusha\" was a dress rehearsable in comparison to \"Ran.\" It's not just that Kurosawa paints the sets with blood, but that he makes it look horrible and frightening and dehumanizing. He exposes it as it is. And he reminds us that this is all for a petty reason. Hidetora murdered and pilaged to expand his territory so he could own more. Now he watches his sons murder before him, so they can spite him. There's a famous scene where Kurosawa shows a bloody massacre and shuts off all sound except for a music. It's like watching a silent movie and it has twice the impact it would have had had Kurosawa decided to mix in gunshots and screams and killings. Some of the killings look more like accidents on the set: so well-done that they look as though they couldn't have been simulated. The montage is gruesome and deliberately exacerbated with one chilling killing after another and not one bit of it is glorified or even cannily familiar to what Kurosawa had shown in \"Yojimbo,\" which though a fantastic picture, was child's play compared to \"Ran.\"\"Ran\" is not only a strong picture in its morality and story and theme, but it's also a professionally-made one with Kurosawa at his peak form. The movie looks beautiful with gorgeous cinematography. Kurosawa shot most of the movie in wide-angle, with very few close-ups, even in emotional ones. In my opinion, he did this to show as much of the landscape as possible, perhaps to remind us that all of this was happening because of the land these people are spilling blood over.There is so much I want to say about \"Ran,\" unfortunately I have a 1000-word limit on IMDb, so I have to cut it short. But I think my point is made. \"Ran\" is one of the milestones of cinema, and perhaps Kurosawa's most impacting picture and one of his very best. Even in his seventies, going blind, and without much financial backing, he made a heck of a movie.",

            "content": "Glorious in its production value, devastating in its commentary on mankind. Greed, selfishness, cruelty, the will to power - these are the dominant traits in man, Kurosawa says, and it's statement about humanity in all ages, whether it be feudal Japan, the 1980's era cold war, or today. Peace and stability are short-lived, we live on a powder keg, and warfare and chaos are inevitable. It's a very dark work that's a joy to watch because of its outstanding visuals, haunting use of music, and excellent performances from a deep cast, including Tatsuya Nakadai (the elderly warlord), Mieko Harada (the wicked daughter-in-law), and Peter (the fool).The 5-6 minutes of chaotic warfare set to symphony music, followed abruptly by the audio cutting over to gunfire and the other sounds of war for another 5 minutes is some of the most moving battle footage I've ever watched. The battle scenes near the end are also magnificent, with the warlords assembling their forces on the plains and those fantastic shots of horseman and foot soldiers scampering forward like a swarm of army ants. Kurosawa is brilliant in using the landscape to show the green paradise we squander by killing one another, and the resulting hellscape of scorched ruins. The undulating hills and beautiful shots of clouds in the sky reflect a timelessness, almost as if they were gods looking down impassively on the madness below.We want to sympathize with the father who has been betrayed, but are told of the many acts of slaughter he committed in conquering his surrounding neighbors, and then in old age we see him make a serious of rash, irrational decisions, so instead we just watch in horror as he descends into senility and madness. While his first and second sons seem like the good, filial types and the third son scoffs and speaks a little too directly early on, note the little clue as to his better nature in the moment when the father has fallen asleep in the hot sun, and he cuts a few branches to erect a makeshift shade for him.There are very few such acts of kindness in the film, but Kurosawa does show us an alternative to all of the violence, and that's the way of peace taught by Buddha, who the other daughter-in-law (Yoshiko Miyazaki) is a disciple of. The scene at the end is a touch didactic and leaves no doubt as to Kurosawa's view on how enlightened we are, but what a lasting, fantastic image he creates.",

            "content": "By the end of his life, Akira Kurasawa was losing his sight. However, like Beethoven when he was going deaf created beautiful music, Kurasawa created beautiful cinematic imagery.Such is the case with \"Ran,\" Kurasawa's version of King Lear with a samurai spin. The use of colors is absolutely magnificent.Lord Hidetora Ichimonji (Tatsuya Nakadai)wants to spend his remaining days in peace and comfort and gives his three sons his kingdom, hoping to be welcomed as a guest. Even though his 2 older sons tell him everything he wants to hear, his youngest displeases him by telling him that he's making a mistake, that his 2 brothers would say anything to get what they want from him. Angry and hurt, he banishes his younger son and gives his kingdom to the 2 remaining sons.And this is where things go to hell.Lord Hidetora realizes that everything that his youngest son told him was true: His older sons not only treat him with an appalling lack of respect, but they conspire to take everything from him. This drives Hidetora to madness and sets off a chain of events in which Hidetora's past and present collide, leading to war between those involved.The scene in which Hidetora, slipping into madness as his kingdom is taken from him, flames surrounding him, is incredibly haunting.The battle scenes are so incredible, that you can't take your eyes from the screen, even to blink.For those who haven't seen any of Kurasawa's films, or haven't gotten into Shakespeare, then this is the film to start with. Even after over 20 years, the film has not lost any of its impact. Highly recommended.",

            "content": "It's interesting to read the earlier reviews for Ran on this forum: the artsy-minded love it, while the roller derby fans hate it. I didn't hate it but must agree that there's enough bad acting from Nakadai to make you want to hold your nose, and lots of terrible writing. For example, we see Hidetora, stumbling around in volcano-land in a preposterous white wig, as he comes out of his stupor to announce \"I am lost,\" and his Fool replies \"Such is the Human Condition.\" Oh, come on! And some of the actions sequences aren't much better. In the first battle, Tora's captain magically gets inside the castle and opens the gates. As the disaster proceeds, a guardsman comes up to report to Hidetora, finishes his message and as he tries to stagger back to the battle, he dies theatrically right there on the floor. And finally, while the castle burns, Kurosawa shows us pile after pile of bloody, artistically arranged corpse pin-cushions. Yeah, we got the point; get on with the story!But I wouldn't rate Ran as totally awful because there is much to admire in this film. Many of the domestic scenes show classic Japanese good taste, and the battle sequences are nothing short of amazing. And while I wouldn't care to get it on with ferocious Lady Kaede as (already married) Jiro does, I loved her character as one of the main forces behind the downfall of the House of Ichimonji. Best of all was the cinematography. Most of Kurosawa's greatest work was in black and white, but clearly his understanding of color composition was masterful. If I could keep the court intrigue, the good exterior scenes in the high country, and the battles and cut out all the Hidetora-gone-mad rubbish, I would have enjoyed this movie.As it was, after over two and a half hours of this stuff, my wife provided the best assessment. As the final credits rolled, she turned to me and said, \"Well, that was depressing!\"P.S. An earlier reviewer commented on the anachronistic use of firearms in this film, complaining that samurai would not have used them. Well, yes and no. True 16th Century samurai as shown in this film would have done their work with sword, bow, and lance, but characters like Saburo and Fujimaki would not have scorned the use of men-at-arms with rifles. What was absurd in the final battle sequence was the rate of fire -- impossible for Saburo's small force.",

It is equally difficult to stage vibrantly. But, put it in Japanese, add in an extra 30 minutes (for measure), and you have a spectacular film that manages to disengage its audience. More than that, it is strangely alienating and makes the original play more appealing and palatable. It's a great pity the storm and drama didn't wipe them out earlier - a far better, though less 'artistic' and certainly less pretentious (and less uneven) option would be to watch 1000 Acres and compare this to Olivier's King Lear....

He is now ready to pass on his castles and lands to his three sons, and wants his legacy to be one of peace. But the three sons quickly become enemies as they vie for power, and plunge the kingdom into chaos and war.The plot and characters are brilliantly adapted from King Lear - the plot is complex and characters' fates intertwine with one another beautifully.\"Ran\" is beautifully shot - it is set in a mountainous region of Kyushu Island, and it makes you want to travel there. The sight of dozens of cavalrymen dressed in 16th century armor, thundering across ridges and fording rivers, sends chills up your spine.The \"jester\" is brilliant in the alternating roles of caregiving and ridiculer of the aging Hidetora, and has a knack for coming up with lines both amusing and deeply illuminating.The battle scenes are incredible. Over 1,400 extras were used, and a suit of armor had to be made for each. Some 200 horses were used. The stunts also are amazing... there had to be some bones broken when you see these guys falling off their horses at a full run. There's another scene where an infantry soldier tries to get out of the way of a cavalryman thundering toward him, and the horse's breast hits him full in the chest, sending him flying.There a really memorable scene where Kurosawa has built a $1.5M replica of a castle, and burns it to the ground. The sight of the castle, fully engulfed, and Hidetora walking down the steps in his descent toward madness, has to be one of the best all-time film scenes.My only criticism is the length - it lags a couple of times. Kurosawa really liked lingering on scenes so the viewer can fully absorb and think about them.",

            "content": "Ran was unlike any other film I had ever seen. It has Kurosawa's stamp of awesomeness of course but visually it just blew me away. This has to be one of the most beautifully shot movies I've ever seen. The costumes, the castle and of course all of the locations are amazing. I was literally speechless for a few hours after having seen the movie; it completely changed (or at least refreshed) the way I look at the world. I think one of Kurosawa's strengths is that as incredibly talented as he is, his modesty always comes across as well; his films are never pretentious.Perhaps the only possible flaw I felt the movie had was that it only used music sparingly. I thought the music that was used was great (especially one surreal sequence which had solely music and images, no sound effects) but I wonder why more music wasn't used to add depth to some of the slower scenes. Maybe the lack of music is ultimately more effective, perhaps it enhances the dreamlike reflective quality of the movie, I can't say for sure.I don't have anything to say about the story really; I haven't read King Lear and narratives are a relatively weak point for me with movies. I tend to find the visual and musical aspects more accessible with dialogue and story more difficult to truly appreciate. I certainly found the story in Ran very engaging and thought provoking but what makes the movie for me is Kurosawa's masterful direction and also the way he makes the movie personal. Even though I didn't completely follow the movie at all times, several parts were very affecting nevertheless and it was clear that the movie meant a lot to its creator.Ran also has an epic grandeur to it; it was the most expensive Japanese film made up to its time and apparently Kurosawa spent about 10 years painting (!) \"storyboards\" for the movie. I think it shows in the movie, you really feel like so much work and consideration went into every second of it.Anyway, the way I see it, Ran is unlike any other film ever made. In terms of capturing beauty on a grand (and yet humble) scale, it is unparalleled (in my puny amount of experience). If I were a pretentious film snob (which I hope I'm not, at least, not yet) then I might say that \"if you haven't seen Ran, you haven't experienced cinema\". That would be a fairly accurate description of what it felt like for me.",

To call him a film director is somewhat mistaken as his movie making reflects his writing and cinematography as well.His influences on the film making world are great as well as happily being able to be inspired by many different sources. When Steven Spielberg, George Lucas and Francis Ford Coppola admire you enough to have a quick whip around with the hat to raise enough money so you can make a film, the term legend is not strong enough.He has made 16th century Japan his most popular subject both because this period represents the height of purely Japanese culture (becoming unique from Chinese culture and only just beginning to encounter western culture) and because it was a time of great conflict.Ran is based on a range of different sources. Those who think this is a Japanese version of Shakespeares \"King Lear\" are sadly mistaken. Yes, throne of blood was a remake of \"Macbeth\" but this movie uses a number of different inspirations. Yes, there is King Lear in there and that story is the main guide for Ran, but with many different developments. The primary inspiration for the story is from a real Samuri who split his empire between his 3 sons. Only in reality the 3 sons ruled happily and this story the opposite happens. He also manages to integrate elements of traditional Japanese No theater into the mix. He did this with throne of blood, but here it is seamless.The story starts with with the old war lord leading a hunting party. Afterwards he seems to fall asleep. My view is that he is not really asleep but dead and what we see later is his Ghost. He has a dream and when he \"wakes up\" he decides to split his kingdom between his sons.Then things go wrong. The sons fight each other and him. He is a man condemned to a hell where he sees the empire he has built ruined by the hate and betrayal of his life.A great epic tragedy. Perhaps many people will watch this movie after reading reviews wondering why people seem to think this movie is so great. Kurosawa is one of the most innovative film makers of all time. If you are interested in film making then his movies are a must. But those who complain that he never had enough main stream exposure, get over it. Americans took his innovations, slicked them up for a mass audience.Watch it, enjoy it, feel moved, analyze it, probably fail to get all the ideas, then watch it again. It is probably a little bit long and spends too much time on the ex-warlord going mad scenes and the ending is a bit of a fizzer.....(hmmm.......I can here the angry cry of a thousand angry film school students)....but it is still the work of one of the greatest geniuses in film making.And don't forget to watch the DVD comments, but seriously I don't think they really understand Kurosawa's real genius (for example, he tends to film the people listening rather than those talking, why, the talking is merely giving information, it is the reaction of the listener that is the most important).",

            "content": "For Akira Kurosawa, without a doubt one of the greatest directors of all time, Ran marks the last great movie he ever made despite its shortcomings. It is hard to find fault with such a great director; one who has explored the very realistic nature of human living with classics such as Rashomon, Seven Samurai, Hidden Fortress, Yojimbo, and Red Beard. Here, he continues his love for Shakespeare by adapting King Lear to the samurai age as he shows an elder lord abdicate the throne to his eldest son only to watch it be tossed around amidst bloody and violent interactions.As with his other period pieces, Kurosawa pays attention to the little details and they all pay off and enhance the watching experience. Every scene is visually delicious from the remarkable sets and locations to the epic and colorful costumes and props. Kurosawa was also a master at filming action scenes and Ran is no exception. They battle scenes are rather graphic for Kurosawa but stunning nonetheless. Although this one didn't entice me as much as his earlier work, perhaps due to its slow-moving pacing and some rather complex motifs, this is still a very strong piece of work from the greatest of all Eastern directors and further shows that Akira Kurosawa is a director to be recognized and honored for all time.",

The story begins with Lord Hidetora Ichimonji proposing to leave his kingdom to his three sons. The film appears in superb vivid colors and has majestic shots of fields and castles. T\u00f4ru Takemitsu's score also adds to the grandeur of this film.The performances of the film are also memorable. Tatsuya Nakadai is effective at showing the decline of Hidetora Ichimonji and making him a sympathetic figure despite his checkered past. The three Ichimonji sons are also well-portrayed and seeing the rivalries of these three strong characters is impressive. Also of note is Mieko Harada's performance as Lady Kaede, who is unnerving to the last. Shinnosuke Ikehata also plays the role of Shakespearean fool well and the supporting performances are commendable.The film is effective at developing its characters and story without seeming slow-paced. To punctuate the character and story development, the film has some battle scenes. These are well-staged and shot on an epic scale. In particular there is a siege and a major battle which are unforgettable. \"Ran\" momentously recreates the tragedy of \"King Lear\" with adept characterizations, exquisite color and grand scale conflict.",

            "content": "There it was. My second viewing of Ran, and the one which made me acknowledge just how much of an auteur Akira Kurosawa was. I have seen numerous films from the director and literally all of them are essential viewing, yet one of those particular essentials is undoubtedly the director's concluding, 1985 epic. Set on the foundations of William Shakespeare's King Lear and produced on a \u0096remarkably large by Japanese standards at the time- $12 million budget, Ran draws corresponding angles between ancient Japanese history and the classic literacy theme of tyranny.Kurosawa's inspiration for the picture is as follows; \"when I read that three arrows together are invincible, that's not true. I started doubting, and that's when I started thinking: the house was prosperous and the sons were courageous. What if this fascinating man had bad sons?\" Those words describe the general premise of Ran, not just the beginning idea, but the focal-point. Also, the King Lear insight was something which fascinated Kurosawa, as he had always wanted to create a past for the characters in his version of the tale (something he similarly did with Throne of Blood).Beginning with an extended scene set against the expansive and luscious background of Mount Aso -during the historic period of Feudal Japan- and ending in full-scale war. This contrast depicts how easily broken a \"peace\" can be, and the escalating tension slowly builds until the land's ageing Great Lord flees his own land to avoid his children's bitter quarrelling. Almost all the characters in the film are after some sort of power; the Lord recognises the yearning his own family have to take the land from him and expresses his disgust towards their selfishness, gluttony, deceptiveness and disrespectful nature. Yet the youngest son observes the evil taking place and attempts to rescue his father from the wrath of his deceitful brothers. Keep in mind; this is based on a Shakespearian tale, so tragedy is always inevitable.Ever since its release, Ran has garnered practically 100% unanimous praise and is often denounced as a modern masterpiece, along with the previous and far less polished work, Kagemusha (Kurosawa called it \"a dress rehearsal for Ran\"). There is something about the to-be classic which \u0096for me personally- offers more satisfaction than any other picture by the Japanese auteur. Many would argue that the film is not as entertaining as Kurosawa's '50s and '60s outings, such as Yojimbo and Seven Samurai, but I would disagree, as much as I adore such classics. In retrospect, nearly every finished Kurosawa product was and continues to remain a great film, if not a masterpiece. Only a collected minority of directors have ever held such unmatched stability.The symbolic use of individually coloured clothing accentuates the emotions of each character; primary colours, yellow, red, blue and white are worn by the principal characters at the start of the piece. Heavy weight is pressed on conveying four predominant and reoccurring themes; turmoil, age, nihilism and warfare. The violence obviously existed throughout the Lord's reign, as an increased inner thirst (predominantly from his children) for control had been looming over the elderly Lord each day he grew older. Kurosawa is said to of intentionally made the chaos displayed a metaphor for an apocalypse of modern nuclear warfare. Well, it sure works.More than anything else, Kurosawa proved his ability to craft films which were in touch with contemporary cinema, but still included all the elements which develop a classic. Without hesitation I would cite Ran as the film which employs the finest use of long-shot cinematography. This is a mere sampling of my feelings towards the technicalities, let alone the film as a whole. Eruptions of unqualified chaos have never been so intoxicating.",

At age 75, Kurosawa puts his own style into Shakespeare's \"King Lear,\" the descent of a once great king into utter senility, and the result is a deeply personal and tragic film of great beauty and wisdom.His second Shakespeare samurai adaptation, (after \"Throne of Blood\" in 1957, which drew on \"MacBeth\") Kurosawa tells the story of Lord Hidetora Ichimonji a famous, revered and aging ruler in feudal Japan who after a bad dream is stirred into abdicating his throne to his sons, Taro, Jiro and Saburo. He gives full control to his eldest, Taro, though his youngest, Saburo, tells him it's a horrible idea and as a result gets banished. Sure enough, Hidetora is denied the respect of Taro when he takes power and wanders off in search of the son he exiled to seek redemption as the elder brothers shred apart his kingdom in attempt to have it all to themselves.\"Ran\" is a beautiful film despite the Shakespearian tragedy. Filmed in Kurosawa's style of three simultaneously rolling stationary cameras, it rarely gets in close to the scene and appears to have the style of much older films, save the color. Kurosawa, who's known for painting his story boards, brings this contemporary abstract color to the film by using the three primary colors (yellow, red and blue) to represent the three sons (their respective armies all wear those colors.) The colors are bright and show the division between the brothers -- each distinct yet capable of mixing. Even the blood is bright red paint as opposed to anything more realistic, suggesting how unnecessary the bloodshed is.The film borrows a lot of Japanese tradition in telling a Western story, which in the past always seems to work well. Borrowing on traditions of Noh theatre, allusions to animals like the treacherous fox and the make-up on Hidetora (frequent Kurosawa collaborator Tatsuya Nakadai) is suggestive of Noh techniques that resemble iconic masks that represent characters with certain qualities. Nakadai excellently uses the facial expressions so crucial to Japanese theatre in his incredible portrayal of Hidetora as he goes from confident and powerful to completely lost.It's a meaningful story for Kurosawa to tell at this point in his career, having much of his films in the '60s and '70s pass by unnoticed and in that time attempt to take his own life. Kurosawa takes his bleak look at human nature with \"Ran,\" using weather like always to show the coming storm of bloodshed and tragedy. \"I am lost ...\" Hidetora says as they wander about, and Kyoami the fool replies \"such is the human condition.\" It's apparent where the story will go and Kurosawa delivers it as only a master can.",

The script is indeed potent, but the way it's materialized fails much behind the director's goals. First of all, this had to be a dramatic movie, while it's actually not. Drama is realized through superficial means and honestly convinces no one. It rather depends on costumes, declamations, stereotypic behavior and forces of nature to achieve something which had to be achieved through EXPRESSIVE ACTING alone. The story drags and the empty space is filled by artsy artifice. All characters are one dimensional and badly acted. Some may argue overacting is a respectable Japanese fashion, but I still don't like it, because it forbids someone to immerse into the plot. The only interesting (and realistic) character is Lady Kaede, also the only one enjoying a respectable performance.The first battle scene is outright ridiculous. Blood has orange colors (!), dead heroes stack one against another in a \"dramatic\" mass of arrows and bullets. Everyone dies except, of course, our main character, bound to have a more dignifying fate and miraculously surviving masses of stray bullets. If the movie ended there, having the main character avoid capture by committing seppuku, or even fearing taking his own life and letting bullets do the work, I would have found the movie enjoyable. But the movie goes on much more into a totally contrived and predictable direction. The end was exactly as I had expected.",

Is it for the high expectations built up in this period, or the ageing of this film, but I found Ran a rather disappointing viewing experience.The story of course is known, but the elaboration on the screen lacks some consistency in my mind. It's too long (the wandering scenes with the \"fool\" Hidetora accompanied by his jester could have been much shorter without missing anything essential) and in general it remained too superficial. The leading parts don't get any development of character (only exception: lady Kaede), although you could have been expecting this with such a tragic story as King Lear on the background.Although the mass fighting scenes, seen in the light of today's CGI, are not spectacular any more, they're very good done. The acting performances are fine too, topping Mieko Harada as lady Kaede, an intrigante who wants to take revenge on the Hidetora family. She gets some marvelous scenes and manages them very well. I also enjoyed Hisashi Igawa as the down to earth general of the second son, Jiro.Announced as a masterwork of the late Kurosawa, I'm glad to have seen Ran at last, but the 99th best movie all times \u0085 no, it isn't.",

Whilst Hamlet is the true masterpiece of language and poetry, Lear has a true human story unlike anything else in the Bard's writings. And here is the only film adaptation to do this great work justice, a Japanese film by master director Akira Kurosawa. This is the pinnacle of Kurosawa's career. It is a work that directly captures the tragedy of Shakespeare, and is final proof that Kurosawa was unequaled when it came to blending Eastern and Western styles. The story of Lear is transmuted into the story of Lord Ichimonji, who foolishly draws his flattering sons near him, whilst banishing the only one to speak the truth. What ensues is the chaos (Ran) of war, as a clan that Ichimonji built out of blood and death erupts in a power struggle. Ichimonji is the perfect version of Lear, considered by most Shakespearian actors as the hardest and most noteworthy role to play. Here are preserved all the classic elements: the loyalty of the third son (Saburo/Cordelia) in the face of insurmountable treachery, the crazy old man (Ichimonji/Lear) and the wise fool that follows him. Other elements are added, such as the Lady Macbeth like Lady Kaede, whose hatred fuels the ravages of war, the gentle Lady Sue and her blind brother Tsurumaru, both victims of Ichimonji's former wrath. In this film, Kurosawa gives birth to the brilliant vision that is worthy of King Lear. Its imagery is unmatched, and certain scenes, such as the Siege of the First Castle, are remarkable for their savagery, poetry, and tragedy. The final Battle of the Four Armies is unsurpassed in film. For people familiar with the techniques of Sun-tzu, this offers a fascinating glimpse of his strategy in action, with much more depth and planning than the bloodfests in Braveheart or Gladiator. And though the Seven Samurai is still his greatest work, Ran stands as Kurosawa's most complete masterpiece, an epic, a tragedy, and a truly masterful film that shows the vicious circle of destruction that arises out of war and ambition.",

In Ran, he emboldens colors, ambient sound, and the reality of violence, and when the gloomy music score plays, the ambient sound disappears and the music becomes the hum of the action.The film, indeed inspired by Shakespeare's King Lear, features acting ripe with what appears to be detaching Shakespearean countenance, overacting, which to many can thus deflate the potential effect of Kurosawa's vision. However, the choice for Tatsuya Nakadai, who plays Great Lord Hidetora, and Mieko Harada, who plays the vindictive Lady Kaede, to use such old-fashioned acting techniques is not based on Shakespearean training but the influence of classical Japanese musical drama theater, exemplified in the heavy, ghost-like makeup worn by Nakadai, which resembles the emotive masks worn by traditional Noh theater performers, along with his body language, long periods of static motion and silence, followed by an abrupt, sometimes violent, change in stance. Being a very concentratedly cultural adaptation, Ran uses these dramatized aspects of the two characters to emphasize their ruthless, passionate, and single-minded natures.The story itself, which is said to be a blend of King Lear and the legends of Mori Motonari, a 16th century daimyo, neither of which I have read, very tightly and carefully unravels and unfolds very present, glaring moral insights.",

Ran is based on King Lear but it is so much more. Ran is a true masterpiece of art, drama, image, theater, and music. Kurisawa has taken elements of the greatest art of the west and the east and blended them so seamlessly. Kurisawa looked into Lear and pulled out a gem that I had never seen in Lear -- of how the Gods look down and sob at our evil actions (scene 21 on my DVD) and asks the question \"why do we kill each other?\" The film is haunting, it is stunning, it is so much more. Usually I can find one or two things wrong with a film, but not Ran. I like the Seven Samauri, but this to me is a much greater film, so much more universal and deep.To some of the haters: Yes it is overacted, that is quite intentionally a reference to No theater. It is sublimely overacted. Its not supposed to be realistic, its supposed to be grand theater in every sense of the word. The dialog and acting are much more natural then Shakespearean drama which was spoken in blank verse iambic pentameter poetry.The filming was quite intentionally devoid of close ups. The effect of the long shots is to separate us from the film a distance as if we are the looking down on the world where evil actions predominate... and perhaps we might learn. I finally have a TV big enough that I can appreciate this film the way it was meant to be seen.... but I wish I could see it in the theater.Yes it is long, but its about half the length of King Lear (If you've seen a Lear that is shorter than Ran, you've seen a heavily edited version).The film is actually quite accurate historically. Fire arms were used in middle age Japan. They were issued to peasants, not samurai (as depicted in the film wearing the typically conical peasant helmet). Muskets required a few days of training whereas the Japanese long bow required a life time of practice. Muskets proved decisive in a number of Japanese battles. I believe that after the civil wars ended (1608 or sometime like that), fire arms were banned by the Shogun. However, I do question the firing practices of the soldiers. The soldiers in this film all fired in either bad volleys (what we in the reenactment hobby call popcorn volleys) or independent fire. In Europe at the time forces fired in carefully controlled volleys because sparks from one mans gun could set off another gun or power source. The firing sounded more like modern fire arms, but perhaps that was intentional (see commentary on the criterion DVD, scene 20).Thats about it.See the film. Ita a masterpiece.",

For pure spectacle nothing else he did comes close, with remarkably choreographed battle scenes, but that is just the icing on the cake. The actors, headed by the truly splendid Nakadai, all acquit themselves well including, most especially, Mieko Harada who gives a volcanic performance as the archetypal femme fatale sowing ruin wherever she goes. The story is epic and timeless, and the cinematography and editing are wonderful. The whole enterprise is spiced with Kurosawa's laser-like focus on human folly.If you have the opportunity to see this movie, particularly in a cinema, do not miss it. Then watch Yojimbo and compare the two -- they are both great films from the same maker yet refreshingly distinct treatments of the smallness, cruelty, stupidity and majesty of humans.",

I like how he tells the bad side of the Japanese conquests, their consequences and how they affect the conquered people and their families and there is a character in the movie who is very sad about the results of the king's conquest and also something interesting is how power strongly corrupts people and abandonment towards parents.Run is a great masterpiece of the war genre and one of Kurosawa's best films it may be long and slow but what a movie it is, at least you have to see it once in your life for how great it is.",

An old warrior, whose days of glorious battle are behind him, deals with his coming of age. Tatsuya Nakadai's acting is great and you can't help but feel for his plight.  The scene in the burning castle is so surreal and I loved Hidetora's face as you can feel his anguish.  So many themes are covered from loyalty (very important), honor, greed, the corruption of power, and insanity.  I don't want to go into detail too much without giving the plot away, but let's say that my first impressions of the characters proved to be severely wrong as the story progressed.  I noticed the tone of the film starts happy and peaceful, then just goes 180 towards chaos and anarchy. It's great.The cinematography is breathtaking.  Kurosawa captures the beauty of japanese landscapes from castle strongholds, fog covered land, to fields billowing in the wind.  The battle scenes are spectacular and the savagery of war is very realistic.  Colors are stunning from the soldiers' uniforms to rich red pools of blood in battle.

Today's mega-budgeted, tent-pole films consist of spectacular, computer-generated technical set pieces strung together like beads on an extremely thin (or near nonexistent) plot string. Director Akira Kurosawa has employed a similar approach here. There are two major technical beads on his string (and a fair number of minor ones). One of the majors is presented in the opening scenes where costumes (and actors' makeup) are overwhelming spectacular and, perhaps, the most gorgeous ever filmed for a samurai-like movie. The other major technical set piece occurs in the closing scenes of intricate military maneuvers by huge (some real, some not) armies. The plot string is excessively stretched/padded-out as well as twisted up and knotted to the point of numbing confusion. (I am not a fan of voice overs, but this is one film that could really use one!) Acting is hammy and sometimes ludicrous (a Kurosawa trademark) with characters using dialog styles that are often challenging to comprehend even with the subtitles turned on (another Kurosawa trademark). Some sound dubbing is poorly executed with outdoor scenes sounding like they were recorded in an echo chamber. Sets (indoor and out) are/appear completely authentic (filming occurred around and inside the most spectacular extant castles in Japan (except for the royal family's). Stunt work is curious with each stunt fall from a horse looking pretty much identical (same stunt person each time or reuse of the same filmed sequence?). Viewers who are riders will find mounting a horse on the right especially interesting. Camera format could have greatly benefited from a much wider aspect ratio to engender a more epic feel. Film score is rich and integrates well with scenes. Restoration is outstanding. Bottom-line: This is an overly long in effect documentary on some of the technical aspects of making a movie masquerading as a movie. WILLIAM FLANIGAN, PhD.",

            "content": "What can anyone say that hasn't been said already about this film? It's a commercial release of one of the most artistic plays ever, and rendered by the most artistically minded film maker in the history of cinema. Who could create such a thing?I speak of none other than the magnificent Akira Kurosawa, the grand master of all film making, and the epitome of his work in the samurai genre, \"RAN\".\"RAN\" explores the turmoil caused by the child who knows only himself, and dismisses all that he should hold dear and valuable. But our main protagonist Hidetora raised his children on the values of unbridled warfare; how to betray a friend, turn him into an enemy, and conquer him ruthlessly. Yet he is utterly shocked when his own offspring treat him thus, and sent into a psychosis from which only a loved one can retrieve him.Edward De'Vere's play focused on three daughters who use their wiles to manipulate and scheme against one another, and thus inflict and strike the same madness in their father. But Kurosawa takes the story and give it a new bent by turning the daughters into sons for the would be Shogun of Japan. This adds a new twist, and gives more than just the usual visual hyperbole that many remakes of films do to their predecessors by actually adding to the story material. The manipulation is still there, but it is the men who are driven by a lust for power and wealth, the one thing they inherited from their father.Note the color schemes of the sons. Note the eldest in Gold, his ascendancy to the family throne. The second son shows Red, and his thirst to replace his eldest brother. The third son, the youngest, donned in blue, and it is the color that comes forth at the end when Hidetora regains himself, and as we also look up at the sky with the characters, and ask the gods why they are so cruel. Indeed, what hath god wrought upon this segment of feudal Japan? A land where its borders are set apart from anything tangible we know about that period in Japan's history. It is truly an imaginary tale, but one fraught with the historic realities of those striving for dominance in a system that knew only swords and plowshares.But it is not the men who are the only samurai. There is indeed a woman who takes on the spiritual semblance of the vampire, and drives the story forward to render justice for her family, now lost to Hidetora's exploits. She is perhaps a samurai above all the others.It is a slow film. It is a grande film. It is spectacle mixed with the frailties and cruelties and, at the end, devotions of the human heart. We see the splash and splendor of the colors, the utter destruction of a society that has put faith in military-wit and lost its heart and soul. We see one disaster follow another, and we also see those who come in to assist the true, and those that come into to clean the chaos that has reigned. Note the old lord in Act Three whose forces are in white. They look down with smiles and applaud the efforts below of those they love. Note the color of the army that assails the Red uniformed forces of the angry second son.Artistry encapsulated.Now, technically it is supremely shot, there isn't too much to criticize here save for one or two SFX shots. The scope and scale of the production is enormous. And for all of the spectacle presented in this epic, it does not lose its intimacy. We see moments of passion, moments of truth, moments of betrayal and moments of solitude. Shot composition and lens selection does not miss a beat. Whether we're looking at a long shot, or a close-up. There is of course the famous montage battle sequence that many have tried to duplicate, but have never achieved. Married to some incredible music accentuating the segment, we see cinematography at its best.This is a long film. It is a long epic film made for and by a Japanese film maker, but a film that can touch all on an emotional level. It will try the patience of the average viewer, particularly younger viewers, but if you're a film aficionado, then this film is for you.Watch and enjoy.ADDENUDM; Oh wow, apparently three prostitutes didn't like my review.

The director had been planning to make this film for decades and this was the realitization of a decade of painting the storyboards for this film. It would be his last epic and the most expensive film that he would ever make.Beyond the autobiographical nature of this story, Kurosawa also saw the battle scenes as metaphor for nuclear warfare and the high anxiety after Hiroshima. There's also the influence of Japanese Noh theater for two of the protagonists, Hidetora and Lady Kaede, whose single-mindedness stand in contrast to the rest of the cast of characters.Hidetora is a powerful warlord at the close of his life who has decided to divide up his kingdom amongst his sons, with Taro gaining the First Castle and the leadership of their family, while his brothers Jiro and Saburo are to support him and live in the lesser castles.The wise old man explains unity using three arrows. It is easy to snap one arrow but three together are more durable. Saburo snaps all three arrows and calls his father a fool, which leads to him and a servant named Tango being exiled. Fujimaki, a visiting leader who watches all of this, agrees with the brash young man and offers him his daughter in marriage.Taro's wife Lady Kaede also demands that her husband go to war, still angry that her entire family was killed by Hidetora. The constant battles - gunfire has replaced swords and arrows - drives the old man mad as he wanders the wilderness, haunted by visions of those he has destroyed in his journey to power.As the entire family follows him into some level of insanity, with war, intrigue and double crosses throughout, it seems as if every castle will crumble into nothingness.How important was Ran to Kurosawa? His wife of 39 years Yoko Yaguchi, died during the production and he only mourned for one day. His eyesight had also completely deteriorated by the time principal photography began, so his assistants used his paintings as guides to frame each scene.",

Basically the story is a reworking of the William Shakespeare tragedy King Lear, and it begins with the Great Lord Hidetora Ichimonji (Tatsuya Nakadai) stepping aside as leader of his people and giving control of the empire to his three sons Taro Takatora (Akira Terao), Jiro Masatora (Jinpachi Nezu) and Saburo Naotora (Daisuke Ry\u00fb). The three songs are all have youth on their side to rule the kingdom, the eldest Taro is given the prestigious First Castle, while Jiro and Saburo settle for Second and Third Castles, and the Lord only wishes to be an honoured guest in these three castles for the continuing years of his life. The two older sons make their father happy, but the youngest may want to cause arguments by warning his father that the uniting of the three brothers to have control will not remain united after some time. Enraged by this the father banishes the young son for pointing out this potential danger, however the warning does come to pass when the oldest son plots with his remaining brother to take everything from their father. With all this going on a war is declared and battles are fought, the formerly powerful Lord Ichimonji is stripped of his former glory to the point where he may die, murders are committed within the closest family and friends, and in the end is only a bad ending for the particular characters. Also starring Mieko Harada as Lady Kaede, Hisashi Igawa as Shuri Kurogane, Masayuki Yui as Tango Hirayama and Yoshiko Miyazaki as Lady Sue. The story was just about easy to understand, I admit the first half an hour or so was the most interesting, but the rest had some interesting moments, the costumes were absolutely deserving of an award, and the battle sequences are great to watch, although I drifted in tiny moments I know overall it is a great epic drama. It won the Oscar for Best Costume Design, and it was nominated for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration and Best Cinematography, it won the BAFTAs for Best Foreign Language Film and Best Make Up Artist, and it was nominated for Best Cinematography, Best Costume Design, Best Production Design and Best Adapted Screenplay, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Foreign Film.

            "content": "This film, Akira Kurosawa's version of 'King Lear' set in feudal Japan, tells the story of Lord Hidetora Ichimonji and his three sons Taro, Jiro and Saburo. The elderly lord gathers his family and talks about how he started off in a small castle but gradually defeated all his rivals and now controls the entire area from the largest caste. He finishes by saying that he had decided to retire; he states that Taro, his eldest son, is to inherit the absolute leadership and Jiro and Saburo will inherit the second and third castles respectively and must support Taro. Saburo, the youngest son, suggests that his father must be mad to stand down arguing it will only be a matter of time before Taro and Jiro turn on him. This leads to Saburo's banishment but it isn't long before his words start to be proved right; first Taro makes his father's position at the First Castle untenable then Jiro refuses his men access to the Second Castle forcing him to head to another castle. Here Taro and Jiro's forces attack; Taro is killed and Jiro takes his place as dominant warlord; Hidetora escapes with his fool but Jiro still wants him dead\u0085 anybody familiar with Shakespearian tragedies will know that there won't be a happy ending for any major character.As with his previous adaptions of Shakespeare plays director Akira Kurosawa does a brilliant job transferring the stories to Feudal Japan\u0085 their themes fit the era perfectly. It explores the idea of revenge as Lady Kaede, Taro's wife whose family was killed and lands taken by Hidetora, seeks to destroy the family from within. Likewise it shows the thirst for power as Taro then Jiro try to destroy their elderly father despite the fact that he has handed over all the real power. The battle scenes have an epic feel; especially when Hidetora is the sole survivor as the castle burns and arrows fly past him. Hidetora's subsequent descent into inevitable madness is shown as he travels through various places he destroyed on his rise to power. Overall I'd certainly recommend this; you don't have to be a fan of Shakespeare or familiar with Kurosawa's other films to enjoy this.These comments are based on watching the film in Japanese with English subtitles.",

            "review_title": "Kurosawa communes with Shakespeare, again . . .",
            "content": ". . . with somewhat less scintillating results than the first time, *Throne of Blood* from the late Fifties. Of course, some of this has to do with the obvious fact that \"Macbeth\" is just more amenable to cinema than \"King Lear\": the former play is much briefer, more to the point, and has more visual possibilities. \"Lear\" also contains reams of philosophical commentary on Man's place in the cosmos which, I fear, gets lost in translation to any other language, let alone Japanese. I'll expand on that a little later.But first, praise is due. If the poetic meat of \"Lear\" necessarily must be excised from the milieu of 16th-century war-torn Japan, one can still admire Kurosawa for brilliantly adapting the play's plot and characters to their new setting. Obviously, the tired old king of ancient Britain morphs easily into a tired old samurai overlord (Tatsuya Nakadai as \"Hidetora\"). But instead of the three daughters, we get three sons. As in Shakespeare, the elder two are bad, the younger good: the former use language to hide their true natures from the king; the latter's inability to use language to SHOW his true, good nature causes his precipitate banishment from Hidetora's dominions. The good son is accompanied in banishment by loyal samurai Tongo, the equivalent to Kent. The wife of the eldest son, Lady Kaeda (Meiko Harada in the greatest female role in all of Kurosawa), is nominally this movie's version of evil Edmund, but in actuality she is Edmund, Goneril, and Regan all rolled into one silk kimono. Indeed, the \"bad\" sons seem unable to commit the vilest crimes without Kaeda's prodding. One scene that demonstrates Kaeda's nastiness with absolutely brilliant economy shows her sobbing on the floor, trying to soften up second son Jiro into marrying her after the eldest son Taro -- her former husband -- has been treacherously killed in battle. With Jiro's back turned, she viciously squashes a moth on the floor without the least interruption in her performance.Minor roles are also transposed: the old samurai has in his service the Japanese equivalent of a court jester, who, as in Shakespeare's play, serves the somewhat tiring function of continually pointing out what a mistake the ruler has made by abdicating and then dividing the kingdom. The good characters Gloucester and Edgar are sort of mixed and matched interchangeably with a brother and sister tag-team of woe: the brother, blinded, is a hermit living in squalor, and the sister is a frightened mouse having fully retreated into Shindo Buddhism. Both of these characters are the damaged results of Hidetora's warlike past, their misfortunes entirely due to their father having been Hidetora's enemy.And this elemental difference in Hidetora's and Lear's back-story is what finally trips up *Ran*, in my judgment. Artists are always attempting to re-write Shakespeare; all fail, even the greatest artists like Akira Kurosawa. Lear was \"more sinned against than sinning\"; Hidetora is basically getting his comeuppance for past brutalities. This is perhaps a suitable enough alteration for Eastern sensibilities: a movie that invokes the Great Buddha is bound to find dramatic justice in an old man suffering the retribution of all of his bad karma. But this idea just isn't as bold as Shakespeare's. Lear pays the price for his foibles twenty-fold, and his sad story is really but a small item in a world of chaotic violence in which maliciousness is the one certainty. Life just isn't fair, and karma has nothing to do with it, either way. Kurosawa, despite depicting all manner of barbarities in this film, clearly couldn't stomach Shakespeare's nihilistic vision of the world. In *Ran*, Tongo reprimands the jester for getting angry at the gods, going on to say, \"The gods weep for us\"; in \"King Lear\", the gods are simply absent. I think Kurosawa lost his nerve. I also think that the Lady Kaeda could have done without the tiresome \"motivation\" for her actions. Unalloyed evil was good enough for Goneril and Regan, and, for that matter, Asaji, the Lady Macbeth-figure in Kurosawa's own *Throne of Blood*. Giving Kaeda a revenge motive deprives her of no small amount of force.Of course, the latter quibble can be considered more than adequately compensated for by such scenes as when she requests a henchman to salt the head of the Lady Sue after cutting it off, so that it would keep better in the heat for presentation. And, of course, any other deficiencies *Ran* might have can be relegated to nitpicking when one considers the great siege of the Third Castle in the middle of the film -- the crowning glory of Kurosawa's epic mode. Horrific carnage mounts over a mournful, Mahlerian score (which changes suddenly and explosively into ambient sound when Taro gets shot), finally culminating in one of cinema's greatest moments: a $1.5 million set going up in flames while Nakadai as Hidetora, denied seppuku and now finally mad, parts two armies like some awesome ghost, trudging his way toward oblivion. If Hidetora is sadly denied Lear's articulation, Kurosawa gives him some of the most brilliant visual presentation that a great artist can conjure. As such, comparisons between the actual director (seventy-five during the film's making) and his subject seem notoriously wrongheaded. Kurosawa hadn't abdicated any throne. Not yet.7 stars out of 10.",

This movie is a pure joy to watch \u0096 as good as are other attributes of the movie, the cinematographic excellence leaves any other movie ever made so far behind. I have liked \"The Last Samurai\" for its imagery and amazing color presentation, but even that movie pales if compared to \"Ran\". Opening scene is spellbinding - music score along with those moments of deafening silence is way too good. No doubt, it was the most expensive Japanese film ever made. Lord Hidetora is superiorly awesome (especially when he turns mad) and Lady Kaede at times seems to be even more ruthless than Nurse Ratched (was in \"One flew over cuckoo's nest\"). Also, so many subtle and some not so-subtle references to Buddha are timely and apt. However, I would confess that movie is not perfect - the attack on the third castle is more or less ordinary, and I do wonder how even in that wilderness, Kyoami was able to maintain squeaky clean clothes for himself and his master.

            "content": "Given that Akira Kurosawa's sight had deteriorated so much by the time he made this movie, it's astonishing what a beautiful film Ran turned out to be. Filmed nigh on entirely in long shots, every single frame looks like a celebrated painter's masterpiece come to life, each one bursting with colour. From such examples as the hill top debate which begins the film, where 16th Century Japanese royalty sit in brightly coloured robes before the sweeping green mountains or the sight of colour-coordinated Samurai armies ransacking a fortress in a silent, apocalyptic battle, right up to the achingly sad final shot before the credits, every second of Ran is a beauty to behold. That isn't to say it's a film that'll concern only those interested in poetic visual statements however, because it is also one of the director's best works and a landmark moment in Eastern cinema.Basically an updating of Shakespeare's King Lear, the film sees the elderly Lord Hidetora Ichimonji deciding to hand over the reins of power to his three sons. His eldest, Taro, becomes the new Lord, while his younger sons Jiro and Saburo are each granted a province of their own to rule over. Saburo however protests, believing it to be a foolish decision that will split the clan and Hidetora banishes his third son. It isn't long however until Taro and Jiro's ambitions of power lead them to betray their father and the nation begins to fall apart, spurred on by Taro's manipulating wife lady Kaede.Kurosawa thus blends Shakespearean tragedy with a sweeping historical epic about the loss and gain of power. At the centre of it all is a remarkable acting presence in the shape of Tatsuya Nakadai as the displaced elderly Samurai. At the beginning of the film he is a man of stubborn pride, but as his world crumbles and his people die, he soon finds himself with nowhere else to go. The emotional turbulence of being betrayed by his own flesh and blood drives him to his limits, but nevertheless he still refuses to contact Saburo because his warrior principles will not allow him. As a man in his twilight years, lost in the world, there is definitely some element of Kurosawa himself up there on screen, the director having been near the end of his career with his health failing and his wife having tragically passed away during shooting. Hidetora isn't a perfect ruler but as evidence of his cruelty and oppression during his reign mount up, he remains a sympathetic character, questioning his past decisions and what exactly it is he has achieved in his lifetime. He is the pillar that holds the film together and no mistake.He is aided by some impressive performances all round. Daisuke Ryo's impetuous, outspoken but loyal Saburo is a highpoint of course even if his screen time is limited, spending the majority of the storyline in exile. Jinpachi Nezu's Jiro is another remarkable presence, equally proud and stubborn as his father but beset by insecurities and mistrust. The two that really standout however are Hisashi Igawa and Masayuki Yui as Jiro's General Kurogane and Saburo's Lieutenant Tango respectively. Kurogane is loyal soldier but he is a bit more complex than average because he knows that his master is a flawed and weak man, yet remains by his side to the bitter end. Tango on the other hand is an adviser who gets banished alongside Saburo, but who returns in the hour of need and goes through hell and high water to return his lord to safety.Sad to say though that not every character feels truly grounded in reality as Mieko Harada's Lady Kaede is the film's weak link (and the reason I'm not giving it a nine). Her performance is spot on as Kaede is a cold, calculating woman with vengeance on her mind at the best of times, but there are one or two moments in the script where the writing isn't particularly strong. During one pivotal scene towards the middle, she comes dangerously close to parody, verging from one dramatic emotional outburst to another, ranting, screaming and licking blood from a knife wound.Mercifully though, that is the only bad thing about this movie and fans of historical epics would do well to check it out. The battle scene that forms the centrepiece is absolutely breathtaking, with legions of Samurai warriors storming a castle in total silence. There are no sound effects, no speech, just the sad musical overture for the majority of the fighting, until a particularly important gun shot rings out and we are plunged right into the maelstrom. Bodies are filled with arrows, blood drips everywhere and hundreds of warriors are slaughtered in spectacular fashion. It may be a glorious sight to behold, but it is the closest thing a historical epic has got to showing that war is hell, no matter what period of human history it is set in.The more blood thirsty among us may then be disappointed by the second clash towards the end, a far more unremarkable skirmish that promised to be incredible after several scenes of armies manoeuvring in anticipation but even so, Ran is unquestionably a masterpiece. It gets into the heads of men who hold tremendous power and puts all their complexities and failings under a microscope for the world to see. Like a watercolour painting that moves, it is beautiful to watch time and time again.",

            "content": "Though much is often made of its lavish battle scenes, at its heart 'Ran (1985)' is a family drama. In typical Shakespearean fashion (the film is loosely based on 'King Lear'), it just so happens that each core member of that family has an army at their disposal. Even so, the feature is surprisingly light on fights; political manoeuvring, personal backstabbing and threats of full-blown war are far more prevalent. Thankfully, this talking is, essentially, as riveting as any skirmish could hope to be. Of course, familial conflicts often devolve into - and are keenly presented as - physical ones. The stand-out of these is a nightmarish, blood-soaked and oddly ethereal sequence depicting what's essentially a massacre. Its almost madness-inducing mayhem is truly horrifying to behold, with numerous extremely violent vignettes aptly conveying the futility and immorality of the entire situation. This alarming scene kicks off an introspective odyssey for the protagonist, one that sees him almost comatose and forced to come to terms with the many sins he's committed. He isn't a good man - that much is evident even from just the small number of his skin-crawling crimes we actually hear about - but we're able to truly empathise with him, even when he's being pig-headed or brutish. That's because we understand how deeply the betrayals he experiences must cut; anyone would be shocked if their sons treated them the way (at least a couple of) his sons treat him. Make no mistake: this is a tragedy. The plot unfolds slowly, painfully but inevitably veering towards an increasingly bleak conclusion. Its haunting end evokes a sense that perhaps it was all some sort of punishment. However, such bloodshed affects all those near it, not just those that may deserve it. In this way, it never feels fair, it just feels real. It's compelling, strangely affecting and fantastically well-conceived. 7/10",

            "content": "A truly thought provoking bit of dialogue from one of Akira Kuorsawa's best works, a true masterpiece in the world of film. The film is so visually stunning one may completely forsake the meanings behind those images or worse walk away from the film confused. In response to that, another character remarks, \"It is the gods who weep. They see us killing each other\u0085over and over since time began. They can't save us from ourselves.\" To me this may quite possibly be Kurosawa's greatest achievement among many.Firstly, and rightly so, is the sheer greatness of the acting in this movie. I could go on about the greatness of each actor's performance, seeing as every performance stands out so well; no character is over shadowed or unforgettable. Instead I'll focus on the gorgeous story treatment and this film's themes. As I'm sure anybody who's reading this review knows, the story is an adaptation of Shakespeare's \"King Lear.\" Kurosawa uses Japanese history very well so, portraying quite faultlessly a warlord ruled Japan. This film, due to it being his most big budget production, has quite an epic feel to it as well. A vast landscape shot accompanied by the awesome cinematography creates a beautiful and majestic aura to the atmosphere as a whole. And the costume design is done artistically, very worthy of the award it won.Despite all that beauty, anyone who truly understands the film will realize it is easily Kurosawa's most nihilistic-toned film. The score itself is dark, brooding, stomach churning and never uplifts onto a joyous melody. The whole underlying theme in itself is the near pointlessness of our existence in this world. How man is naturally power hungry and lusts almost always for only their desires, no matter what they may be. Regardless of whom must one must hurt or toss aside to attain it, we will do it, for better or for most cases, worst. We naturally do this, and are more than willing to shed blood and commit betrayal to have what we want. There's a classic sense of Shakespeare tragic irony at work here, about how loyalty can be misplaced, and before we can even have a chance to make up for it the world can take away our redemption. After all his losses, including his power and sanity, all Hidetora wanted was forgiveness, and yet the opportunity was forever lost in death. His other two sons are easily seduced by the promise of power and intimacy but both also end up a victim of their own vile ways. And yet, it is not God's duty to punish the wicked, nor to praise the righteous. This seen many times in this movie, but is brought out to the fullest when the gruesome death of lady Keade comes to light. This character had lost her whole family at the hands of a war for power long ago, and lost everything but her own scarred brother. She coped, as she said to Hidetora in a great scene, by way of prayer to Buddha, a holy deity. Religion is her savior, but no amount of devotion saved her in the end. The same goes for her brother who sits atop the ruins of his childhood home, but has no idea his sister isn't returning. An image of Buddha she gave to him falls down below amongst the rocks, neither worsening nor benefiting his predicament. Man is alone to deal with his own self-constructed problems.\"Don't cry. Its how the world is made. Men prefer sorrow over joy, suffering over peace.\"",

            "content": "SPOILERS MAY BE CONTAINED HEREIN!Akira Kurosawa's adaptation of King Lear is considered by some to be among his best works. If so, justifiably. The film is quite a masterpiece.\nThe Lord Hidetora decides to abdicate his throne to his three sons in an inexplicable act of vanity/ silliness/ big-heartedness. This against the better counsel of his son Saburo whom he banishes for his honesty. Following this action, we watch in mute horror as the once tightly held kingdom falls into pieces as the three sons vie for ultimate power, with some neighbouring powers and even one of the wives thrown in for good measure. What ensues is a masterpiece of dry ironic tragedy. We watch the erstwhile Lord slowly but surely loose his powers of reason, eaten away by guilt, fear and shattered pride, while everyone else one dies at the altar of war and the greed for power. We can't help but be drawn into the web that Kurosawa ensnares for us, can't help feeling sorrow and occasional amusement as human beings reveal their endless frailties.Through all this, Kurosawa's technique is simple yet profound. The music, except in the battle scenes, is stark and has a natural feel to it that compliments the 16th century Japanese countryside where the film is set. He uses the strong characterisations and gestures that come hand in glove with the Samurai ethos to telling effect. Every scene is infested with Samurai grandeur. His style of filmmaking perhaps is closer to European film-making as he gives up speedy cuts for longer mid-shots in which fierce dramatic interactions can play themselves out. As such, his style is almost theatrical. Even the battle scenes are interestingly played out: one scene has no battle sounds, the other has them in full glory. Here Kurosawa seems to be toying with our cinematic notions of battle scenes. The performances are uniformly good, with the actress playing Lady Kaede, standing out, for me at least.All in all, as a version of King Lear, Ran works because Kurosawa is not awed by his source material but freely adapts it to suit his own ethos and cinematic vision. In that sense I'd rather see it as a stand alone film with an original screenplay co-written by Kurosawa and none other than the great bard himself. A film which stands on its own. And should be seen finally as belonging to one Akira Kurosawa.",

I also liked this movie because of the messages that wants to pass and because this movie wants to has an impact to the audience after they watching of it. About the interpretations it has to be mentioned the interpretation of Tatsuya Nakadai who played as Lord Hidetora Ichimonji and he was really good at it, equally good was the interpretation of Daisuke Ry\u00fb who played as Saburo Naotora Ichimonji, and also Akira Terao's who played as Taro Takatora Ichimonji.Lastly I have to say that \"Ran\" is a masterpiece movie and it really worth everybody to watch it, it has much of suspense and action and of course war and all of that are being combined really good with drama.

The DVD quality was horrible, so that might have contributed to my dislike, but I really didn't like this film at all. It was very touhg to get through...I had to watch it in pieces, because I could not take it in doses longer than 30 minute stretches. The acting is horrible throughout, the plot is like a bad soap opera set in Samurai-land, and the visuals, while artistic and nice to look at, are heavy-handed, distracting, and slow down this already tedious film. Had this been an American production, people would bash it beyond all repair...compare it to other 1985 films for example \"Back to the Future\", and it pales miserably. The dialogue, the comedy, the action...all amateurish. I know it's Kurosawa and he can do great things, but this one was no good and seems like an aging director trying to do something grand and wonderful, and like Francis Ford Coppola's \"Godfather III\", this one fails and is not even worthy of being compared to something like \"Seven Samurai.\" How is this then in the IMDb Top 250 list?

This was 2nd Shakespeare adaption for legendary director Kurosawa and the script was certain to fetch critical acclaim but was it enough in mainstream filmmaking? Ran is about 160 minutes long and somewhere this thing makes it a strict one take viewing experience. I can't watch this film multiple times on TV or anywhere with breaks and neither i think i can watch it again in one take without forwarding once. In Medieval Japan, an elderly warlord retires, handing over his empire to his three sons. However, he vastly underestimates how the new-found power will corrupt them and cause them to turn on each other...and him. The family battle of reign and crown is very much predictable but never loses sense and artistic values. What i feel about adapting something is either you should try and modify it or make the copy paste look so good that people will find no difference at all and you'll be saved. From what i have seen in Kurosawa's filmography, i found his original films more interesting and more classical than both the Shakespeare adaptions. It could be because i knew the story already or may be i didn't find it Highly interesting, glueing and engaged. Ran doesn't go offtrack, it stays on its way and runs smoothly till the destination. The only problems are long runtime and typical use of big Canvas. The performances from all the cast members are good but only Tatsuya Nakadai remains in mind. Background score and Cinematography are suitable to the theme and the era in which the film is set. Agressive use of violence and battle scenes look fine sometimes but not everytime. Kurosawa directs another gem but just because of outdated melodrama and lack of freshness, Ran didn't make it to the my list of Classics. Nevertheless, a Fantastic Adaption any day.RATING - 7/10*By - #samthebestest",

The film is the last, and one of the best, of the 'historical' dramas from director Akira Kurosawa. The production is outstanding, with beautiful expansive cinematography, excellent set design, and fabulous costumes (the film's only Academy Award win). The cast is great although Lord Hidetora Ichimonji begins to look a bit theatrical as he slides towards madness and Tatsuya Nakadai overplays the character at times. Mieko Harada is particularly good as Lady Kaede, who oozes Machiavellian menace as she ruthlessly manipulates Hidetora's hapless middle son Jiro (Jinpachi Nezu). The film moves at a faster pace than Kagemusha (1980), Kurosawa's previous jidaigeki and the battle scenes are epic and spectacular, with armies wearing brightly coloured armour and flying brightly coloured banners clashing like a game of 'Risk' brought to life. The stunt work is also excellent, especially the horsemanship in the ill-fated cavalry charges. All in all, one of the best films from the legendary Japanese director and a fitting 'swan song' to his output of historical dramas.",

            "content": "The man was a genius when it came to directing these long Japanese war epics and Ran is no different. This is Kurosawa's interpretation of Shakespeare's King Lear, a play that unfortunately I did not study. The plot consists of Lord Hidetora abdicating his empire and splitting the kingdom between his three sons, who each want to have total control. And so many castles are raided and many horseback battles are conceived. Whatever the scene, everything was filmed to perfection. I just adore Kurosawa's style, he doesn't rush a single scene. Leave a castle burning for 30 seconds, watch a man run through a field for 30 seconds or even look at the sky for 30 seconds. In theory, I should be bored...but his artistic integrity and majestic style is a sight to behold. What resonated with me the most was the screenplay, also by Kurosawa. Several lines of dialogue felt like Shakespeare and it's admirable to see an influential film maker be...well...influenced by another famous writer. Scenes where Hidetora descends into madness are great examples of this. Tatsuya Nakadai, who portrayed Hidetora, was once again outstanding. This equals his role from Kagemusha, it was an emotive and poignant portrayal of a father who has been betrayed by his children. The battle scenes were masterful work, hundreds of extras in clan attire definitely filled up the screen with contrasting colours. The costume and production design were yet again wonderful to look at. I do love me the traditional Japanese environment that Kurosawa captures with ease. Lady Kaeda though, was the manifestation of evil...her manipulative skills were fascinating to watch. This leads me to my only problem, which is that none of the major characters are likeable, even Hidetora had issues. So I struggled to become emotionally invested in these characters. However, the purpose of this iteration was to explore themes of betrayal and insanity, Kurosawa conveyed them to technical perfection. Not a complete masterpiece, but extremely close to being one.",

If that is ok, (it was fine with me) then you can look forward to a powerful tale of intrigue and betrayal. Speaking of the story, while it is based on Shakespeare (King Lear), it contains lots of action. And unlike some movies based on his work, Ran is very easy to follow. The first thing you notice about Ran is the style of the camera work. The scenery is often beautiful and Kurosawa uses powerful telephoto lenses to interestingly compress distance. The plot begins to unfold about an arrogant Lord and his three sons. It seems like a simple family squabble but the family members are often not what they seem. Everyone believes they know what is happening but almost no one understands the danger they are all in.\nThe castles, battle scenes and the costumes are tremendous. I especially liked the quiet moments. For in every silence, a terrible event was beginning to unfold. The performances by the brothers are good. The Lord played by Tatsuya Nakadai is outstanding. But it is Mieko Harada playing Lady Kaede who steals the show.Ran vividly shows how fragile family and sanity are. It is a paranoid vision where anyone can do harm. Yet, it is all glossed over by the polished customs of the traditional Japanese world which increases the story's intensity. There are good people in Ran. They cling to their faith. But they are at the mercy of the arrogant, who are blind to the need to work together, to make any society work. No other film illustrates the need for cooperation at every level better than Ran.",

It is the last classic Japanese samurai epic of the 20th century, and the last great film by a filmmaker who overshadowed most of his contemporaries.Adapting Shakespeare's King Lear to Medieval Japan and changing daughters to sons, Ran opens with an aging warlord (Kurosawa regular Tatsuya Nakadai) dividing his power among his sons, only to watch them sulk away. Intending to spend his twilight years visiting each in turn, he instead witnesses the slow disintegration of everything he has created and a vicious fraternal war.The 70s were a very rough time for Kurosawa, with the debacle of his first color and independent picture, attempted suicide and very slow rehabilitation. In this time he made only the Russian Dersu Ouzala, a fine film, but one that stands apart from his other work. He also devised the story of Ran, an impossible-to-finance behemoth of a picture at a time when Japanese filmmaking was evolving towards smaller, nimbler, and safer ventures. As the prospect of ever making Ran grew ever fainter, he set his sights on a smaller film to serve as a dress-rehearsal of sorts: Kagemusha. It took foreign financing, courtesy of his first generation of successful fans - George Lucas and Francis Coppola - to get that made, to great international acclaim. It also helped Kurosawa rebuild his confidence and throw himself at Ran with countless paintings and years of preparation behind him.If you've never seen anything by Kurosawa, or, worse yet, if you've only seen his earlier masterpieces Seven Samurai and Yojimbo, Ran might cause a bit of a shock at first. Those other films were the work of a master in his prime, confident, playful and extremely dynamic. Ran is a much more static, fatalistic an poised film, the product not just of a decade of storyboarding, but of a grim sense of doom born from Kurosawa's experience and the play he chose as his inspiration. That said, never has the cruel indifference of fate been so artfully depicted on a screen.The battle scenes are few, but haunting in their grim relentlessness. With his endless flows of colorful, authentically-armored soldiers, Kurosawa paints war scenes that manage to be both incredibly convincing and otherworldly at the same time. It conveys a sense of being a ghost, forced to witness the last hours of a dying world, something no other film has managed before or since. You will marvel at the mastery on display, but your enjoyment will depend on whether you can overcome the near-crushing pessimism on display. I struggled with that at the very end, and consequently cannot rate this as highly as his other films I mentioned. Nevertheless, Ran deserves deserves every bit of praise thrown at it.Watch it and decide for yourself.",

Or perhaps it would be more accurate to say that those two sources are eerily similar. An aging warlord (Tatsuya Nakadai) that has decided to retire and hand over the three great castles he has conquered during his bloody reign to his three sons, with the oldest named his successor and the head of the great house. But almost immediately the sons begin arguing among one another and soon the warlord finds himself dethroned and wandering the battlefields of the war his sons are waging.Quite like with his previous Shakespeare adaptation, Throne of Blood, Kurosawa delves deep into man's corruptibility and the taint of power in this film. Many of his films are at least somewhat heroic in nature and tone. Whereas the protagonist of this film, the warlord, is anything but. We learn throughout the course of the film that his life is a long tale of conquest, beaten down enemies, blood, fire and destruction. Yet Kurosawa achieves the very hard task of making him sympathetic despite all that. He obviously loves his sons and his anguish at seeing his life's work torn down in a matter of days is real and jarring.Perhaps it could even be said that his character is reflected in his sons. There's the oldest, the one with the power, pride and possessions, but who is brought low by those closest to him and stands on feet of clay. There's the schemer, the one willing to commit atrocities to get what he wants. And there's the youngest, who's the most driven by the love he has for his family, but who's also the one with the most difficulties in surviving the war-torn realm they live in.The film is also massive in scope, budget and length. Its themes are deep, its running time is closer to three hours and its story is a humongous five act monstrosity. It was also the most expensive Japanese film ever made back then and the money is definitely on the screen. Hundreds of soldiers at once on display, all of them decked in armour. Entire castles built and then destroyed. Lavish costumes, ruins and locations. I don't think I've seen a movie with this much handcraft on the screen since The Lord of the Rings trilogy. And this predates those films by almost two decades.Yet the film is always gripping, always interesting and endlessly fascinating. It's called one of Kurosawa's finest, and yeah, I can see why.",

            "content": "When a living legend like Kurosawa, does a King Lear adaptation at the tender age of 75, one would expect a small-scale film concentrating on the human elements of the story. That he produced an epic of such proportions makes a further evaluation of the great man's contribution to cinema necessary.'Ran' (translating as Chaos) is set in medieval Japan and follows the basic King Lear narrative closely. Lord Hidetora is an aging warlord and, wanting a peaceful retirement, decides to divide his kingdom up amongst his three sons. After banishing the youngest, Saburo, for pouring scorn on the idea, Hidetora finds himself an unwanted obstacle to the older two. After repeated humiliations, pride forces Hidetora into vain wanderings on the open plain, his state of mind declining as rapidly as his entourage.The film sets itself the unenviable task of trying to explain the precarious position man holds within the universe. Man is seen to be elevating himself to such a level that he dreams of challenging the very laws of nature. Hidetora has achieved his status through deception, callousness and violence; his notion to wash away the blood he has spilt in happy retirement is scornfully thrown back by the elements. The speed and manner in which he is forced to lie in the bed he has made for himself should serve as a warning to all.The films large set pieces, particularly two quite stunning battle sequences, are staged magnificently, but 'Ran' is no empty epic. The characters and their motivations are fully explored and the tension built up by the dialogue fully compliments the action. With an ending which offers no redemption 'Ran' paints a bleak picture - the colours and brushstrokes it employs however, turn it into a dazzling masterpiece.One point - the second main battle reminds me of 'Zulu' with the soldiers lined up on the skyline shouting down.",

            "content": "Akira Kurosawa is one of the greatest filmmakers ever and his last epic film Ran is often considered one of his best, an adaptation of King Lear. Ran is a visually striking, thematic epic that Kurosawa's fan will love. Ran is glorious to look at, having fantastic colours, costumes and cinematography of the Japanese plains and mountains. The characters are rich, major and minor as well defined and have a role to play with their character dynamic. Tatsuya Nakadai as Hidetora is a character who goes through the ringer as he descends into madness, face all his sins when he rose to power and goes into a mental and physical void as he ends up in a wasteland. The battle of Third Castle was a terrific sequence as a small force are in a last stand against massive army attacks, using arrows and muskets. It was beautifully shot battle, showing the scale of the army and showing the carriage as Hidetora's mind cracks.A theme of power corrupts as Hidetora seek power as his sons want to have complete control of the land. All the characters have their own agendas and the only ones who are loyal to Hidetora are the ones he rejected. All the characters in the power struggle are all trying to play one against the other.Kurosawa direction is superb, a great looking film and he allowed scenes to play out in long takes, allowing the drama to play out and adds to the theatrical nature of the acting and story. Kurosawa even uses the weather to great effect to enhance the emotion and turmoil the characters and world suffers, much like Rashomon and Throne of Blood.Ran is typical Kurosawa.",

This is not madness, not a soul seething with demons. it is histrionic flailing.i think perhaps the Japanese cultural approach to the very idea of madness is not accessible to us in our usual western terms. it may be that an appearance of high melodrama is as close as we can come on this issue. the cultures simply don't see the same thing when they look. the film makes me glad bette davis never did Shakespeare.sorry, kurosawa fans, i love him, too, but this one misses as badly on the verbal level as it transcends on the visual.",

It adapts the plot and narrative structure of Shakespeare's King Lear to the Sengoku Jidai: in place of Lear and his daughters Goneril, Regan, and Cordelia, we have the daimyo Ichimonji Hidetora and his three sons, Taro, Jiro, and Saburo. This transposition somewhat intensifies certain aspects of King Lear's moral conceit. Hidetora's sons neglect their formal duties under filial piety, just as he abdicates his own responsibilities as lord and father. While the actions of their Shakespearean counterparts is intuitively reprehensible, in Ran, they violate codified central tenets of Confucian ethics. Nihilistic interpretations of King Lear came into vogue in the 20th century, but while neither the stage production nor its film adaptation affirms a strong moral conclusion, to me it is at least clear that an ambiguous morality is not equivalent to a lack thereof. Ran is a cautionary tale about seeking privilege without responsibility, substanceless claims to moral superiority, and the banal yet fragile nature of what is truly good. Kurosawa's direction relies more heavily upon nonverbal techniques than Shakespeare's dialogue, and it is largely for his mastery of visual storytelling that the film is so highly regarded by critics. The film feels more of an exercise in visual storytelling, than necessarily a source of mass entertainment. It certainly is instructive in expressive cinematographic technique, with much to be learned and emulated. For the critical viewer, this is indeed a great masterpiece.",

Like other Kurosawa films it takes a while to work up any momentum, requiring several long, static dialogue scenes to establish the conflicts between an aging warlord and his (thankfully color-coded) sons (plus one totally ruthless daughter-in-law).

In the process, he quarrels with the youngest son, who is the only one sane and bold enough to tell his progenitor the truth, to wit that this is a singularly misguided plan. Slowly but surely the family will rip itself apart, amidst treachery and slaughter...Kurosawa transports Shakespeare's tragedy to feudal Japan. In doing so he re-arranges and re-adapts the story liberally : the protagonist, for instance, becomes an old samurai warlord with a whole household of openly acknowledged concubines. There is also a bitter joke which involves a fox head and which allows for a bit of folklore about beautiful shape-changing women who set out to beguile unsuspecting men. The move to feudal Japan works very well, for a variety of reasons. To begin with, this backdrop preserves the great themes of class, power, prestige. Secondly, the viewer is immersed in a rich and complex culture which can produce extremes both of violence and of beauty, often at the same time. (Some of the movie's costumes, especially the aristocratic ones, are so exquisite that they deserve a fashion museum of their own.)This is an epic movie with an exceptional visual grandeur. It is also a deeply pessimistic movie. \"Ran\" deals not just with the folly of a single man or a single family : it deals with the folly of Mankind, which could live peacefully on a generous and abundant Earth but prefers killing and looting...Much recommended.

It is his last great film.\nKurosawa had a long career, but it was interspersed with difficult periods of \"writers block\". Therefore finding funding for his films was noy always easy, especially in the second half of his career. \"Dersu Uzala\" (1975) was financed with Russian money and \"Ran\" (1985) with French money.From the three great Japanese directors after the Second World War (Ozu, Mizoguchi and Kurosawa) Kurosawa was the most Western one. The cultural influence went in both directions. Kurosawa had an influence on Western filmmaking. \"The magnificent seven\" (1960, John Sturges) was a remake of \"Seven Samurai\" (1954, Akira Kurosawa). On the other hand Kurosawa was inspired by Western literature, most notably by Shakespeare. Stange as it may sound Kurosawa is one of the most prominent Shakespeare adapters under the film directors. He brought MacBeth (\"Throne of blood\", 1957), Hamlet (\"The bad sleep well\", 1960) and King Lear (\"Ran\", 1985) to the screen.King Lear is a pessimistic story in which a father is cheated by his elder sons. Only his youngest son remains faithful to him. In \"Ran\" the difference is visualised in the landscape. When the father is with his youngest son, the landscape is green. When the father is with the other sons, the landscape is black and consists of a volcanic type of sand. This black landscape is ideal for the fighting scenes because it provides a perfect background for the colorful banners of the different armies.The last scene is mindbogling but also not easy to forget. A blind man is all on his own, staying on the edge of a cliff. In essence he can't make another step.",

            "content": "Akira Kurosawa is renowned both in the west and at home as one of the world's finest filmmakers, in large part thanks to his many historical pictures. Made towards the end of his career, Ran is the last in a long line of Kurosawa features set amid the chaos of Japan's feudal past. But this time around there are none of the downtrodden samurai and gnarly-toothed peasants so familiar from his 1950s classics. Ran is not an intimate human portrait as Rashomon, Seven Samurai and Hidden Fortress were. This is a vast epic of battles and warlords, the bloody historical backdrop against which those earlier, small-scale stories would have taken place.Kurosawa himself was now in a very different phase in his career. He keeps the camera back from the action, a cold and objective eye. His however is still very much a cinema based around movement, rhythm and tone. Take the opening shots over which the credits are played, picture-postcard tableaux of horsemen, the occasional turn of a head or flick of a tail the only thing to tell these are not stills. Set to the haunting whistle of a Japanese reed flute, it's a perfectionist evocation of the calm before the storm. Throughout the picture staging, pacing, colour and sound are all precisely tuned to the needs of the scene. Often a shot will be held for longer than strictly necessary purely for the sake of rhythmic balance (Kurosawa did his own editing). But it's not all about aesthetics. Some of the artier looking shots also serve to give the story more depth, such as the attention-grabbing close-up of the helmet when Kaede seduces Jiro, which visually corresponds to Hidetora's grass \"crown\" in the following scene, the comparison between the two reminding us how great the shift in power has been.The acting in Ran is as much a matter of stylisation as the direction. Taking inspiration from Noh (a Japanese theatre tradition comparable to opera) lead man Tatsuya Nakadai makes exaggerated gesture of even the most normal action, for example wiping his fingers clean with military snap after signing the document that relinquishes his power. It's not a realistic or emotive way of performing but it fits in with the tone of the whole piece. And as with a stage production, the focus here is much more on figures than faces. Of the other cast members Mieko Harada is particularly good as Lady Kaede. She has a wonderful wavering voice like one of the reed flutes prevalent in the score, and is deeply expressive. It's great fun to see the exuberant stage performer Peter playing the fool, and also Hitoshi Ueki (Lord Fujimaki), a popular comic actor who seems to me like a Japanese Clive Swift.For all its stylistic precision, Ran can make for difficult viewing, not because of its length or cultural barriers, but because of its utter bleakness. It is not just in scope that it differs from the Kurosawa pictures of previous decades, it also foregoes the heart and humanism that made those earlier affairs so affecting. Ran is one of the most aesthetically beautiful films ever made, and is certainly a powerful commentary on the war-torn chaos of the twentieth century, but it seems slightly sad that Kurosawa has rejected making an emotional connection with his audience.",

Kurosawa was very fond of theater NO, and in some films--\"Throne of the blood\", \"Kagemusha\" and partly other jidaigeki films--he tried to use the elements of this traditional theater--slow movement of actors, sudden change of tempo,dialogue with Buddhist concept of life and death, mask-like make up of actors etc. But the most ambitious attempt of Kurosawa on this direction was in dramaturgy of \"Kagemusha\" and \"RAN\". They are twins in this sense. \"Kagemusha\"'s story--the real person and his double, who is trying to be \"real\" and in the end dies as a result of the contact of two world--this world and the world of the dead--is very similar to one genre of theater NO--Fukushiki-Mugen-NO. \"RAN\" followed the same genre but the plot is based on one of Shakespeare's tragedy. The dramaturgy of theater NO and Shakespeare's plot were miraculously mixed and made into a quite original scenario, which in fact two-layered everywhere. So in this film there are so many terms from Buddhism and Shintoism, such a slow tempo and a sudden nightmare of the hero, which brings him to the unreal world of madness.Dream invades the real world and changes it into total chaos--\"RAN\" means \"rebel\" and \"chaos\" at the same time. This deep structure may not be noticed by contemporary Japanese youth, probably will be forgotten by most of us, but it is really the artistic point which the director wanted to reach for about 40years,after he had seen theater NO at the first time---total simulation of this theater into his own cinema.",

            "content": "Wars have always dominated the history of the human species, from its early beginnings in the Stone Age up to the days of our modern civilization. An immensity of blood was spilt on the most various justifications, to extend one's own territory, for the sake of possession or maybe out of no apparent reason at all. These vile habits continued throughout the ages; they were backed by policies of bold expansionism like the ones of the Roman Empire or Colonialism, to name but a few. In our century the incessant waves of arms and armours still have not stopped breaking on the shores of mankind; wars and warriors are not exterminated yet. Only the weapons have changed: where first there were some scattered tribes who fought ferociously against each other using rather rudimentary equipment such as roughly cut bones or stones, there are now modern means of warfare, more powerful than ever, with a capability of destruction hardly to be surpassed.The film I want to comment on, \"Ran\" by Akira Kurosawa, reflects all this, the unceasing and senseless carnage of millions of people, man's fury of self-annihilation. The last scene in particular deserves attention: You can see Tsurumaru, a young blind-man, one who has suffered many atrocities, who has traversed the infernos of war and has become its only survivor, stumble along a mountain ridge towards the edge, alone, in front of a wide and open sky, impressively reddened by the sun's setting.And the spectator, still deeply touched by the violent scenes seen before, the bloodshed, the ever-present hunger for power and possession, draws his pessimistic conclusion: this is the dusk of human history; man, who did nothing to stop the move into the fatal direction, who, in his folly, even invented nuclear weapons to hasten his own destruction, is a stumbling blind-man, about to fall into a deep and sombre abyss.",

            "content": "In Medieval Japan, an elderly warlord retires, handing over his empire to his three sons. That's the opening of this masterpiece, a story so rich and each frame are simply stunning and artistic. It's my first movie from the acclaimed and legendary film maker/director Akira Kurosawa and maybe it wasn't a movie I should have started with but I've long wanted to see and experience it and I'm glad I did. The imagery is again pretty, extraordinary even. How Akira Kurosawa used paintings as storyboard is incredible and a very nice way of doing things. He also wrote the story and script ten years before filming so combine that with the paintings as storyboard we know that Ran was a passion project. The movie is based on William Shakespeare's King Lear but set in the Sengoku Period in Japan and it worked perfectly.The acting is phenomenal and feels very real and accurate to the time period, they succeed in giving a believable and dramatic performance that comes out as a perfect performance. The costume and prop department did a magnificent job at creating remarkable costumes and props that immerses you into this epic adventure that is Ran. The music is something amazing in the movie as it moves the story forward and used at emotional times. The various of sets they built was enormous, superb. With the huge amount of long shots Akira used made it look like paintings, the camera angles and such, it probably were exactly like he thought it would be.This was a very interesting experience, a movie so special but so superb. It's something I've never seen before and I'm glad I got the experience to watch this piece of art that might be Akira Kurosawa's Magnum Opus? Ran was phenomenal, strange at times but overall superb!",

            "content": "The DVD, put out by Wellspring, as The Masterworks Edition, actually offers some different features than the later two disk The Criterion Collection of the DVD. Both DVDs offer enhanced versions of the film. The Wellspring DVD still has some dirt and splotchiness, although the colors are well restored. And unlike Criterion, Wellspring uses gold subtitles, which are easier to read than the white subtitles Criterion uses. The DVD I saw has production notes, the film in a 1.85:1 aspect ratio, a restoration demonstration, and two film trailers. The chief difference lies in the commentaries. The Criterion version has only one commentary by film historian Stephen Prince, and has a documentary on Kurosawa called AK, by French filmmaker Chris Marker, as well as Toho Studios It Is Wonderful To Create series of documentaries on Kurosawa. By contrast, Wellspring has no featurettes, but a second film commentary, by film producer Peter Grilli. Grilli's commentary is flat and uninvolving, filled with sweeping generalities about film, in general, and this one specifically,; as well delivering few specifics on Ran, much less individual scenes and moments- either within the diegetic reality, or in the making of the film. It is also punctuated by several minutes long periods of silences. It begs the question of why was this person hired to do the commentary? The second commentary is also by Stephen Prince, and it is reportedly similar, but not exactly the same, as the later commentary he did for Criterion. Prince is a very hit and miss commentarian. This offering is one of his better ones. While he always trends to over-prepare and come across as bland and reading notes, this commentary is quite scene specific, and Prince seems to have loosened up a bit.Overall, the screenplay by Kurosawa, Masato Ide, and Hideo Oguni is a good one, although, as mentioned before, a better fleshing out of the characters was needed. The cinematography by Asakazu Nakai, Takao Sait\u014d, Masaharu Ueda shows that good scenery alone does not make for great cinematography. One need only look at films like Sean Penn's Into The Wild or Walter Salles' The Motorcycle Diaries to see that beautiful mountainscapes do not equal great art. Kurosawa's men, by contrast, show how framing and flattening out imagery with telephoto lenses can render reality into a sort of Japanese flat art depiction of the world. This also illustrates the superfluity and flat out wrongheadedness of most critical writing on the use of certain types of cameras or lenses to get certain effects, in this film and in general. Why? Because the flattening of images (such as in the openings ceremonial scenes in the mountains, or in certain interior ceremonial shots, especially when the frame is crowded) is not important for how it is achieved, but for what it imparts to the viewer. In these cases, the flattening of images into an almost Classical Oriental illustration makes the objects and characters in the frame seem to be closer to each other (sometimes almost on top of each other) than they really are in the internal reality of the film's narrative, which, in turn, makes the scenes seem and feel almost claustrophobic. This, then, makes the viewer feel what the characters do emotionally, as they are uneased by the internal circumstances and crowding, just as the viewer is by the external composition on screen. Thus, viewers understand the aggression on screen viscerally, cued by what amounts to a subliminal visual testosterone (think of the effect crowding has on male interactions at sporting events, or in cases of road rage). That these effects are achieved via a certain lens or camera technique are, again, far less important than what they impart into the viewer. That so few critics understand this about art, in general, and cinema, in particular, is typical of just why so much art and criticism is so bad, repetitive, and dependent upon the seeking out of artistic intent, rather than artistic effect. Why? Because intent is rather a simplistic declaration, whereas effect is a multifarious cogitation. There are also several jumpcuts in the film that depict emotional fragility of characters and moments. These all work well, and are employed so well that one often does not notice them, except subliminally, or upon rewatch. The score by T\u00f4ru Takemitsu has an otherworldly feel that really meshes beautifully with the images. It also is obviously influenced- at least emotionally- by Jerry Goldsmith's landmark score for The Planet Of The Apes.Oftentimes, when an artist has been as consistently great as Kurosawa was, his bar is set so high in expectation of ineffably great things that when one gets merely demonstrably terrific stuff from him, well, it seems wanting, although from lesser lights it would be praised sky high. Ran is a film that falls just shy of Kurosawa's greatest works, but stands leagues above the vast majority of the films we all watch. If that praise seems faint, then catch it when it falls onto you.",

All who thought that this \"old man\" didn't have it in him anymore were all proved wrong with this film that truly should be regarded as one of the best films ever made.In Ran, Kurosawa again remade one of Shakespeare's classics in a feudal Japanese setting. This time the story is Shakespeare's King Lear. Hidetora Ichimonji (Tatsuya Nakadai) is an ageing warlord who decides to divide his kingdom into three parts and pass it onto his three sons. The older two agree to this offer, but the youngest one thinks his father is mad, and doesn't realize that soon the sons will soon be fighting amongst each other for power of the kingdom. The chain of events that follow will drastically change the kingdom of Hidetora forever. Ran is one of the most captivating, beautifully filmed masterpieces since movies started to be made in color. This could quite possibly be Kurosawa's best film since The Seven Samurai was made more than 30 years earlier. Fans of great cinema should not miss Ran, a truly remarkable film on all levels.",

            "content": "Ran succeeds as one of Akira Kurosawa's legendary epics. This film is an artistic masterpiece of such beauty and grandeur, that it can put one in an immense state of awe and wonder. I'm not always one for epic scale films like this, but in the context of a master of storytelling like Kurosawa, I loved it. Ran is an almost three hour tale of political unrest in a kingdom of feudal Japan. When the patriarch of the Ichimonji family, Lord Hidetora Ichimonji, decides he wants to live out his remaining years in peace and ease, he hands over power of the kingdom to his three sons. In the vibrant opening sequence of the movie, Lord Hidetora announces this to his sons are receives mixed reactions from them. Two of the sons flatter their father and accept his request happily. The youngest of the three sons has an entirely different reaction, telling his father of the mistake he is making and how the kingdom will crumble if the powers are to be divided like this. Furious at his sons accusations, Hidetora banishes his youngest son, leaving the two older sons to rule the kingdom. However, shortly after this exchanging of power, the youngest son's grave warnings become reality, and the two older sons conspire against their father to strip everything of him, including his title as The Great Lord. From here, war ensues in an elaborate tale of greed and deceit, as political turmoil leads to some of the grandest scenes ever imagined in this gigantic scale epic.Kurosawa's career began all the way back in the 1940's, so obviously the bulk of his film career consists of black and white films. Ran, however, was shot in color, and it is some of the brightest most eccentric color I have ever seen. The film opens in the beautiful rolling hills of Japan. The grass gleams a rich green, and the sky a vibrant blue. It's the kind of beautiful landscape that would bring a tear to the more transcendentalist eye. In this opening scene we are introduced to the main characters of this film. Lord Hidetora is dressed in a pure white kimono and his three sons each wear different colored kimonos that are all equally vivid. Jiro, the violent and unpredictable one, wears a blood red kimono. Taro, the slightly less unpredictable but more naive one, wears a glowing yellow kimono. And Saburo, the fair, peaceful, yet also truthful one, wears a soft blue kimono. These colors remain consistent throughout the film as Ran prides itself in color symbolism, using it as it's most important motif throughout the entire film. The opening scene sets the stage for the pacing and style of this film. What the characters say in this scene is obvious foreshadowing for what events will take place in the movie, what the characters simply wear is an almost bigger foreshadowing of how they will each play out and develop over the grand scale of this film.Ran continues to reinforce its use of color to heighten the visual experience of this film. By the end, it's hard to decipher whether you have just watched a painting within a film, or a film within a painting. Either way, this film is a work of art not only in cinematic context, but in the context of the painters medium as well. Kurosawa is known for his ability to set up a beautifully choreographed shot for every frame of this films, but with the added use of color in Ran it gives the film credence in multiple artistic mediums. Every shot could be reconstructed into a beautiful and vibrant painting Kurosawa did something genius here, and it might display a directors greatest transition from black and white to color in the history of cinema. It's somewhat sad to see how this added level of symbolism has seemed to dwindle away now that color has become the norm. The use of color in filmmaking has switched gears, when we now have directors shooting their films in black and white for artistic effect and color for something more normal.The greatness of Ran doesn't end at its visuals though. There is a fantastic narrative within these vivid and colorful vistas. It is a very slow paced film that dwells on certain scenes for a very long time, yet never overbearingly long. The story itself is fairly complex, as would be expected from such a grand scheme of a picture, yet as long as you stay with it, it is an incredible story with a great deal of subtext and underlying themes that serve to give it an even greater purpose as a revolutionary film. With any epic film like this you'd expect it to cover a lot of proverbial and existential ground and it certainly does. We see everything from the themes of close family bonds and loyalties, to the traumatic effects of war on the human mind and soul. Ran is a dramatic tragedy of lost innocence and peace. It is a harrowing look at the destruction of family and kingdom. Yet, despite these bleak themes, it still manages to be a stunningly beautiful film. This beauty serves to drive home the emotional impact of the film, engraving some very gripping images into your mind.Ran is a story told on such an unimaginably epic scale. It's complex narrative is not for everyone, yet if you put your mind towards understanding the emotion and symbolism of this film, it becomes something so much more than your average tale, even by Akira Kurosawa's standards. The film is rich both in story and visual artistry, and the two elements blend together so splendidly. This film is immaculate and is filled with such subtle emotional nuance. It is a sweepingly beautiful painting that tells its story in an unforgettable way. Ran is a timeless classic that stands out as one of Akira Kurosawa's best.",

They sit in the fields surrounded by the King's accouterments and dine, discussing political matters, when the king announces his resignation and assignment of the throne to his eldest son, Taro (in yellow). The youngest male, Saburo (in blue), objects and is banished.As time passes, the king realizes the changing of leadership status has caused a perceived decline in respect from Taro, and small acts of false pride result in his banishment from the castle. The brings rise to evolves into a complicated political struggle from factions previously beaten into submission from the very family now feuding within itself. Suspicions are fueled by the daughter of one of these subservient clans (Kaede,) and she is a strong, wily woman with great ambition and the will to win. Taro and Jiro (in red,) stir a cauldron of debate resulting in Taro's assassination and Kaede's self professed machinations for her own ends only, with no love lost over her dead husband. She seduces Jiro, winner of the brothers' duel. Meanwhile, the old king wanders the outdoors in an up-welling of senility and despair. His face becomes increasingly white and mask-like, as if one of the living dead. His wandering fool companion (a hall mark of Shakespearean tragedy,) watches him pick flowers aimlessly and declares \"only the mad are sane.\" Like Saburo, the fool, Kyomani, lives in the same paradox of wandering homeless as a price for telling the truth.More of the ranks who fell to the Ichimonji clan are revealed: Suei and Tsurumaru, two siblings defeated by the old king. One was subjected to marriage to a royal son, and the other was blinded as a price for sparing his life. Now the old king's exploits are beginning to glow in stark relief. Now the old patriarch of peace is seen from the other side. Old Ichimonji and the fool seek refuge in Tsurumaru the blind's house. The young man has nothing of substance to offer except to play a song on the flute after he declares \"Hospitality of the heart is the only pleasure I have left.\" Even in total impoverishment, happiness is a possibility. Jiro is cajoled and prompted by Kaede to carry out her designs. She even over powers him physically to gain his compliance and to seduce him. The one who assassinated his oldest brother is spineless with this woman; this woman who tears apart the whole cabinet of trusted officials and has them all extradited.Out in the wilds, the old King \"shelters in the ruins of the castles he burned,\" as Kyomani the fool states. Manjo, a former cabinet adviser, finds the pair and persuades Kyomani that Saburo must re-connect with his father. Meanwhile, Jiro dies under Saburo's sword and outside forces seek to encroach upon castle three, Saburo's former domain. Saburo's men prevail, and Saburo finds his father in the woods, demented and run down, and tries to reconcile. They do, but the son is immediately killed by a bullet and never knows the spoils of his army's victory on castle three. The summation of the plot: the old king asks \"are there no gods?\" and Kyomani replies \"The gods weep...it is we who can't save ourselves.\" This hails back to the question in Rashoman.Kaede is killed by Jiro's former adviser, the king is buried, and I won't spoil the end for you.It is King Lear, The God Father, Death of a Salesman, and The Brothers Karamazov. Overwhelming, breath taking, holographic like a Rodin sculpture. You won't see the likes of such a film maker again.I give this a 9.",

Everyone who hears the news is outraged, and his youngest son Saburo speaks agaisnt his father, only to tell the truth nad is thus banished from the kingdom, as well as his advisable councilor Tango.His two other sons soon become corrupt with greed and power, which takes up about the first hour of the film, which is rather slow paced and filled with Shakespearean like dialogue. it sounds o.k. from here. Then, without a warning, a huge battle sequence explodes on the screen started by his two sons! The battle is depicted in a very horrific but beautful sense that shows to other war films that filmmakers don't need visual effects and blaring music to fulfill the battle.because of this betrayal, Hidetora is forced into insanity and escapes the battle alive, while is eldest Taro dies, and Jiro takes the throne of the clan. As fate comes, Tango and his court jester Kyomi, who is wonderfully portrayed by Peter; Tango leaves to find Saburo who seeking him out, who has hidden hismelf with one of the other clans.here the film jumps between the story of Hidetora and Kyomi, which swtich roles beautifully from king to fool, to fool to king, and the manipulating power of Lady Kaede who seduces Jiro leader the Ichimonji clan. the film goes on with a gradual, but necessary pace for a two hour forty minute film.it is a film of tragedy, betrayal, and the powers of greed and deception. The most magnificent thing about this film is the cinematography that shows the mood of the story very explicitly. the costumes and set-decorations are fabulous and well made, the acting is grand, the music is haunting, and the story tells us that we should not fall for our desires, but fall for the goodness in life. 5/5",

In the middle Taros wife Kaede (Mieko Harada) prays the lives of Ichimonji clans brothers like a black widow. People say, that Ran is Kurosawas adaptation of Shakespeares play King Lear. I wouldn't know that, being that I've never read it. So I'll just take their word on it.Whole plot is full of schemes and conspiracies: everyone is on everyones death list. Very deep drama mixed with bloody battle scenes. And I am not talking about Hollywood type action, but far more brutal type of action, in style of \"Saving Private Ryan\". Acting is overall very good, tough like it is always in my case, I have this small cultural shock between Japanese actors and European/American ones. But it usually quickly wears off. Good actors are good, no matter the language.Direction of the whole movie is very good and cinematography is just stunning and full of colours. All images are extremely vivid and lush. Beaty mixed with violence. A combination, which is tried by many directors, but usually in vain, but Kurosawa carries it off almost painlessly.There's also lots of scenes with lots of extras running all about. In fact it took two years to make all the costumes for this flick, so make your calculations about the amount of all the extras in the flick.All in all very stunning movie, in fact I even dare to say, RAN is one of the finest made by Kurosawa.",

Even though he went on to make three other (highly underrated) films after this, \"Ran\" stands as Kurosawa's crowning achievement, and possibly his finest film.  It moves with the assurance of an epic, yet the grace of a finely wrought personal drama.  Simply one of the finest films ever made.Although the cast is uniformly excellent, special mention must be given to the performance of Mieko Harada as Lady Kaede.  Rarely in modern film has such an evil and unsympathetic character been rendered with such an unerring pathos.  Kudos to Harada (who would have won an Oscar with this performance in an English-language film) and to Kurosawa for making this one of the indisputable cornerstones of film art.",

That we have preserved the collaboration of Kurosawa and Takemitsu, and that these two artistic geniuses handled such serious and thought-worthy material with such gravity and depth, is the incomparable good fortune of filmgoers everywhere.

            "content": "Akira Kurosawa is one of my favourite directors and William Shakespeare is my favourite writer of all time. As can be expected, combining the two creates cinematic gold. This adaptation of King Lear relocates the play to Japan a few centuries later than the play is set. A powerful war lord abdicates to his 3 sons and 2 of them turn against him and betray him. Shakespeare films rarely capture his genius, but this one does and then some. It adds depth and complexity to an already fine play, and makes the central character arguably even more compelling than he was in Shakespeare's version. It makes some changes here and there, but it doesn't feel overly different from its source material. This isn't just an adaptation of the play; it's using the play to create a sobering, fantastically powerful and completely mesmerising meditation of loyalty, chaos and war. This is absolutely incredible cinema which shows why it is one of the most successful art forms in the world. This dazzling, earth shaking masterpiece outshines not only every single other Shakespeare adaptation but all the paintings in the Lourve combined.Akira Kurosawa's direction is near perfect: The film looks unbelievable and the battle sequences are absolutely tremendous. Every single shot looks amazing and it's definitely his most beautiful film. The acting is absolutely astonishing, and there are some particularly frightening characters in this one. It also has an incredible script; it's incredibly deep, hauntingly powerful and none of the dialogue feels forced or awkward. It's a fairly slow movie, but you don't even notice it. The final shot of the movie is utterly haunting. Ran is a very powerful and thrilling movie with amazing action scenes, mind blowing acting and a brilliant story. It's so ridiculously captivating and well made 2 and a half hours disappear like nothing. Definitely one of the best foreign language movies ever and even better than the film which put Kurosawa on the map, Rashomon. Films like Romeo + Juliet and O are good, but they can't possibly hope to match this, which is actually just as good as King Lear itself. At least they actually say what happened to the fool this time.10/10",

Ran is about a great lord, Lord Ichimonji, who retires his power to his three sons. But his life of treachery begins to reap his rewards as his two oldest sons turn against him and each other. His own lust for power begets their lust of power, and ultimately, the film ends with destruction. This story is compelling and, probably because it's Shakespeare, makes it feel classic, timeless, almost like a storybook.I noticed that Kurosawa's cinematic composition is a little different here. Instead of his three dimensional composition, he chooses to frame his shots flatter. It hit me halfway through the film that this was to give it a more \"stage\"-like, proscenium kind of feel. Nevertheless, this was still a joy to watch.",

Scenes like the attack on Hideotora, the opening credits with its shots of warriors sitting quietly atop horses, or the final scene involving Lady Kaede achieve an almost operatic grandeur that shows the work of one of cinemas true craftsmen.

It was a much better adaptation than \"Thrown Of Blood\", which aside from the death scene at the end, was pretty dull and unexciting. I liked the montage sequence during the siege the most especially when the music cuts out, and the war sounds shock the movie back to action. \"Chaos\", indeed, but it is the classic chaos which we are familiar with, the story since it is derivative, can be repetitive at times, however the sheer visual depth and eye for composition present in every frame makes this a more than worthy viewing experience for anyone.",

Adapted from William Shakespeare, King Lear, the story centers around three sons, whose father decides to hand down his power and kingdom to one of his sons. After this moment, the sons are truly separated from each other by their need for hubris. Kurosawa does a excellent job with the long shot and capturing the beauty of the scene and the moment. Nature, is also another character in the film, that Kurosawa captures beautifully. At times of chaos it seems that nature responds to reveal a religious entity. By having instances of meaningful emptiness, it allows the audience to have a moments of reflection, which many other films do not offer. Also the pristine use of color in the movie really makes it a wonderful piece of art. Each brother in the movie contains their own color and when these colors clash, it reveals the essence of art. For instance, when the red and yellow sides clash, they cause an orange fire that is set in the castle, to reveal what happens when two sides merge. It may cause destruction and utter chaos. Also the music in the film really makes the film more captivating and worth watching. I highly recommend this film for its use of color, nature, and incredible camera movement.",

In a way this is certainly true, Kurosawa embraces the tragic, maybe to excess.  (The only \"happy ending\" I can think of in a Kurosawa film is Yojimbo).There is an interesting parallel though, which adds depth to Saburo's death.The snipers are an afterthought.  Jiro orders them out, then basically forgets all about them.  He is already high-tailing it to the castle when they catch up to their target (actually, I think he might be on the verge of seppuku at that point, I don't remember).This is very very similar to the burning of the peasant village earlier in the movie.  Hidetora orders a peasant village burned, for completely stupid reasons.  He is quickly talked out of it ... but nobody ever thinks to cancel the order.  Later, somebody mentions ... \"hey, do you smell something?\".  There is no further explanation of this line ... it is the peasant village, burning.  They forgot.This is Kurosawa humor, very very dark humor.Personally, I think the shooting of Saburo was intentionally a parallel to this earlier moment.  Seen that way, Hidetora is definitely getting a karma moment.His (Hidetora's) own death, I agree, is kind of just thrown in there, but if you see the link between his crimes and Saburo's death, and that Saburo's death lead to his, it makes a little more sense.Dark dark humor indeed.",

            "content": "I enjoyed this movie, but it is not nearly as good as all the hype would have you believe.  It isn't unwatchable like Gangs of New York or Thin Red Line, but having just seen it, I suggest it was subjected to the same treatment those other two films were.  Because Kurosawa made some masterpieces when he was younger, therefore when he returns to prominence with a really long movie, set in the past, about GREAT THEMES like death, loyalty, war & the human condition, the critics line up to slobber all over themselves trying out-superlative one another.Here is my complaint: GREAT THEMES do not equal GREAT FILMS.\nI mean, I got it in the first five minutes.  The king trusted the wrong sons and they were going to screw him.  Then they did.  Then all the people the king screwed over the years screwed him too.  Unlike some movie fans, I get no satisfaction knowing what's going to happen next in every flipping scene of a film.   I like surprises.  There weren't any.Part of the reason for this was the pacing.  It does not make me a shallow California moron to get bored when a movie drags.  I can dig silence.  I can dig long shots of clouds and scenery.  But there has to be tension of some kind.  There has to be something going on in the story to make me wonder what will happen next.And honestly, I think I watched the same stuntman fall off the same horse twenty times in a row, just from different angles.Somebody wrote that these were the best battle scenes he'd ever seen.  All I have to say to that is what are you smoking? Let me break it down for you:\nShot of red army captains yelling, \"Attack!\" Shots of red horsemen riding perpendicular to blue gunmen in forest (But not toward them.  No.  Why ride toward the guys you are fighting?  Better strategy to make like ducks at an arcade shooting game!) Shot of Blue army behind trees firing guns. Shot of red horseman falling off horse. Another shot of red horseman falling off horse. Another shot of red horseman falling off horse. Another shot of red horseman falling off horse. Shot of Blue army behind trees firing guns. Shot of red horseman falling off horse. Another shot of red horseman falling off horse. Another shot of red horseman falling off horse. Another shot of red horseman falling off horse.Lather, rinse repeat.Also, every character was obvious.  Nobody did anything that I didn't expect.  I didn't wonder if the wicked wife of son # 1 was wicked or not. I knew it from the moment she spoke.  When she went in to put the moves & intimidation on son # 2, I knew what she was up to.  She was cool in the way she did it, but it still didn't surprise me.  Nothing about this film surprised me.The acting was good, as were the costumes, scenery & cinematography.  I liked the bit with the fox statue.  That was okay.  And like I said, the wicked wife was pretty bad-ass.  If you like Kurosawa, check it out.  If not, let me save you three hours of stuntmen falling off horses and Don Quixote sans charm or humor clambering vacantly around rocks and fields while a gay guy in bright clothes and a Pebbles hairdo yells profound insight at him.Here is the moral:\nLife always seems unjust to those who are reaping what they sow.\nThe Gods don't screw us.  We screw ourseleves.War is bad.There.  Now you don't need to see the movie.  Rent Seven Samurai instead. So much better, and since it's in black and white, you won't have to be annoyed with a lot of pink blood.",

Filled with bloody massacres and an equally gory resolution (with Kaede getting her head sliced off, which Kurosawa doesn't actually show, but it's evident thanks to that nasty blood spray on the wall), RAN may not be a completely whole- some film for the whole family, but hey, it's Shakespeare, a poet who specializes in tragic, belligerent stories.

This is the best Shakespearean story adapted to the screen.\nThe characters are complex and their motivations are deep. The story is also sad. I got easily lost in this world and when I saw certain character arcs, I was in near tears.\nThis movie is worth watching just for its costume and set design (which it won an Academy Award for). Kurosawa uses the vast plains to his advantage in the framing of the landscape. You can admire something in every shot.\nCharacters act in a very human way. You can easily put yourself in his/her's position and feel their decision justified. This film is underrated in the sense of a human story. This movie is an epic of gargantuan proportions.\nIt's amazing to think now that Kurosawa couldn't get funding for this movie.

            "content": "Akira Kurosawa is among the most respected directors and writers of posrt-WW2 Japan with many of his films been consider as classics and Ran, which in Japanese means chaos is one of them and one of his last work. What I like is the fact that Mr. Kurosawa took inspiration of one of Shakespeare plays, King Lear to be precise and fused it with a historical figure of that era the daimy\u014d M\u014dri Motonari, but the main plot is more or less the same with King's Lear.So during the Warring State Period of Japan we meet Hidetora Ichimonji a elderly warlord who seen that he is at the end of his life he gather his three sons and divides the area among them but he with retain the title of Lord. For that his youngest son ,Saburo fiercely disagrees with that plan and tells it immediately to his father that his plan is flawed. But Hidetora has none of it and banish him and gives the first castle to his eldest son Taro and the rest two to his second, Jiro. And as it is obvious by the inspiration of king Lear the two brothers treat their father poorly to a point he is reduce to a beggar!And at the same time Jiro seems to overthrow his brother, while Saburo with his allies later master a big army in order to pressure the rest two Ichimonji to take Father under his protection. In the end all of the House of Ichimonji is dead, their main castle is soon to be destroyed and the once prosperous realm is in ruins.Now to the characters for some of them are quit intrigue. I will start with the Ichimonji and then analyses some of their peripheral allies and antagonists. For starter Hiderota while he at first is in peace, he can't see that the brutal method which he used in order to take power have left a lot of grudges against his house and that his sons aren't as united as things. As for his first-born he is an oaf under the control of his wife Lady Kaede, whose castle was the now First castle and in the process her whole family was murdered in the night of her wedding (I guess the George R.R. Martin may took some inspirations) and she has one goal: to stay in her castle and keep it all cost, so she forces Taro to banish his Father and later after Taro is secretly assassinated by a trusted man of is brother Jiro during the siege of their Father's men in the abandoned Third castle, so to look like normal, she seduces Jiro.As for Jiro he is the Petyr Baelish family and he makes plans to take down his brother for him to be the next ruler of the clan, from this actions he seems to be angry that though smarter and better leader from his older brother he never got the recognition he deserved ,but when he becomes the ruler after his brother death he is practically a pawn against Kaede,who is leagues more manipulating than him and in the end she is one of the reasons the Ichimonji fell. As for Saburo he is blunt but not mean ,headstrong but not an idiot, in general he should be the next ruler, but it wasn't meet to be. For closing it will writer about my favorite secondary character,the right hand man of Jiro,Kurogane, although he has the dirty job for his lord ,he is totally realistic and when war is up on them, he is the only person who wants to find a solution with a peaceful way and also the only who see that his lord is \"under the spells\" of the recent widow of his brother.As for the fighting, is fast, devastating and 100% historically accurate. What I loved is the impact of the early firearm arquebus has for it kills two of the brothers ,Taro in a way to hide a treason and Saburo to deprive him of his victory. Also during the decisive battle of the dominion of the Ichimonji's state the firearm ,turn the table on the bigger Jiro's army who uses just mass attack of infantry and chavarly , but Saburo's troops, dag in the woods and every time the larger army comes to them is slaughtered. This is also true for the period, the introduction of firearms during the second half of the Waring period changed the way Wars were won and lost. Kurosaga intentionally shows firearm like that to make parallels with the atom bomb, the War changed and everyone who didn't not follow then new rules can't survive.All in all is an epic of a film, which though a bit slow it worth your time and gives plenty food for though and analyses of the psychology, war and the hobbesian world of that treason and violence create.",

            "content": "Ran is one of the best pieces of Japanese cinema. As an adaptation of Shakespeare's King Lear, it truly fascinated me. Akita Kurosawa directs Ran with the brilliance of modern realism and Japanese theatre with the additions of an epic story. It begins with a king separating his kingdom between his three sons. Two of them accept his offer, whereas one declines, insulting his powerful father and being banished from the kingdom. One could already guess the events that unfold after are not good. The first two sons both struggle with the responsibility of power, as the old king struggles with the lack of it.Ran truly exploits the tyranny of power and the lust and greed for it. As a great war epic, it embodies the longer takes as moments of reflection that are very much needed for the deeper drama of the story. The deep focus is something that is taken advantage of in every shot. Kurosawa models the downfall of a ruthless king and his only talent of killing and greed. The one thing that I truly admired about this film was the vibrant colors. Kurosawa is very expressionistic with the color in the film. Each son has a particular color to represent as their own. Also, the use of white on characters expresses evil, which is something that is usually expressed as the opposite. The red vibrance of the blood in the battle scenes is something to admire. Growing up watching war films like Saving Private Ryan and Braveheart, color isn't something you see a lot of. I really admired that polar opposite that I witnessed in this film.The last thing I'm going to touch is Kurosawa's use of nature as a whole character. Each scene appreciates nature which is something that is deeply integrated into the Japanese culture. I loved Ran and hope to achieve it's success as a filmmaker myself.",

            "content": "I think one of the more prominent aspects of this movie is the treatment of death and some major changes. Before death and some turning points, there was no preparatory work, but this thing happened naturally in a seemingly flat tile. . For example, the protagonist's sudden death, before this, there was not even any sign. Sometimes life and change are like this. Shaking people's hearts in peace is the power of real substitution. Although some deaths and accidents were sudden, they were calm. However, this does not mean that the film lacks a close-knit, but that his close-knit is more reflected in the changes in the relationship between the characters in some events. Death is also very dramatic, but his dramatic treatment of death is unconventional. Death should be a relatively important node in our previous drama concept, and it is also a more vigorous and tragic thing in our life concept, but when we return to life, death often occurs, not as we have agreed in the past. Roaring accompanied by tragic and accompanied by all predictable foreshadowing, death and even other things as usual, just a certain event, he may have a huge impact different from other things, but before and during and After it happened, it might not be like the fanfare we imagined. This conflict between the abnormal planning and treatment of the dramatic state and the previous mass perceptions has caused very large psychological and logical effects. Everyone saw the passing of a life in a tile, and suddenly, despite the calm, it contained a stronger force than the hustle and bustle, the sudden death of Xiuhu, the sudden death of the three sons, all these issues were handled in this way, It makes people feel impermanence in the absence of God. However, in order to avoid the tiredness caused by this sudden tiling process, Kurosawa adopted exaggerated colors and stage effects to deal with colors, and the form and content were highly rebelliously merged, becoming a classic of film and television.",

            "content": "Kurosawa's last epic and the most expensive Japanese film of its time, \"Ran\" is the result of a master of his craft firing on a cylinders. Whilst my favourite of his work still remains \"Ikiru\" (1952), there is no doubt \"Ran\" is his masterpiece. The colours and level of detail the director went for is jaw dropping, spending 10 years storyboarding the film as paintings, even mourning the death of his wife for one day before returning to shooting the next. Kurosawa's ambitions and mad dedication pours out of every frame, and the results is one of those unforgettable \"landmark\" movies that can easily be considered among the greatest ever made.As we all know the man particularly excels at Shakespeare such as \"Throne of Blood\" (A \"Macbeth\" adaptation from 1957), \"Ran\" is based on the legends of the daimyo M\u014dri Motonari, as well as the tragedy \"King Lear\". Set in the Sengoku-era, Tatsuya Nakadai stars as Hidetora Ichimonji, an ageing warlord who decides to retire and separate the land between his three sons. Unfortunately the news does not bode well among the siblings, leading to events and betrayal that will leave the whole kingdom in jeopardy.I've said it before in my review of \"Kagemusha\" (1980), the colours of a Kurosawa movie are unmatched in their \"saturated\", watercolour like quality. And a particular silent battle scene speaks volumes when you see light pouring out the darkest of clouds, and the crimson red blood stain every wall. The theme of Nihilism is ever present, and obviously Kurosawa was more known for favouring Humanism among his work (There are a few brief glimpses in this tragedy that do show signs of redemption). But I think the ambitions of each individual is perfectly represented, with all their greed leading to their eventual demise.Tatsuya Nakadi stars in his last collaboration with this director, and his performance as the warlord descending into insanity is believable every step of the way. Though I'm not all to familiar with it, the film has been noted for its reminiscence of Japanese \"Noh\" theatre, and an extensive use of wardrobe for its 1000+ extras (The movie won an Academy award for its costumes). The dialogue driven story is fantastic, and the camera-work has that look about it that remains effortless.Final Verdict: I've praised this film enough, and I cannot think of any faults or shortcomings whatsoever. I hope you see it and become overwhelmed at its beauty, or at least its scope and efforts broaden your horizons. 10/10.",

            "content": "Ran is a movie I have wanted to see for a long time, and, after seeing it, I feel privileged. It is a grand achievement for Kurosawa, and a wonderful film.As the movie unfolds, it is spectacularly easy to identify with each character - even the more malicious ones (this does the job of making one care about the good and despise the bad all that much more easily). Each character says what needs to be said to get the right thing across, and no more. The movie seems to be made gently, and with great care. And it's something that works, in every single shot of the movie.\nOne thing I love about Kurosawa films is how simple, but how effective the cinematography is. I cant help but mention it here. Compared to overdone and all-too-mobile camerawork in movies like Gladiator, Ran's camerawork is simplicity defined. For the most part, it simply sits there, as a casual observer. It doesn't move all that much, but that just means that, when it does, its all the more important. The way the camera moves in and out throughout scenes truly do enhance the movie, and give it even more life. Kurosawa truly was a master at using the camera to enhance the story, rather then just show it.Yes, the performances are excellent. The sets and costumes are incredibly beautiful. The battle scenes are epic and have influenced many a director, I am sure. The tale is grand, epic, and amazingly well translated to the movie screen. But there's more to Ran then just that. It's just an absolutely stunning motion picture. It jumps out of the screen, and is full of life. And it's so much better than just about any other Shakespeare play adapted to the film screen (especially the overly pretentious \"Titus\") by Hollywood. Ran is a movie that needs to be seen. It's also a fitting exclamation point (he made other films, but this is his last \"big\" one) to the career of one of the greatest filmmakers to ever live.",

Compared to Kurosawa's early work in Seven Samurai with the wonderful characters or the stunning photography in one of my favorite films, Kagemusha, this film is just dull. It misses completely on the tragedy side since the characters are never really developed and much of the film looks like it was shot in a bowl of a volcano with dirt and dust everywhere. The comic relief of Kyoami, the jester/fool, is just whiny and annoying. When the great lord finally reaches the end of his wits his deep comments on life just seem silly. He is too stilted too play the \"mad\" role properly and all the long shots and very heavy make up leave little opportunity for facial expression.

            "content": "Kurosawa likes to adapt Shakespeare's plays, and most of his films are also few main characters. Fierce conflicts, simple and fixed scenes, consistent with the uniform structure, have their own characteristics.\nIn this movie, the characters are still simple. Xiuhu and his three sons, Xiuhu passed the command to his eldest son. The three sons were bluntly ousted by him. His home country was in chaos and he was also displaced. Taro and Jiro killed each other. After picking up his father, Xiuhu recognized his mistakes, but unfortunately he was in an ambush, and Xiuhu also died in anger.\nBut in this simple story, Kurosawa was able to shoot ups and downs, and it was exciting. This is also a consistent feature of his movies. The plot is often not complicated, but the director can make people worry and curious about how to progress. Perhaps this is inseparable from the characters 'distinctive personalities, that is, the characters are all It's very brilliant, so the plot retreats to the second place at this time, the director's creation of the atmosphere, and the character's Huacai performance at the gate, attract more audiences.\nKurosawa said that this movie was filmed with the attitude of overlooking the beings in the sky, so there are almost no close-ups and few close-ups.\nThe protagonist of this film is undoubtedly Xiu Hu, who is a lifelike interpretation of Zhong Dai Da Ya. He is not only a sullen general, but also a loving old father. From arbitrariness to despair, the character changes during it are very convincing and crazy. After that, fluttering white hair, angry eyes, sad eyes, and the strong wind blowing the shirt from time to time, revealing his thighs that were too late to wear pants for escape, are all so sad-the impermanence of the world, From the top to the bottom, the disillusionment is undoubtedly unfolding.\nThe two women inside were also very striking. Both wives were destroyed by Xiuhu and their father and brother died, but they chose different paths. The wife of Taro, A Feng, retaliated, instigated Taro, then seduce Erlang, and finally the brothers murdered each other. She was also slaughtered, but she died without regret, rather willing to destroy the city, her determination and viciousness were shocking. In Kurosawa's \"Spider's Nest City\", there is also such a lady. Even if she is scheming or short-sighted, she finally sends her husband back, and it is also a vicious lady who is cruel and murderous. This lady had similarities with A Feng, the director at that time also meant to blame the character's failure on the shortsightedness and greed of the woman, but when she came to A Feng, she gave a more reasonable explanation, namely It's not that women are insidious by nature, but that there is a reason for it, and that there is excuse, A Feng is shaped into the role of the goddess of revenge.\nThe other Mrs. Mo, who was devoted to the Buddha, was very helpless about Xiuhu 's slaughter city in the past, and Xiuhu was very helpless about this. She said that if you are bad for me, I will be in a better mood, but Mrs. Mo is not at all with him Careful, recite the Buddha every day, and still remember to carry the portrait of Buddha on the way to escape. When was the grievance reported? With a gesture of evasion and forgiveness, Madam Mor gave another solution to the hatred.\nIn the end, the family of Xiuhu's family collapsed, only Mrs. Mo's brother Hemaru, the blind man was still alive. He was using the blind stick to explore the road on the ruins of his former home city, and almost fell into the abyss. Perhaps it is a kind of metaphor. All living beings are just like blind people. They cannot see the way forward. If they lose the heart of Buddha and compassion, the abyss is in front.\nProbably only such a tragedy can be filmed in the mood of overlooking the whole life in the sky. Otherwise, how could you bear to reveal the truth to the public so naked, Lu Xun said that the people in the iron house are actually afraid of such a tragic, but someone must wake up the people in that room. The bitter fruit that Xiu Hu finally tasted was originally planted by him. Even if there is a son who is reliable, he finally cannot withstand the retribution of karma. Looking back on life, is it a success or a failure? Is it gain or lose? The crazy Xiuhu muttered to himself, who I am, when he finally realized that he was small, it was too late.\nCang Tian looked at the fighting between humans, and it was only a pity. The choice must be made by human beings.",

Greed and power consume many of the characters including two of his children. The Great Warlord in his attempt to step down, attempted to give his power to his eldest son and live out the rest of his life with his children. His youngest son Sabaro didn't agree with this and didn't trust his brothers ability to be loyal. The Warlord picks the children who are more willing to show there affection and his downfall starts there.Although slow and drawn out in many scenes Kurosawa does an amazing job showing the size of the battles. The choice to have no music during the Castle raid brought me closer to the battle. Hidetora losing his mind in the tower, and being subject to the barrage of arrows and bullets was one of the most captivating scenes i've ever watched. My favorite character Hidetora's nurse, constantly told the truth.

Within the first few minutes itself the entire story will become clear to you. Kurosawa's mastery is seen in how the story progresses involving many characters and each playing a specific part. Lord Hidetora is ageing and he decides to give control of his kingdom to his eldest son. What follows next is a powerful display of human nature mingled with treachery, war skill, decision making, loyalty and many more. Keeping the main story on the top all the time it allows the viewer to think about the question of good or bad. Lord Hidetora's past was filled with slaughter and suffering to people and it comes back to him making the viewer wonder whether to sympathize with him or not. The film takes inspiration from the Shakespeare's king Lear. The acting from Tatsuya Nakadai (Hidetora) was spellbinding. Majority of his work was done by his scary eyes which depicted his inability to do anything when he understood that the fall of his empire was imminent. His face with all that whiteness of exasperation speaks things which no one after watching the film can ever forget. There is active participation of the supporting casts including the women (who influenced the story greatly) who might be the king's associate but were free to speak. It is the most expensive film Kurosawa had made and speaks for itself. The beautiful landscapes, the costumes, the palaces, the army scenes all shout for their achievements individually. It felt like everyone in the family had a grunt over something and wanted to be a part of it. The brothers had no affection at all for each of them. It would be nice to have a prequel to this story to see how these characters developed in the past. MESSAGE: \"Circle of life.\"VERDICT: \"A must watch\"",

Nonetheless, the loyal son gets banished and the other two sons wreck havoc on their lives as well as the lives of their allies and family members.

I had heard the name \"Kurosawa\" before and as a filmmaker to-be, I was very interested. But I had never seen any of his films.Well, to cut a long story short, I was sitting in the Egyptian theatre with my father during the evening the next day. And it was brilliant. It had humor, it had drama, it had heart-wrenchingly detailed and exceedingly horrifying scenes of epic violence. This is truly the work of a genius, and when one takes into consideration that the widower Kurosawa was almost blind and 75 when he made RAN we cannot help but bow down to the mighty power of Japan's premier filmmaker.The story of King Lear set into Feudal Japanese times, RAN takes a leap in all terms. It has three-dimensional characters, unpredictable plot twists, highly meticulous scene setups and brilliant dialogue. For fear of giving anything away, I won't say much more.

Kurosawa brilliantly frames each shot as a painting, staging actors often in the foreground of amazing sets and backdrops.The battle scenes are epically staged as Kurosawa shows logistical prowess as the geography and thematic elements of the battle scenes are easy to follow. Nothing is left out and it is all laid out in a clear and concise way. Cinematically, the battles are the culmination of Kurosawa's directorial career. Bright red blood stains the ground it flows on and the skill of the samurai is well illustrated.Like all Shakespeare works, the story is set in a world of heightened reality. The acting is turned up to 110% and the plot is pure melodrama. There could have been 15-20 minutes shaved off as the film loses a lot of momentum near the middle point, but that would also take away from the amazing performances from Tatsuya Nakadai and Mieko Harada.\"Ran\" is a masterwork from a master director.

I come back to this film every few years, and each time it impresses me more. LOTR may have bested it for grand battles, but such are only a means, not an end, in RAN.Superficially, RAN is a King Lear story about a Japanese warlord who abdicates his throne and is betrayed by his elder sons after sending his true youngest son into exile. His dream to visit each son in turn and stay over a few days at the \"in-law addition\" to the family castles is thwarted when his sons want to usurp every last bit of his power and the whole clan goes down in war.In reality, RAN is about female power. And manipulation. Power manipulation. Sexual manipulation. Manipulation for revenge. The Supreme Manipulator is Lady Kaede. The battles are just her chess games. The sons are just numbers - literally, their names mean \"First,\" \"Second,\" and \"Third\"-born. The fate of Hidetora Ichimonji, our King Lear, is not sealed when he trusts his elder sons and sends his true youngest son into exile at the beginning of the film. It was sealed long before the film started, when he massacred Lady Kaede's family in front of her eyes, and then forced the unspeakable on her: marrying her to his eldest son as a spoil of war. Little did he understand how much more cunning than he she is. How much more patient. How much more manipulative. Seemingly peaceful years pass with Hidetora watching his kingdom prosper, but the tree has already been severed at the roots.When Lady Kaede is finally beheaded at the end of the film, it is too late. Lady Kaede's most dangerous body part is gone: the brain that plots, the mouth that whispers destruction into her husbands ears. Her plans have already come to full fruition, and the destruction of her family is avenged by the complete destruction of Hidetora's. Who is to say that she is more evil than Hidetora or his sons? Has she done more unto them than Hidetora did to her? Did she ever wield anything but her tongue, while powerless men kill and rampage with their swords?RAN is surely Kurosawa's greatest opus, and his last. The Twelve Samurai and the Hidden Fortress are fine films, but ultimately just sophisticated action films. RAN is a film of color, of symbolism that is powerful but never in-your-face, of emancipation, and of revenge served oh so very cold.",

            "content": "It's widely known that this film is based on Shakespeare's King Lear, and in its execution is stacks up just as well as the original. The story is in this case that of a warlord in Feudal Japan, stepping down from his position and dividing his kingdom between his 3 sons....what ensues is chaos.Whilst some of the original plot points are reversed, I.e - instead of 3 daughters, there are 3 sons, the story does retain some original Shakespearean components. The one that stands out to me is that of the warlords \"fool\". It's not something you would see in Japanese courts, but was very much part and parcel of medieval Europe. The Fool though does play a crucial role, in often speaking to and observing truths that key characters do not often notice.Story and plot structure aside, the colour palette is stunning, and the cinematography is beautiful. The scale of some of the sets are just spectacular, with gorgeous costumes and set design giving the whole movie an authentic dramatic feel. My favourite parts were the scenes involving horses / cavalry, the number of extras were in the thousands, not a CGI soldier in sight...I very nearly gave this film a 9, but in some moments it is so dramatic and theatrical, with long drawn out silences that is slows the flow of the film. I understand it's to build suspense and focus on poignant moments, but it doesn't always deliver....Not a film to watch everyday, but it is a work of art, and should be viewed as such.",

            "content": "\"Ran\" is a poignant epic based on Shakespeare's King Lear. Many call it one of the best (if not the best) Shakespeare film adaptations, and while I haven't seen enough Shakespeare films to say for sure, it's hard to see any other one topping this one.The film begins on huge rolling hills, where Lord Hidetora has gathered his acquaintances and his three sons. He blacks out, and suddenly he decides he will choose his successor right there. He picks his oldest son, Taro. Taro and the middle son, Jiro, suck up to their father by saying they will serve him loyally until his death. The youngest son, Sabaro, knows exactly what is going on. He calls them out on it. Then Lord Hidetora decides he will give power to all three of his sons, but Sabaro once again sees flaws in this. He knows the three brothers will not get along. He is banished, since Hidetora needs everyone to be loyal and follow him blindly, rather than taking criticism when he needs to.This causes a slow downward spiral. Taro is convinced by his wife, whose family was killed and village was burned by Hidetora, to force his father to give him complete power, but he is clearly not cut out for being a King. He already can't control his soldiers. Hidetora leaves the kingdom and while he is gone, Tango Hiragana, one of his advisers, comes to him with gifts given from peasants. Hidetora is told that the samurai never accepts charity, so he orders the peasants dead, but he finds out from Tango that those peasants were told by Taro to never send food to Hidetora, or else they will die. These people were pushing away Taro and asking for Hidetora back, but he just killed them. Tango suggests Hidetora should put Sabaro as king, but Hidetora didn't want the truth. He now has no where. Hidetora is told that Tango is just trying to stir up trouble between his family and take the throne for himself. He pretends that he did nothing wrong, but this causes his downfall. Both Taro and Jiro betray him and invade the castle at the same time, in an incredibly violent and intense scene. Not only have Hidetoras sons betrayed him, but all of his loyal followers have died in front of his face and it was his fault. Despite nearly dying many times, and arrows and gunfire flying all around him, Hidetora comes out alive, and what follows is his punishment, his personal hell. He confronts all of his past atrocities, such as a boy whose family he killed, and eyes torn out. The wreckage of a palace he burnt to the ground. But the two most truthful people in the film, aside from Sabaro, Lady Kaede, his loyal jester whom he saves earlier in the film (part of what shows Hidetora has the potential to be a good person, since she jokes about his foolishness frequently), and Tango. They look for Sabaro. Meanwhile, his son Jiro, who killed his other son that was taking the throne, is sitting atop the throne, but he is being controlled by his brothers widow, who is now his wife. She threatens him and then she controls him by earning his trust. Jiro isn't strong enough to be a leader of his own, so he succumbs to blind loyalty to his new \"wife\". Sabaro confronts Jiro, and this is where Jiros downfall begins. He is told by many that he shouldn't start a war with Sabaro, and he tells Sabaro he won't, yet he stabs him in the back the first chance he gets. He attacks, but Sabaro has a plan. There are men in the woods firing guns at the oncoming attackers, and despite Jiros orders, which they don't want to follow since he didn't truly earn their trust, the men retreat. Jiros wife reveals that she was just trying to get revenge for her family, and she did it. Then she is killed. Sabaro then reunites with Hidetora, and Hidetora at first can't forgive himself and doesn't think Sabaro will forgive him, but he comes to his senses and seems completely changed, and he essentially had redeemed himself. All he cares about anymore is Sabaro. Then Sabaro is killed by one of Jiros soldiers. Lady Kaede blames the gods who she worshiped, but the true blame is on man. As one soldier states, the gods try to make things right, but man has to always go and make things worse. We have an obsession with violence and our rulers will always continue to kill and kill, until the rational ones die and the cycle repeats itself. Then we get a poignant shot of Tsurumaru, the kid who had his eyes torn out, dropping a portrait of Buddha as he stands atop a mountain, showing how humans themselves deny justice from the gods and truly control things. And the good will always go out with a whimper, not a bang. They don't get to go out as valiant soldiers.",

            "content": "On the surface, this is an epic. Well it is actually an epic to a certain extent, which probably explains the surprising popularity of this movie, considering the average modern viewer's lack of interest for artistic ambition in movies.But below the surface... This is so clever it took me almost 20 years to really get it. The first time I saw \"Ran\", it was in 1986... I was 25. I saw an epic. Got impressed with the imagery, got bored with the narrative style. Since then, my tastes have vastly changed (dare I say \"improved\"? ;-)), so have my inclinations towards cinema in general, and the way I approach artistic works. That's life. I would probably have loved LOTR when I was 20 *LOL*!I'm usually not at all into this kind of movies. Even if I admire to a certain extent Kurosawa's skills and good intentions, I generally still get bored with his movies, even after all this time spent in discovering artistic cinema, because to my sense they're basically Theatre, not Cinema, just (very) cleverly recorded for the big screen. Theatrical acting, theatrical scenery, theatrical dramatic construction. And as I don't like that much the conventions and mannerisms of Theatre (matter of cultural background), most of Kurosawa's movies (despite their quite obvious qualities, like outstanding artistic framing, use of space, pace, atmosphere...) fail to interest me but on a mere intellectual level. In short, I find them too artificial to my taste (like many \"intellectual\" french movies btw).But \"Ran\" is a winner. Because in this movie, this theatrical approach pays, like it does -but much less IMO- in \"Dersu Uzala\". And it pays sooo much! The acting/scenery theatrical conventions - some being inherited from NO - fit the story perfectly, allowing the attentive viewer to catch each and every single subtlety of the narrative, giving life to archetypes instead of stereotypes, and offers the rare possibility to consider things from dramatically different points of view. It's artificial and intellectually constructed, sure, but this very characteristic, against all odds, gives birth to an emotional ballet, a poetic power that is quite rare in the movie industry. And the humor! It's an incredibly daring (and very dark) humor, always on the verge of artistic suicide... Kubrick is capable of such humor sometimes (I suspect there is a lot of hidden cynical humor in \"Eyes\" - maybe I'll get it in another 10 years? *LOL*). Chen Kaige tried to use some similar humoristic twists in the very derivative (but nevertheless enjoyable) \"Jing ke ci qin wang\", but the result is far from being on par with Ran's wicked, cruel, over-cynical humor. Shakespeare would probably be very proud of this. My opinion, of course.The visuals are astounding, and help me to remember the difference between art/style and artifice/mannerism (the latter being the norm in most of modern blockbusters' cinematography, like in \"LOTR\" - over-idealized, over-clean, iconic, synthetic, demagogic, manipulative).  Kurosawa (I think) basically built on the \"Barry Lyndon\" approach and took it to a whole new level. Very, very impressive. The beauty and the power of these images.Sure, it requires attention, patience, receptivity, and sure it's not easy to get over some surprisingly bad moves (like awkward, almost laughable battle movements) but it's well worth it. Below the \"epic\" surface, this is a demanding, challenging movie to understand (many great movies are, like \"2001\" or \"Lost Highway\", which explains the fact that such masterpieces sadly don't get the deserved recognition in their times but only after a fair amount of time), but the rewarding is proportional to the efforts the viewer accepts to make. Oh of course, if you're on the \"movies-are-made-to-entertain-and-they're-crap-if-they-don't\" side, just forget it, and wait until you're grown up a little. Just like I did.In short, \"Ran\" is quite an outstanding audiovisual and emotional trip. It may take time for one's taste to adjust, depending on one's previous experience in reading books and viewing movies (it took me about 18 years to come back to this movie with an open mind..!), and it may take time to reveal its hidden treasures, but I repeat myself: It's weeeeeeell worth it.",

            "content": "I came to this without having seen much except earlier Kurosawa (I seem to be exploring Japanese cinema in the opposite direction to most people, finishing up with Kurosawa) and was surprised by many elements. I didn't expect it to be so theatrical, even down to the make-up which seemed more theatrical than usual for naturalistic cinema. I do wonder if maybe Kurosawa in his later period was sensitive to Japanese criticisms that he was too 'western' in his technique, and wanted to give it more of a Japanese feel - or perhaps he was deliberately paying tribute to the theatrical origin of the story, rather than the usual film technique of attempting to 'open out' and naturalize adopted plays.I found this theatricality sometimes a problem - shots are often from afar, and no attempt whatever is given to providing the characters with back stories. I found this provided a disconnect for me - i never really felt any empathy for the characters. So much of the dialogue was in the form of soliloquy rather than natural conversation. Judging from my further reading about the movie, the subtitles do not adequately translate the subtlety of the original Japanese script, which i understand was in a deliberately archaic and poetic style - impossible to translate properly. Perhaps this is one of those rare movies where a dubbed version would be better than subtitled - a skillful scriptwriter may have been able to come up with an appropriate and distinct language and tone for the characters.Those concerns aside, this is certainly a great movie, epic in scope and with a huge emotional impact. While some criticize the running time, i feel it is perfect, I was never bored. His pacing is perfect, bringing the pace up slowly but inexorably to the great battle scene (very well rendered, its rare that battles are filmed in such a manner that allows tactics to be so apparent to the viewer), up to the devastating final scenes. While the final metaphor may be a little heavy handed, it is immensely powerful.",

I tell you, this is rare since most movies are either too cerebral (not a bad thing) or too bombastic (sometimes not a bad thing). The battle sequences are very, very nicely done, and the characters are so tragic. Seeing someone like Hidetora falling downhill into a crazed, senile old man has never been so much fun. All sorts of characters appear in a form of double crossers, weaklings, manipulators, fools, honourable warriors, tragic victims, heroes... they're all here. Its easy to get convoluted in its plot, dialogue and visual scenes and say \"oh Ran is about betrayal\" or \"Ran speaks on the horror of war.\" Look closely, and you'll see that Kurosawa uses the whole film to point out that mankind are foolish and questions our ability to change, even though we are aware of it (Ikiru shares this subtle parallelism on theme).

            "content": "Ran is in my opinion Kurosawas most epic films in the mammoth scale of what it tries to tackle. All in one it is a crushing film trying to display the hopenlessness of humanity; the hypocrisy of hierarchy, the lack of morality within our societal structures, the greed and lust for power. Religion gets thrown in, and it's an anti-war film all in one. You might not take it all in, you don't need to, you take what you want from it and no more. It's impossible to sum it all up in one review, and impossible to grasp all in one viewing.Kurosawa is most definitely a genius with a camera that's for sure, although i've heard this film described as 'clunky'. I'd definitely put it under vibrant, very colourful and the shots throughout are exquisite. Tatsuya Nakadai puts in one of the best performances of all time, and his portrayal of suffering and almost the loss of soul is impeccable, and some of the shots of him are unforgettable. The cogs are kept turning by the spontaneity of the whole thing, each step assuredly moving us one rung up the ladder, but without revealing the exact locale of the next.The film is definitely a film of segments; we start out with the merciless lord Hidetora out boar hunting with his three sons, and two rival clan faction leaders. Hidetora is old and falls asleep after the hunt. He dreams a crushing dream - almost a prophetic dream - of himself walking aimlessly in a field with no voice able to hear him; lonely. The inevitable outcome of his ruthless life, and his bad karma perhaps, would be his own downfall. He was blind to everything around him but his own power. So although notably shook up, he hastily forgets about it.His three sons are of very different characters, and he gives the head status of his clan to his eldest son, and thus also the land to his eldest son. The youngest son is forth rite in his words and proclaims he must be senile if he thinks power of such magnitude can be passed on so easily; without any bad feeling, even amongst brothers, and as such he is exiled. His father was so blind to all around him that he couldn't accept he could be wrong, and furthermore took it as a threat.The second stage of the film is when the soul crushing venture really begins as the naivety of Lord Hidetoya's decisions bear fruition, war soon breaks out, and he is completely stripped bear, and the fall of himself and all around him slowly commences. It's the beginning of his humbling in position to put it lightly.If there is one thing this film certainly is, it is anti-war. The main real focus on war is the sheer hypocrisy and irony which surrounds it. That doesn't mean to say that there aren't epic battles because there sure are, but there is something more mystical and poignant in them far beyond a grandiose scope of a battle.Hidetoya's closest companion ends up being the fool, whom says to the mighty Lord \"A bird traded it's speckled and dirty egg for that of the pristine white egg of a snake\" \"The white egg hatched, and the baby snake ate the bird\" \u00a0Beauty definitely isn't on the outside, it's on the inside, and this is said at Hidetoya's most humbling of moments. The man once adorned in his white and golden robes, he whom thought of himself as closest to the gods, and would have ruled as a complete dictator, had a complete role reversal with a man whom was living his life out making a fool of himself for others entertainment. His outer grandiose state no longer meant anything when when removed from his pedestal.",

Thank you for your art Kurosawa, you're amazing!",

The colors, the composition, the imagery, the symbolism and the movement are all choreographed to touch our hearts, minds and imaginations. And they all come together this way because of director, Kurosawa.This is one of the most breathtakingly visual films that I have ever seen. I'm not sure TV sets ill do it justice, with all of the color and contrast controls.The movie deals with classic plot devices like greed, power, loyalty and love. To be sure, it was adapted (so I've read) from William Shakespeare's KING LEAR. If so, then it was a brilliant adaptation, because, even just visually, the story works.I would highly recommend this movie.",

            "content": "I'd like to say, firstly, that I don't generally trust \"visually stunning\" films.  There are a lot of movies that rely on grand special effects, bright lights, and tricksy cinematography to dazzle us past the fact that in the words of Gertrude Stein, \"There's no 'there' there.\"  (Or as David Mamet put it: \"But what is it in aid of?\") Ridley Scott, for instance, you can have.  Granted, his movies look spiffing, but a fog machine doth not a catharsis make.Kurosawa's visuals, of course, are famous, and often imitated, and here and there in his films he has fallen somewhat into the same trap-- but only here and there.  Not so in \"Ran.\"\"Ran\" may be the closest thing to pure poetry I have seen on the screen-- you can almost hear the cadences of the recitation.  I don't trust spectacle, but in \"Ran\" the spectacle is informed with wrenching emotion, and a terrifying weight-- it's the only great tragedy of the screen, the only one that lets you feel the size of tragedy.  For once visuals are not just a magic show or window dressing-- in the absence of Shakespeare's language we have Kurosawa's images, and it is no small thing to say in the light of this that \"Ran\" is the greatest Shakespearean adaptation for the screen.  Why this should be I don't know, but perhaps it took an old man-- Kurosawa, his sight failing, entering the realm of darkness, with a heavy disillusionment with the world to give force to his age, to get at the heart of Shakespeare's play: a mammoth, brooding anger at the sins of the world.Shakespeare, luckily, got through this period to a craggy sense of redemption in his final plays.  It's a pity Kurosawa never got to \"The Tempest.\"",

It's kind of Japanese version of \"King Lear.\" Even though it is based on \"King Lear\" story, this movie approaches me very Japanese style. What I mean is, it follows buddism and rewards in accordance with deeds in our life by showing chaotic battles and betrayal.By watching this movie, it reminds me 'What comes around, what goes around.' Once you betray someone, you would be betrayed. In this movie battle scenes are splendid. I think Kurosawa shooted very unique way that shows well by using wide camera angle that capture both armies. In this movie, Hidetora's make up is too much overdone and I guess it's because influence of Japanese traditional play called \"Kabuki\" Development of movie takes long time form scene to the other scene, so it can be a little bit bored to watch but it's interesting to see how it does reflect our life.",

            "content": "Inspired by King Lear, Akira Kurosawa created with this, maybe the most complex and dramatic film of his career, and there's a LOT to choose from. Technically speaking, this was the last great Epic to be made. The scale is massive. Not just because of the huge battle scenes in the end, but mostly because of how massive the story was. There are more than a dozen prominent characters, and within the 2:40, every character is properly developed, and each is very distinct. Tatsuya Nakadai, who plays Hidetora, gives one of the most powerful acting performances I've ever seen. Every second he's on screen, even when he's passed out sleeping, he has your complete attention. But luckily because of the great character development that Kurosawa gave us, each character is equally important to the overall story.\nThere are so many fascinating and intelligent themes played throughout. Most interesting being the theme of loyalty and betrayal. Ultimately that's what the whole film is about. Strangely enough, the themes of loyalty and betrayal are represented best by the characters of Kurogane and The Jester. They have minor parts compared to Hideotora's family, but their actions and the lines they say best sum up the point of this movie. And this is a very deep, heavy, dramatic, fascinating movie. While it's quite a depressing story, and you can't help but feel depressed for ALL the characters, Kurosawa balances the heaviness with jaw dropping visuals. The script is poetic, moving, powerful, and just plain enjoyable. I first saw RAN on a day when I was bored and very exhausted. That didn't prevent me from getting more involved than I have with any movie in years. I couldn't take my eyes off the screen at any moment. When the whole movie was finished, I literally leaned back and took a deep breath. One question I have though. With Decades of experience, was Akira Kurosawa, the most flawless and polished Director who ever lived, LUCKY when he got those incredible shots of soldiers marching while the shadow of the sun and clouds followed behind them? If you see the movie, you'll notice. My favourite line in any Kurosawa movie comes from RAN,\"Man is born Crying. When he's cried enough, he dies.\"That line was spoked by.......... The Jester.",

The movie is dark, and seems to be without hope, but it is not Kurosawa with a doomsday message.  There is no message, nor an attempt to disillusion.  It is a movie that makes the viewer think and reflect, and consider who we are and how we act, and why we live. Supporting the content is the visual orgasm of colors, composition, and motion.  There are few movies that attempt to stretch the limits of film and human creativity, but Ran breaks past those barriers.  Such are the creations of not men, but truly elevated artists.

Kurosawa has a taste for Shakespeare, retelling much of his works in his films.The spectacle is overwhelming, with long, drawn-out battles with flowing, colorful flags and lots of blood. The battles rage a little too long for my liking, and take the story away. The film is very long and tends to drag, with some of the dialogue adding to the plodding pace.The story revolves around a warlord and his sons who vie for power, resulting in much bloodshed and strife. There is a jester who adds comic relief, and his wild antics are quite the bizarre contrast to the otherwise serious tone of the film.Kurosawa fans should watch this, but alone it is not the most impressive story, even as a retelling of Shakespeare.

Why this movie receives the blind praise it does is something I will never understand. How can a movie this bad be considered one of Kurosawa's best?

Indoor and outdoor it sprays onto any available surface.  Unfortunately the color of the blood is just a bit to watery and not dark enough, or maybe the color was off on the tape I watched.  The battle scenes are intense and spectacular, except the sequence of one of the warriors falling off a horse and getting stepped on as a group rides by is replayed several times.\tOther than lots and lots and lots of stage blood this film does have a good plot and strong characters.  The plot is based on King Lear, but I\u00d5m not sure how closely.  Also someone finally broke the bundle of sticks. (You know how in every youth group this situation arises.  You each get a twig and break it then you put all your twigs together and the idea is you can\u00d5t break them.  The moral is teamwork=good  Yuck!)  Just for the scene where the son breaks the bundle of arrows this is an excellent movie.

            "content": "If a person only sees one Kurosawa film in his/her lifetime, or just one foreign movie in general, it should be none other than 'Ran'. It begins with warriors on horseback, watching the endless terrain for intruders. Haunting music plays in background, and one knows they are in for something special. No artificial light is used, which suggests a sense of realism most people aren't used to. The film is shot from an observational angle, letting the viewer make judgments about what is going on on the screen.  An epic in every sense of the word, 'Ran' is the story of a Lord dividing his territory between his three sons. Ignoring the warning of his youngest son, Saburo, the Lord exiles him. Before he realizes what he has done, his oldest son turns against his father. What happens next will be nothing but chaos, just as the title suggests.  The struggle for territorial domination turns even the brothers against each other, as they alienate their own father. 'Ran' has some of the most beautiful battle sequences ever filmed. One would think that watching dozens of being brutally slaughtered couldn't be beautiful, but one has to see this movie to believe it.  Throughout the movie, shots of clouds are shown.  Many people will think they are unnecessary, but as one watches the film more, they will realize the clouds represent the change of mood in story.  In the beginning, they are beautiful and white, later on, they are dark and muddy. 'Ran' has also one of the most mischievous female characters created, Lady Kaede. The story is based on King Lear, but I'm willing to bet Kurosawa got the inspiration of Lady Kaede from Lady Macbeth. This woman will do anything and everything to have her way; putting on a false face and tears, sleep with her husband's brother, and order the death of an innocent woman. In the end, things get very bloody and a little confusing.  It is a little difficult to tell who is doing what to who. Nonetheless, the final scene is hair-raising and unforgettable.  Kurosawa is crying out, to either God or humanity, to save humanity from its endless cycle of killing and destruction.",

Lady Kaede is certainly a great role and she throws herself into it completely.  As for the film itself, Kurosawa's epic story manages to survive the film's overly long running time and preoccupation with stage blood. It's worth the price of rental just to watch Harada's Lady Kaede bully, seduce, and out-wit her male counterparts.  A truly great performance.",

The expression of the blood was very interesting; it seemed very fake (compared to the movies nowadays), but it still had a great effect to the audience with the bright red color. He also used the color to almost distinguish the sons in the movies; yellow, red, and blue. While watching, I thought Kurosawa expressed himself in couple different characters; one would be Hidetora, who is so majestic in the beginning in the movie but eventually referred as an old senile fool who can't even take care of himself. It seems as though he represented his career throughout the years, and how he must have felt throughout the years. Especially, when he expressed how pathetic Heditora felt when he couldn't even kill himself; just as how he tried to commit suicide but he fails. This film was a representation, from my point of view, of his career, as well as his life before he produced the film.",

It was almost overwhelming for me at times as I was trying to keep up with all the various character names and motivations. The photography was so lush and colorful as well, probably the best-looking Kurosawa film I've seen to date. Then again, this is the first one I've seen in color. The framing of shots, the scope and scale, all of it was just so.....magnificent. I love huge epics like this which have so much to them in regards to subject matter; this one deals with loyalty, family, and the bloodthirsty nature of war, among other things, and in the sort of poetic way that would make Shakespeare proud. The battle sequences are stunning and somehow manage to be beautiful and brutal at the same time because of the way they're filmed and the use of music. The score is very haunting; I thought it was used best in the big battle scene towards the middle of the film which causes Hidetora to go mad. I was even smiling during it because the execution was so breathtaking; the type that makes your eyes widen. And the opening set the mood extremely well; I knew from that point on I was watching a film that would instantly become a favorite. I'm glad I blind-bought it, because I will definitely be seeing it more than once.",

The running time is really long: 2 hour 40 minutes, however, I am always mesmerized by the film and forget such long running time. Tatsuya Nakadai's strong presence as the protagonist, sharp eyes like a beast, and his act which follow to Kabuki draw my attention; moreover, the scenes of Japanese Samurais' wars are represented courageously and beautifully by the Kurosawa's grand directions. Furthermore, it is possible to say that Kurosawa represents his ideas about god and death. Especially, at the last scene, a Buddha picture falls off instead of Tsurumaru. I think that Kurosawa represents the same thing with what Tango says; Tsurumaru can \"choose\" his way, alive or death, after the scene, and the picture of Buddha does nothing to him and just fall down from the top of the wall. That is to say, it is possible to argue that Tsurumaru is the metaphor of people who could choose disturbance or peace, and the Buddha represents the useless gods that cannot save people as Tango says. By the way, as a Japanese speaker, I am disappointed at the English subtitle a little bit because it breaks the presence of the Kurosawa's script which expressed in Japanese sometimes. For example, \"Old age is difficult (Aware, oitari)\" Surely, the meaning of this line is correct and exactly; however, I think the English subtitle does not have the power of the words which represented in Japanese.",

It is a story about what should have been a simple family feud, but because of the position of the family in question in the Japanese hierarchy many thousands of people have to die senseless deaths.  It's especially significant to note that, like in almost every war in human history, the leaders who were responsible for the carnage do not die until the very end.  It is an incredible relief to finally see them die, and perhaps that is the only element of the ending that makes it a rather \"happy\" one.  It's difficult not to feel sorry for them when it happens, yet it is the most satisfying feeling knowing that had they been killed much earlier, then so many innocent people would have been spared.  The scene that symbolizes this theme best is that of the fallen emperor as he walks away untouched from a battle, in which everyone, including all of his best warriors, and his wives, is killed.  They all die because of a decision he made, yet he is the only one who survives - what a wonderful, and true to life, irony it is.This is quite likely the best war film ever made, matched only by Hoffman's \"Deluge\" and Chen Kaige's \"Emperor & The Assassin\", although neither of these other two films made such a powerful philosophical statement.  It is Kurosawa's greatest work, and far more mature and interesting than any of his previous work.  \"Seven Samurai\" was fun, and most popular amongst american audiences, but hardly his best film, even \"Hidden Fortress\" was more cinematically interesting.  \"Ran\" is simply magnificent.

In his way he is as brutal as his brothers although he is respectful and sincere to his father. The progression follows a terrible logic: greed leads to violence which leads to greater violence until it destroys everyone (all the main characters and most of the rest).Regarding the technical aspects, the film is just GORGEOUS to watch: the cinematography, dresses, sets, locations... everything is astounding. And the music by great master Toru Takemitsu, though for the most part it's just unearthly noises made by woodwinds, strings and percussion, gets a deep, restrained, Mahlerian poignancy during the attack on the castle (compare it to Mahler's The Song of the Earth, final movement).(**Attention: BIG spoiler**) But the very best part of the film is also its very worst: the ending, with the poor blind guy abandoned (her sister just been killed) on the edge of an immense cliff, surrounded by emptiness and with just his stick between him and the most probable death... it's just more than I can stand.

Another masterpiece from Kurosawa, while I didn't enjoy it as much as another one of his Shakespearian adaptations, Thrown of Blood, it's still up there with his best films. Another stunning film, it's a sharp contrast to his earlier black and white films with stark, gritty cinematography. Ran is shot in colour with lots of bright reds, yellows and blue's to help give the film a unique, artistic look, more of an achievement when you consider that Kurosawa was almost completely blind when he directed it.

The wide camera shots have a feeling of pomp and grandiloquence and are very beautiful.  Kurosawa truly had an eye for this.  The acting was, for the most part, superb, if not a little overdramatic.  It fits the story well, though.However, I found myself squirming unsteadily in my seat for 160 minutes. Many parts of the movie were slow, even for me; it's comparable to a story line of Dragonball Z, where a story that should only take about a week to finish is stretched over many episodes.

Instead of taking the story of King Lear and focusing on the central character as that title does, Kurosawa has chosen to name his film after its setting: a world of chaos unleashed by the pride and ignorance of a former warlord. Discovering what it is to be human, while hurtling around in a universe without rules or borders, is a theme that Kurosawa loved.  You can find it most accessibly in Andrei Konchalovsky's film Runaway Train, based on a Kurosawa screenplay.  The strength that evil has, if we allow it; the futility of so many things in which people believe; the redeeming power of love: these meant as much to Shakespeare in King Lear as they do to Kurosawa in Ran. Yet there is great beauty here - most of it associated with the pomp and circumstance of battling armies, and most of it belied by the violence they do.  The background, the universe in which Lord Hidemoto scuttles like a proud, crippled, spider, is blank; brown and grey in colour, but bereft of landmark. Just as, after Shakespeare's Act I, Lear never sets foot in a building; just as Ahab and Ishmael, having left Nantucket, never set foot upon land; so Hidemoto is cast out into darkness. Music, costume, cast, battle action: so good it's hard to remember you're watching a foreign film. This is film-making at its grandest and most universal.  Thank the bold Frenchman, Serge Silberman, who financed it when nobody else would, for one of the great films by one of the great directors.",

In a \"train wreck\" film, the situation is obviously headed straight into disaster and the audience wants to scream to the characters to get off the tracks (whatever happens to serve as the metaphorical tracks in their situations) and prevent a catastrophe. A \"train wreck\" film is not like Roger Ebert's Idiot Plot example, where the film would be over and all problems solved if everyone involved wasn't an idiot. The characters in RAN are not idiots. They make bad decisions, and decisions that seemed good but are subverted and manipulated by malicious men and women, and when things go to hell they do become crazed and non-lucid. But the Lord had good intentions, forgetting what sort of travel route good intentions are used to construct.RAN understands also that film characters, like most real human beings, are a mix of good and evil. The three sons make bad decisions and end up destroying each other, but they also realize how horrible their actions are and regret them (only not enough to stop the train wreck from happening). Lady Kaede is as close to 100% evil as I've seen at the movies, yet even she is acting not as a stereotypical harridan, but as a subtle manipulator whose avenue for creating destruction is opened up by other forces. Metaphors could be drawn from RAN to a lot of modern-day situations where different factions battle for a lot of reasons, and paramount among them is the inability to see a word where they're NOT battling.The combat scenes in this movie are stunning, and have been well-described elsewhere; suffice it to say that BRAVEHEART and GLADIATOR owe their Best Picture Oscars to the choreography of costuming, editing, cinematography, and fake blood (lots of it) here, to say nothing of SAVING PRIVATE RYAN. RAN is an incredible film, and it's not always fun to watch, but it's unforgettable in its poetry of a great family reduced to savagery.",

The ones that try to be powerful and are too sure to reach success, as the brigands in the \"Seven Samurai\" or the Takeda clan officials in \"Kagemusha\" will fail and will end as villains or fools. On the other hand, the poors show to survive as in the case of the fool jester of Ran, that, even if he was considered mad, in a madden world without value, will result, after the cloud were drifted away, the real winner. Even without an armour and a castle. Or, still better, without a wicked Lady ready to lick his wounds not to relieve but to soak blood. As can be seen in a breathtaking scene of fight and subsequent passion between Kaede and Jiro.The real fool and poor ones.

I'd never seen it before, but because the name \"Kurosawa\" was on this it, my expectations were sky high.  Well, I was not disappointed.As you are surely aware by now, Ran is a Kurosawa's adaptation of King Lear, transferred to medieval Japan.  An aging warlord named Hidetora attempts to leave his kingdom to his three sons and enjoy a happy retirement.  Things immediately go awry.  The youngest son Saburo, a brash, outspoken youth, challenges his father's decision, saying in so many words that the father had trained the sons too well.  Raised to imitate their amoral butcher of a father, they would ultimately turn on him.  This incensed Hidetora, who banished Saburo (along with a close advisor who dared speak up in agreement with young Sab) and went through with the plan.Unfortunately, Saburo turns out to be right and the film proceeds to show the tragedy of Hidetora's decision.  Not only do Hidetora's sons turn against him, his entire family has enemies who've been waiting years to avenge themselves against them for Hidetora's past brutal conquests.Ran has the feel of a great Shakespearean tragedy.  Many of the scenes could have been stage sets, or perhaps more accurately opera.  Note the bright colors and lavish costumes set in contrast with the bleak storyline, the bigger than life emotions, the extremity of loyalty and betrayal, and the cataclysmic finale, all very reminiscent of a tragic opera.  I was left emotionally drained by the time it was all over.Visually, Ran is stunning.  I mentioned the exceptional use of color and costumes already.  But the shots of the landscapes, sky, and castles are likewise incredible.  The characters often make reference to the gods and in Kurosawa's nature shots, you almost get the impression that they are close by, gathering to watch these sad happenings.Additionally, Ran features the best - I repeat, THE BEST - battle scenes I have ever witnessed.  The music, choreography, and cinematography combine to create two major battles so incredible I think I could just sit there and watch them in a loop for hours on end.  The only problem with them (and one of the few weaknesses of the film in general) is the overuse of buckets of blood, much of which looks fake.The acting was wonderful, especially Mieko Harada who stole the show as the ultra-manipulative Lady Kaede.  Tatsuya Nakadai was also great as the animated Lord Hidetora.There's an awful lot that could be written about this film, but with limited space, I'll leave it with this: watch this film, preferably on the big screen.  FYI: Rumor has it that the DVD of Ran is complete garbage, so do your due diligence before buying.",

The environments, both inside and outside are magnificent. It's really a class production.A minor thing that bugged me a bit was that 'King Lear' character looks a bit like a character out of a cheap Hong Kong kung fu flick, I'm not sure what the idea was with the hair/beard/sideburns. Also, some scenes felt a bit drawn out, but perhaps that's just my more modern sensibilities.It's not my favorite Kurosawa movie by any means but it's well worth watching.7.5/10.",

            "content": "Ran (Chaos) by Kurosawa was very captivating in many ways. I loved how he deliberately paced the movie and it wasn't stagnant. It was heavy on tragedy and right from the beginning, there would be an inevitable chaos in the land between the brothers. This movie inspired by King Lear had an interesting twist in the end, where it was vague but it had a glimmer of hope in the end. When tragedy struck and what seems like a tragedy story, there was light at the end of the tunnel. I especially admired the battle scene, how Kurosawa concentrated on the background point of view rather than directly on the action. When the warriors got off their horses, the camera was pointing at the ground where they would be pummeled by the charging horses of the Jiro. I thought the death of Saburo was tragedy especially when he found his father in the end and that was a highlight moment. Saburo was able to forgive his father and reunite with him to share that intangible moment. I thought the end would have the father taking back his kingdom but all the brothers end up dying including the father. In a way, it was a glorious revolution even though things went horrible. The destruction of the first castle was a turning point to a new and hopeful future. The dominion of darkness was taken down and I am guessing things would probably be better off without the corruption and the evil desires of world dominations by the brothers except Saburo. I enjoyed the movie overall, it was good war movie and it was quite enjoyable to watch and got my attention all the way through the end.",

But this filmed showed that the saying \"blood is thicker than water\" isn't always true. A woman was able to turn brothers against each other and allow the greed to end all of their lives. In this film nature had a dramatic role and added life to it. It was beautiful to see the bright colors and the beautiful scenery of the grasslands and green hills. Also enjoyed how the director foreshadows upcoming events, such as the scene of the sky with the moving clouds. Another great scene that was tragic but somewhat comical is when Lord Hidetora Ichimonjiis tries to kill himself during the castle attack scene and ever attempt goes unaccomplished. He sees a sword, picks it up, and to his surprise it doesn't have a blade. Another scene is when numerous arrows are being shot into the castle, and every single on of them misses Lord Hidetora Ichimonjiis. But Lord Hidetora Ichimonjiis appearance, the pale face and white hair gave the film the kabuki theater affect. Very good film, highly recommend.",

It is an incredibly creative update of Shakespeare's \"King Lear\" that takes place in a war-ridden Japanese culture.  Instead of the King bequeathing his castles and lands to his three \"loving\" daughters who then marry horribly corrupt husbands, Akira Kurosawa has the Japanese King bequeath his castles and lands to three \"loving\" sons who then marry corrupt harpy wives.The most beautiful aspect of the film is the fantastic imagery in which Kurosawa delights so zealously.  The opening war scene of Spielberg's \"Saving Private Ryan\" seems to have been lifted directly from Kurosawa's \"Ran\" wherein a horrorifically blugeoning war seems to be taking place in a dream-like state.  Kurosawa also has spectacularly vibrant colours so as to use them to vividly punctuate every aspect of the film.To produce Shakespeare alone is an amazing feat; but to be able to interpret Shakespeare via the ancient Japanese culture is pure brilliance.  This is one of Akira Kurosawa's definitive films and that which will keep him alive for generations to come.",

Especially, I was moved by Tatsuya Nakadai, who played Hidetora, and Mieko Harada, who played Kaede. Mr. Nakadai could express both mental agony and madness of his role. In addition, Ms.Harada's act was very terrible in the scene that Kaede frightened Jiro after Taro was killed. Finally, the film sets were excellent such as many kinds of weapons and castles. By the sets, the scenes of the battle and a castle,which burned fiercely, were impressive. Thus, I would like to recommend \"Ran\" to the people, who like to watch movies!!",

I would definitely describe this as an epic. The characters are so well developed and I care about them all, including the minor ones.One thing I found interesting was how the minor characters supported the plot and ideas presented. I don't think I have ever seen this done to the same extent as in this movie.****Possible Plot Spoilers****The plot in this movie flows very well. It starts off with a calm setting and premise. Then things quickly take a change for the worse after Lord Hidetora relinquishes his power over the lands to his three sons.The dark side of human nature, as well as the good side are presented in such a compelling way that it just draws you in and never lets you go. The major characters have interesting twists to their personalities and behaviors. I was definitely caught off guard by this at first. But the twists make sense as the movie progresses. You start to realize that they are very human in that greed and power takes over their once rational, caring selves. Not every character is like that, just like in real life and that is what makes the character/plot development outstanding.The one thing that sticks out as a negative in this movie were some of the battle scenes. However these weak moments were so brief and quickly give way to excellent scenes of battle.****End Possible Plot Spoilers****If you are into an epic movie, with beautiful scenery & costumes, an intriguing plot and unforgettable characters, you must see this movie!",

Never sure whether to like or hate anyone, want to feel sorry for Lord Hidetora but never quite can, but eventually do, because he's a human being. Both battle scenes are breathtaking, in completely different ways.  The first was so sorrowful and awful and the second just unfathomable, just not possible, there there in front of you,  and in the end, both are equally pointless, needless, horrible in their destruction, yet sorrowfully just. It's amazing that a film that runs for 160 minutes and is only happy for the first five can have the bottom fall out of it so heart-wrenchingly at the end.  That after so much time wandering through such an unhappy world can take what little hope, what little joy, may be left, and snatch it away so breathlessly and finally.   To be a part of this world so long and to be left so empty is just an astonishing thing to me. I recommend making it a two-night event, and having something dutiful to do with your hands while you watch, especially the second night.

Stunning at least.

The third son uses his knee to snap the bundle of three arrows, exposing the wishful thinking of his father's lesson. What ensues is an epic film of human ambition, cruelty, and suffering.The cinematography switches between sweeping vistas of grasslands, to the inner chamber of castles, to pitched battles.

            "content": "The movie begins with a wild boar trying in vain to escape in wilderness from its hunters. The rest of the movie is about one of its hunters, an old warlord, fleeing from his own title-hungry sons. This warlord makes a bad judgment when he divides his territory between his two disloyal sons and denounces the third (and the youngest) son for his pungent and straightforward talk about this decision. Very soon, the old warlord recognizes his folly when, first his eldest son and then his second son, asks him to surrender his title and submit to their authority. The desire to be the sole in-command has made these two each other's enemy too. The result is bloodshed and gore. The old man is driven to insanity by his sons' atrocities, the loss of his loyal soldiers and wives and also the phantoms of his own cruelty in his victorious past. The youngest son comes to his rescue in the end, but he too is ambushed by his elder brother. In the end, none is left of the family and the beneficiaries are other smaller warlords, who stood on the sidelines and made their final move when the only remaining son was weakened and surrounded. \nThe movie is punctuated with great performances, grand war scenes, ruthless bloodshed, beauty of Japanese wilderness and above all, director Akira Kurosawa's knack for perfection. He excels in his strong depiction of various themes of the movie such as humanity wasted by war, wretchedness of old-age guilt, insensitive desire for revenge and efforts to overcome hatred through religion (Buddhism). The movie is in Japanese, yet the translated subtitles convey the message with great intensity. The message of the movie is loud and clear: \u0091Gods can not save us (men) from ourselves'. The inevitability and consequences of power struggles and resulting wars make this movie an eternal contemporary.\nVerdict: The movie publicity literature claims this movie to be Kurosawa's \u0091personal pick'. After watching this almost 3 hours long epic, I don't find that claim difficult to accept. The only downside is that the movie, at times, appears too long.",

Visually stunning the colors and scenery make this movie a must see just based on that.  Then you throw in Kurosawa's adeptation of Shakespeare and this movie is a can't miss for any movie fan.  The 2 battle scenes are amazing to watch.  They had me on the edge of my seat.   This movie is very long.  I did not think I would be able to watch it all in one night but once I started I couldn't stop.   I was not bored except for 1 time.  This was when Lord Hidetora went crazy in the desert, though it is needed for the story, I found it a bit on the boring side (the blind guy was a nice twist).  Another plus to this masterpiece was the exceptional acting especially Tatsuya Nakadai(Lord Hidetora) and Mieko Harada(lady Kaede). The Lady Kaede character was played brilliantly.  A back stabbing b**** who was out to be number 1 no matter what she had to do to accomplish this.  All in all this movie was a 10 for me!",

I think that the most amazing scene was when the son first attacked the father. The Father was sitting up in his room and he was trying to die but could not get hit by an arrow. Even though they were flying everywhere around him, and they were on fire. And then he tried to commit suicide but he could not find a sword that wasn't broken. And to have all of the men with dozens of arrows stuck in them was very gruesome. I thought this was awesome and really set the standard for future war directors. I also thought that the women in this women are portrayed with lots of power and almost superior to the men. I think that this was really amazing because you don't often see this happening in film. Especially in Japanese cinema. All in all this movie is amazing and I would recommend it to anyone who loves war movies.",

            "content": "The German artist Caspar David Friedrich once said that \"The painter should paint not only what he has in front of him, but also what he sees inside himself.\" That is exactly what Director Akira Kurosawa has done with Ran. The story of a 70 year old warlord in feudal Japan who hastily decided's to split his thrown into three and leave it to his sons. Kurosawa was 76 when he directed this film, and shares many similarities with the central character Hidetora. The eldest Taro receives the first castle and becomes leader of the Ichimonji clan. The other sons Jiro, and Saburo are given castle's two and three. As I'm sure you can imagine things start to rapidly go downhill as Taro and Jiro's motives are soon shown crystal clear. Their greed is ultimately what led to chaos sinking its blooded teeth into the land. And soon Saburo who is cast out by his father raises an army in the hopes of securing peace across Japan. One excellent thing I noticed in this film is the subtle foreshadowing implemented into many scenes. There's an early scene where Saburo (who I initially thought would be the bad egg) insults two of Hidetora's subjects. After he's embarrassed his family the brothers get up and leave, but not before Saburo cuts down some bushes and uses them as shade for his sleeping father. That tiny detail cements his love and respect for Hidetora. The central theme to this film is 'chaos'. The word Ran even means chaos. And there's lots of intelligent scenes which foreshadow the oncoming mayhem. Such as short cuts of clouds ever growing larger until they've become uncontrollable storms. I really cannot say enough good things about this film. But this review has stretched on, so I'll leave it with this. Ran, is without a doubt the best Shakespeare adaptation ever put to screen, and in my personal opinion the greatest Kurosawa film there is.",

I was only able to watch it on video and I'm longing to see it on the big screen to fully appreciate Akira Kurosawa's ultimate statement about war. It's not only the masterly directed battle-scenes (which are among the best of all time, that is for sure) that make this film one the best war-epics, along with \"Lawrence of Arabia\" or \"All quiet on the western front\". It is Kurosawa's whole treatment of this complex adaption of Shakespeare's \"King Lear\": He reflects on the reasons of war, how longtime allies become enemies, how the victims split up in those who forgive and those who revenge and about the innocent, who pay in a war the highest price of all. All these elements are carefully developed and Kurosawa takes a lot of time to unfold his story. And to all, who think this movie needs to much time until something interesting happens: stay at least until the first battle. You'll see, everything that seemed boring or not interesting will work out perfectly and add up to one of the greatest movies of all time.",

            "content": "As arrows and bullets sail through the air, the white clouds in the sky give way to an approaching storm of despair. The mistakes of a father have come to torment him, and while it is arguable rather or not he should be considered a hero, it is unquestionable that his life has become a tragedy worthy of our pity.Akira Kurosawa's Ran is an adaptation of William Shakespeare's King Lear. It is the story of Lord Hidetora Ichimonji, who has decided in his elder years, to relinquish leadership of his clan to one of his three sons. As King Lear did before him, he judges his sons too quickly, and makes the first wrong decision amongst many, each costing him more dearly than the last.Hidetora is a memorable character, not only on account of his torment, but also through his portrayal by actor Tatsuya Nakadai. The movie has subtitles, but they are unneeded in understanding the emotions of the character, as they are displayed with such strength they shatter the language barrier. When Hidetora feels something, it is often difficult to find yourself not feeling the same.In fact, it would be difficult to look down upon the performances of any of the actors in the movie. Every character, from the three sons to the various servants, is shown in such a manner that you learn to love or hate them. If a character is shown on the screen for even a few minutes, it is unlikely you will be left with a neutral opinion of them.It is simple to see the planning placed into this film, as every element is handled exceptionally well. The costumes and musical score are elaborate and fit well into the frame of this epic movie. The humor is limited, as it should be, and is incorporated at the right times, serving to make the movie all the more enjoyable. Akira Kurosawa's artistic direction makes even the clouds an important element of the film. They not only serve to show the passage of time, but also reflect the mood of the scenes.This movie might not be for everyone. It does show some age, not every scene is packed with action or comedy, and it does require the reading of subtitles. Nonetheless, if you are a fan of Japanese cinema, or even if you are not, you owe it to yourself to give this movie a chance.Highly recommended. A solid ten out of ten.",

However, the setting has been transferred to feudal Japan, and the themes updated somewhat by Kurosawa. The result is a reinterpretation that needs no understanding of the original play, and is on its own one of the great artistic masterpieces of film in the 1980's.The image from this movie that stays with most people, I think, is a clear comment of the world surrounding Kurosawa in the decade of Star Wars (the Reagan program) and the invasion of Afghanistan (by the USSR). The most lasting image of this movie points to a world on the brink of apocalypse, and Kurosawa uses his cinematic techniques to bring a story of feudal Japan into the modern world, and it contains messages still relevant in our current time (with the revival of Star Wars and the new invasion of Afghanistan - among other countries - it is clear that we are not too far from the world of the 80's).This movie can convey an artistic point that is still relevant through it's oblique interaction with the modern world, and aside from that, it is a great work of art.",

The medium shots he used lasted about 3 seconds while all the long/far away shots lasted 1 minute to 1 1/2 minutes. All of the battle scenes were shot with a long lens.

This also helped the foreshadowing such as clouds and rain present at various parts of the film to imply the coming of a battle or a big event. Betrayal and the pursuit of power are the main recurring ideas. The battles between brothers for the place of the old father built into a non-ending killing of each other.

After several dozen more viewings along with more experience in Japanese cinema (reading of, viewing and commentaries), this has become my favorite film of all time.Understanding the presentation is crucial to admiring this work: how Kurosawa used elements of Shakespearian drama, Japanese History and the ancient Noh theater style to form a coherent surreal experience. Kurosawa also felt that silent films had a visual quality that had been neglected with the advent of sound, so he even throws in the element of that in the films most famous scene!What I originally thought of as bad makeup was not what it seemed at all. Kurosawa based the characters appearences on the masks used in the Noh tradition. Hidetora in the beginning is styled after an evil spirit, but after insanity has set in, the styles takes the form of a tormented soul condemned to wander the earth eternally.The acting various from stage theatricality to subtle but intense minimalism. Tatsuya Nakadai gives an over the top theatrical Shakespearian performance, while at the other end of the spectrum is pure Noh by Mieko Harada as Lady Kaede, devestating evil with the baresting amount of physical movement or facial expression. While the burning of the third castle is spectacular, the quiet moments are just as gripping. My personal favorites are the scenes with Kaede, Jiro and a brilliant Hisashi Igawa as Kurogane.True, \"Ran\" may not be for everyone, but for those with an open mind and a bit of patience, whole worlds of meaning and rivetting drama will unfold before you.",

However, all concerns vanished once the film started.All at once a tale about devotion, betrayal, war and most of all, family, Kurosawa's take on the story is epic yet intimate, all at once an outlook on three warring nations as well a look at the nature of sibling hood and fatherhood, of families broken, and of vengeance. Fantastic performances by the actors (including a deceptively incendiary performance by Mieko Harada as Lady Kaede) only add more to the film.From the opening credits to the tragic finale (after all, this is a tragedy), the film is captivating.

It is she who gives her blind brother Tsurumaru the image of Amida he lets fall in what may well be (to me at least) the most beautiful ending ever.

Hidetora (Tatsuya Nakadai) abdicates from his position of power, relinquishing complete control to his eldest son, Taro (Akira Tarao), to the pleasure of the middle son, Jiro (Jinpachi Nezu), and to the chagrin on his youngest, Saburo (Daisuke Ryu). This decision casts into motion the entire slimy plot of scheming actors \u2014 I must imagine that Ran served as one of George R.R. Martin's many inspirations for GoT. Hidetora's health and visage begin deteriorating once he realizes the effects of what he's done \u2014 he eventually doesn't look much better than an afflicted King Th\u00e9oden. There is a lot of Hidetora wandering the countryside, oftentimes with his jester, Kyoami (Peter), which gives me one of my few criticisms of the film. At 162 minutes, some of this could've been cut. The film is filled with visually stunning scenes, most notably Saburo's cavalry crossing the river, Ayabe's (Jun Tazaki) contingent high on the hill, and the castle engulfed in flames. Kurosawa gives us some solid battle scenes \u2014 it is astounding how these actors really fell from their horses and bounced off the ground \u2014 but I have to admit I was disappointed we never got the armies really engaging each other in hand-to-hand, katana-clashing combat. Ran is a must-see for anyone who enjoys a blood-covered epic. I'm comfortable giving it one point less than Seven Samurai.",

The other Kurosawa films I've seen have your usual cinematic rather than theater-style acting. The acting in Ran takes me out of the movie a lot. Tatsuya Nakadai seems to spend most of the movie bug-eyed and slack-jawed while 'Peter' just seems like some cliched effete homosexual twit. It's the visuals of the impossibly glorious colors, the army marching on horseback, the fantastic clothing design along with the basic story line that make it so remarkable for me.\nThe army crossing the countryside, crashing through the waters, is fantastic. The image brings with it a sense of the regal, the honorable, but also one of impending wrath; it's almost frightening in a way. costumes, which won an Academy Award, carry most of the film's color. I read that the 1,400 costumes were handmade in Kyoto, traditional seat of Japanese tapestries: \"It took three to four months to make each beautifully colored robe (the work was done simultaneously), and it was nearly three years before all were finished.\" Kurosawa frequently chooses drab backgrounds--barren soil, gray slab courtyards, rock steps--to show off their dazzling beauty.\nThe film is set in medieval times, but it is a 20th century film, in which an old man can arrive at the end of his life having won all his battles, and foolishly think he still has the power to settle things for a new generation. But life hurries ahead without any respect for historical continuity; his children have their own lusts and furies. His will is irrelevant, and they will divide his spoils like dogs tearing at a carcass.\nThe story line, partly inspired by Shakespeare's \"King Lear\", but also commenting on on the intricacies of family dynamic, ego, selfish obsessions, and war in general, is compelling for sure. However, I felt too many scenes were unnecessarily wrong, leaving me wanting to skip ahead much of the time. The greatness of the film outweighs the slights, so I'll go with 3.8 stars for now.",

It adapts the plot and narrative structure of Shakespeare's King Lear to the Sengoku Jidai: in place of Lear and his daughters Goneril, Regan, and Cordelia, we have the daimy\u014d Ichimonji Hidetora and his three sons, Taro, Jiro, and Saburo. This transposition somewhat intensifies certain aspects of King Lear's moral conceit. Hidetora's sons neglect their formal duties under filial piety, just as he abdicates his own responsibilities as lord and father. While the actions of their Shakespearean counterparts is intuitively reprehensible, in Ran, they violate codified central tenets of Confucian ethics.\n\nNihilistic interpretations of King Lear came into vogue in the 20th century, but while neither the stage production nor its film adaptation affirms a strong moral conclusion, to me it is at least clear that an ambiguous morality is not equivalent to a lack thereof. Ran is a cautionary tale about seeking privilege without responsibility, substanceless claims to moral superiority, and the banal yet fragile nature of what is truly good. Kurosawa's direction relies more heavily upon nonverbal techniques than Shakespeare's dialogue, and it is largely for his mastery of visual storytelling that the film is so highly regarded by critics.\n\nThe film feels more of an exercise in visual storytelling, than necessarily a source of mass entertainment. It certainly is instructive in expressive cinematographic technique, with much to be learned and emulated. For the critical viewer, this is indeed a great masterpiece.",

The director had been planning to make this film for decades and this was the realitization of a decade of painting the storyboards for this film. It would be his last epic and the most expensive film that he would ever make.\n\n\n\nBeyond the autobiographical nature of this story, Kurosawa also saw the battle scenes as metaphor for nuclear warfare and the high anxiety after Hiroshima. There's also the influence of Japanese Noh theater for two of the protagonists, Hidetora and Lady Kaede, whose single-mindedness stand in contrast to the rest of the cast of characters.\n\nHidetora is a powerful warlord at the close of his life who has decided to divide up his kingdom amongst his sons, with Taro gaining the First Castle and the leadership of their family, while his brothers Jiro and Saburo are to support him and live in the lesser castles.\n\n\n\nThe wise old man explains unity using three arrows. It is easy to snap one arrow but three together are more durable. Saburo snaps all three arrows and calls his father a fool, which leads to him and a servant named Tango being exiled. Fujimaki, a visiting leader who watches all of this, agrees with the brash young man and offers him his daughter in marriage.\n\nTaro's wife Lady Kaede also demands that her husband go to war, still angry that her entire family was killed by Hidetora. The constant battles \u2014 gunfire has replaced swords and arrows \u2014 drives the old man mad as he wanders the wilderness, haunted by visions of those he has destroyed in his journey to power.\n\nAs the entire family follows him into some level of insanity, with war, intrigue and double crosses throughout, it seems as if every castle will crumble into nothingness.\n\nHow important was Ran to Kurosawa? His wife of 39 years Y\u00f4ko Yaguchi, died during the production and he only mourned for one day. His eyesight had also completely deteriorated by the time principal photography began, so his assistants used his paintings as guides to frame each scene.",

While the setting and several details are altered, the nature of Shakespeare's tragedy is evident in full force, as a family initially presented in regal certainty find themselves pulled apart by greed, mistrust, na\u00efvet\u00e9, madness, and, perhaps most painfully, chance. Vices such as anger and jealousy fan the flames of conflict until they reach the boiling point with devastating consequences; you'll gaze around the smoke-filled battlefields and, thinking back to the opening scenes, wonder how the characters could have arrived at such an unpleasant fate. At its core (as confirmed by the title), Ran is about the thin line between civilized behavior and total chaos, and the hostility associated with periods of evolution as groups vie against one another for supremacy and survival; the relatively innocuous and somewhat well-intentioned series of events that lead to a complete shattering of both peace and Hidetora's mental state amplify one another in unexpected ways, playing off of human weakness. Deeply philosophical and totally morose. Visual composition is spot-on here, as Kurosawa employs distinctive wide angles in accordance with a massive set and costume budget (that was clearly put to good use); the final shot of the lone, blind Tsurumaru left isolated in the shell of his former castle not knowing that his slain sister will not be able to return to him is a heartbreaker, even if he is not necessarily an important character to the actual plot. (4.5/5)",

Ran is about a great lord, Lord Ichimonji, who retires his power to his three sons. But his life of treachery begins to reap his rewards as his two oldest sons turn against him and each other. His own lust for power begets their lust of power, and ultimately, the film ends with destruction. This story is compelling and, probably because it's Shakespeare, makes it feel classic, timeless, almost like a storybook.\n\nI noticed that Kurosawa's cinematic composition is a little different here. Instead of his three dimensional composition, he chooses to frame his shots flatter. It hit me halfway through the film that this was to give it a more \"stage\"-like, proscenium kind of feel. Nevertheless, this was still a joy to watch.",

In the tradition of Throne Of Blood, Kurosawa finds himself once again adapting William Shakespeare work to feudal Japan with exceedingly effective results. RAN is choked full of all the sweeping battles, family betrayals, and political intrigue that one would suggest when bringing the tale of King Lear to the screen. As usual, Kurosawa's direction is perfection throughout. This is different from his films of the 1950s and 1960s. Here we see him take advantage of the benefits that come with shooting a film in color, like color symbolism throughout. The rivers of blood are also much more striking in there more accurate reddish tones than in his previous works. The film was on the whole more generous when it comes to the carnage on screen, a clear sigh of censorship changes over time. Tatsuya Nakadai would have made Sir Anthony Hopkins proud with portrayal of the mad king. He is able to play both Hidetora's proud stubbornness at the beginning and his descent into hysteria at the end with equal fervor. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013Overall: While I personally prefer Kurasawa's smaller scale skirmishes like Rashomon or Seven Samurai, RAN is still an impressive spectacle and spellbinding exploration of the profound themes of The Bard's work. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014Highlight: In the scene of Hidetora's castle being sieged, what would be a thunderously deafening scene is instead only left with the sparse musical score, making the gruesome slaughter on screen all the more vivid.",

            "content": "A great take on King Lear!\n\nAkira Kurosawa's epic war drama Ran (1985) is a fantastic adaptation of William Shakespeare's tragedy play King Lear. Kurosawa writes sympathetic and complex characters and modernizes Shakespeare's language into finely tuned dramatic prose for the big screen. Ran is riveting as a tale of fatherhood, brotherhood, loyalty, family, honesty, and betrayal. I can make the argument that Ran is the greatest version of King Lear ever put to film. It's exciting in its large scale combat and engrossing in its nuanced drama. \n\nKurosawa's direction is particularly fascinating as his ambition for realism is unparalleled in these epics. Using scores upon scores of extras in full armor, he gallops entire platoons of men full speed on horseback towards one another. The blur of motion in the camera during the action looks startlingly modern. Ran could have come out now with its genuine performances and contemporary look. Kurosawa continues his obsessions with vibrant color and dream sequences. Ran fashions itself out of lovely kimonos, realistic samurai armor, endless muskets, cool katanas, and frightening spears. It's impressive how Kurosawa brings feudal era Japan to life again and again with his films. Ran is just as astounding as his earlier classics.\n\nTatsuya Nakadai is powerful as Lord Hidetora Ichimonji. He plays the clan head well as an elderly man, who falls prey to his sons' dishonesty, while scorning his honest son. Nakadai uses his big expressive eyes effectively as you feel bad for him by the end. He's a very fun actor to watch in Ran.\n\nI really liked Akira Terao as Taro Takatora Ichimonji. His meek responses are funny and his cruel underhanded is interesting. Jinpachi Nezu is perfect as the traitorous son Jiro Masatora Ichimonji. Daisuke Ryu is excellent as the banished son Saburo Naotora Ichimonji. His candid rapport with Nakadai is nice to see. I must mention Mieko Harada steals the show every time she is on screen as the conniving and resourceful Lady Kaede. Toru Takemitsu's score is really refreshing and different for a Kurosawa film. It sounds quite contemporary to my ears.\n\nOverall, Ran is brilliant filmmaking matched by compelling acting. Kurosawa did it again!",

This is Kurosawa's interpretation of Shakespeare's King Lear, a play that unfortunately I did not study. The plot consists of Lord Hidetora abdicating his empire and splitting the kingdom between his three sons, who each want to have total control. And so many castles are raided and many horseback battles are conceived. Whatever the scene, everything was filmed to perfection. I just adore Kurosawa's style, he doesn't rush a single scene. Leave a castle burning for 30 seconds, watch a man run through a field for 30 seconds or even look at the sky for 30 seconds. In theory, I should be bored...but his artistic integrity and majestic style is a sight to behold. What resonated with me the most was the screenplay, also by Kurosawa. Several lines of dialogue felt like Shakespeare and it's admirable to see an influential film maker be...well...influenced by another famous writer. Scenes where Hidetora descends into madness are great examples of this. Tatsuya Nakadai, who portrayed Hidetora, was once again outstanding. This equals his role from Kagemusha, it was an emotive and poignant portrayal of a father who has been betrayed by his children. The battle scenes were masterful work, hundreds of extras in clan attire definitely filled up the screen with contrasting colours. The costume and production design were yet again wonderful to look at. I do love me the traditional Japanese environment that Kurosawa captures with ease. Lady Kaeda though, was the manifestation of evil...her manipulative skills were fascinating to watch. This leads me to my only problem, which is that none of the major characters are likeable, even Hidetora had issues. So I struggled to become emotionally invested in these characters. However, the purpose of this iteration was to explore themes of betrayal and insanity, Kurosawa conveyed them to technical perfection. Not a complete masterpiece, but extremely close to being one.",

All the shots of nature and the cinematography are perfectly on point. \n\nTaro's wife seems like she bad news. Same with the wife in Kurosawa's brilliant movie, Throne of Blood. It's crazy to see how conniving and corrupt the Great Lord's son becomes. Wow, amazing sequence when the warriors trap Hidetora and his men and then proceed to kill them. Really dark bet yet so elegant especially with the music in the background. \n\nI love how Hidetora looks like a goddamn ghost when he walk out. It's almost like is in fact a ghost. Amazing shot with the castle burning in the background and all the warriors. \n\nThat scene where Hidetora gets carried into a small house is amazing. When the man plays the flute, you can feel all the emotions and feelings he has towards the whole ordeal with Hidetora himself. It's played out brilliantly. The man in the house serves as a reminder to Hidetora of his not so friendly past. \n\nSeeing all those warriors on horseback cross that body of water full throttle is quite a sight to see. That Lady Kaede is probably the most viscous out of all of them. She don't fucking play no games. It's incredible to see the amount of extras Kurosawa used in this movie, he paid no expenses. I'm glad Lady Kaede's life ended that way. But what was more intersting was her reason behind why she did everything she did. It kind of makes you understand why she did what she did, and makes sense. That ending, wow, so much symbolism and metaphor. \n\nOverall, this movie is an amazing epic. It could easily be arranged into a play, and still be good. The acting and the story line are so gripping. The cinematography is beautiful. A lot of attention to detail was given. Especially with all the costumes, castle, set pieces, and locations. Seeing the good relationship they all had, the father and the sons, and then watching it all go to shit once the father relinquishes his power, is something I've never seen in a movie before. This movie is about revenge, avenging lost ones, family bonds, war, corruption, history, and even religion. And it all comes together elegantly and majestically.",

There are empires, warlords, castles and fighting over power possesion here as a retiring Lord tries to depart his fiefdom between his three sons. This does not reach out as planned and there are loads of conflicts here.\n\nSolid story, not too tricky to hang on to, but there are many names to keep track on here, so I don't get the full grip of the story. It's very long, but worth your time. Rearly boring, and anciant films of foreign language that pushes three hours are bound to include some down scenes. This film has few of them.\n\nSome very good mass fight scenes, really old school warfare. Epic fights are looking super realistic and neat. The landscapes and elements of wind and fire are also looking mezmerizing. I like most of the characters, but the actors that give them life impresses a lot. Great leads! \n\nLoads of extras here, 1400 in fact. Together with the 200 horses they are making it a very lively film and it increses the skill of directing even more. Cool sound wraps up this huge film from one of the greatest directors. Only my third film of his I think, but there will be more.\nNot the greatest film I have seen, not a poor one. It's a big archievement and a fantastic production. Story-wise it's OK and it will be remembered as a very slow film that's well-built and has great looks. Huge film.\n\n8.5 out of 10 clouds.",

There is no question that Kurosawa is a phenomenon, and his films are all worthy of serious attention. 'Seven Samurai' is an absolute classic. 'Ran' is a good but not great film, though. Its strengths lie in its robust characterisation, philosophical insights into the human condition and in its superb retelling of the King Lear story. The actors are all top notch in spontaneity and vigour. The cinematography and colours are beautiful in the recently restored 4K version. But the direction and editing, in my opinion, are undisciplined. Most of the battle scenes are haphazard, repetitive and overlong (and the fake blood looks ridiculous), though the sense of peril in pre-CGI days is palpable at times. There are waaaay too many scenes of the increasingly mental Hidetora (a consistently intense Nakadai) wandering around woefully in wastelands with his loyal fool Kyoami (a girlish and watchable Pita).\nThere are some outstanding scenes of really gripping drama, especially when the psychotic seducer Lady Kaede (Mieko Harada) is on-screen, and I enjoyed the stalwart, unflinching loyalty and integrity of men like Tango, Fujimaki and Kurogane. The film's themes are superb: irresponsibility, ambition, fidelity, authority, power, futility, sexuality, forgiveness, religion and many others besides. But it's hard to fully root for any of the characters and there is no real hero, as Hidetora himself is revealed progressively to have been a bit of a monster in his younger years. If the film was trimmed by at least 40 minutes to get it near the two hour mark, it would be touching greatness. Instead, it's incisiveness is lost in the flab of excess footage.",

Greed and revenge are the themes explored in the film, and Kurosawa always managed to get the most out of his film because he crafts films that really resonate with the viewer. Ran is such a film. Brilliantly shot, acted and directed, the film, not only boasts effective performances, but has stunning imagery, which adds so much to the film.  Fans of his work will definitely relish in the power that the film possesses. I much preferred Kurosawa's earlier work, but Ran is nonetheless a strong film that features all the trademarks that has made Kurosawa's work so good. With strong performances, and a simple, yet effective story, Ran is brilliant, poetic filmmaking that should be seen by any film buff. I really enjoy films that have simple ideas for storylines, and I find that the filmmaker is able to get much more depth out of an idea without overdoing anything, and the result is an impressive effort that ranks among the finest foreign films. Nonetheless, I still think that Seven Samurai was Akira Kurosawa's masterstroke of filmmaking. He has never topped it, but he always delivered thought provoking, epics that managed to be some of the finest films ever made. If you want a good action drama, then give this a viewing, it is a film going experience like no other, and it's one of the few foreign films that have stood the test of time. This is a film worth seeing, and it is enthralling experience from start to finish that will surely appeal to viewers looking for a film that has a simple idea, yet grand execution in style. That was what stood out for Akira Kuroswawa's work, his knack to create big, ambitious films while keeping everything to a bare minimum, as to not complicate things for the viewer and in the process, he created something quite remarkable in the cinematic medium.",

But more importantly, this is once again a Kurosawa character study done by way of Shakespeare, where loyalty & ambition clash in such a violent way it can only end one way. The story weaves, twists and turns only to come back to the source of the problem for Lord Hidetora, who endures the fate he has inflicted on others, with his family in shambles and his enemies triumphant. At the same time, the story does suffer from pacing issues and occasional forays into melodramatics and the acting is uneven at best.

Just like \"Throne of Blood\", \"Ran\" easily engulfs me in a magical world of great enchantment, but this is a chaotic and cruel world. A world made of suffering where gods will not save Men from himself and where the thirst for power is the mirror of the natural struggle for survival, ethics and morality are subdued by the samurai conduct and interests of the powerful. Film of great symbolic significance, to watch \"Ran\" is like watching an epic and blazing Noh (form of Japanese classical theater) performance that reveals the true gist of human nature and existence. Tecnically superb work with countless memorable scenes, hauntingly beautiful soundtrack by Toru Takemitsu (whose work I highly appreciate), top-notch cinematography, camera work and acting, all in perfect harmony to create a deeply melancholic, beautiful and exciting universe. \"Ran\" is not without its shortcomings though. I may speak for a minority, but this would be a virtually perfect film in my eyes, if not for Kurosawa's maniac obsession with redundant battle scenes, especially in the last half hour or so (yet again, for what?!), some dragging moments ought to be chopped out with more insightful editing work to keep up with the standards of the rest of the film, enough is enough. And hard for me to believe that no life was lost during those crazy shoots. Fortunately, these distractions are relatively minor here, not as bad as in \"Kagemusha\", so it doesn't prevent \"Ran\" from becoming one of my favorite movies ever. The heartbreaking final scene also enters into my favorite list, perfect expression of how helpless we are in the world. Masterpiece from Kurosawa, highly recommended!",

From the royalty to the soldiers and even the peasants, each is just stunning to look at and I can only wonder what they would be like to wear.\nWhere this film loses me is in the large scale fight sequences. Kurosawa has demonstrated in previous films that he has a good eye for action and framing of action but it seems as though much of that is lost in Ran. Whether the camera is too close not giving much information or far away and stationary, when combined with the editing in the film, you can only help but wonder... were these the only shots available for the film? Where are the matching tracking shots, etc.? While removing these large fight sequences would have eliminated these problems, it might have made the film stale and truly would have taken away from the epic scope of everything. Such are the decisions of the artist.\nI do have to wonder, is this the film Kurosawa wanted to make, or the one he ended up making despite it not being exactly how he envisioned it. Still despite the minor grievances, Ran still brings forth a powerful film and viewers who don't nitpic as much as I, will likely find no fault in this epic of tales.",

The story concerns Lord Hidetora, who being quite old decides to foolishly (but with the best intentions) divide up his lands amongst his three sons. He is betrayed by them as they turn their backs on him and go to war with each other over the territories and castles as Lord Hidetora slowly loses his mind.

            "content": "Ran, director Akira Kurosawa's epic adaptation of William Shakespeare's King Lear, has the distinction of being one of the greatest and most powerful cinematic tragedies to ever grace the silver screen. Kurosawa had already demonstrated his ability to handle Shakespeare 30 years beforehand in his masterful version of Macbeth, Throne of Blood, but he had to wait until he was 75 to film Ran, a project he had long cherished. Criticized and neglected in his home country of Japan, old, lonely, near blind and suicidal, Kurosawa must have felt some sort of kingship with Lear and set out to bring Shakespeare's tale of greed, power and betrayal to ravishing cinematic life. He ended up making one of the supreme masterpieces of Japanese cinema; a bloody and nihilistic interpretation of Shakespeare's play that, although set in 16th century Japan, highlights the sorrowful state of the human condition in the Cold War era. Although Ran is without question the most devastating film ever about anything, with powerful performances and gorgeous photography, composition and art direction, it is endlessly watchable.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://www.hollywoodchicago.com/sites/default/files/Ran1.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nAging samurai warlord Hidetora Ichimonji announces his wish to divide his kingdom among his three sons: Taro, Jiro and Saburo. The eldest two welcome their father's decision with false pledges of love, while Saburo believes his decision is insane, as he thinks the brothers will fight for control of the kingdom and end up destroying it. Shocked, Hidetora banishes Saburo in a rage, but his son's prophecy soon proves correct as his kingdom and family are torn apart by war, revenge and an insatiable thirst for power, driving the old lord to the darkest depths of madness. It is a sad end to a powerful life. The most expensive Japanese film ever made at the time, Ran was a colossal undertaking by Kurosawa that he handled with the assurance and vigor of a master at the top of his game. The film received Academy Award nominations for Best Art Direction, Best Cinematography, Best Costume Design (which it won) and Best Direction, losing most to Sydney Pollack's Out of Africa. Only a modest success in 1985, Ran, with the passing of time, has come to be considered one of Kurosawa's finest works, both critically and popularly, and is perhaps the ultimate film adaptation of Shakespeare, arguably even surpassing the play it is based on.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://media.web.britannica.com/eb-media/57/75057-004-BF0FF502.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nKurosawa's worldview became progressively bleaker and bleaker over the years, as his career plummeted, friends and family passed away and the world found itself on the brink of nuclear apocalypse. The death, isolation and utter hopelessness in the human spirit that so haunted the legendary director were manifested in this masterwork, in which he poured all his rage, nihilism and sadness. The haunting final shot of Tsurumaru standing atop the ruins of his family castle perfectly summarizes Kurosawa's feelings on the human condition: blind, fragile, alone and on the edge of oblivion. Ran is a film that shows us the brutal and destructive consequences of violence and the betrayal of family, and the folly of war, power and greed. It shows us a world that is doomed to suffer endless cycles of violence and death, and not even the heroic, the upright, the virtuous or the innocent are spared. This film is a plea for peace that urges the viewer to transcend his primitive nature and love his brother, or else be damned to a meaningless existence and a painful death.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://wird.com.ua/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/4e45ca36964d.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nThe director's all encompassing cinematic vision constantly propels the film to new heights of cinematic power. This was Kurosawa's attempt to outdo himself, and he succeeds in all respects. Ran has a contemplative length, depth and grandeur that commands respect and demands our attention. He is never afraid to linger on a near motionless scene, and yet can encompass sweeping sequences of carefully choreographed action with equal panache. As expected, the epic massed battle scenes are superbly realized, and a silent massacre sequence set to Toru Takemitsu's music is one of cinema's most nightmarish. It is not surprising that Kurosawa storyboarded every single shot as paintings, as there is not a single shot that I couldn't hang up on my wall. The film is composed mostly in wide shots with no fast cutting and little camera movement, as if the film is from God's eye view as He looks sadly down on His children, who wage inexplicable war upon each other and think themselves all powerful. Kurosawa's use of the four elements is unrivaled, even by Tarkovsky, and the colors (predominantly red, blue and yellow) jump right off the screen. Truly a visual feast for the eyes!\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i.discuss.com.hk/d/attachments/day_130714/20130714_f88110142c2d819405afqj31x3538Ons.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nThe performances of Tatsuya Nakadai and Mieko Harada as Hidetora and Lady Kaede deserve special mention. As the old lord haunted by his violent past and in search of redemption, Nakadai gives what is arguably his best performance, while Harada gives exceptional power and conviction to one of the most memorable characters in film history. Translated into Chaos in English, Ran is Kurosawa's vision of a world on the brink of destruction, and a world that needs to change. It is a vision unparalleled in the history of cinema, and one that is still fully relevant. Ran is the triumphant final flourish of a master who overcame every obstacle and gave one last great gift to humanity, which of course failed to recognize it as the cinematic masterpiece that it was until years later. But a cinematic masterpiece it is, and certainly one of the most important ever made.

Not one person just talks in this film. They scream their lines like crazy.\n\nAnd not to sound awful, but nearly everyone looks a like in this film. It was hard to keep track of who was who, and what they were doing. There is little emotion in any characters, so you can't relate to anyone and in a movie like this, it should be important to feel for somebody.\n\nBesides yelling all their lines, the director clearly hates the idea of a CLOSE UP, so we always feel very distant from every character. When someone dies, we don't really care.\n\nI am a character person first, so the fact that I couldn't feel for any character, let alone tell them apart, really kept me disinterested in this film. Not to mention it took me THREE days to finally get through it. One of the most over praised films I have seen yet.",

            "content": "You know, when you watch even only a small handful of Akira Kurosawa films, it becomes incredibly difficult to pick which of his works is his best because he seemingly could do anything, no matter what it was and no matter what age he seemed to be. Ran is definitely one of his all-time greats, and it is quite an achievement not only because he made this film at the age of 75, but because it also pushes his greatness as a director to new heights even as time changed. Ran is easily one of the greatest film epics of all time, and I'll do my best to explain why this is so.\n\nWhen Lord Hidetora of the Ichimonji Clan's age begins to take a toll on him, he decides to step down from the throne and divide his castles among his three sons to rule over those particular territories. Taro gets First Castle and will become leader of the Ichimonji Clan, Jiro gets Second Castle, and Saburo will receive Third Castle, while Hidetora will retain his title, but remain mostly in the background of his sons' rule.\n\nWhen Lord Hidetora presents a lesson based on three arrows that can't be broken when together, his son, Saburo takes the arrows and breaks them, stating that the lesson means nothing and that such an alliance can be broken, and also stating that the sons will probably not remain loyal. After all, Hidetora himself used brutal methods to conquer his territories, and his sons have a high probability of following in his footsteps to gain sole control of the territories.\n\nUpon hearing this brutal honesty from Saburo and having suspicions of him, Hidetora banishes him, along with a servant named Tango who stands up for Saburo. Taro and Jiro still have their castles, which Hidetora remains in control of Third Castle.\n\nShortly after his decrees, Taro and his wife, Lady Kaede (Whose family used to rule over First Castle, but were savagely murdered by Hidetora and wants revenge) begin to plot to take control of the territories and take away Hidetora's title as Great Lord. Enraged by his son's offer, Hidetora leaves his castle and travels to Jiro's only to discover that Jiro is just fine with Taro's plan and has similar desires.\n\nHidetora leaves that castle as well and decides to take refuge at Third Castle, only to have it be attacked by forces from both Taro and Jiro who attempt to kill him and his forces. Hidetora escapes death, but is left to descend into madness in the wilderness as he is forced to live with bad decisions and misdeeds come back to haunt him.\n\nIn the midst of the battle, Taro is killed, leaving Jiro vying for control over the Ichimonji Clan and its territories, while also striking up an affair with Taro's scheming wife, Lady Kaede who uses him as a pawn for her own schemes through her seduction and beauty.\n\nNow, an all-out war threatens to tear apart his entire clan, and he is left with to go insane with only a few devotees in the wilderness to keep him company in his personal hell.\n\nThe story is a grand and magnificent tragedy with a deep story and rich characters. There are many layers contained within the plot and every bit of it is engaging and riveting to follow as the characters descend into their inevitable tragedies. There's betrayal, madness, seduction, murder, war, compassion, and many other themes to be found in the tremendous storyline that will give the viewer a lot to think about and process.\n\nThe acting for such a grand epic is stellar, especially Tatsuya Nakadai as Hidetora. Though I've only seen two other films of his where he had a major role (Harakiri, Kagemusha), once again he delivers a great performance like he did in those previous two films I've seen. However, the actors playing the three sons are also magnificent in their roles, as well as Mieko Harada as the manipulative and seductive Lady Kaede. This time, it wasn't just one actor who dominated, there were so many great performances that you can't help but admire.\n\nRan is a glorious epic filled with virtually everything anyone could ever want from a grand, epic tragedy. It's a riveting and deep film that will make its 160-minute running time feel like nothing because there is so much that it has to offer. If you love film epics, Ran is not something to miss.",

Now watching it on blu-ray (but with only a 32\" screen), setpieces, such as the brutal battle which leaves the castle in flames, are still pretty amazing.  True, its epic length could be a bit wearying and the plot operates well on a grand scale and not so sensitively on a smaller interpersonal scale.

The actors are nothing short of brilliant, without exception. The art direction, cinematography, and costume design earned the film Oscar nominations, winning one, but worthy of all three - and more. The film score is distinctive and stunning as well.\n\nI was debating with my brother about which was better - Ran or Seven Samurai. We both felt they were equal in the end.

It's always been a magnificent film but watching it on bluray was incredible. The format lends itself to Kurosawa's epic story beautifully. The cinematography and use of widescreen is breathtaking and the film has never looked so good. If you've never seen it, it's a Japanese retelling of Shakespeare's King Lear. Combined with Japanese lore the film tells of a ruler gone mad who abdicates his position to his eldest son and divides his land amongst all 3 sons. When one of them rejects the offer believing his father's whim to be out of insanity, he is banished. As the father sinks deeper into madness a power struggle begins between the other two brothers. It's a richly textured film, both visually and thematically. When it needs to be violent the blood is let brutally and when it needs to be tender the emotions are worn on it's sleeve. Many consider this to be Kurosawa's masterpeice and it definitely is amongst his best, but I personally think his next film, Dreams, was his best and most personal. Nevertheless as he was nearing the end of his career (and life), Ran still feels like a personal film. It is very much a statement about the nature of man and I can't help but feel that Kurosawa was disheartened by this. It is even spoken in the film that man seems more content being at war with each other that it wishes for peace. Ran is an epic film made all the more powerful on bluray.",

Kurosawa's brilliant epic is a powerful look at the insatiable lust for power that lurks in the hearts of men. How congeniality can turn to savagery at the slightest hint of gain. \nAlso, and what I think is his most effective message of the film: We as a people lie, cheat, steal, and in some instances murder, yet expect the world to be fair to us in return. \nLike all Kurosawa films, he loves using nature to reflect what is happening in the story. As the family bonds being to fray, he often cuts to ominous clouds descending upon the castle. When the father realizes that he is no longer welcome in his kingdom, we get a close up of the sun and the sweat beading on his brow. These are just classic Kurosawa staples that are done beautifully here. While I was expecting this focus on nature, I was not however prepared for how graphic the film would be.\nThere are extended gory battle sequences that frankly were very shocking to me. I have nothing against violence, I just haven't seen Kurosawa tackle it with such intensity. Although it is arresting, it is very fitting to the film as Kurosawa shows that these aren't men engaged in acts of valor, this is wanton violence brought on by greed. The music that plays over it isn't triumphant, it is of something lost. At the tender age of 75, you would think he wouldn't want to dabble in such brutality. But I guess 75 is as good as age as any to show some good old-fashion double suicides. \nWhile there is a lot to chew on, I think that if Kurosawa wants you to walk away with one message, it is to never give up power, especially to your rotten kids.",

Nonetheless, the very essence of Shakespeare's play is captured by Kurosawa's visually stunning epic about an old ruler's haste and foolish decision which his entire family pays the price for. Tatsuya Nakadai gives a masterful performance as a once fierce and now shell-shocked old emperor. He is surrounded by a terrific cast. Kurosawa's vision however must ultimately be applauded for managing to show us just how gruesome the Bard's tale is; through the gore and violence, which make Tarantino's films look PG, teaching us the same lessons about war which Shakespeare wanted to teach us. Striking and breathtaking film, the length of Kurosawa's late masterpiece is of no importance because it is so engrossing. Cannot wait to revisit this film in bluray and see Kurosawa's bold colors again.",

To me, from head to toe, this Kurosawa's picture which symbolizes downfall is absolute stunning - such gorgeousness in a film is utterly rare, and of course, it is one of the Kurosawa's many best films. Ran is a success - having nominated for Academy Awards for best art direction, best cinematography, best costume design and best direction and won one. Ran was also nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Foreign Language Film.\r\n\r\nI repeat this - Ran, from head to toe, is absolutely stunning, and of course this movie is perfect. The film's cinematography, which is top notch, is a killer. The way Kurosawa captured the images of burning castle, a moving horses, dead soldiers, battle scenes are all undeniably respectable, and sublime too, and one great example would be the scenes where the attack of the third castle  was occurring. Very much in evidence that Kurosawa's talent in film-making is transcending. The film's script which was being written by Kurosawa himself, Hideo Oguni and Masato Ide is yet admirable. The exploitation on poetic lines are proven to be effective and fitting for the movie.\r\n\r\nOne would see great performances in Ran. Good acting by the players, but to me, the two actors who stood up above the rest are Tatsuya Nakadai and Mieko Harada. Tatsuya Nakadai plays the great lord Tatsuya Nakadai. The great lord is old, fragile and somewhat defenseless and the character is well characterized by him. Mieko Harada plays a female villain Lady Kaede, whose character is hungry for revenge. Her amazing performance which is raw and gripping, plays a very important part for the success of the movie.\r\n\r\nSurely there are several movie elements which are worthy to be carried out for discussions, but to me, the main highlight of Ran is its cinematography, and it is one hell of a show.\r\n\r\n[10/10]",

What I have to offer is that there is such a poetry to the visual aspects of this film. While the battle scenes are among the goriest and grizzliest that have ever been put on celluloid, there is a dance here, a wave of the most intense coming and going as we watch the soldiers fall. It tells how potentially good men can be influenced by the forces of evil. The wife of the first son is purely vengeful, and horrifying.

            "content": "I came to this without having seen any of Kurosawa's films (Seven Samurai and Rashomon most significantly so) and was surprised by many elements. I didn't expect this film to be so theatrical, even down to the make-up which seemed more theatrical than usual for naturalistic cinema. I do wonder if maybe Kurosawa in his later period was delicate to Japanese criticisms that he was too \"western\" in his technique, and wanted to give it more of a Japanese feel; or perhaps he was deliberately paying tribute to the theatrical origin of the story. Even so, this is certainly a great movie, epic in range and with a huge emotional impact. \r\n\r\n\"Ran\" is basically an updating of Shakespeare's King Lear; the film sees the elderly Lord Hidetora Ichimonji deciding to hand over the reins of power to his three sons. His eldest, Taro, becomes the new Lord, while his younger sons Jiro and Saburo are each granted a province of their own to rule over. Saburo however protests, believing it to be a foolish decision that will split the clan and Hidetora banishes his third son. It isn't long however until Taro and Jiro's ambitions of power lead them to betray their father and the nation begins to fall apart, spurred on by Taro's manipulating wife lady Kaede.\r\n\r\nKurosawa thus blends Shakespearean tragedy with a sweeping historical epic about the loss and gain of power. At the center of it all is a remarkable acting presence in the shape of Tatsuya Nakadai as the displaced elderly Samurai. At the beginning of the film he is a man of stubborn pride, but as his world crumbles and his people die, he soon finds himself with nowhere else to go. The emotional turbulence of being betrayed by his own flesh and blood drives him to his limits, but nevertheless he still refuses to contact Saburo because his warrior principles will not allow him. There seems to be a definite element of Kurosawa himself up there on screen, the director having been near the end of his career with his health failing and his wife having tragically passed away during shooting. Hidetora isn't a perfect ruler but as evidence of his cruelty and oppression during his reign mount up, he remains a sympathetic character, questioning his past decisions and what exactly it is he has achieved in his lifetime. He is the pillar that holds the film together and no mistake. He is aided by some impressive performances all round. Daisuke Ryo's impetuous, outspoken but loyal Saburo is a highpoint of course even if his screen time is limited, spending the majority of the storyline in exile. Jinpachi Nezu's Jiro is another remarkable presence, equally proud and stubborn as his father but beset by insecurities and mistrust. Mieko Harada's Lady Kaede is the film's most hated rouge; her performance is spot on as Kaede is a cold, calculating woman with vengeance on her mind at the best of times, during one pivotal scene towards the middle, she explodes with one dramatic emotional outburst to another, ranting, screaming and licking blood from a knife wound.\r\n\r\nThe battle scene that forms the centerpiece is absolutely breathtaking, with legions of Samurai warriors storming a castle in total silence. There are no sound effects, no speech, just the sad musical overture for the majority of the fighting, until a particularly important gunshot rings out and we are plunged right into the maelstrom. Bodies are filled with arrows, blood drips everywhere and hundreds of warriors are slaughtered in spectacular fashion. It may be a glorious sight to behold, but it is the closest thing a historical epic has got to show that war is hell, no matter what period of human history it is set in. The more blood thirsty among us may then be disappointed by the second clash towards the end, a far more unremarkable skirmish that promised to be incredible after several scenes of armies maneuvering in anticipation.\r\n\r\nThe greatness of Ran doesn't end at its visuals though. There is a fantastic narrative within these vivid and colorful vistas. It is a very slow paced film that dwells on certain scenes for a very long time, yet never overbearingly long. The story itself is fairly complex, as would be expected from such a grand scheme of a picture, yet as long as you stay with it, it is an incredible story with a great deal of subtext and underlying themes that serve to give it an even greater purpose as a revolutionary film. With any epic film like this you'd expect it to cover a lot of proverbial and existential ground and it certainly does. We see everything from the themes of close family bonds and loyalties, to the traumatic effects of war on the human mind and soul. Ran is a dramatic tragedy of lost innocence and peace. It is a harrowing look at the destruction of family and kingdom. Yet, despite these bleak themes, it still manages to be a stunningly beautiful film. This beauty serves to drive home the emotional impact of the film, engraving some very gripping images into your mind.\r\n\r\nIn the end, Ran is an artistic masterpiece of such beauty and grandeur, that it can put one in an immense state of awe and wonder. It may seem theatrical at times, but like a watercolor painting that moves, it is beautiful to watch time and time again. \r\n\r\nStory: B+\r\nActing: B+\r\nDirection: B\r\nVisuals: A\r\nOverall: B\r\n\r\n*** out of 4 stars",

I'm not familiar with King Lear at all (which this is based on), so perhaps that is a reason for it, but a great film should be able to reach even the audiences who haven't read the source material, and this just didn't do much for me. Nakadai is good (lots of the performances are way over the top, however, but you come to expect this from Japanese films), but everything else is lacking; the camera shots and action scenes are so stolid that I keep feeling like we were watching one of those fake reenactment battles some people do for hobbies - the setting literally just looked like they'd picked the nearest field (the 'castles' and such that they used were great, however). Costume design, etc. is great, but you can't call a film good just for that. The whole film focuses on shaming this old Lord and his horrible, power-grabbing sons. There's little to no story development and structure - certainly not worthy of what I have seen in other Kurosawa films anyway. It's a real shame for me that I didn't like this. I'm going to read King Lear, then watch this again, and see if my opinion changes.",

            "content": "King Lear remake or Akira Kurosawa biopic? Maybe both, and either way, it's the most entertaining, engrossing, and engaging Shakespeare that I've ever seen, and a completely believeable allegory for a life of mistakes regretted.\r\n\r\nThe story of King Lear is well known: an ageing king divides his kingdom between two fawning daughters and excommunicates the third who dares to tell the truth. In time, he lives to regret his decision, discovering during a descent into madness that, to paraphrase Junius, the subject who is truly loyal to the chief magistrate does not flatter.\r\n\r\nAs a piece of cinema, it's hard to fault Ran. Although the near-3 hour running time seems daunting, the telling of the story rarely drags. Where Shakespeare sometimes loses you in a barrage of Dukes and Earls of various bits of England and navel-gazing soliloquies, Kurosawa's streamlined Lear keeps us focussed on the matter at hand and the key players. The addition of the viscerally evil Kaede (or is she?), while sure to disappoint Lear purists, adds complexity beyond pure greed as motivation for the villains. The scenery and visuals are stunning, from the castles (ruined or not), to the Japanese mountain-scape, to the desert. The score is well judged, never intrusive and never sounding a wrong note.\r\n\r\nThe acting too is faultless. The minor characters are rich and complex, struggling with their decisions, balancing loyalty and honour, greed and lust; never one-dimensional, never purely detestable nor loveable. And Hidetora (Lear) himself is a simply stunningly brilliant portrayal of madness - madness that comes from realizing that his own miserable fate is entirely of his own making. To err is human; to realize that your error has cost you everything you love is the road to madness, and the portrayal here is entirely convincing.\r\n\r\nSo is it Lear? Not in any conventional sense. But stripped of the arcane language, transposed to a different place, and with subtle tweaks to motivation and morality, this is the most accessible Lear I've ever experienced; I truly felt that I understood the point of the play after I saw Ran in a way that a straight reading or literalist film adaptation won't achieve. And is it a biopic? If so, perhaps we can understand the tortured soul of Kurosawa a little better through this, surely his masterwork.",

The film follows a family of samurais who vye for being their father's favourite, and unfortunately, the consequences are bloody, brutal, fiery, and highly disturbing. Wars galore in this film. The three previous films I have seen under Japanese master's direction were all from the 1950's, the latest being the masterpiece \"The Seven Samurai.\" Kurosawa is not afraid to show bloodshed here in abosolutely excessive matters, perhaps as much as Sam Peckinpah's \"The Wild Bunch.\" He is also not afraid of taking colour to his advantage, exposing the gorgeous set pieces and scenery within this feature film. \"Ran\" is another great work under Akira Kurosawa.\r\n\r\nOne other note I would like to make is the father in the film. He is allegidly controlled by spirits and although, perhaps there is more to it than that. I believe, because of his age, he may have gone totally senial, sparking utter insanity. He does act really crazy in the film and he passes the effects of his weak mentality onto his sons and the kingdom, resulting in disaster. Kurosawa does a fine job showing the father's craziness, as well as casting actors in terrific performances.",

Do I love Akira films??? Yes I do and I have watched them over and over, this movie about the struggle of power and of course Kurosawa is very crone to Shakespeare that's how he made this movie all on his work but a more of our Japanese style to it. I remember when I first watched this and that was like years ago I didn't really like the film back then but today, this is one of my favourite epics ever. \r\n\r\nI read somewhere that Akira Kurosawa painted everything before he under took the movie and he get the idea from Lucio Fulci from his masterpiece The Beyond. The way Fucli painted the powerful images of hell and then took them to the screen with the films ending climax with the two Americans in an atheist vision of hell. As well as the croned haunted hell house. I just admire Kurosawa's visions of this epic with the burning of the 3rd castle that was just amazing.\r\n\r\nA story of greed, a lust for power, and ultimate revenge. The Great Lord Hidetora Ichimonji has decided to step aside to make room for the younger blood of his three sons, Taro, Jiro, and Saburo, the Lord's only wish now being to live out his years as an honored guest in the castle of each of his sons in turn. While the older two sons flatter their father, the youngest son attempts to warn him of the folly of expecting the three sons to remain united; enraged at the younger son's attempt to point out the danger, the father banishes him. True to the younger son's warning, however, the oldest Son soon conspires with the second son to strip The Great Lord of everything, even his title. \r\n\r\nI admire the films themes of \r\n\r\nWarfare: Saburo's assassination by a sniper also shows how individual heroes can be easily disposed of on a modern battlefield. Kurosawa also illustrates this new warfare with his camera. Instead of focusing on the warring armies, he frequently sets the focal plane beyond the action, so that in the film they appear as abstract entities.\r\n\r\nChaos: The ultimate example of chaos is the absence of gods. When Hidetora sees Lady Sue, a devout Buddhist and the most religious character in the film, he tells her, Buddha is gone from this miserable world. Sue, despite her belief in love and forgiveness, eventually has her head cut off. When Kyoami claims that the gods either do not exist or are the cause of human suffering, Tango responds, the gods can't save us from ourselves.\r\n\r\nAnd of course there are powerful themes of Power, Greed and Nihilism.\r\n\r\nEven though it may not appear so it is based on the struggle of King Lear, well not entirely directed towards or near it I see the similarities or the two stories and how it was based on it. I read the book once upon a time and it was just beautiful to know were he got inspiration besides overusing Shakespeare. (Not in a bad way at all).\r\n\r\nThe acting style is very strange and controversial. It's rather more body language and the way people reflect on there situation. It's mainly influenced by Noh theatre, it also more body language as I have sated and the distraction of silences that goes into that scene. Not just focusing on the scenery and what is happening to this struggle. Noh aspects of these two characters emphasize their ruthless, passionate, and single minded natures.\r\n\r\nI really liked the way with the camera instead of the simple one camera stands there and...Take done. No he uses more of the old technique and advances more on Long shots to catch the beauty of that scene and what is in view of it, such as the people and the building as well as catching there responses to that action. As well as the arrow hitting the man and the peoples reaction to the perpetrator doing so.\r\n\r\nI really liked the costume designs they took more then two years to make all of them by hand and for every lead and every extra and done so with such creative talent it's not just the leads that get the best it's all of them. I really liked the aspect of course with all the detail put into it, It's not today you see these sort of things anymore. So overall it was worthy of its Oscar for best costume design and I can think of a million other categories it should have won. \r\n\r\nThe sets are just breathing again Akira spent years painting everything to his likening and everything had to be right down to every detail. The burning of the 3rd castle was just incredible no miniatures no computer generated imagery...No. Everything was burned to the ground in the order that it should and every actor or extra needed to know what they were doing. And its not just sets its scenery I remember the scene with the filed of gold they just went for miles and she was walking throw it like nothing because she was no greedy man.\r\n\r\nI think by the end every man, women, child needs to view this epic masterpiece.\r\n\r\nKeiko's score 100%",

The movie itself is huge in its scope and bleak vision. It is not simply a remake of Lear although it clearly owes a lot to Shakespeare. I thought the best scene was the seduction of Jiro (second son) by Lady Kaede, the recent widow of Taro (first son). The scene owes more to Richard III than Lear but with the twist that it is the woman doing the forced seduction. I was reminded of Richard's famous speech:\r\n    Was ever woman in this humour woo'd?\r\n    Was ever woman in this humour won?\r\nThe movie grinds on to its inevitable tragic end. There are wonderful, if slightly overblown, scenes of samurai warfare. I was somewhat puzzled by the use of firearms but research showed that by the time of Mori Motonari (the most likely model for Lord Hidetora) firearms would have been recently introduced to Japan.\r\n\r\nIt is an easy movie to respect.

Throne of Blood is dark and menacing as is Peter Brook's  version of King Lear. Kurosawa's Lear seems so fragile as he shuttles between the conquests he's just bequeathed to his sons. The grandeur of the scenery and costumes doesn't mask his vulnerability. Similarly, Mieko Harada's performance as the vengeful princess is stunning because of the rage that erupts out of her flower-like appearance. Ran delivers a few powerful emotional moments despite its epic proportion.",

Both starred Nakadai, who is perhaps my favorite Japanese actor. But in Kagemusha, Nakadai had humor to give his character redeeming qualities. Here he has nothing but maniacal redemption, resentment and a desire for absolution. And all of these come after he is punished for his greed. I do have a slight problem with the battle scenes, I had wished they were more...battle-y but they weren't bad. The blood and gore worked well and came out as shocking. \r\n\r\nRan did perhaps contain one of the most well deserved and bloody beheadings in film history though. I don't want to heap praise onto this film just because the consensus is to do so. I think I prefer kurosawa in black and white and he has made quite a few movies better than this one.

Kurosawa's direction was amazing and i began to understand that he was using all of his filming experience to his best abilities to make this film come to life, especially the execution and timing of certain scenes.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese acting style is in the film in which each emotion is expressed through not only facial expressions but the body as well. Theater performance can be closely related to the acting just like what was displayed in \"Seven Samurai\". Yet, both styles of acting where very well blended just like in Seven Samurai.\r\n\r\nThe drama was extremely tense for almost every scene in this movie. If you like to watch movies that are upeat, happy, and can make your day, stay away from this movie.

As if Shakespeare's \"King Lear\" wasn't brutal enough, the world famous Akira Kurosawa, a man known for making depressing and violent movies has tackled this tragedy.\r\n\r\nRan, based on King Lear, is about an aged warlord who passes on his land and rule to his sons. But his youngest son rejects his offer because of his belief that his father's violent and bloody past has affected the minds and fates of his family. And how right he is. From then on the story is all about greed, trechory, murder, and the father's descent into madness. Though there are many changes and the story is more simplified compared to King Lear, it does not hurt the movie at all. Kurosawa's vision of King Lear in an Ancient Japan setting gives the story a new respectable look. This movie not only hightens the feelings and lessons of King Lear, but Kurosawa's also focuses on a \"godlessness\" theme which becomes incredably horrifying. \r\n\r\nAkira Kurosawa is one of, if not, the greatest film director of all time. And he gives it his all in this movie. With a greater budget than his other films, everything in this movie is perfect. Unbelievable costumes details, fantastic makeup, chilling music score, and not to mention the movie's achitecture and sets, one tower which was built just for the purpose of burning it down. That's commitment. All combined with Kurosawa's years of filmmeking knowledge to make this movie an epic like no other. And not to mention the wonderful and haunting preformances, especially from the ones who played the scary Lord Hidetora and the femme fetal Lady Kaede.\r\n\r\nKurosawa's inspiration knows no bounds for he is the one who created modern cinema. With his representation of the world in his films, he not only opened new bounds in storytelling to touch, but new ways to show them. Though Ran is one of his latest, it is still just as impressive as any other of his films and a must see for movie buffs.",

A peculiar trait of Asian, Kung-fu, chop-socky movies. We have that style of dialogue here.

Some of the things that are done in this movie probably couldn't even have been done as effectively with CG (which is what the modern film maker would have resorted to). This movie trots itself around the screen as a prize visual masterpiece. Let's face it - it's a moving work of art. \n\nThe acting in this movie is also pretty fucking good - as much so as you can expect from Tatsuya Nakadai. I cringed a little bit when I saw the ridiculous over acting of Mieko Harada (Lady Kaede) but maybe that's just me. \n\nAnother thing that fits with the aesthetic quality of this movie is the fact that the score was written by Toru Takemitsu - the product does not disappoint the name. \n\nNow time for the bad part. As we all know, 'Ran' is an appropriation of Shakespeare's 'King Lear' - which is a good play in its own right. And to the credit of Ran, it does a wonderful job of translating that play in to its own cultural context whilst retaining its own identity as a story. \n\nThe one thing that this story keeps which I wish it wouldn't is Shakespeare's story structure. The ridiculous and meticulous and numerous folds of narrative that is a Shakespearean play does not translate as well as one would hope to the big screen. Perhaps it is because the modern audience doesn't feel it has the time for 20 different archs to unfold which a simultaneous circular narrative is in place - We love Shakespeare because he is a genius and because his stuff is flat out impressive. We don't love Shakespeare because his stuff makes for bland appropriations and re-interpretations. \n\nWhat this movie needed was the inspiration of Shakespeare and the sweetness of Akira Kurosawa (who is a modern Shakespeare in his own right) - we do not see that sweetness in 'Ran'.\n\nBUT - if you can stomach a 2h 40m spiral in to depression, then enjoy this otherwise masterful work.",

Not only this, there are so many subtle themes and messages throughout the film that one can't help but be deeply affected. There's a deep root message of nihilism throughout the piece, laced with anti war messages and questions over morality and family bonds. \r\n\r\nThe film is an adaption of King Lear, but one would be hard pressed to tell, if they hadn't been informed before hand. Kurosawa makes the story his own, and brings a true masterpiece to the screen in the process. The detail on offer is astounding, little wonder when you realise that Kurosawa spent 10 years painting every scene. \r\n\r\nA rare marvel of film making vision and depth; one that will stay with you.",

            "content": "In my opinion Ran is Kurosawa's masterpiece and one of the best films ever made.  It is also one of my top 5 favourite films and will probably be for a long time. \r\n\r\nIt is one of the rare films that succeeds in every possible way and watching it is a very powerful experience. Ran works equally well as a family drama, a period piece, an anti-war film, there are elements of comedy, romance and revenge. For me it is the definition of an Epic film. \r\n\r\nRan means Chaos, it is loosely based on Shakespeare's play King Lear, an ageing warlord named Hidetora Ichimonji retires and divides his kingdom between his three sons Taro, Jiro and Saburo. Chaos, War and Tragedy ensue. \r\n\r\nWith this film Kurosawa proves to have been one of the greatest film makers to have lived, but he also proves to be an exceptional artist, this film is a work of art. \r\n\r\nThe direction and cinematography are exceptional and astounding, every single shot is flawless, the colours are vibrant and powerful, the locations are breathtaking, the editing is very smooth, almost imperceptible. I liked the way he filmed the action sequences, he stays quite aloof from the action instead of getting up too close as is the trend these days, thus it has more of an impact and is much more comprehensible. \r\nKurosawa spent 10 years painting each shot of this film before even beginning filming, and it shows. I don't think such a beautiful film has ever been made or will ever be made again. \r\nThe scale of it all is beyond belief; he built the Third Castle on the slopes of Mount Fiji only to burn it down in one of the finest scenes in the film. He ordered thousands of suits of armour, weapons and horses, He used over 1,400 extras.  The film cost the equivalent of 12 million dollars, it was the most expensive Japanese film to be made at the time. \r\nSeveral scenes stand out throughout the film but I would say the most brilliant is the attack on the Third Castle, such a powerful scene that shows the horrors of war better than any modern war film. Hidetora's descent into insanity during that horrific scene is amazing to watch and his silent walk away from the burning castle is haunting. \r\nOther scenes that really amazed me were the whole battle scenes between Jiro's forces and Saburo's, the scene in Tsurumaru's hovel and the final shot. \r\n\r\nThe acting was brilliant from the whole cast, I can't think of any one actor who diminished the brilliance of the film, on the contrary they enhanced it especially Tatsuya Nakadai who plays the Warlord Hiderota and whose performance is crucial to the film as well as being one of the best I've seen. The whole cast really became their characters and seemed at perfect ease in the time they were depicting, probably because of the excellent costume design. \r\n\r\nThe characters were all well developed and all had a purpose, I think a lot of work was put into them. Even those will smaller roles were interesting, but there are some who are fascinating to watch, such as Hidetora, his change throughout the film is quite remarkable, he goes from being a rather proud, pompous unlikeable man to a man who has lost his mind to a man who has discovered himself and wants forgiveness for his sins. Another character that is interesting to watch is the \"fool\" Kyoami who at first seems rather insignificant but later becomes one of the main characters and is very important for his role in the events that take place. \r\nI liked the fact that each character was easily identifiable, on previous Kurosawa films I have sometimes been confused to who some characters were exactly, but in Ran it\u0092s much clearer. \r\n\r\nThe soundtrack is interesting, I can't say I like it but I don't really think it was meant to be enjoyable or even likeable. I think it evokes the main theme of the film which is Chaos perfectly so in my opinion it succeeds at what it was intended for. \r\n\r\nWell I think I\u0092ve said enough about the technical aspects of the film and the various qualities, so I think I\u0092ll say a bit about the themes and the overall message of the film which is very important. \r\n\r\nOne theme that is ever present and mostly quite dominant is that of Chaos, the events are chaotic and unpredictable; often moments of calm are quickly destroyed by moments of violence all of which are sudden.  \r\nThe absence of religion is also a sign of the Chaos, the only religious character is Lady Sue and her fate is tragic, when the fool Kyoami curses the gods Tango replies that the gods cannot save them from themselves. The gods play no part in this film, it only shows the cruelty of man. \r\n\r\nThe strong theme of nihilism is present especially towards the end, Saburo\u0092s death just as victory was attained, the murder of lady Sue just when you thought the bloodshed was over, the fate of Tsurumaru... \r\n\r\nI thought the way Kurosawa used Tsurumaru standing alone and blind on top of a ruined castle with an image of Buddha that he dropped lying in the darkness to be very powerful and very clear; Kurosawa was showing modern mans condition. \r\n\r\nThe way good characters are slain pointlessly such as Saburo and Lady Sue and the way evil characters continue to do their evil deeds until they meet violent ends such as Jiro and Lady Kaede is quite depressing, Ran is easily one of Kurosawa\u0092s darker works, it doesn\u0092t contain such deeds of heroism as the Seven Samourai, instead heroic men are treacherously gunned down by faceless enemies. \r\n\r\nKurosawa made this film at a very difficult period of his life, he was going blind, he had attempted suicide and his wife died during production. But he continued work relentlessly and ended up with one of the finest and most powerful films ever made, and I admire him greatly for that.\r\n\r\nIf you haven\u0092t seen this film then delay no longer, it is essential viewing although grim and dark in tone it will not leave you unaffected. But if you are like the people I have seen give bad reviews to this film because it was too long or too boring then I suggest you stay away from it and be content with latest Hollywood Blockbuster.",

Adapted by Kurosawa from Shakespeare's King Lear, Ran undoubtedly features amongst the best works of the master director. It captures with sheer vividness and surreal resplendence, the true essence of human struggle for survival, highlighting the cruelties associated with life. Ran is strictly indicative of the sole consistency of life i.e. change, an attribute that not only makes the humans vulnerable but also gives them the hope to rise after a fall. The brilliantly captured scenes are breathtaking to say the least, especially the war scene that depicts fate casting the final blow to the ruthless reign of the warlord. The brutality and the bloodshed depicted in the very scene can make even a cold-blooded appear jittery. Ran portrays the poetic justice in such a relentless and abominable fashion that one can't help but sympathize with the narcissistic warlord, who spent his life arrogating and annihilating the innocent souls. The plaintive score gives the movie a much desired tone, a mood that not only supports its melancholic backdrop, but also immensely adds to its poignant beauty.. Ran is a classic example of Kurosawa's brilliance and perhaps a consummation of his artistic direction.",

            "content": "Ran could have been a victory lap. In 1950 Akira Kurosawa turned the conventions of film narrative on their ear with Rashomon, a film so unlike anything before it that Kurosawa's producers and actors insisted it didn't make sense (it did), and in 1954 he made The Seven Samurai which is not only the most influential action/adventure movie of all time, but is one of the 4 or 5 best movies ever made by anyone. With a handful of other classics thrown in for good measure (Ikiru, Throne of Blood, Yojimbo), Kurosawa's place as one of the masters of cinema is undeniable. By 1985, he had absolutely nothing to prove, except maybe to himself.\r\n\r\nBy the late 60s Kurosawa's native Japan had turned on him, declaring that his style had become too westernized and he was essentially banished from the Japanese studio system. He was signed to work on his first American film in 1970, but was fired by 20th Century Fox. He attempted suicide, his eyesight was going, and nobody wanted to finance his films. To make things worse, at the ripe age of 65, Kurosawa had his biggest idea yet, a massive adaptation of Shakespeare's King Lear set amongst the warlords of 15th century Japan. He spent ten years storyboarding the shots for the film he would call Run (which translates to chaos or revolt), designing the costumes, and most importantly, trying to rustle up the money to make what would eventually be the most expensive production in Japanese history. After this decade of preparation, he would team with French film producer Serge Silberman, and Ran would finally get off the ground. \r\n\r\nLike Lear, Ran begins with a man dividing his land among his children. Lord Hidetora has spent his whole life taking over all the land he could see, and killing everyone who stood in his way. Now, in his 70s he has given his land to his three sons in hopes that this will allow him to live his remaining years in peace. What he's actually done, is given everybody access to an army. This is Kurosawa's bleakest film, a sense of dread hangs over all the proceedings. This may also be Kurosawa's deepest work thematically: madness, honor, death, war, sex, God, and family are all within the auteur's wide grasp.\r\n\r\nVisually, Kurosawa has few equals. He fills every inch of the frame with his unique mixture of authenticity and artistry. It's not just the cinematography, which is of course exhilarating, it's the production design, the costumes, the make up. Ran is a complete visual experience. Kurosawa's battle scenes are a reminder of just how poorly most battle scenes are filmed. Instead of obsessing over trying to make the audience feel like we're in the middle of the action (which we never really will anyway) Kurosawa pulls back and let's us see the whole gruesome spectacle. The majesty, the violence, the hatred.\r\n\r\nWhat stands out about Ran for me, as it does for all Kurosawa's work, is his purity as a storyteller. He's the undeniable master of the cinematic epic (David Lean is #2 and then it's a long way down to #3), and you can't make films with the weight and length that he does without perfect pacing. A Kurosawa film is never rushed, never hectic, but also never boring and never lethargic. He always moves at just the right speed, and for the life of me I can't point out an example of this aspect of his genius. So, how did he do it? Why did his films move so much more smoothly then other filmmakers? It must come from inside of him. No, tricks, no techniques, this is the only way he knew how to tell a story. He probably never even thought about it, and that is the sign of a great filmmaker.\r\n\r\nRan is brilliant in every way a film can be brilliant. It strikes us in our hearts, our heads, and our eyes. I would be remiss if I didn't mention the philosophy that Kurosawa so tastefully sprinkled through all of his movies. His films were always full of interesting questions, and in Ran he poses one of his toughest. Is God somehow permissive of human atrocity or having created human beings is He Himself powerless to stop us?",

Key characters are evident, but they are supplemented by secondary characters who have a forceful and memorable impact on the story.  Kurisawa also injects a fool, or jester, who provides continuous insight, musings, and commentary on the madness that surrounds him.\r\n\r\nSome may have issues with the subtitles, and discerning who's who in the various personal conflicts and armed battles.

However, his son's have other ideas about how to deal with the old man who relinquished his power, but wants to retain his status of Great Lord.  The cinematography is gorgeous, and the battle scenes are an achievement all by themselves.  In this day of CGI all battle scenes feature hundreds of computer-generated extras: not Kurosawa.  His film is filled with hundreds, probably thousands of extras, but more then being a fight movie, it is also a tragic tale of how a father was overthrown by his sons' greed.  SEE IT ALREADY!",

Kurosawa does an excellent job once again with the cinematography. Yet, in my opinion, its not one of Kurosawa's best works.All of the characters with the exception of Saburo were rotten to the core acting entirely out of self-interest. While such a characterization may have been part of the message Kurosawa sought to get through, I found it difficult to truly accept the almost exaggerated egotism of many of the characters. I think the work was also hindered by Kurosawa's close adherence to the Shakespearean play, King Lear. In doing so, it really limited the originality of the film as a whole.",

A companion piece, as it were, to three previous Kurosawa films, \"Seven Samurai\", \"Throne of Blood\", and \"Kagemusha\", but \"Ran\" stands alone as the pessimistic, apocalyptic vision of a master filmmaker who feels his time may be near, and though he'd still make films for another eight years, this is the film that effectively sums up his career, both glorious, difficult, and overwhelmingly dark, a devastating portrait of human frailty, greed, and betrayal at it's bleakest.  But the colors, the amazing reds, yellows, and greens, and the Oscar winning costumes, remain warm and bright, a lovely vision of purity amongst constant decay.

Personally, I do not give out perfect ratings often. Every few months, maybe more, a film comes along that stuns me so thoroughly that a rating that is not a perfect score feels like heresy. Ran is that kind of film. From the story to the score to the cinematography to the colors, the film is a lyrical and poetic masterpiece from director Akira Kurosawa. Based on King Lear, Ran depicts the transfer of power from an old Lord to his eldest son, only for him to be subjected to watching his three sons destroy all that he built. A film about chaos of the mind and the world, Ran develops themes of family, respect, honor, nihilism, and postmodernism. An epic of profound scope, delicately brought to life by Kurosawa, Ran  is a film that immediately becomes one of my personal favorites.Depicting the fall of the House of Ichimonji (fake), Ran is an exercise in trusting and respecting those that you what is on their mind, rather than lie to your face but cover it in complimentary words. In this way, Great Lord Hidetora (Tatsuya Nakadai) is doomed to watch his lands fall to ruin after opting to trust those that to lie to him, if only because they bowed before him when they did it. Though the sons will be blamed for fracturing the family, in many ways, Hidetora fractured the family and the family was always doomed to fail. As he had three sons, the power struggle would have continued no matter when Hidetora died. In many ways, this could be described as Ran's way of showing that our actions do not mean anything (nihilism) and everything is pre-determined for us (free-will or lack thereof). This is even mentioned by one character who says to not blame the gods for what occurs because everything has already been determined. Thus, it can certainly be concluded that the Ichimonji were doomed from the start to fracture. However, by trusting his unfaithful sons over his most faithful son because he spoke his mind, Hidetora merely sped up the demise.Additionally, Ran is an exercise in violence begetting violence. Towards the end, when Hidetora's life is one again struck with tragedy at the hands of his son's violence towards one another, he asks \"Is there no justice?\" Though his pain is authentic and he is incredibly sympathetic, Hidetora losing his sons to war is justice in its purest form. Throughout the film, we see castles of lords killed by Hidetora. We are introduced to daughters that were witnesses to Hidetora slaughtering their families, only to then be married off to one of Hidetora's sons. For Hidetora to suffer as he made others suffer - by watching his family be destroyed - is justice and demonstrates that you \"reap what you sow\" and \"violence begets violence\".Ran also heavily discusses chaos. In fact, its title translates to \"chaos\". Yet, the chaos in the film is two-fold: of the mind and of the world. As he family falls apart, Hidetora goes mad. His mind is very literally chaos. Though he has moments of lucidity, his insanity destroys his mind and memory, causing him to forget what his sons look like and forgetting who a faithful servant was. All of these moments are painful to see, in particular with the servant. Faithful from the beginning, Kyoami (Shinnosuke Ikehata) is distraught to see his master forget who he is and the audience certainly feels his pain. The madness of Hidetora, however, is matched by the now war torn region he is surrounded by. With bloodshed, plots for power, and intrafamily conflicts, there is very little chaos and the film reflects this with long, drawn out battle sequences highlighting every element of brutality. Though chaos appears to happen quickly from the outside, it actually comes from very precise and small steps and Ran goes to great lengths to show the slow descent into chaos experienced by the House of Ichimonji. From plotting wives to power hungry siblings, the collapse is hardly a gradual one.As with many Japanese films, Ran also delves into themes of family, respect, and loyalty. In particular, respect and loyalty are a large element of the film. With long scenes of men showcasing their loyalty by bowing or following their master into battle, Ran develops a constant theme of loyalty. Though some loyal men die, their loyalty is always celebrated, in particular when they do not stay quiet and instead speak their minds. Even if rebuked, they are proven to be right in the end and their original objections were proven to be justified. Had their warnings been headed, the collapse of the Ichimonj would not have happened. As such, Ran could be called a celebration of contrarians. Though they are unpopular figures, the words they speak come from the heart and should be heard clearly, in order to avoid making a fatal error.",

To me, from head to toe, this Kurosawa's picture which symbolizes downfall is absolute stunning  such gorgeousness in a film is utterly rare, and of course, it is one of the Kurosawa's many best films. Ran is a success  having nominated for Academy Awards for best art direction, best cinematography, best costume design and best direction and won one. Ran was also nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Foreign Language Film.\r I repeat this  Ran, from head to toe, is absolutely stunning, and of course this movie is perfect. The film's cinematography, which is top notch, is a killer. The way Kurosawa captured the images of burning castle, a moving horses, dead soldiers, battle scenes are all undeniably respectable, and sublime too, and one great example would be the scenes where the attack of the third castle was occurring. Very much in evidence that Kurosawa's talent in film-making is transcending. The film's script which was being written by Kurosawa himself, Hideo Oguni and Masato Ide is yet admirable. The exploitation on poetic lines are proved to be effective and fitting for the movie.\r One would see great performances in Ran. Good acting by the players, but to me, the two actors who stood up above the rest are Tatsuya Nakadai and Mieko Harada. Tatsuya Nakadai plays the great lord Tatsuya Nakadai. The great lord is old, fragile and somewhat defenseless and the character is well characterized by him. Mieko Harada plays a female villain Lady Kaede, whose character is hungry for revenge. Her amazing performance which is raw and gripping, plays a very important part for the success of the movie.\r Surely there are several movie elements which are worthy to be carried out for discussions, but to me, the main highlight of Ran is its cinematography, and it is one hell of a show.\r [10/10]\r Facebook (http://facebook.com/alex.desmall) Twitter (@Alex_DeSmall) (http://www.rottentomatoes.com/member/AlexDesmall)",

The music is rousing and haunting, almost sometimes paying homage to Mahler, the script is literate and thoughtful and the story intensely moving. Add to that Kurasawa's ever immaculate direction and the truly remarkable lead performance Tatsuya Nakadai and you have an even more brilliant film. Rounding off is the truly Machiavellian performance of Mieko Harada as the daughter-in-law figure. The over-two-and-a-half-hour length and slow pacing didn't hinder Ran in the slightest, at least to me anyway, though some not used to Kurasawa's style may be deterred.

When I first saw this movie in 1985 I just knew if was a great movie. I was totally captivated by the Attack on the Third Castle(which I still am) but it has now become obvious to me how all truly great works of art are hopelessly(hopefully?) entangled with the Biblical worldview(even if the director doesn\u2019t embrace that view.) Although you would expect Kurosawa to be a Buddhist he seems to acknowledge that the Eightfold Path does not succeed in conquering suffering. Indeed, the son who returns at the end does \u201cnot\u201d cure the chaos(oh how Kurosawa could have used the conquering Messiah of the Christian faith here!) Tsurumaru\u2019s drop of the Amira Buddha image near the end also seems to indicate a lack of faith in the Buddhist way.But the other Christian themes reflected in the quotes above are beautifully explored here.Mise en sc\u00e8ne Score(20/20) Kurosawa is a master here. The scene in which Hidetora exits the Second Castle is gorgeous. As is the overhead shot in the ruins with Hidetora and Kyoami. Although the Attack on the Third Castle is not static there are many powerful images here as well. The final shot of Tsurumaru matches the bleakness of the final shot in Vertigo, and repeats the theme of a fall from great height(The Garden of Eden?)The Attack on the Third Castle(30/30) If this isn\u2019t the greatest sequence in movie history it is surely the greatest sequence without dialogue. How can such carnage be so captivatingly presented? This type of \u201coperatic\u201d violence is what Peckinpah presents at the end of \u201cWild Bunch\u201d but raised to a higher degree.Proverbs 22:6 Score(30/30) The inverse holds true as well. Even though Saburo escapes this tendency(by the grace of God?) he can\u2019t save the day in the end.Revenge vs. Forgiveness/Loyalty Score(10/10) The sins of Hidetora, Taro and Jiro come full circle as Lady Kaede takes her revenge. But Lady Su\u00e9\u2019s way of forgiveness, and the loyalty of Tango and Kyoami, stand out as the way forward.Acting Score(4/5) Hidetora\u2019s death seemed overacted to me.Worldview Score(4/5) Perfect presentation of our hopeless state without God. What Kurosawa needs is the nun from Vertigo to offer hope.98/100",
