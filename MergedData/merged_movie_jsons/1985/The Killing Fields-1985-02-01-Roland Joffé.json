            "content": "Thoughtful and thought-provoking war-drama based on the memoirs of N.Y. Times correspondent named Sidney (Sam Waterston) and his relationship to journalist assistant and guide named Pran (Haing S Ngor ) . Extraordinary feature debut for Ngor who won Best Supporting Actor Academy Award . Haing S. Ngor a real-life doctor who had never acted before and who lived through the deeds depicted at the movie , he became the first Southeast Asian , and the first Buddhist , to win an Oscar ; furthermore also first film for John Malkovich who gives an awesome portrayal as an intrepid photographer . Ngor's own experiences (in real life he lived Cambodian war ) echoed those of his character and usually played Vietnam roles (Tortures of war, Heaven and Earth , In love and war , Vietnam Texas , Eastern condor) until his violent death by an Asian band . This exciting story depicts the war chaos , Cambodian turmoil and primal bloodletting , but most of the movie is a shattering re-creation of hell on Earth . Marvellous cinematography by Chris Menges who also deservedly won Academy Award and filmed in Phuket , Railway Hotel , Hua Hin, Thailand and Royal York Hotel , Toronto, Ontario, Canada . Screeching and sensitive musical score by Mike Oldfield that accompanies perfectly to the film . Roland Joffe's direction shows a generally sure-hand with a bit of melodrama at the end . Alain Resnais's seminal documentary \u00a8Nuit et Brouillard (1955)\u00a8 was a touch-point for both director Roland Joff\u00e9 and prestigious producer David Puttnam when they were preparing this magnificent movie .This excellent movie contains a relentless criticism to Pol Pot regime , but also US and an exact description about historic events . In power , the Khmer Rouge carried out a radical program that included isolating the country from foreign influence, closing schools, hospitals and factories, abolishing banking, finance and currency, outlawing all religions, confiscating all private property and relocating people from urban areas to collective farms where forced labor was widespread. The purpose of this policy was to turn Cambodians into \"Old People\" through agricultural labor. These actions resulted in massive deaths through executions, work exhaustion, illness, and starvation. In Phnom Penh and other cities, the Khmer Rouge told residents that they would be moved only about \"two or three kilometers\" outside the city and would return in \"two or three days.\" Some witnesses say they were told that the evacuation was because of the \"threat of American bombing\" and that they did not have to lock their houses since the Khmer Rouge would \"take care of everything\" until they returned.Money was abolished, books were burned, teachers, merchants, and almost the entire intellectual elite of the country were murdered, to make the agricultural communism, as Pol Pot envisioned it, a reality. The planned relocation to the countryside resulted in the complete halt of almost all economic activity: even schools and hospitals were closed, as well as banks, and industrial and service companies.During their four years in power, the Khmer Rouge overworked and starved the population, at the same time executing selected groups who had the potential to undermine the new state (including intellectuals or even those that had stereotypical signs of learning, such as glasses) and killing many others for even breaching minor rules . The Khmer Rouge forced people to work for 12 hours non-stop, without adequate rest or food. They did not believe in western medicine but instead favoured traditional peasant medicine; many died as a result. Family relationships not sanctioned by the state were also banned, and family members could be put to death for communicating with each other. In any case, family members were often relocated to different parts of the country with all postal and telephone services abolished. They committed crimes against humanity , the Khmer Rouge government arrested, tortured and eventually executed anyone suspected of belonging to several categories of supposed \"enemies\". Today, examples of the torture methods used by the Khmer Rouge can be seen at the Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum. The museum occupies the former grounds of a high school turned prison camp that was operated by Khang Khek Ieu, more commonly known as \"Comrade Duch\". Some 17,000 people passed through this centre before they were taken to sites (also known as The Killing Fields), outside Phnom Penh where most were executed (mainly by pickaxes to save bullets) and buried in mass graves . Of the thousands who entered the Tuol Sleng Centre (also known as S-21), only twelve are known to have survived.",

            "content": "Based on the Khmer Rouge revolution in Cambodia, this is an excellent tale of hardship and friendship. Basically director Roland Joffe` did an wonderful job in exposing the detailed facts so simply in the film that you believe that you are in that time in person. The two actors, Sam Waterson and Haing Ngor both displayed godlike pieces of acting. It's unfortunate Waterson couldn't join Ngor in Academy Awards. In addition, the director's credit is to highlight both the characters' points of view. That's why the movie became so interesting to watch. John Malkovich brought out a fine performance as a photographer. In the course of the story of adventures of the two men, the film also has vivid descriptions of the public life during the war. Several detailed scenes of war violence are presented here so indifferently that you are bound to be convinced about its historical accuracy. Here we find the magical cinematography of Chris Menges. Again, during the time of Dith Pran's suffering, it never seemed that the director is showing too much.One of the most important, and my favorite, aspects of the film is its ending. You cannot imagine of a better alternative of this happiest ending possible in a war drama. And with the fantastic use of Lennon's \"imagine\", it has got to an enormous height of perfection. 5/5.",

            "content": "*Some spoilers*Complex & historically rich, THE KILLING FIELDS is closely based upon New York Times journalist Sydney Schanberg's 'The Life And Death Of Dith Pran.' Schanberg was a stringer for the Times during the Vietnam War, and was stationed in Phnom Penh in the early 1970s as once-neutral Cambodia was overrun by outside interference (US and North Vietnam), and collapsed into an explosively violent civil war. Schanberg reported extensively on this war, assisted by Cambodian photojournalist Dith Pran, and this film does an adequate job of introducing the complexities of it \u0096 the rightist government (which was nominally US-backed - not touched upon during the film) quickly became paralyzed by inaction, stunning levels of corruption and ineptness. Simultaneously, the mysterious other side (deemed Les Khmer Rouges by the deposed Prince Noorodom Sihanouk) fought with near-incomprehensible ferocity, maintaining an impenetrable veil of secrecy about their ideology and future plans for Cambodia. With the Cambodian government(the Khmer Republic) soon in a swift free-fall, the American embassy was closed on April 10, 1975 and Americans \u0096 along with some Cambodians \u0096 were airlifted out. After painful debate, Schanberg and Pran opted to remain, in an attempt at covering the now-imminent fall of Phnom Penh. Seven days later, the Khmer Rouge (K.R.) captured the city \u0096 the dying government shuddering to a surrender, and Schanberg and Pran went into hiding in the French embassy. The finest moments of the film are the depictions of the chaos, desperation and crowding at the French compound \u0096 the intent and future behavior of the K.R. were not well-known at this point (right up to, and for a considerable amount of time after their victory they operated in absolute, cult-like secrecy), and the sense of oncoming apocalypse is perfectly expressed with a subtle, seemingly-throwaway line delivered at this point by a French diplomat: \"Adieu, ancien regime,\" as an official from the now-overthrown Khmer republican government was lead away at gunpoint, and the sound of massacres could be heard all over the city. Pran was stranded in the country as the K.R. immediately launched one of the most infamous revolutions in world history, ordering cities emptied of their populations in an attempt at creating an isolationist agricultural utopia, and dismantling 'bourgeois' institutions. The ideology of the K.R. (critical to understanding the tragic depths of the story, and skimmed over in the film) was essentially a blend of the most extreme theories of Mao and Stalin, mixed with a strand of nationalism rivaling any variant of fascism in its ferocity. In this harshly reconstructed society, urbanites and the educated (like Pran) were automatically considered enemies of the people, likely to be killed as potential counterrevolutionaries. Forced into a gulag in the countryside, Pran camouflages his background, but is still subjected to the brutalities inflicted upon many of his comrades. Upon hearing that Vietnam has invaded Cambodia, Pran flees into the bush, gradually making his way to the Thai border. Word reaches Schanberg, who has been searching for Pran for nearly four years (Cambodia had been sealed off from the outside world), and the two are reunited in a refugee camp in Eastern Thailand. KILLING FIELDS is a gripping film, successful on many fronts. Filmed in Thailand, the performances seem very authentic, and the period setting is painstakingly recreated. The cinematography has an impressive John Ford grandeur. Thus my main problems with the film amount to hairsplitting: the Mike (ugh) Oldfield score is abysmal, and at least one otherwise great scene (the US embassy evacuation) is ruined by it. A little more digging into some of the political ideologies swirling around the actual events would give the later scenes (Pran in one of the KR collectives) needed context. Other commentators here have already noted the inapproriateness of Lennon's 'Imagine' at the films' end, and the mercifully brief Schanberg-at-home scenes during the latter half of the film are a bit much.Very intense - as doctor-survivor-actor Haing S. Ngor \u0096 who won an Oscar for his portrayal of Pran \u0096 stated in 'A Cambodian Odyssey,' - his own autobiography: \"Had the film portrayed the actual severity of what had occurred, no one would've been able to sit through it.\" This is easily among the most harrowing tales of friendship and loyalty to have ever made it to the big screen; even with minor problems, a film very much worth seeing.",

            "content": "Rating: **** Out of ****Hard to say, but I believe when it comes to the war genre, The Killing Fields manages to edge out even Saving Private Ryan, and without a doubt, there's no better war film out there that's done a better job of capturing the realistic details and emotional loss of the time period (that being, the 70's in Cambodia/Vietnam).Thus, I've always considered it a little odd that no one I know has even heard of this film. When lists of the greatest war films are decided, I don't believe I've ever seen this film crack any list. And the reason is simple: The Killing Fields is often ignored because it doesn't come from a soldier's point of view, and neither does it feature any adrenaline-pumping battle sequences. The fact that a strong portion of the film (about 2/5's) comes entirely from a Cambodian man's viewpoint might throw off a few viewers here and there. And yet, the film does just as fine a job as any anti-war film in creating a frightenining, chaotic world.The performances all around superb without exception. Haing S. Ngor, who was tragically killed a few years ago, delivers a riveting, emotionally wrenching turn as the guide who is trapped in Cambodia and forced to fight for his life. He deservingly won the Oscar, though it's a shame he was snubbed for the best actor award. Inarguably, he's the film's central character and he also has more screen time than top-billed Sam Waterston. Despite my complaint on that matter, Waterston is also excellent as the journalist with a guilty conscience.The Killing Fields is a suspenseful and exhilarating experience, a journey through an apocalyptic landscape that features one shocking image after another. Watch, and you'll see why the film is so acclaimed.",

            "content": "Without doubt THE KILLING FIELDS is one of the greatest films ever to have come out of Britain . The cinematography is outstanding , watch the numerous scenes where someone runs past the camera and the camera follows them only to have the camera follow someone else when they run past it , or the way the camera spins around when the journalists are captured outside the hospital , but this film is rightly remembered for one man : Haing S Ngor , a Cambodian doctor who had his own horrors to tell after nearly being captured by the Khmer Rouge ( !!!! POSSIBLE SPOILER !!!!!) the scene near the end where he sees the red cross refugee camp in Thailand  is one of the most moving in the history of cinema .I won`t bother to list all the great things about the film , but I will reply to some criticisms . First of all the anti American slant . Well I think we can all agree that America`s intervention in South East Asia in the 1960s has been the greatest mistake in American history . Their war in Vietnam and the bombing of Cambodia and Laos caused the massive instability that led to the rise of Pol Pot and as THE KILLING FIELDS shows when the Americans fought and lost they abandoned the Cambodian people to their fate. I also agree that the music can be intrusive but has anyone noticed that we get string orchestras for Dith Pran and ordinary Cambodian civilians and mechanical synthesisers for KR killers ? I think there`s a reason for this . My only other criticism is that after reading Christopher Hudson`s novelization the script makes makes some of the characters vague like Noakes and Rosa for example . But there`s not much wrong with THE KILLING FIELDS , a throwback to a time when Brits made films that weren`t comedies , though I`ll be the first to admit that this film won`t be to everyone`s taste .\nAnd as I write this review many years after it was made THE KILLING FIELDS does have an added poignancy today . Dr Haing S Ngor was brutally murdered by a street gang for no reason at all several years ago . And we see Sydney Schanberg looking across the New York skyline with a very prominent shot of the twin towers of the WTC",

            "content": "I don't think even this picture can accurately convey the horror of the Khmer Rouge and their policy of Cambodian genocide during the era of the mid-Seventies. It was a terrible time for that country with estimates upward of three million Cambodians massacred by the Pol Pot regime, and all because of an extreme combination of Marxism, Khmer nationalism and xenophobia. When Dith Pran (Haing S. Ngor) stumbled onto the 'Killing Fields' of the film's title while attempting to escape the barbarism of his captors, one can only look on in fascination at an impossibly grotesque landscape. With a more than obvious slant regarding the Khmer Rouge as a by-product of American bombing in Cambodia, one might balance that view with a more careful reading of history, but even so, historians still fall on both sides of the matter. In any case, Cambodia was one of the dominoes that fell during this period with the help of the North Vietnamese Army during the early Seventies.Haing S. Ngor was a fledgling actor when he appeared in this film as Cambodian journalist Dith Pran but one wouldn't know it. The picture and story becomes his following the evacuation of Phnom Penh and the victory of the Khmer Rouge rebels. One can't imagine what emotions and hardships the real Dith Pran must have undergone after the American contingent left. Surviving in turn by drinking cattle blood and relentlessly pursuing any possible means of escape, his story is one for the ages regarding one man's quest for freedom and dignity. There also comes a moment in the film when while viewing today, there's the added poignancy of observing the Twin Towers looming above a New York City landscape when Sydney Schanberg (Sam Waterston) returns home from his Cambodian assignment. To my mind, I don't know of any other film that touches on the Cambodian War and it's attendant horror the way this one does. It was a time when, as Dith Pran so accurately stated at one point - \"The enemy is inside us. No one can be trusted.\" With all that, there's only one question I have about the making of the film and choice of scenic backdrops for much of the action, and that is, just how many times do you think it was necessary to be subjected to all that product placement by Coca-Cola?",

            "content": "Oh, this brings me back alright. It was the last days of 1984, and earnest college students like me had much to talk about. Wasn't it wonderful that Walter Mondale had chosen a strong woman like Geraldine Ferraro to be his running mate, and wouldn't the Democrats sweep the Northeast at least for that brave move? Does buying a Coke at the local convenience store signal support for the apartheid government in South Africa? Did anyone else see that amazing film about the human price of American involvement in Southeast Asia?It's nearly 20 years later, and I've managed to shake the ill effects of my youthful liberalism easily enough in most cases. This film, however, packs the kind of punch that isn't explained away by political trendiness.\"The Killing Fields\" is a great film that tries and succeeds in capturing much of the carnage and tragedy of Cambodia as the radicalized Khmer Rouge and the U.S.-backed regime of Lon Nol controlling Phnom Penh clash in a fight to the death to be/not be the next domino in the Communist rollover in Southeast Asia. By particularizing the conflict to that of the true-life relationship of two men, New York Times reporter Syndey Schanberg and his Cambodian apprentice and aide-de-camp, Dith Pran, the film forces a level of empathy that is at once uncomfortable and absorbing. It is possible to walk away from this film hating the manipulation, the America-bashing, the easy liberal guilt. But it's impossible to walk away from the human experience borne witness to before the movie's done, if one has any pretense of being human, and that's its great strength.Oh, it's polemical alright. We hear comments about how the Khmer Rouge's excesses were the direct result of Nixon's secret bombing campaign. (U.S. Counsel: \"After what the Khmer Rouge have been through, I don't think they'll be exactly affectionate toward Westerners.\" Schanberg: \"Maybe we underestimated the anger $7 billion in bombing would unleash.\") It makes its point, absolves Pol Pot and condemns Kissinger with the same broad brush, and it feels a bit jaded and hollow for that, but I don't know. Schanberg betrays the attitudes of a knee-jerk liberal, and I outgrew that, and maybe I feel superior for that, but Schanberg had AK-47s pointed at his head by 12-year-old brainwashed boys, and I didn't, so shut up already, know what I mean?The performances are incredible in their verisimilitude, particularly the leads. Sam Waterson burns with righteous anger as Schanberg, and I like his performance for what it is and how he creates that extra level of tension, but he's a butterfly compared to the condor that's Dr. Haing S. Ngor, one of the Academy's most obscure best supporting actor recipients (there was even a joke about it in an episode of \"The Simpsons\") but someone who didn't just walk the walk. He relived his experience surviving a holocaust that was, per square mile, even more savage than the Holocaust itself. The fact he won a Best Supporting Actor award (Waterson instead was nominated for Best Actor, and lost to F. Murray Abraham for \"Amadeus\") is one of those perversities of film history, given he carries more of the film than Waterson (who slinks to the background two-thirds of the way in) but also that he personalizes the story in a way that makes the incomprehensible immediate and involving.We lost Ngor to a senseless murder a few years ago, and have little left to explain what was going through his mind as he relived an experience that cost him his wife and child when he actually lived through it. Roland Joffe does a nice job in the DVD commentary, though, a commentary I put up there with P. T. Anderson's \"Boogie Nights\" and William Peter Blatty's \"The Ninth Configuration\" for being worth the price of the DVD and then some by itself. He recalls Ngor's reaction to one child actress whose hard face in enacting a scene convinced Ngor she wasn't just pretending to be Khmer Rouge, and Ngor's request that Joffe participate in one critical scene by muttering real torments Ngor suffered at the hands of the \"KR\" as a way of enhancing his performance. At one point, trying to convince him to come aboard, Joffe said something about Ngor owing it to his country to bear witness to his story, and that of Dith Pran, and that did the trick, though Joffe seems to wonder if the same sort of manipulation Schanberg pulled on Pran wasn't going on here, too.It's a great movie because it doesn't shy away from uncomfortable truths, because it never loses sight of the human dimension, and because it gave a pretense of understanding to one of the great human traumas after World War II. We never wallow in gore, but the cost of this war is always with us while we watch. The experience is both endurable and humiliating.I just wish they reshot that ending, with \"Imagine.\" Joffe in his commentary even notes the lyrics are the sort of thing Pol Pot would have gone along with. It feels forced. Did Yoko Ono give her approval after they explained the scene her dead husband's song would appear in, or after they told her the first nasty execution scene would be shot while \"Band On The Run\" issued forth from a soldier's radio?A great movie, of an awful moment in human history. If we have any chance of overcoming man's sorry past, it will be because movies like this one get made once in a while.",

It is so important, now as ever, for everyone to understand what evil truly is. This movie shows evil in its worst form: the form of mass murder thinly disguised as ideological cleansing.What makes this film so special is not only the bare-faced method of its delivery (including some horrid shots of the dumping grounds of the murdered), but the way the film keeps a decidedly Southeast Asian feel. The filmmakers worked to keep that style, in the scenery, the music, the set design, and, most importantly, by keeping the Cambodian journalist front-and-center in most scenes. In fact, the only time the film doesn't work is when it focuses on the New York Times reporter (the main reason I give this film a 9 instead of a 10 are the pace-stealing scenes stateside). Far too often we only see such stories from our own viewpoint, it's incredibly refreshing (and bold) to film a story like this from the viewpoint of the foreign country whose ruin was precipitated by the careless policies of our own government.Wonderfully filmed, well acted, brilliantly scripted, The Killing Fields is a timeless, important classic.

Through all of this, I learned about Cambodia. It wasn't until I was fifteen that I saw \"The Killing Fields\", and I was horrified at the Khmer Rouge's brutality. You can't even begin to imagine the awful things that they did until you see the movie.I also read Haing Ngor's autobiography \"A Cambodian Odyssey\". What he experienced was basically the same as what \"The Killing Fields\" portrays. But the really surprising part is that of all the groups who were in power in Cambodia during Haing Ngor's life there, the Khmer Rouge were the most honest. The French were the colonizers, Prince Sihanouk was a royalist who suppressed the insurgent movements, Lon Nol was a military ruler installed by the CIA, and then the Khmer Rouge. When US planes started bombing the countryside after Lon Nol came to power in 1970, the Khmer Rouge explained to the Cambodian people what was going on. So, the people began supporting the Khmer Rouge. So whether or not anyone wants to admit it, the Khmer Rouge were driven to their actions (although that's still no justification for their atrocities).The whole issue is so complex, that it takes a while to think about. But either way, you have to see this movie.",

            "content": "\"Cambodia is the Nixon Doctrine in its purest form.\" - Dick Nixon\n\"People starve, but we must not grow food.\" - Dith Pran on the Angka (Pol Pot's regime)Gut-wrenching stuff. A tale of friendship, the senseless carnage of war, the importance of a free press, the sins of America, and the cruelty of communism under Pol Pot. Mostly it shows incredible courage set to human tragedy and the jaw-dropping scenery of Cambodia. The cinematography is sublime, the gore, often to innocent people and their kids, is horrifying.As moving as the film is, I wish it had been told completely from the POV of Dith Pran (Haing S. Ngor), the Cambodian translator/journalist who ends up imprisoned after his family and Western journalists escape (including those played by Sam Waterston and John Malkovich). I would have liked to have seen his family life before the war, the dialogue in Khmer subtitled, and a little more Cambodian context. The first half of the film is certainly good, but suffers because of its attention on the Western journalists.However, it begins soaring at about the 90 minute point when Waterston is sitting in his NY apartment listening to Nessun Dorma from Puccini's Turnadot, and then cuts to Pran toiling in the mud with other captives at gunpoint. Those moments gave me goosebumps. We then see Pran suffering at the hands of brainwashed kids who are toting weapons and putting the populace through reeducation camps, and it's gripping. I can think of few better scenes that depict the horror of war and genocide than when he stumbles through that endless field of skulls and bones. Whenever the film focused on Waterston or Malkovich, such as that silly argument they have in the bathroom, my interest waned a bit, even though I admired the courage of the characters and their convictions.That second half overall is brilliant though, and it's inspiring that it's a true story, with Pran ultimately joining his friend at The New York Times. That last line, coming from a guy who has been through hell, is stunning: \"Nothing to forgive, Sydney. Nothing.\" It's too bad it's set to John Lennon's Imagine; as fantastic as that song is (probably my all-time favorite), it's misplaced here.",

            "content": "Sam Waterston is Sidney Schanberg, a reporter working for the New York Times in the midst of a civil war in Cambodia in the early 70s. His dedicated interpreter is Dith Pran. In and around the capital are a few dozen other reporters and diplomatic personnel, including photographers John Malkovich and Julian Sands. It's dangerous work.Briefly, the Khmer Rouge win the battle for the country. The Westerners, towards whom the rebels have no reason to feel grateful, are penned up in the French embassy and finally thrown out of Cambodia. The Cambodians who have been associated with the West are sent to forced labor camps. They include Dith Pran, who has elected to stay with Schanberg because \"I am a journalist too, Sidney.\" Waterston, Malkovich, and Sands try desperately to forge a passport for Pran but the attempt fails.Pran is beaten and tortured and finally escapes from the camp, only to face even more appalling horrors on his trek to safety. Meanwhile, Schanberg collects prizes in New York while agonizing over Pran's incommunicado.It's an outstanding film in almost every way. Haing Ngor won an award for his performance as Dith Pran and, in fact, he's quite good, stoic and frightened at the same time. But the story is Schanberg's because he's the person who has something to learn -- and learns it.Waterston's handling of the Schanberg role is more than adequate. He's able to capture Schanberg's New England accent with no trouble. Waterston himself was born in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and was graduated from Yale. But he does more than just play with a regional accent.In the beginning, Shanberg treats Pran as a kind of lackey or gofer. The famous reporter for the fabled New York Times rushes from place to place, self absorbed, eager for the truth, while Pran is little more than an instrument to him. I'm surprised the movie is so candid about this.At one point, the Khmer Rouge are about to roll into the Phnom Penh and Schanberg and the other reporters have decided to stay and cover the problematic event. Schanberg, busy typing, interrupts himself long enough to tell Dith Pran that people will be killed -- a lot of people -- and tells him to decide on the spot whether he wants to stay or leave. Arrangements have been made for Pran's family to get out but Pran himself is torn between his family and his loyalty to his profession as a \"journalist\", as well as his personal loyalty to Schanberg. He twists his hands and works his features for a second before deciding to remain behind. As a result, he is dropped into hell.That basically is the first half of the film. The second half gives us a few scenes of Schanberg in New York shredding himself with guilt. But the focus is on Dith Pran's journey through the killing fields of Cambodia. He undergoes unspeakable iniquities. I won't describe them but I can say that the movie treats them with as much discretion as they deserve. The film doesn't wallow in blood. The final scene is sentimental but very moving.Among its virtues we can say that the photography is unimpeachable, although what it sometimes shows us is revolting. The musical score by Mike Oldfield is appropriate and innovative. Especially effective is the percussive dissonance that accompanies the arrival of the last U. S. Marine helicopters that evacuate some of the refugees. Oldfield also gets the palm for introducing so many Americans to \"Nessun Dorma\" from \"Turandot,\" one of only a handful of arias that most of us will find familiar now. I can't say the same for John Lennon's \"Imagine\" at the end. I thought it was spelling out the obvious and I felt my basilar membranes wince a little. There were a few crying babies too many as well. Roland Joffe should have had more respect for his audience.It's one of the most realistic movies about war than I can remember seeing, and not \"brutal\" in the usual sense of squibs exploding and bodies falling in slow motion. It's not that stupid. Sherman said, \"War is all hell.\" True enough, for civilians as well as troops.",

Watching it again was both a moving and a worthwhile experience.There are so many scenes which will, as the movie case says, haunt the viewer long after watching. The scene already mentioned, Waterston and Ngor wandering through the remains of the homes of Cambodian civilians destroyed by American bombs, a little girl, her hands over her ears, crying and screaming, surrounded by explosions and gunfire.The acting performances are top notch all round, particularly, of course, by Dr. Ngor. The team of Joffe and Menges is superb, as they also are in The Mission. Both films are in my video library.As an aside, whatever happened to Joffe? Super Mario Brothers? The Scarlet Letter?

When the Khmer Rouge (probably one of the most vicious and barbaric regimes in history) takes power the Westerners flee. The enterprising American, however, remains behind with his faithful guide (who sends his family off to America). This turns out to be a bad decision; through a series of misadventures Dith Pran cannot escape Cambodia and must remain behind while his friend flees.

            "content": "In 1975 the revolutionary group Khmer Rouge took over Cambodia and initiated a regime that reportedly claimed two million lives. At the time the Vietnam War was still going on, Cambodia was a strategic territory for the American army and the country was full of journalists. The basis of the movie's story comes from the lives of two of them: New York Times journalist Sydney Schanberg, and Dith Pran, Cambodian photojournalist and interpreter who coined the term \"Killing Fields.\" Written by Bruce Robinson based on their writings, the movie follows in fact two stories: one is the fall of Phnom Penh, the capital, and the evacuation of the international embassies, as witnessed by Sydney and Pran, and Sydney's return to the USA; and the second, more radical narrative, shows the horrors of the Khmer Rouge as witnessed by Pran after he's captured and sent to work in a Killing Field, and his epic escape to freedom.From Phnom Penh Sydney and Pran report the events of the civil war between the government and the Khmer Rouge, with the revolutionaries clearly gaining control of the country. The international embassies start evacuating their personnel. Sydney and Pran opt to remain, although Pran sends his wife and family away. As the Khmer Rouge revolutionaries enter the city, they're initially received with joy and prospects of peace, everyone tired of the war. Even Pran joins the festivities. However the Khmer Rouge, split in different factions due to internal power struggles, continue to fight in the capital. Sydney and Pran find refuge in the French embassy, until it's also evacuated and all Cambodians hiding there are turned over to the revolutionaries.For the time, the movie was quite revolutionary in casting a non-amateur actor in the role of Dith Pran. They found Haing Somnang Ngor, a doctor living in the USA, to portray Pran. Like Pran, Ngor had also spent four years in the killing fields before escaping. He won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor in 1985 for this role. He played the role with naturalism and lightness, displaying a restraint in emotions in situations where an actor would typically go into melodramatic mode. The choice of Ngor is ahead of its time for another reason. Anglo-American movies tend to work on the logic that audiences can only care for the plight of foreign countries if the experiences are mediated through a character from their culture; that's why war correspondents are usually the main characters in such movies. Although now thanks to movies like Letters from Iwo Jima and Hotel Rwanda this is changing, casting a Cambodian actor to tell the story of a Cambodian prisoner of the Khmer Rouge was audacious then.Sam Waterston also delivers a powerful performance as Sydney, an authoritarian boss who blames himself for having used Pran to further his career only to abandon him. Back in New York he starts an international campaign to find his friend, always wondering whether he's doing enough for him. The movie is also helped with performances from John Malkovich and Julian Sands as two other journalists, Craig T. Nelson as the US Army officer in charge of the American evacuation, and Spalding Gray as the morally-torn American Consul, wary of abandoning the country to the revolutionaries.The scenes in the Killing Fields still have, decades later and after graphic violence has become generalised, the power to affect because of how the movie shows the psychological roots of the crimes. It's not that the images are excessively violent, it's that the movie depicts a philosophy of inhumanity. Regimes don't just producer horror for its own sake, the violence is just a tool to implement ideas. Rather than just showing the horrors, the movie shows the philosophy which the violence was used to enforce: the viewer is taken into the classrooms where children are being taught to hate the concept of family and any personal relationships that may threaten blind loyalty to the party; children are given power over life and death; intellectuals, teachers, journalists are executed for their skills; people are forbidden from growing crops, because that's a sign of free initiative, even though thousands are starving to death The movie confronts us with those ideas and we can't help but ask, \"How the hell did anyone ever think these ideas could work in a society?\" Not everything holds up as well in the movie. Many good scenes are ruined by Mike Oldfield's intrusive cacophony of synthesizer noises. Nowadays, when we listen to electronic scores with less patience than our ancestors did back in the '80s, a lot of this music sounds horrible. Oldfield, one of my favourite living musicians, is by no means an inept film composer, however: half the score, when he turns to traditional orchestration, is majestic. \"Pran's Theme\" and its variations are appropriately elegiac, and \"Requim for a City,\" with its chorus of grieving voices, is a haunting attempt at showing through music the misery of the one million Cambodians forced by the Khmer Rouge to abandon the capital in a forced march to the countryside to work on the Killing Fields.Twenty-seven years later what the movie has to say about the darkness in the human soul, and the determination to overcome it, remains fresh.",

Each and every component combines together to form not only a hard-hitting political statement, but also a focus on a deep and pure friendship.Images of the injured, bloodied, distraught and destitute, leave lasting effects and obviously prove uncomfortable to watch sometimes, but they put us in the positions of the journalists who were stepping into the war zone of Cambodia at the time. In contrast, there is the compelling scene in which Sydney Schanberg plays video footage of Nixon blatantly lying about America's involvement in Cambodia and also shows Cambodians who have been injured by the fighting. While this still evokes feelings of sadness, it stirs up more angry emotions aimed at the dishonesty of the government, and, if looking at it from a wider perspective, most politicians. This is one of The Killing Fields' great strengths - its ability to make us feel a range of emotions throughout the course of the film.At no point is there any attempt to glamorise the subject matter or try and put a Hollywood spin on it. For instance, when the group of journalists are captured by the Khmer Rouge and forced into the back of the tank, the close-ups show the sweat and fear on their faces in the near darkness, with no wisecracking lines or dramatic music, just the sounds of the tank travelling to an unknown destination.The music moves away from the traditional sweeping classical score (apart from the hauntingly beautiful main theme) and relies heavily on synths and other electronic sounds. This actually works to great effect - possibly better than a classical soundtrack would - emphasising the confusion and fear of the people and the drama of the fighting. However it is John Lennon's Imagine, played in the final scene, that encapsulates the message of the film and provides a subtle yet powerful ending.All the cast excel but it's Sam Waterston and Haing Ngor who particularly shine and make their characters' relationship seem completely believable. It would have been ridiculous to have asked Ngor to put any more into his performance, due to his own experiences under the Khmer Rouge regime.To put it simply, you really must watch this film.",

The score in particular is just awful and mostly out of place. There are several serious scenes within the film that are suddenly accompanied by melodramatic and at times almost goofy music and thus ruined. Aside from that, I didn't find the setup for the friendship between the protagonists particularly convincing. The American journalist Schanberg treats Dith Pran like his employee for the first hour of the film. Only when they are separated emotions suddenly run wild and the viewer has to believe in this profound friendship. Besides, the infamous \"killing fields\" are in the film for approximately ten minutes. Joff\u00e9 could have definitely laid more focus upon this horrifying part of the story.Nevertheless, I suggest seeing THE KILLING FIELDS - not least because of it being one of only a hand full of films covering the Khmer Rouge subject.",

Schanberg is there to report on Cambodia's border being bombed by the U.S. during the last years of the Vietnam War. These bombings make Cambodia vulnerable to the takeover by the Khmer Rouge regime, which becomes Schanberg's new story.Schanberg and his colleagues are journalists who want people to know what really is going on as opposed to the watered down/non-existent radio/TV coverage about Cambodia's problems. John Malkovich's photo journalist character makes a snide remark about a certain BBC reporter who must sneak reports past the Khmer Rouge soldiers in the beaks of chickens that somehow make it to Thailand.Schanberg gets Pran's family out of Cambodia to America as the American Embassy and everybody else is getting out of Cambodia because they know that the Khmer Rouge is going to takeover the capital city. But Pran stays behind with Schanberg. Pran sees the Khmer Rouge parading through town and believes there might be peace, but his hopes are dashed as the Khmer Rouge soldiers kidnap Pran and the journalists for awhile. Things in Cambodia go from bad to worse, and the journalists are given one last chance to leave, but no Cambodians can go. The journalists try and doctor a passport for Pran, but it fails. Schanberg and the other journalist believe Pran will die at the hands of the Khmer Rouge. Malkovich blames Schanberg for Pran's fate. Schanberg begins to symbolize America in the way we bombed (used) Cambodia (Pran) and left it behind just when they needed our help.Disturbing scenes of children caring guns, a young girl suffocating a prisoner, and skeletons floating in a ditch show the atrocities of this dictatorship. Somehow Pran manages to survive in a prison camp--where he is starved, brainwashed, and tortured. He finally escapes and reunites with Schanberg.There are some scenes in which some subtitles would have been appreciated. The Killing Fields has been criticized for leaning to the left in its view of what happened in Cambodia, and I agree with that. It's really amazing that a movie like this ever got made considering the Hollywood machine. I recommend The Killing Fields for fans of Vietnam movies.

The movie is first and foremost, a historical account. The events are based off the true story of Dith Pran and Sydney Schanberg. Given that I had not known much about the Cambodian genocide of the 1970's prior to seeing this film, I must herald the piece as a successful feat of cinematography that served as both informational as well as inspirational.

And yet this is pretty much the only film that had some sort of widespread reach in the western world. It's a real pity that it wasn't a better film.I did see the movie when it came out originally and while I didn't think it was a brilliant film at the time, it got me interested enough in the subject to read up on in it. Including Dith Pran's book which the film is based upon. Having re-watched it now for the first time in decades and with a lot more background knowledge, the film is full of very big flaws. One of the driving forces for this film is meant to be the friendship between Dith Pran and Sidney Schanberg, but for the first half of the movie, Sidney treats Pran like a low-level employee and there's no real warmth on screen between them. It's only when Pran is forced to leave the French embassy where they've been hiding out and gets sent to a Khmer Rouge labour camp that suddenly this great friendship is highlighted, even though there was little evidence of it shown beforehand.The second half of the movie, with Sidney back in the US and Dith Pran left behind in Cambodia is where the film somewhat hits its stride. That said, reading about his actual experiences, the film feels almost tame in comparison. Roland Joffe also missed a chance of making a bigger impact here by deciding to not use subtitles for any of the Khmer dialog throughout the movie. This means that the second half where it's almost exclusively featuring Cambodians has to work on a visual level for viewers who don't understand the dialog. That means many of the scenes are over-simplified and make them feel less realistic than they should have been.Likely the decision to not use subtitles also means that Dith Pran's time in the killing fields was shortened so much in the movie that it feels like it lasted a couple of weeks rather than the four years it really was.The by far worst aspect of this movie though is the music! I'm sorry but as much respect as I have for Mike Oldfield, he absolutely cannot write movie scores. The music here is so completely out of place and distracting, it ruins all the otherwise great scenes. A perfect example of that is when Pran, Schanberg and a couple of other journalists get captured by Khmer Rouge troops and held hostage in an abandoned Coke factory. What would have been an incredibly tense set of scenes gets absolutely ruined by the music that sounds like it would be better placed in an episode of Gumby. It's so distracting, it almost makes it comical.This is by no means a terrible film. But a few relatively minor changes could have easily made this a great film.",

Everything about it has the ring of reality, with a gripping sense of the brutality and evil of war. I think the sequence in which the journalists are arrested by the Khmer Rouge is one of the greatest moments in film history. The brilliant soundtrack that sets the mood as are they held hostage, while Prahn pleads and bargains for their lives, is perfect. You feel as though you are right there with these men as they experience desperation amid the shocking violence of war. The palpable mood of gut-wrenching fear and tension that the actors project goes far beyond the standard Hollywood fare. This movie is a subtle collage of sound, sights, and emotion that is very rare. The cast is uniformly excellent, and in technical terms the direction,cinematography,editing, soundtrack, sets and screenplay are as good as it gets. It should have won Best Picture as far as I am concerned. Haing S. Ngor deserved his Oscar, and Sam Waterston should have won Best Actor too. This is an incredible story and an incredible movie. Too bad they don't make more like it. I've seen it many times over the years and it gets better with time. It's a masterpiece.",

It's just too gut-wrenching and uncomfortable to sit through a second time. Generally, it's two hours of suffering and torture. Who wants to watch that?It IS a powerful story, though, based on the true life adventures of Dith Pran (played by Haing S. Ngor) who somehow survived the unbelievably-brutal regime of Cambodia dictator Pol Pot. Other reviewers here have detailed the storyline, so there is no sense me rehashing that. Suffice to say this is a movie that - be warned - is very tough to view in many spots - but will leave you emotionally drained. Ngor's harrowing performance is one to remember, as is the horrible story of what happened in the mid '70s in Cambodia under the Khmer Rouge. This movie was filmed with Thailand and the scenery there, along with the excellent cinematography, makes this a visual treat.Some have complained that the film is too slow for them. Others didn't like this because it was overtly anti-American in some regards (the bombing of Cambodia). I can understand those complaints.

It does not give much insight into the motivations of the Khmer Rouge or of its own characters for that matter.The film follows journalist Sydney Schanberg and his Cambodian translator Dith Pran as they cover the fall of the Cambodian government. In his enthusiasm to cover the story, Schanberg decides to stay behind when the American Embassy evacuates. This results in Pran being stranded in Cambodia for the duration of the Khmer Rouge regime.The film works best when it focuses on the personal drama between Schanberg and Dith Pran. Sam Waterston gives a good performance as Schanberg, making us empathize with the character even when he acts like a self-indulgent jerk. Haing S. Ngor is excellent as Pran, earning his Oscar with a moving performance.However, the film does not give us any insight into the characters, particularly why Pran, who is clearly terrified, decides to stay behind with Schanberg. Their relationship, while compelling portrayed by the actors, is not explored in any depth, leading to unintentional homosexual overtones.More gallingly, the film does not really give any insight into the Khmer Rouge or why they carried out their atrocities. With Nazis and other more familiar historical villains, viewers will generally have a good sense of their ideologies and motivations. This is not necessarily the case with the Khmer Rouge. We do not really get a sense of who the Khmer Rouge are targeting or why? This is a particularly glaring omission as many younger Americans are only familiar with the Cambodian genocide from this movie. Furthermore, the film's general lack of on-screen violence results in a failure to convey the true horror of what took place. This flaw is acknowledged even by some involved in the film. As Haing Ngor reported in his autobiography, both he and Dith Pran thought the film's violence should be more graphic to convey the brutality of the Khmer Rouge.If you want a true sense of who the Khmer Rouge were, see the documentary S21: The Khmer Rouge Killing Machine, which goes into far greater detail.",

            "content": "*Possible spoilers*The Killing Fields attempts to tell the story of the Cambodian holocaust through its two main characters, NY Times journalist Sidney Schanberg and Cambodian Dith Pran. Unfortunately, the film only succeeds in telling Schanberg's view of the Cambodian Holocaust.As mentioned by a previous reviewer, Pol Pot, the architect of the tragedy, is not mentioned once. Schanberg's unwillingness to see the Khmer Rouge for what they really were is briefly touched on, but that is excused by the journalist attempting to blame the holocaust on the Nixon Administration and their bombing campaign. While it can be argued that there may have been more humane ways to attempt to prevent the Communist takeover, realistically there weren't any other options available to the Nixon administration given the legislative handicaps placed on them by the Congress regarding action in Cambodia. It would've been nice to see that point addressed, as it would have been nice for the film to acknowledge that four days before the Khmer Rouge victory, Schanberg wrote a column for the NY Times entitled, \"Indochina without Americans: For most, a better life.\" The horrors being committed by the Khmer Rouge in eastern Cambodia had been reported by refugees for well over a year by that point, and yet Schanberg and the Times refused to acknowledge it.It is bad enough that this film perpetuates the canard that the Americans were to blame for the holocaust because of their bombing campaign. What is absolutely unacceptable is that while passing judgment on US policy, this film never once brings up, let alone finds fault with, the North Vietnamese policies in Cambodia. It was under the auspices of the North Vietnamese that the Khmer Rouge was founded in 1959. It was in Hanoi that Pol Pot and 30,000 other KR's found sanctuary and training. It was Hanoi that initially violated the neutrality of Cambodia, taxing and conscripting peasants into their cause of conquest. It is the very height of absurdity that this film blames the US while not once mentioning either Pol Pot or the NVA's role in what occurred.All that being said, the story of the Cambodian holocaust is very important history that should be known by all. It is my hope that this tale will be given more balanced treatment in the future by someone in Hollywood. But given its current aversion to making films about the crimes of Communism or ones with plot, I won't hold my breath.",

            "review_title": "A harrowing true story and a fine debut for both Joff\u00e9 and Ngor",
            "content": "The Killing Fields is the directorial debut of Roland Joff\u00e9, whose film career has steadily declined in quality ever since. Nevertheless, it's an impressive debut, a harrowing true story with a screenplay by Bruce \"Withnail and I\" Robinson, based on the book The Death and Life of Dith Pran by Sydney Schanberg.\nThe Killing Fields follows two journalists - American Sydney Schanberg and his Cambodian translator, colleague and friend Dith Pran - in Cambodia as the Khymer Rouge rises to power and they are forced to try and flee. The first half shows the deteriorating situation as Schanberg and his British and American friends are eventually forced to escape the country and their doomed efforts to take Pran with them, whilst the second shows Pran surviving under the Khmer Rouge's monstrous regime and eventually managing to make his own escape. That these events (fictionalised tweaking aside) really happened only adds to the weight of the story, which succeeds in showing some of the horror of what happened in Cambodia in the nineteen seventies; it was the real Pran who coined the phrase \"the killing fields\" and his on-screen discovery of one of them is a chilling moment.\nBut whilst the film is partly about the Khmer Rouge regime, it is also largely about the bonds of friendship between Schanberg and Pran, that kept Schanberg struggling to find out what happened to his friend after he was forced to leave without him. Sam Waterston plays Schanberg, whilst Haing S. Ngor plays Pran and had never acted before but had personally survived the Khmer Rouge. Waterston gives a passionate performance as Schanberg, a journalist utterly devoted to the truth regardless of the personal risk and who never gives up on Pran, but Ngor is the real star, giving an astonishingly convincing performance in a role that must have had resonated personally. The strong supporting cast also boasts fine performances from John Malkovitch and Julian Sands as Al Rockoff and Jon Swain, plus minor roles for Spalding Gray, Bill Paterson and Patrick Malahide, but it is Ngor - especially in the second half of the film - who outshines everybody else.\nThe first half of a film is unrelentingly tense, from the opening accidental bombing of a Cambodian town by the Americans that demonstrates that war is a bloody mess. But it is the second, shorter half which stays in the memory, as Pran is incarcerated in a Khmer Rouge labour camp and subjected to physical violence and re-education. He escapes, but finds himself surrounded by skeletons and rotting corpses in one of the infamous \"Killing Fields\" before being recaptured and finally escaping a second time to the safety of Thailand at the start of the Vietnamese invasion that ultimately ended the Khmer Rouge. What is striking about this is how Joff\u00e9 presents it: the film entirely eschews subtitles, which forces English-speaking audiences to share in Schanberg's alienation when he and the others are briefly held captive by the Khmer Rouge during the first half of the film and makes the second half overwhelmingly disorientating.\nSlight concessions are made for narrative reasons: a monologue from Pran accompanies many of the scenes in the labour camp, as he recites the deranged teachings of the Khmer Rouge; and prison camp commandant Phat speaks English to Pran because he knows he understands it. For the most part however, the audience is forced to rely on the visuals to understand what is going on, an artistic decision that pays off. Indeed, the strength of The Killing Fields is as much down to Joff\u00e9's grasp of visuals as it is to Robinson's screenplay. Thailand doubles for Cambodia and looks entirely authentic, with Chris Menges' cinematography granting the film a documentary appearance that makes the more brutal scenes queasily unpleasant. When Schanberg is back home in America trying to find a trace of Prin from afar, Joff\u00e9 has him watch real-life television footage of Nixon and Cambodia, another subtle reminder that the events of the film actually happened. The frequent use of hand-held cameras helps, as does the use of close-ups, which drag the audience into the events onscreen. The only aspect of the production that has aged badly is Mike Oldfield's score, which is dramatic, but unmistakeably a product of the nineteen eighties.\nIt's surprising that Roland Joff\u00e9 managed to make a film as accomplished as The Killing Fields as his first feature length movie and then utterly failed to make anything anywhere near as good ever again, at least to date. This is impressive, important film-making and Rotten Tomatoes' amusingly inaccurate description of the film as a masterpiece of \"American cinema\" can be taken as a considerable compliment to the British film industry and to everyone involved in making it.",

The American is a journalist for (if I recall correctly) the New York Times, while the Cambodian is a local colleague name Dith Pran (played by a real-life escapee from the killing fields). The early stages noisily illustrate the collapse of Cambodia under the strain of American interference aimed at supporting the South Vietnamese government climaxing in the chaotic scenes at the American embassy as the American journalist tries and fails to get his colleague onto the helicopters to safety.The emotional heart of the movie is, however, the quieter second half as Pranh faces the deadly \"re-education camps\" and finally escapes to freedom.The Oscar winning cinematography is excellent but the film just fails to make it into the \"great\" category due to a slightly stilted script and (despite nominations for both leads - and a win for Haing Ngor as supporting actor, when he was actually lead) acting.Well worth your time and money, especially if you can see and hear it on the big screen.",

            "content": "This is a very serious film that concerns a gravely serious subject, the genocide perpetrated by the Pol Pot regime in Cambodia during the 1970's in which an estimated two million Cambodian citizens were murdered. As director, Roland Joffe is to be commended for his powerful portrayal of one of the most horrifying instances of human cruelty in modern times. As one who was alive and politically involved at the time, beyond the murderous brutality of the regime that plunged an ordinarily peaceful Southeast Asian nation into utter chaos and widespread bloodshed, where was the rest of the world when it allowed these atrocities to occur only thirty years after the European Holocaust of World War II? What was the United Nations doing at the time? I could not understand how this could happen as it was occurring in the late 1970's any more than I can today, and I applaud director Joffe for so effectively bringing a very dark chapter in modern history to the screen.Viewers should be cautioned about some very painful scenes that I found to be very difficult to watch, including the results of the mistaken American bombing of a Cambodian town, Neak Leung. The images of wounded and crying children are especially disturbing, but they represent an event that actually happened as the United States escalated its military campaign in Southeast Asia with the approval of both major political parties. If these very troubling incidents are difficult to observe in a movie, just imagine what they must have been like to experience in real life.As good as the film was, it did run exceedingly long, and I wouldn't have minded less of a focus on the American journalists and more on the experiences of Mr. Pran and his suffering compatriots, the Cambodian people. I found much of the dialogue between Shanberg (Sam Waterston) and Rockoff (John Malkovich) silly and even annoying, which truly degraded the rest of a very powerful film. The scene in the French embassy ran for much longer than needed. The music of John Lennon's song \"Imagine\" is very beautiful, but the lyrics are very na\u00efve and seemed totally out of place at the finale when one considers the human horrors that had been revealed during the previous two hours and twenty minutes. As a human race, we must do much more than passively \"imagine\" a world without genocide. We must act vigorously to see that it never happens again.",

            "content": "Wow, what a punch to the gut! If you are about to watch The Killing Fields for the first time, be prepared to feel the same way. It is an emotional tale that describes the horror of the Khmer Rouge reign. It is a thought-provoking tale based from the memoirs of a New York Times correspondent. The performances from the cast are excellent, especially from Haing S. Ngor, a doctor who never acted before. This is Roland Joffe's first film as director and he really understood the material. It is not only a movie that describes the horror of war, but it is a tale of friendship, loyalty, and love. David Puttnam, who produced this feature, actually said Joffe was the only man who understood what the film truly meant. Indeed he did, because this film is an emotional gut punch!As a history major, this time period is actually one I was not all too familiar with. I knew the Cambodian Civil War was in part due to the Khmer Rouge taking over the country. This film taught me how horrible these atrocities they committed. They killed over 17,000 people. They wiped out the intellectual population (such as teachers, doctors, etc). They banned western medicine and books. They wanted to turn Cambodia into an agricultural sector, and thousands starved as a result. In terms of crimes against humanity, this is about as bad as it gets. They were also known for their \"Year Zero\" policy which outlawed all religion. One of the reasons why the film works because director Joffe, screenwriter Bruce Robinson, and cinematographer Chris Menges worked together effectively to bring these events to the screen. The film looked gorgeous thanks to Menges's exquisite camerawork. But sometimes it also looked brutal especially when we get a peek at the actual killing fields.The film is based off the eyewitness accounts of New York Times reporter, Sydney Schanberg (Sam Waterston). He is covering the Civil War in Cambodia along with his intrepid photographer, Al Rockoff (John Malkovich). They team up with local journalist, Dith Pran (Haing S. Ngor) to cover the brutalities of this genocide. When the American forces evacuate, Pran sends his family with them. He, however, stays behind to help cover the truth of the war. When it is time for Schanberg to leave, Pran is forced to stay behind even with his family in the United States. That does not sit well with Schanberg. He uses all resources at hand to bring Pran to the states and to his family.Roland Joffe's casting decisions were interesting. He wanted to stay away from the big names which he felt would take away the emotional impact from the movie. Some names may sound familiar like Sam Waterston and John Malkovich, both of them had amazing performances. However, I want to focus on Haing S. Ngor. He won an Academy Award for his supporting performance, which was a very impressive feat. When he signed on for his role, he was a doctor with no acting experience. Furthermore, he actually survived the war that this film is based on. He spent four years at a forced labor camp, but eventually was able to escape to Thailand. He was only one of two nonprofessional actors to ever win an Academy Award. Very impressive feat and well-deserved because he did show amazing chemistry with the rest of the cast. On a side note, this is actually Malkovich's first film role as well. He also did an amazing job!The Vietnam War and the conflicts in Southeast Asia brought some powerful movies like The Deer Hunter or Apocalypse Now, but this story is a more grounded approach. It is about ordinary people being killed off just for the heck of it. The film threatens to become conventional at times as the story of a man going back into a war-torn nation to save someone dear to him is something that is done often. The Deer Hunter and Uncommon Valor are a few examples. That said, the film then throws that approach out the window when it decides to focus more on the Dith Pran's character. I liked that approach and it added more to the emotional impact.The Killing Fields is one of the best films of 1984. It is a very powerful film about love and friendship set in the backdrop of a terrifying war. If you do not shed a tear during the movie, you may not be human. The last lines of dialogue wrecked me. Perhaps, Mike Oldfield's score may have helped. The movie hits home the themes of friendship, but also how awful genocide is. This was an important history lesson for me, and I am glad to recommend this movie.My Grade: A",

            "content": "Brief Summary: This movie depicts the story of one Dith Pran engulfed in one of the most tragic genocidal regimes to ever grace this planet. Pran has been caught in the Year Zero program, an attempt from the Khmer Rouge to wash away all preknowledge of societies and start everyone over as simple farmers. 'Wash away' is being used in a light context though, people such as doctors, students, teachers, etc are being killed. Children are being honoured and respected as their minds have not had the time to be corrupt by the western traditions. This explains the fact that many of the Khmer Rouge are in fact teenagers. We experience through our eyes the many horrid nightmares Dith experiences at the hands of these young tyrants.Review: A pretty typical story of an individual being caught in a 'wipeout' program much akin to the many holocaust films out there. What makes this film stand out is that it shows the viewers a different regime in history with very much the same effects on its population as the holocaust. The acting is superb by all degrees, in fact, the main actor Dith Pran (real name Haing S Ngor) has actually been through the horrors of Pol Pot's regime. In conclusion, a nice movie to watch just to see the power of a regime other than the Nazi's as well as a man who has to go through all of it.8/10 - Won't be forgotten (in a good way!)",

            "content": "I wasn't born when the war in Cambodia was happening so I didn't know anything about it till I watched The Killing Fields.There is so many levels to this film. The main theme I think is the friendship between Sydney Schanberg (Sam Waterston), a journalist for The New York Times who is sent to cover the war between the country's revolutionary Khmer Rouge and Dith Pran (Dr Haing S. Ngor), his assistant who acts as an interpreter,guide and journalist/photographer. There are some very touching scenes between the two men, it is lovely to see two men who love one another, almost like brothers. The two actors Sam Waterston and Dr. Haing S. Ngor are just brilliant and had we in tears when they have to said goodbye to one another and Pran has to leave the embassy and they both know what happens to people like Pran. I especially loved the scene when they meet again and Pran runs into Sydney's arms and he tells Sydney that there is nothing to forgive.I like the fact that the film flips between the two characters. We see Sydney desperately trying to find Pran and Pran trying to survive the starvation and torture and he can never be himself, he must keep himself guarded because he knows they will kill him. One of the most gripping scenes is when Pran has escaped the camp and he comes across the most gruesome sight of skeletons littered all over the place. The film is not afraid to show graphic scenes of the violence that was going on at the time in Cambodia which is not sugarcoated but it shows the brutality that men can show towards each other.I feel the heart of the film is Pran. He suffered harsh treatment, starvation and torture from the Khmer Rouge and he doesn't seem to hate these people. He just accepts that he must follow their rules to survive so he can be with his family again.Just because the film is based on a real story, doesn't mean you have a happy feeling inside you, that you know that Pran beats them and survives and is reunited with his friend and family. There is still tension and you are gripped when you see what Pran goes through to survive.The music by Mike Oldfield is so appropriate and fits the mood of the environment. It is very well directed by Roland Joffe who keeps us to the edge of our seats up to the end.I think what also helps is the fact that the actor playing Pran, Dr Haing S. Ngor went through the same thing as Pran and who better to know what Pran went through, then this man who was tortured and had to deny being a doctor and couldn't save his wife in childbirth for fear they would both be killed. It is amazing that it was his first film role and he definitely deserved the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. It is also sad that he survived Cambodia, only to be killed in a robbery. It was a waste and it should never have happened to this man who had been though enough already.",

            "content": "**** out of ****After nearly 20 years The Killing Fields still remains one of the most powerful films ever made, a brilliant piece of moviemaking that leaves a searing imprint in the mind long after viewing it.  This is not a film to be taken lightly, but a serious examination of the horrors of war and individual conflicts and struggles, and for that it is on par with Steven Spielberg's work on Saving Private Ryan and Schindler's List, certainly a noteworthy comparison.  The film opens in 1973, with the Vietnam War coming to an end.  But the horror is far from over.  The Khmer Rouge, a radical political group, are slowly taking over war-torn Cambodia.  The film's first 2/3's chronicles the journeys and friendships of two journalists, Sydney Schanberg (Sam Waterston) and Dith Pran (Haing S. Ngor), as well as photographer Al Rockoff (John Malkovich) and another photographer, a British man named Jon Swain (Julian Sands).The American Embassy makes the crucial decision to evacuate but Schanberg refuses to leave, and his partner Pran, out of a sense of loyalty, also willingly stays behind while his family is evacuated.  But trouble ensues, and Pran is eventually forced to remain in Cambodia and must struggle to survive re-education camps and the Killing Fields.Of all the films to involve the Vietnam War (technically, though, the focus of this is on Cambodia), The Killing Fields ranks above them all.  It is even more harrowing than Oliver Stone's Platoon, more realistic than Apocalypse Now and Full Metal jacket, and more intensely personal than The Deer Hunter.  This film remains something of a forgotten relic, losing the Best Picture award of 1984 to the undeserving Amadeus, but The Killing Field's importance and impact have remained, and perhaps by today's standards, has an even more terrifying imprint.Perfectly directed, this easily remains director Roland Joffe's best work to date (and he'll probably never surpass it).  It's something of a tragedy to see him take a step backward with every film he has gone on to make (The Mission, the disastrous The Scarlet Letter).  But his work on this film is still by far one of the most impressive I've seen in this genre.  He captures the insanity of the time period, the political confusion, the chaos, and the downright terrors of war; doing all of this not from a soldier's point of view, but from civilians, most particularly Dith Pran.The war-torn chaos featured in the first hour-and-a-half give way to an intense struggle for survival in the last hour.  The focus is on Dith Pran and the tortures he goes through.  It is here that the film takes an apocalyptic look and stance, and the sight of hundreds of dead bodies in a long, single ditch remains one of the most horrifying and shocking sights ever put on film.Suspenseful is a way to describe the film, yet it is far more nail-biting than the usual Hollywood-churned thriller.  It's impressive how director Joffe creates so much tension from so many situations.  From the beginning when we see the evacuation to the point where the journalists try to fake a passport to keep Pran in the embassy; all these moments are simply heart-pounding.Those scenes seem almost obligatory in comparison to the last 1/3, which focuses on Pran almost entirely.  Every scene in these last 50 mintues, I was left constantly praying and hoping he'd make it out and I literally gripped my seat every moment, wondering whether he'd be discovered or whether he'd be able to escape. The film is so riveting not only because of Joffe's direction, but also because of the individual characters whom we grow to not only care for, but also feel like we're in the same situation with.  Haing Ngor carries the load as Dith Pran, and comes through magnificently.  Having faced the actual terrors of war in Cambodia, Ngor is brilliantly effective, and he easily delivered what must have been the best performance of the 80's. \nSam Waterston is almost as good as Sydney Schanberg, Pran's close friend who feels guilty for having let Pran stay behind during the evacuation.  It is his drive to get the news down that places Pran in danger, and though we're aware of this, there's never a moment when we aren't touched by Waterston's torn feelings.  This is his best performance to date.The supporting cast is also very good, most notably John Malkovich as the photographer who seems a little odd at first, but is pretty much the average guy who also sympathizes for Pran's plight (and, as a result, ends up arguing with Schanberg).  Julian Sands is also effective as the photographer whose life as well as Schanberg's and Rockoff's, was saved by Pran and he tries his best to return the favor.The Killing Fields, while certainly a bloody violent film and almost always depresses the hell out of you, is ultimately more inspirational than anything else.  This may be a flinching, no-holds barred experience, but it is one that must be seen.  This is truly an unforgettable film, and one of my personal favorites.",

            "content": "The Killing Fields is a surprising film, that could have matched any Vietnam set film as its set in Cambodia. Most know of the Vietnam War, but almost only half of the world still remembers what Cambodia went through during Pol Pot's heinous ethnic cleansing of the people with the help of his brutal regime the Khmer Rouge. They systematically murdered over 2 million Cambodians who were to them 'undesirables' and needed to be removed.The Killing Fields is a film that realistically portrays the genocide, and the infamous Killing Fields where most of the genocide victims ended up, and attempting to cross the watery fields their remains made a soup to crawl through. This film is extremely sad and hard hitting, as the Cambodian genocide never really got much coverage as say the Vietnam War did. The filming of the event in this film is very well done and captures the horrific moments of the genocide. People being herded onto trucks bound for executions, children being murdered in front of their parents.This film could in my opinion match even most big-budget Jewish Holocaust films with how gritty the feel of this film is. The film follows American photographer for a US newspaper who is stuck in the country following the Khmer Rouge's take-over played by Sam Waterston, however it is the second and most frank viewpoint of character Dith Pran portrayed by real life Khmer Rouge survivor Haing S. Ngor who was sadly murdered in 1996 due to his views of the Khmer Rogue. Haing S. Ngor is amazing surviving the Genocide, seeing many of his friends and countrymen hacked down by the Khmer Rogue. This film is for those who wish to see a tragic event just as sad as the Holocaust and indeed the Vietnam War. Its disturbing at times but must be to portray the events of the Genocide. This is a classic in its own name now, and its a film I can watch over and over again.",

Bombing doesn't cause normal folks to turn into blood thirsty Communist tyrants. Did the people of London, Berlin, Tokyo or Malta massacre each other after WWll? The Khmer Rouge were merely following the well worn path of Communist tyranny and totalitarianism ala Stalin, Mao and Sung, but without the PR job that Ho and Fidel had! It was a real sad movie that did show the depth of evil that the Communists are capable of, the turning of the kids into Communist murderbots who had people killed because they wore glasses or had soft hands. The starvation and impoverishment of everyone except the ruling cadres should be a powerful antidote to the parasites who whine about the inequalities of capitalism.

            "content": "In the Killing Fields, there may be some things politically that you'll either not be fully aware of going in, or need to be brought up to speed on. The short of it that I know for sure is that the Vietnam war didn't stay completely within its borders, but rather spilled over into Cambodia, with the kind of guerilla warfare being raged, but more crucially (along with Nixon's own butchery intentions) rival gangs and groups were looking to gain control - and all of this at the cost of thousands of lives, mainly civilians' lives. What's good about the film politically is that it doesn't ask you necessarily to take a big side on one or the other in the Cambodian conflict, except as far as Pol Pot making madness and chaos even more extreme, and that the violence of these street gangs made into larger forms was horrible. But what's even better is that the emotional core, the pathos, is strong: this is a movie about friendship (writer Bruce Robinson, coincidentally, would make another key movie about friendship in the 80's in Withinail & I, on a totally different context of course).The friends - one might almost say lovers in the non-romantic, heterosexual sense - is author Sidney Schanberg (Sam Waterston) and Dith Pran (Hang S Ngor, who won a deserved Oscar for his acting, which often feels very raw and wholly convincing, basically as though he was/is there). Sidney is there in Cambodia to get the scoop as a New York Times reporter, and not only won't soft-pedal anything, he despises the reporters sent/allowed in who will. Pran is nominally his translator, but he is a reporter as well (we don't see much of that aspect, but it's not difficult to see his serious intentions to get things down as they are). The two of them finds that they're stuck in the country as things become even more harried; the greatest tension and suspense of the film isn't even about being under the barrel of guns held by certain guerilla soldiers (though that's part of it) - it's simply how to get Pran out of the country.One may ask why Sidney just didn't get Pran out when he does, in fact, get Pran's family out. Maybe there was just more work to do. Maybe it was simpler that way and for Pran to stay it was necessary for the very on-the-street-on-the-run reporting that Sidney was looking for. But whatever the motivation, the centerpiece of the film for me all comes down to a photograph - this is what's needed for Pran to get a passport and go along with the Americans and French out of the country (it is explained why Cambodians can't leave, but it's not completely clear, or at much as it could've been for me). We see how Malkovich, as a photojournalist, takes the painstaking task of taking pictures on a beat-up, nearly broken camera, and has to develop the film in a very cramped bathroom with unlikely chemicals. It's not totally a spoiler to say it doesn't end up working - for half of the film, Pran is in a prison camp and it then becomes a 'how-does-he-escape' scenario - but this section is for me the most effective: trumping the violence of the world through the process of photography (if not art, then close enough), and just seeing the moment-by-moment events of that sequence is staggering.Of course, there's much violence here, and in a way this was a nice antidote to the barrage of mindless, at best usually guilty-pleasure action fare of the 1980's. Instead of something like Rambo 2, where one man goes in and single-handedly takes on the entire Vietnamese army, this is more like 'hey, you really have to be very, very careful here, because the one wrong thing said or done can get you shot in the head, immediately, or, if in prison, worse via torture'.Some of the events in the first act move rather quickly, but the important thing is that we get to learn who these people are, especially Sidney and Pran, and this is crucial for the emotional stakes: will they be torn apart, and if they are, can they reunite again? I kind of wish I hadn't looked up the trivia for the film ahead of time as I got in a way spoiled as the ultimate outcome (one hopes for the 'happy ending', though here that's especially relative). The tension mounts so well in the second half because we know, as capable as Pran is at thinking on his toes and acting quickly, he's up against a truly formidable, horrifying presence in these soldiers, all trained to the gills for brutal executions.If there is a political message it comes in a rather operatic moment: Sidney is back in New York and watching what looks like a primitive version of a VHS tape of some old news broadcast; it talks about Nixon's message to the American people about what the plan was for Cambodia, and how it was not the bill of goods he was selling. One almost gets the sense that had Nixon really had his way, Pran could've been wiped out by a barrage of bombs. But, again, The Killing Fields is interested in politics only up to a point: the power of the film comes from its male bond, and its depiction of survival and how one can keep a head when surrounded by death and destruction. A very good film of its time, and it holds up extremely well.",

They were in-human. To do those sorts of things you must have no heart, no feelings, and no soul. To them, human life is not cheap. It is worthless. And to allow these vermin to carry out this program of degradation and mass slaughter gives the whole world a black eye, not just America. America was involved in Vietnam, which spilled over into Cambodia. We were \"responsible\" for that, although it most likely would have happened anyway. To allow it to continue unabated for the next decade was the real crime. I suppose the real question here is \"Should America be the world's policeman?

Ngor, who won a Best Supporting Actor Academy Award for his performance). Although anybody can do a Wikipedia search on the people and the event and see what happened, it is the suspense and tension with which the events shown are presented that makes this a special film. It actually makes you feel \"you were there\" during the fall of Cambodia and the holocaust that followed.Sam Waterston didn't do that many films before his signature role as Jack McCoy on Law and Order, but he gives an intense performance here. Shanberg is one of the reporters deciding to stay in the danger zone and report on the Cambodian civil war, and on American bad acts during that war. He needs Pran as an interpreter and guide in a place where there are literally no Americans. But then comes the imminent fall of Cambodia to the Khmer Rouge, and Shanberg tells Pran he has to decide if he is to stay or go. And the question explored later on is, given that Shanberg decided to stay through the fall of Phnom Penh, did he subtly influence Pran to stay because he needed him?The genocide that followed the takeover of Cambodia by Pol Pot and his band are shown in all its horror. It makes me want to dig deeper and get the answer to the question - Did the American reporters who stayed behind just think that the Khmer Rouge were going to pass out lollipops and pat the little kids on the head and all would be hunky dory? This brings me to the hazards of being slavish to dogma. Pol Pot was a monster, but more than that he actually thought that these crazy ideas of his would work and instituted them en masse immediately. A good number of the up to three million dead in the three years that followed Pol Pot's rise to power were him actually believing you can transform a nation suddenly and completely and refusing to back down when he only brought ruin upon the land. But I'm sure he never missed a meal.There are great supporting performances by a young John Malkovich as a fellow journalist, and I tip my hat to Spaulding Grey who made a career of his one man show and documentaries built in part, at least, on his small role here.The thing that makes this really hard to watch besides the realistic horror of the war and the aftermath? There really are no \"good guys\" here. The Americans, the French, the Cambodian government pre and post Pol Pot, all had their hands dirty.

Sam Waterson was wonderful as the lead character, Sydney Schanberg, a New York Times columnist covering the Vietnam War.I had only known Sam Waterson as Jack McCoy from Law & Order. I like his performance as Jack McCoy--a moralistic but bland district attorney--but this character and performance as Sydney Schanberg is light years ahead of the well suited and often cozy Jack McCoy.What I don't know about the Vietnam War could fill volumes. And what I know about its spill over into Cambodia and the atrocities there is even less. The Killing Fields was a deep plunge into the bloody conflict going on in Cambodia and two reporters that braved it to cover it.Sydney Schanberg was a New York Times reporter being accompanied by Dith Pran (Dr. Haing S. Ngor), his driver, translator, companion, and also a journalist himself. As bombs were being dropped, bullets were being fired, and they were hustled to and fro at gunpoint, they tried to make deadlines and report the truth.For me, war movies are never an easy watch, and this was probably one of the hardest. The imagery of dead and dismembered bodies is so visceral that it snaps you out of whatever revelry you were in. Though there were multiple scenes that jarred me, one of the most jarring was that of a toddler covering his ears and crying as bullets flew and bombs exploded all around him. It was such a heavy impactful moment. Almost as if that scene was inserted in the movie to let you know who were the biggest losers and hurt the most in all of this. The movie would only plunge the viewer deeper in despair before giving him a modicum of relief.As horrendous, desperate, and anxious this movie was I loved it. I didn't love it like I love a Marvel movie in which everything that is occurring is fictitious and I can root for the good guy over the bad and all the destruction will be repaired by the next installment. I loved it for its authenticity and for punching me in the gut as it did. If I only loved it for letting me know that I haven't been desensitized by constant movie violence then that would be enough. But I loved it for more than that and one of the bigger reasons was the human bond made between Sydney and Dith Pran. Two men from different sides of the world that shared a common goal and even shared a love for one another. There's so much to love about this movie its just unfortunate its based upon real events.",

Not only is it a spectacular war picture, with surprises around every corner, realistic special effects and makeup, and harrowing struggles that will make you cringe and compel you to keep watching, but it's a beautiful, moving story of love and friendship.

It's ugly and overwrought, and I swear to God that in places, it's over-explanatory character almost crosses the line into \"Mickey Mousing.\" 3. Better closing song.\"Imagine\"? \"I\"-freaking-\"MAGINE\"?! The killing fields of Cambodia represent Lennon's idiotic totalitarian fantasies taken to their logical conclusion. This is what happens when you try to reshape human nature to fit an ideological mold. You can't do it, so you just end up killing everyone. The use of this song demonstrates that the filmmakers had no idea what the hell they were making a film about.4. More honesty.It might have behooved the filmmakers, when they were giving Sidney Schanberg (in the person of Waterston) free rein to spew his puerile blame-America-first leftism, to have acknowledged that Schanberg wrote pro-Khmer Rouge propaganda intended to convince the American people that a Communist takeover of Cambodia would be a very fine thing indeed (including, mere days before the Communist victory, a piece headline \"Indochina Without Americans: For Most, a Better Life\").5. Less racism.OK, Dith Pran wants to stay in Cambodia because he's a reporter and it's his job. But it's Schanberg's fault that Pran stays because...well, apparently because Pran's just an Asian who shouldn't be allowed to make his own decisions. I can't see any other reason why it's Schanberg's responsibility. Pran is a grown man.And I touched above on the film's blaming America for the Khmer Rouge atrocities. Apparently Asians can't be expected to know how to behave. If they kill millions of people, it can only be because of something Great White Father did.But for all that, I still recommend the film as a depiction of what Communism is in its essence--even if the filmmakers don't quite seem to have grasped it themselves.",

            "content": "The late Gene Siskel summed it up so neatly that I feel compelled to quote him. Yes, Roland Jaff\u00e9's \"Killing Fields\" is a wonderful story of \"professionalism, friendship and courage\", showing the true dedication of two professional journalists in their attempt to cover the on-going chaos in Cambodia at the Vietnam War's aftermath and their mutual support in the midst of a nation implosion announcing the worst. Naturally their collaboration produces the kind of fraternal bonds that can only bloom in worst-case situations, which is exactly what Cambodia is going through.The two reporters are Sidney Schanberg from the New York Times (Sam Waterston) and his Cambodian interpret and photographer Dith Pran (Dr. Haing S Ngor). Both had the courage to face every obstacle getting in their way to truth and each one tries to save the other's life at some point. That Sidney fails to get Dith his ticket to New York thus exposing him to the brutality (and that's an understatement) of the Khmer Rouge Army is profoundly affecting but never to the point that we blame him, we know he did his best. And so did his fellow co-workers, among them the photographer played by John Malkovich and whose efforts to get the right picture for a fake passport result in one of the film's most suspenseful sequences, one that goes without a single aimed weapon.But beyond the \"friendship, professional, courage\" tryptic, what the film accomplishes goes beyond its narrative format. It's perhaps the most notorious and vivid depictions of one of the worst atrocities of the last fifty years: the Khmer Rouge genocide. In a short lapse of time, about two millions of Cambodians were sacrificed at the altar of a 'Cultural' Revolution that annihilated every remain of civilization. Between 1975 and 1979, through starvations, exploitation and mass executions, the Army of the New Order enslaved a whole population, brainwashed the younger ones, cutting their family ties to produce a generation of zealous teenagers who wouldn't hesitate to pull a trigger. They also got rid of any citizen who represents a connection with the Old Order: doctors, engineers, intellectuals, as a matter of fact, wearing glasses could sign your death warrant. And so either you played dumb and resigned yourself to years of labour and hunger in Labour Camps or you were dead.A few survived the horror, I wouldn't spoil the fate of Dith Pran but if you read this review, I invite you to google the name of Dr. Haing S Ngor who played him. He too was a genocide surviror and a spokesperson for the Cambodian community until his untimely assassination in 1996. His death was classified as murder but the shady circumstances make it rather hard to believe that there was no connection whatsoever with Pol Pot (who was still alive at that time). Anyway, Ngor's death shows that \"The Killing Fields\" is more than a film, it's a testimony rooted in the past like a tree but whose branches were still growing, trying to reach, if not the peace, but the realization of the Occidental world. Because to add up to the misery, no one really cared about the tragedy and the world left thousands of innocents dying behind closed doors.It's even worse when you see in the film's early scenes a miscalculated American bombing destroying killing civilians. So the film is about the Free World's total indifference or in the best case, impotence. And I guess it's only fair that its most inspirational triumph (the film was in AFI's Top Cheers) didn't rely on a White Savior trope. Many great stories were built on that, \"Schindler's List\" is an example but \"The Killing Fields\" couldn't afford such a straightforward resolution. But it's still effective as a war movie, because what it does is portraying real people, played by not glamorous actors, some were relatively unknown at the time. Many scenes showing the Cambodian guerrilla, the arrests, the bombings or the random executions are shot in a way that channels \"The Battles of Algiers\" which impressed director Jaff\u00e9. But Jaff\u00e9 also knows when to use synthesized music to enhance the emotional power or the thrills of one scene.Still, it's for these moments of fragile humanity that the film deserves our attention, the friendship between Dith and Sidney, their sweetness, their vulnerability, their fears and smiles. It's also for these little foretastes on the terror before the titular fields reveal the ugly secrets buried in their muddy holes, for these brief moments showing a little child crying in the middle of an intense bombing or the emotional farewell to Dith that the film is such an extraordinary journey, culminating with a tale of survival-b-keeping-a-low-profile that makes it closer to \"The Pianist\" than \"Schindler's List\".But there's little chance that this film has been watched as many times as these WW2 classics even with its status as a Best Picture nominee. A real shame because the 100th entry of the British Film Institute Top 100 should be exposed to the public eyes, to raise awareness of a tragedy as emotionally devastating as the Holocaust, if only because this time it was a Genocide of a regime against their own people. \"The Killing Fields\" is important film-making, it's a historical document that I recommend watching in the company of several Youtube clips that would provide further insights on the tragedy.Roland Jaff\u00e9 would later make \"The Mission\", an interesting companion piece. Not to venture into hazardous comparaisons, but I guess what both films show is that men's evil might annihilate one civilization but not the universal extent of fraternal love ... immortalized by the film's emotional finale before closing on a picture of two child refugees, one looking behind, one helplessly staring at us... what a symbol!",

            "content": "This is a terrific biographical action drama set in an American conflict that few of us know anything at all about. Like its subject matter the film has crept into relative obscurity, despite its seven Academy Award Nominations, including one for Best Picture. It won in three of these seven categories, including Best Cinematography and Best Supporting Actor for Dr. Haing S. Ngor.It takes place in the post Vietnam era, during the Cambodian Revolution when the Khmer Rouge took power and it provides us with a behind the scenes look the highly unpublicized American involvement. It's primarily based on the relationship that develops between Pulitzer Prize Winning New York Times Reporter, Sydney Schanberg and his guide, interpreter and fellow journalist Dith Pran, (Ngor). Sam Waterson, who received an Oscar Nomination for Best Actor in a Leading Role, portrays Schanberg, whose relentless determination leads to accusations and profound feelings of guilt for compromising the safety of Pran by delaying his evacuation.Much of the remainder of cast is impressive as well. John Malkovich is splendid in the role of Al Rockoff, an American photographer on assignment with Schanberg, Julian Sands as British journalist Jon Swain and many others.This is the film that taught me to put my closed captions, for the hearing, (and listening), impaired, to good use. Even with an exceptional home theater system, (which is probably as effective as any one found in the cinema in 1984), I found it impossible to understand much of the dialogue, due to the thick Cambodian accents. The second time I saw the film I used my captions, as needed, to be sure that I not only heard, but also understood every word. What's the old saying? It was like watching it again for the very first time. Since then it's been my policy that any movie worth watching twice is worth hearing once.The graphic violence is extreme and in that respect, may well have paved the way to the future for such award winners as \"Platoon\" & \"Black Hawk Down\". I suspect that this is due, at least in part, to the fact that the screenplay was written based on the actual accounts from journalist who experienced this war from its frontlines. Schanberg & Pran, in particular, might just as well have been fighting themselves.I no longer own this movie and it's been sometime since I last saw it, therefore I apologize if some of my facts are not in order. Prior to writing this I did make an effort to rent it, not so much to refresh my memory, but more to revisit an old friend. Unfortunately, it appears as though the largest video rental establishment in the Southeast has forgotten this flick as well, at least in their Charlotte stores. Part of the irony here is appropriated in the film's tagline, \"Every so often, there is a film that is destined to be talked about and remembered for years to come\". What I do remember, beyond a shadow of a doubt, is the fact that this is a magnificent film that depicts the horrors and extremities of war, while illustrating a genuinely interesting drama, as well as any I've ever seen.",

The terror and genocide in Cambodia is not overlooked in this story indeed it fits perfectly aside this tale of friendship. The acting is great and the Cambodia doctor \u0085..

            "content": "The Killing Fields opens with a voice-over telling us of a few brief, matter of fact items regarding the Asian locality of Camboida; a coming of speech which informs us of how The West see it as a lonely, isolated, untouched paradise over long shots of warm, tropical iconography in the form of low sunsets and palm trees. Where the compositions are rather picturesque and the supposed views glowing, The Killing Fields is a film more about the death and destruction going on within a corrupt and putrid nation; those of whom run it share similar characteristics. The suggestion that something is very wrong with the established Western view is hinted at when a large aircraft used for bombing raids ominously flies overhead, before we cut to a closer shot physically bringing us a little deeper into the locale thus revealing a young boy wearing a war helmet. In a basic sense, Utopian iconography of an \"untouched paradise\" has been replaced by standard war genre codes; an un-Earthing of the truth after a prior stance has been just been deconstructed, the film itself a documenting of the atrocities that occurred within the nation of Cambodia between 1973 and 1975, and whose opening from the lead wonderfully ties in with his own experiences as we observe him at various points in the film try to uncover the truth about an event, within an event.Roland Joff\u00e9's quite wondrous film covers the true story of a man, an American journalist, named Sydney Schanberg here played by Sam Waterston and his friendship with several other men of western origin as well as native Cambodian photojournalist Dith Pran, played by the Oscar winning and now tragically deceased Haing S. Ngor. Joff\u00e9's film is a systematic deconstructing of this supposed myth the opening voice over speaks of and a somewhat effortless encompassing of post-war mental states linked to that of predominantly guilt as well as life as a prisoner of a new order on top of that. The film is a taut, mediative piece on one's actions and the decisions one makes in the heated coven of wartime whilst battling on the front-line, not as soldier with a gun but as a journalist with a camera, and how these shape the immediate situation as well as how these decisions made come to affect those involved years later; the centrepiece of which is a harrowing race against time when several characters are holed up in a building located in the Cambodian capital of Phnom Penh, as a man's life seems hours away from being ended due to incoming dangers.How it came to that is a tale altogether; the resulting misadventures born out of it additionally something else with the story of two men coming to understand one another under intensified circumstances the film's first port of call. When we begin with one of these men, we begin with Pran being chauffeured around town in a Mercedes, something which suggests importance; the presence of the car radio set to an American station playing out in English also suggesting bilinguality thus an education and the dialogue-free interactions he engages in with two passing monks as he walks past them on a public street hinting at not only respectful characteristics but perhaps a decent, positive reputation that he himself carries resulting in people stopping and bowing their heads to him. The characteristics are that of a binary opposition when placed up alongside those in the Cambodian Communist organisation known as The Khmer Rouge, the chief instigators of hate and fear throughout the film and the chaos and terror they instill into both the film and those involved later on because of the finale of the Vietnam War spilling out into the neighbouring nation.The film scatters the nationalities of most of the other first world, usually Capitalist, officials Schanberg and Pran deal with; a deliberate deploying of varying nationalities representative of The First World attempting some form of aid to those of Pran's ilk involved in the hardships, everything from Australia to Scotland to England to Russia. But the film is less bothered with the politics than it is of the true story of these two men linking up; Schanberg's relationship with Pran, like Pran's characteristics in regards to his own natives The Khmer Rouge, is in stark opposition to that of his getting along with The American Government, whom he berates from the beginning and clashes with on a number of personal and political points. After initially arriving and meeting with a relatively spaced out photojournalist named Al Rockoff (Malkovich), Schanberg is forced into travelling to the site of an American bombing raid with some locals when denied access to fly out along with the Americans; a later event as Schanberg attempts to practise liberalism in trying to photograph some atrocities leading to arrest and later realisation at press fabrication with what they perceived to have happened there that day.Pran's staying in Cambodia following evacuation orders on behalf of Schanberg leads him to a nightmarish post-war space of authority, totalitarianism and a strong military presence operating under a banner of a 'Year One' mentality. The distinction as to what sorts of environments each of the respective parties, Pran still in the Far East and Schanberg in New York City, inhabit in this: their post-Cambodia living, is pointed out via the kinds of mediums and sources of cultural indulgence they have access to or the ability to be exposed to. Where Schanberg is free to engage with the news; home video and opera, Pran is having to surrender to a dictatorship wanting to eradicate free thinking and bring everybody down to the same level. The finale and what transpires in leading up to it is fraught with angst and terror infused within both parties; a nerve-shredding trek in both a psychological and physical sense of either man desperate to be reunited. For this a many other things, the film is a triumph.",

The film tells the story of American journalist Sydney Schanberg, who was reporting in Cambodia during the Vietnam war. America was secretly bombing Cambodia and then invade. He was present during the rise of the communists, the Khmer Rouge. Sydney befriends a Cambodian journalist and interpreter Dith Pran and both men see the country become war-torn and then see the Khmer Rouge become truly brutal against the people. Both men are forced by 1975 to hide in the French embassy with other journalists and Cambodians. Both men get split up, Sydney goes back home to New York whilst Dith is forced to under the brutal regime and goes into forced labour.This a beautiful film about friendship and both men do have a love for each other. It also show how brutal the regime of Pol Pot was and that he was on of the worst dictators in the twentieth century. It is well acted and Roland Joffe shows that he was once a good director. A aspect that I liked out the film was it felt like you were really they, you didn't know what was going one, like the people and you only got information from television or the radio.

The 1975 collapse of Cambodia and subsequent 're-education' of its population (through brainwashing and genocide) by Khmer Rouge insurgents is reconstructed through an unlikely but true friendship between two journalists from opposite ends of the globe: hard-nosed New York Times reporter Sydney Schanberg and his resourceful Cambodian counterpart Dith Pran. From their anxious refuge inside the French Embassy in Phnom Penh to the horrors of a post-revolution work camp, the film builds moments of agonizing intensity, although the latter half splits into separate stories of unequal impact: Schanberg, in New York, agonizes verbally and at length over the unknown fate of his friend, while Pran, in the newly named Kampuchea, endures a torment that surpasses words. The performances in general and the cinematography in particular merit special attention, with the moody colors suggesting the light of a solar eclipse: darkness in broad daylight.",

            "content": "What was taken away after a viewing of The Killing Fields is not any sort of empathy with those poor Cambodians or the plight of Dith Pran, but a genuine hatred of Roland Joffe for believing his audience is made up of moronic dolts so ignorant and unsophisticated that they need to be told that the insanity and murder on display is a very bad thing. Really, thank god for the 30 inserts of crying children while overpowering sadness-score swells exponentially. Feel bad! You must FEEL BAD FOR THEM! Joffe's narcissism viciously attacks us at every turn with how goddamn important he knows this film is. It's brutal and insulting.This is a shame, as there are some skillfully choreographed sequences where our protagonists are shuffled from place to place in total confusion as to the situation. These contain little to no dialogue and articulate a great deal through imagery. Of course there is the outrageously bizarre musical accompaniment that deflates any interest in the scenes. It's as if Joffe hired Trent Reznor and Danny Elfman and told them to meet somewhere in the middle. The much hyped performance of Haing S. Ngor is not Earth shattering but definitely impressive, especially as a non actor who totally out-acts the rest of the cast. The tragedy is that as a man who actually survived all the misery we see in this film, he deserved to be in a far better portrayal of the insanity the Khmer Rouge put Cambodia through. All we learn about the calamitous conflict is that \"it sucked.\" Granted, the focus of this film is on the characters of the reporters, but the audience should know a bit about what they are seeing. The Khmer Rouge appears like a magical force that simply showed up and took over. This might be asking for too much of a different film, but it seems necessary for something that clearly wants to be the total embodiment of the Cambodian conflict. A film that bastardizes John Lennon's \"Imagine\" in such a horrific, tug-at-the-heart-strings fashion deserves no such moniker. It's an ending so overdone and steeped in cheese that all in the audience will cry, but not for the intended reason.",

Pran is forced to stay in Cambodia when the journalists leave and only escapes to America at the end of 1979.The film begins with journalist Sydney Schanberg (Sam Waterston) arriving in Cambodia in 1973 on a New York Times assignment. Dith Pran (Haing S. Ngor) is assigned as his translator/facilitator. Schanberg is arrogant and aggressive. We also meet Al Rockoff (John Malkovich), a laid-back photojournalist who frequently returns to the storyline. Schanberg and Pran cover an American B-52 \"accident\" that destroys a Cambodian village but is downplayed by the U. S. military.The story then jumps to 1975, when it is clear the Khmer Rouge will soon enter the capital city of Phnom Penh. There are dramatic encounters between the American journalists and the Khmer Rouge in which Dith Pran plays a central role in preserving their lives. After the Khmer Rouge take over the city, the journalists retreat to the French Embassy. However, local Cambodians are ordered to leave the embassy. Schanberg, Rockoff, and photojournalist Jon Swain (Julian Sands) try to forge a Western passport for Pran, but eventually, he is left behind.The film then alternates between Schanberg's efforts to discover if Dith Pran is still alive and Pran's existence under the Khmer Rouge for four years, and the persona he adopts to survive. Schanberg is sometimes accused of forcing Pran to stay in Cambodia when he could have been evacuated with the rest of his family at an earlier point.This powerful film tells the story of local translators/facilitators who work with Americans in their various international adventures. Haing S. Ngor deserved his Oscar, though it should have been for Best Actor, not Best Supporting Actor. Waterston was nominated for an Oscar, but the film portrays him as an arrogant American who needs the local Cambodian to save him. The cinematography is first-rate. The chaos and the uncertainty of life are clearly evident but without unnecessary gore. Closeups and quick shifts reduce the need for hundreds of planes and lengthy battle scenes. Fewer Sydney Schanberg scenes and more Dith Pran scenes would have suited me.There's a lot of fiction in the film. Its version of creating a fake passport is pure fiction. And the film omits the fact that Dith Pran was the administrator for a Cambodian village for much of a year after Vietnam overran the Khmer Rouge. He escaped to Thailand when he feared the Vietnamese would learn of his American connections; he did not escape from the Khmer Rouge.There is a supreme irony that Haing S. Ngor, who also suffered under the Khmer Rouge, died in Los Angeles in 1996 after being shot in a robbery attempt outside his home. He was a medical doctor that hid his professional skills while captured to avoid being killed.",

Schanberg is practically powerless to aid his friend, who faces a perilous task in escaping Cambodia's Killing Fields.The direction by Roland Joff\u00e9 along with the Oscar-winning cinematography by Chris Menges bring the story to vivid life. The latter portion of the film, taking place for the most part in the Cambodian countryside is particularly breathtaking. Mike Oldfield's score, on the other hand, is not always successful and sometimes exudes a typical eighties gloss. There are a few times when the music distracts but, thankfully, those instances are the exception rather than the rule.Waterston and Ngor's portrayal of the two principle characters is convincing and the supporting cast isn't too bad either. Ngor won an Oscar for his role, doing so with a performance based mostly on nuance. The ending sequence, featuring John Lennon's \"Imagine\", is particularly touching though now bitterly ironic given Ngor's murder a dozen years after this film.This is a compelling story of hope in the face of tyranny.

There are so many unforgettable passages in this film. It grabs hold of you right from the beginning and never lets' go.

            "content": "The acting is very good. I'm not just saying that because I'm impressed brown people from foreign countries can act (as I suspect many are). Some of the guards are impressively menacing, for example. It's hard to give John Malkovitch credit because he's always good.The story is a little self-indulgent; much of it is about the Americans. I'd venture to guess that the actual Killing Field period takes up less than 40% of the film's time.The score is lousy, but then, really, a lot of scores at the time this was made were terrible. (Yes, there are some gems. But there's a whole lot of rubble.)Ultimately, my problem with the movie is that if you're looking for a fair understanding of what happened in Cambodia, this isn't it. It's an attempt by some people to wash their hands of their own culpability, and to whitewash the atrocities committed by those whose political philosophy they are sympathetic towards.The show does nothing of any real significance to demonstrate the unparalleled horror that the Khmer inflicted on Cambodia, and instead hopes to write it off as the result of American bombing. Silly.Leave aside the unmentioned fact that the bombings were sanctioned by the Cambodian government, which had thrown out the Prince who was allowing the country to be used by the North Vietnamese. That's not an unimportant fact. (I hope viewers understand that Cambodia is how the North Vietnamese infiltrated the South - get a map and look at where Saigon and the Mekong Delta are, and you'll suddenly begin to understand why there was so much fighting in that notorious swamp and why Nixon bombed Cambodia. Secret? To whom? It was no secret to the Cambodians. The fact that some Americans drone on about its secrecy is merely evidence of their own self-importance. What does the secrecy of the bombings - to the American mind - have to do with the fact that leftist Cambodians were teaching children to hack their families to death with machetes? If \"the bombings\" made them do it, why the need to indoctrinate children away from the idea of family? One has zero to do with the other, but everything to do with a philosophy of Party and State.) But you're talking about a regime (the Khmer) that managed - in a country with a population density somewhere around present-day Wisconsin - to round up and slaughter somewhere between 1 out of every 6 and 1 out of every 4 people. Even the Vietnamese didn't commit these kinds of atrocities and we flattened the place. They had cities to bomb and bomb them we did. As we did Germany and Japan. The Khmer always intended to do the things they did, but it would be too much for Chomskyites to admit that this is the logical conclusion of their radical inclinations.It would be good to really get a handle on what was done. I suspect we'll have to wait a long time before we ever get a fair treatment of what happened to the Kulaks, what happened in the real Gulags, during the Great Leap Forward, the Cultural Revolution, the North Vietnamese conquering of the South and what the Khmer did.The use of Communist Viet Nam appears only as the plot device (albeit a historic one) that allows the protagonist to attempt his escape (of course, by a \"real\" Khmer patriot, now suddenly worried about where his country is going). It mentions the border scuffles in a single line. Nothing about the fact that waves of human beings were fleeing Cambodia by any means possible to Thailand, Burma and Viet Nam (which was already conducting its own pogrom against the South while gearing up to go to war with their former sponsors the Chinese). Red on Red indeed.And yeah: \"Imagine\" is a silly song. Communists butchered many, many people because those people were attached to their religions. This is just spitting on their graves.",

            "content": "It is quite some time since I saw this film, and war movies are not normally my genre of choice. However, I left the theatre deeply moved by the personal story involved and also better informed of the atrocities in Cambodia under Pol Pot during the 1970's, an aspect of modern history of which I was woefully ignorant. As modern movies have brought to the masses the cruelty of the Holocaust, this film emotionally conveys what I suspect is the much lesser known suffering of the Cambodian people, with two million civilian deaths resulting from this civil war. The film tells the dramatic story of an American journalist, Sydney Shanberg who is covering the civil war in Cambodia along with native interpreter, Dith Pran. Pran saves Shanberg and the other journalists, but must then protect himself from the outrages of the Khmer Rouge. He manages to escape to Thailand and is finally reunited with Shanberg, who has been anxiously searching for him.The scene that has stayed with me through the years is the dramatic ending, where Shanberg and Pran are reunited. It is their touching friendship that has formed the basis of this movie, and Shanberg has been so desperate to locate his friend. Tears come to my eyes even now as I recall them embracing with such joy at being safely reunited. It seemed as though the tall Shanberg virtually picked up the much shorter, totally endearing Pran, who had suffered so much during the time they were separated. Ever since this movie, I have been a great fan of Sam Waterston, who competently portrays the journalist Shanberg.Although I was so caught up in the moment I didn't object at the time, I do in retrospect have a few difficulties with the background music chosen for this scene. John Lennon's 'Imagine' has a beautiful tune and though all people of good will desire peace, I oppose its clearly anti-religion lyrics.Dith Pran was portrayed by first-time actor, Haing S. Knor, a Cambodian gynecologist who had lost his own family due to the Khmer Rouge. This added an extra poignancy in conveying how much his character, Pran, suffered. Sadly, I recently read that Knor, who won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar, was killed senselessly a few years after this movie by a street gang for no reason whatsoever.This is an unforgettable film, troubling but also both extremely enlightening and moving. It dramatically unfolds this compelling friendship bond while bringing to the forefront the Cambodian horror story, from the perspective of one very appealing Cambodian.",

The facts that the film is not based, but an actual true story, coupled with the knowledge that star Haing S Ngor was an actual Khmer Rouge prisoner, makes it impossible to turn away from the screen.Sam Waterston's performance as the determined turned guilt-ridden reporter Sydney Schanberg is good, but the show belongs to Ngor whose compelling performance gives us not only a person we care about but also a realistic, real human being, thrown into horrible circumstances of outside causes. If anything Ngor's terrific performance can be the sole reason of this film's raw power and brutality.But there is more to watch in this human film. Mike Oldfield's great, suitable score which perfectly suits the action without getting too dramatic or too subtle. The stunning cinematography which shows the horrors of war amidst the beauty of Cambodia. Terrific production value showing atmospheric, realistic locations filled with thousands of extras, a feat reminding me of the days of David Lean, only less joyous and much more terrifying given the context.I cannot recommend this brilliant film enough. Actions speak louder than words, so go see this as soon as you can, and prepare to be moved immensely. The use of John Lennon's \"Imagine\" is perfectly suited.Overall rating: 91/100",

First, its realistic portrayal of the war in Cambodia - focusing on the suffering of civilians, and the incredible horror some would inflict on others.Second, the rather cold, unsympathetic journalist, Sydney Schanberg (Waterston). Yes, that's what I said. It's not until after winning a Pulitzer Prize for his Cambodian assignment, does he begin to have some real guilt about leaving his friend to suffer. Great timing. He then embarks on a mission to save Dith Pran, but it seems less for his friend than to absolve his own shame.If you've seen the movie and didn't catch this, please see it again. The events leading up to Schanberg's veneration are anything but compassionate towards the real victims, Dith especially. A journalist who wakes up, conveniently after his ego has been sufficiently nourished, and decides to be a human being for a change. He's lying down in his N.Y apartment listening to opera, but that won't quench his guilt either. It was worth a try though.Dith's pleading for his life will forever haunt me. Waterston's accurate portrayal of this self-absorbed, blinded-by-the-truth journalist is even more abhorrent.Minor actor, Spalding Gray, based his entire monologue \"Swimming to Cambodia\" (1987) on a bit part in the movie. This is the second example of exploitation by the artsy-left crowd. The first is \"The Killing Fields\", for demonstrating how one can use unfortunate victims to further their careers and come out looking like humanitarians.",

In such divided times, Schanberg is able to return home unchallenged, though for Pran, the rules are different.A simply astonishing display, capturing the strain and distress caused by such devastating affairs. The film is in a similar format to Michael Cimino's The Deer Hunter starring Christopher Walken and Robert De Niro, with its slow and careful approach, ensuring that all details are included and that the production is sincere and doesn't appear rushed.In addressing serious philosophical subjects, the movie's cast is what allows these topics to be explored with full strength; Haing S. Ngor, Sam Waterston and John Malkovich shine in their respective roles, portraying their characters to highlight the difficulties that each faced in tough conditions. The movie's brilliance was reinforced at the 1985 Academy Awards where it picked up three 'Oscar' wins for 'Cinematography' and 'film editing' as well as Ngor winning what would turn out to be his only Academy Award - receiving the honour for 'Best Supporting Actor'.Turning over $20 million in its Box Office was extremely impressive for the mid 1980s and The Killing Fields proved itself as an insightful, cultured spectacle that possesses an initiated polish to an already sublime script. The camerawork goes hand-in-hand with the sublime acting performances, in convincingly portraying the acts of pain and exhaustion.An eye-opening, jaw-widening, tear-dropping watch.",

Of course, it tells a bigger story too, namely the result of the bombing of Cambodia by the United States and subsequent atrocities committed by the Khmer Rouge: torture, slavery, brainwashing, increasingly indiscriminate murder on a mass scale. All very real and very terrible things. The film manages to tackle all of this heavy material without glossing anything over, (I'm looking at you Hotel Rwanda) and without making it so brutal as to be unwatchable.Unfortunately, the majority of the acting and dialogue in The Killing Fields isn't quite good enough to do the aforementioned atrocities justice. That is not to say these aspects of the film are bad, they're perfectly adequate. I just wish they were as flawless as some enraptured reviewers would have you believe.Ironically, (and perhaps even fittingly) it's the non-actor Cambodian children that give the most convincing, (and touching) performances in the movie. They may just be being themselves, but it lends the film an authenticity which few of the trained actors were able to capture with any consistency.The cinematography is spot on. Brilliantly balanced and flawlessly framed, it's practically symbolic in a few shots. Just beautiful. All of the filming appeared to be shot on site, in Cambodia and elsewhere, a practice that the majority of modern directors seem to have forgotten about, which is a shame since no amount of CGI or special effects are as convincing as the real place. The sets look 100% real, nothing looks staged.The music ranges from moving, to merely fitting, to downright strange and painfully 80's. Fortunately, there's more of the former than of the latter. With the exception of a few crude sound effects, The Killing Fields sounds quite good overall.While important, The Killing Fields is unlikely to ever be a very popular film. While it's technically a \"war movie\" (in part) it never glorifies violence, or tries to make it look cool. There's plenty of violence, of course, but it's more of the uncensored 6 o' clock news variety. Obviously, the film also draws attention to a very dark page from the United States past, and raises a lot of uncomfortable questions, which is bound to turn some people off. However, for anyone mature enough to handle its subject matter, and empathetic enough to explore the wide range of emotions covered in the film, The Killing Fields should really not be missed.7.9/10",

Set against the backdrop of the war-infested Cambodia, where Khmer Rouge had taken charge during the mid-70s, this is a story of those brave-heart journalists who made it back alive! And honestly, that is the only story this film tells! Khmer Rouge is merely a 'backdrop' as mentioned earlier in this paragraph and that is the very fact about this film that lets it down.This is a film that begins on a chaotic note and continues it further, and hence, for the viewer, the tension never really develops...it is already there, at the outset! The story centers around two of the main characters, Sydney Schanberg (Sam Waterston) and Dith Pran (Haing S. Ngor) who are trying to cover the war situation in Cambodia in 1973. Things turn uglier soon enough when an American B-52 bombs the town of Neak Leung by mistake! Two years later, the Khmer Rouge seem to be taking over, and evacuation begins. Some Cambodian locals who have sought refuge in the French Embassy in Cambodia are forcibly trapped in the whole drama, including Dith Pran, who is there to assist Schanberg.The rest of the story focuses on how Schanberg is feeling guilty about letting Pran stay on with him and how Pran attempts to survive amidst the Killing Fields created by the Rouge.What this film doesn't quite clarify are the intentions of the Khmer Rouge itself on which the whole films seems to build its premise. The actions and the very reason of the existence of the Khmer Rouge isn't clear enough, neither is the actual situation in Cambodia. There is chaos throughout the film, so there isn't really any clear explanation given for the whys and the hows and the whats in this supposedly powerful drama.Sure, there are a lot of gut-wrenching scenes in this war-fest, but since we who are newly being introduced to the Khmer Rouge history aren't really told the inside story, it is difficult to relate to any of those who are mercilessly disposed of! So at this point, I would recommend the viewer to thoroughly study the Khmer Rouge story, in order to follow this film more closely! Good performances from the two lead actors Sam Waterston and Haing S. Ngor and a fine supporting act in an early role by John Malkovich, but that is just not enough to save this film based on a strong true story.\"The Killing Fields\" is a film begging for a remake, with hopefully a more focused script.",

The film is just as unpredictable as life itself. The actors did a very good job in bringing the characters to life, especially Haing S. Ngor as Dith Pran. (Ngor himself, was a captive during the Cambodian war where he was imprisoned and tortured).Parts of the film looks like an advertising vessel for Coca Cola, which is a pity, but I suppose they were a big sponsor. Apart from that, this is a very well done film. I did find the latter part of the second act and into the beginning of the third act a bit dragged out. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't in the least boring, but found it too long. It does span a few years, though, so I suppose they wanted to show us the agony Dith Pran had to endure, making way for a good finale.",

If it had been a documentary I would have loved it, but it seems to fall by movie standards. Yes, it is about a very sensitive subject and gets a very important message about the terrible acts committed by man, but movies require more than just that for a great review, and I don't think the Killing Fields quite delivers.

            "review_title": "A Tour De Force in Polemical Cinema",
            "content": "David Puttnam, who produced The Killing Fields, has long argued for more films to be about something, reflecting the larger world we live in. The Killing Fields is a product of a polemical cinema, based on real people and events, for the promotion of a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre, in this case the dubious morality of the United State's involvement in modern Cambodia and the country's subsequent descent into totalitarian nightmare.In early 1970's Cambodia, American journalist Sydney Schanberg reports on US mass bombing on the Vietnamese border, carried out in order to destroy Vietcong bases located there. He sees the destabilisation of the country, and witnesses, as a consequence in his view, the Khmer Rouge's rise to power. This theme, the abandonment of the United State's Third World involvement once its interests in an area have diminished, is personified and presented allegorically in Schanberg's real life friendship with a local journalist and translator, Dith Pran. At first Schanberg treats Dith Pran like an employee, rather than as a friend or partner, chiding him when he cannot 'find the story', i.e civilian casualties of the US bombings.Schanberg and some colleagues stay on once the Khmer Rouge takes over, though it is clear this is as much for their own self-serving careerist needs as it is for truth and justice. In any case, it becomes clear that these naive journalists have no idea of the danger they are in, and what follows is a journey of survival, guilt and redemption.Schanberg and his fellow western journalists, having 'found the story' and nearly been killed in the process, are eventually granted safe passage out of the country, and Schanberg abandons Dith Pran in the hands of the Khmer Rouge. The film thus shifts from a war film on the ground, splitting towards a twin narrative. The first shows Schanberg's return to the US to awards and comfort. He has become the famous war reporter he wanted to be, which fuelled his interest in Cambodia in the first place. But he now finds emptiness and misery in his guilt-ridden state, as he makes futile attempts to help his friend Dith Prin, who only stayed in Cambodia to help Schanberg and put himself on the line for Schanberg when the Khmer Rouge initially captured them. On an allegorical level, the United States, having involved themselves in South East Asia to protect its national interests, has abandoned the region to the fate of the conflicts it helped create.The second, concurrent narrative shows Dith Pran's nightmare journey towards deprivation and dehumanisation in the Khmer Rouge's rural death camps, where he has to be anonymous as urbanised, educated people are put to death. Here he witnesses the terrifying destruction of social and family life, and restructuring of society on totalitarian lines, before he escapes.It is unusual for a western film to focus on a native 'supporting actor'. They are usually confined to being sidekicks to the active American 'hero', who has to sort out the situation for the natives. However, The Killing Fields contrasts Schanberg's purgatory in New York, trying to keep the authorities aware of Dith Pran and helping his refugee family, and Dith Pran's own unbelievable, but real, journey of survival. But the film is keen to point out that, far from Dith Pran being destroyed by his experience, he fights for his humanity, making a connection with the disenchanted Khmer Rouge leader who recaptures him. When the leader dies due to infighting, caused by an invasion by the Khmer Rouge's Vietnamese former allies, Dith Pran takes the man's son with him when he escapes, only for the boy to die in a landmine attack. It is interesting to see Dith Pran giving the boy a Buddhist funeral, showing he has not forgotten the humanistic traditions of his country, which the Khmer Rouge have tried to wipe out. The dignity of the small funeral in the forest contrasts with the horror of the mass graves, the killing fields he has stumbled upon throughout the country. This scene also contains its own, smaller allegory on the fate of children under the Khmer Rouge,reflecting the brutal 'education' of children, which turns them into vicious,dehumanised, little cadres, separated from their families, bred to be loyal only to the state.Dith Pran eventually makes his way to safety. Schanberg has gone from ambitious war reporter to broken man, and is revived by news of Dith Pran's escape. Dith Pran has changed by extraordinary circumstances from an aspiring journalist to being some thing much greater, a man ennobled by undefeated courage and an unshakable faith in humanity. In the final scene, Dith Pran, helping a landmine victim, sees Schanberg arrive at the aid camp he has found refuge in. There is a tense moment as the two face each other from a distance, which collapses as Dith Pran runs to hug Schanberg. Schanberg asks for redemption in abandoning Dith Pran, to which he replies there is no need, and that he is only happy to see him again. In the same way, the film is completing its larger allegory in asking for the United States to redeem itself by re-engaging with the region, but this time not with war and arrogance but peace and humility.The cast is uniformly excellent, particularly Sam Waterson as Schanberg and non-actor, Dr Haing S. Ngor as Dith Pran. Roland Joffe's direction is superb, filming Robinson's skillful, resonant first screenplay with an ambitious realism and sensitivity, whilst retaining an eye for the natural beauty of Cambodia. The shifts in location from rural, third world Cambodia to urban, first world New York are handled seamlessly. Particularly interesting is his concentration, during certain scenes, on the reaction of the common person caught up in the events that surround them.Overall, a tour de force in polemical cinema.",

It seems like movies where the protagonist is not from a familiar culture wind up being limited in popularity, and this film deserves better than that.  Westerners all too often forget about the atrocities committed in Cambodia, and this film documents the suffering of the people in a very personal way.Haing S. Ngor gives one of the best performances I have ever seen recorded on film.  Certainly, his real-life experience living through the Pol Pot regime must have given him a lot to draw on, but it is still remarkable that an untrained actor could convey so much.  He deserved every bit of the praise he got, including the Academy Award.  The other performances are also excellent, especially John Malkovich and the somewhat-maligned Sam Waterston.I agree with the other reviewers that this movie avoids the implication of the US government in the rise of Pol Pot, as well as the Vietnamese connection.  But, as a depiction of one man's harrowing experience in the reeducation camps, putting politics aside, it is still an extremely worthwhile movie.  Hopefully, people will want to learn more after seeing it, and will educate themselves further on the history of this amazing country.I saw this movie for the first time before visiting Cambodia in person, and when I visited the actual killing fields outside of Phnom Penh, I finally realized how realistic the scene of Pran falling into a pit with hundreds of bodies was.  If you're planning on visiting Cambodia, this movie should be required viewing.  Anyone who underestimates the realism of this film needs to visit the country - and speak to the survivors.",

            "content": "The Killing Fields is an urgent, powerful and visually upsetting film set in the mid-70s in Cambodia. Director Roland Joffe spares us nothing whatsoever in his devastating depiction of casualties, cruelty and torture during the appalling combat. But the film is not merely concerned with presenting a realistic snapshot of the atrocities in Cambodia at the time of the Khmer Rouge uprising. Joffe's film also works on a human level by telling the true story of the relationship between a N.Y. Times journalist and his Cambodian assistant and interpreter during these events. It is the expert balance of unflinching history and human drama that makes The Killing Fields such a tremendous movie.N.Y. Times reporter Sydney Schanberg (Sam Waterston) is working in Cambodia in 1973 on a report about the consequences of American bombings against suspected communist bases. Assigned to aid and interpret for Schanberg is the native Dith Pran (Hang S. Ngor). As the months pass, chaos erupts in Cambodia and the Khmer Rouge seize control. Dith Pran places himself in danger to protect Schanberg from the victorious Khmer Rouge forces and even risks life and limb to help him gather controversial material for his dispatches back to America. But when Schanberg and the other remaining correspondents have to leave Cambodia, they fail to fool the authorities into believing that Dith Pran is an American citizen, and the unfortunate interpreter is taken to one of the infamous Year Zero re-education camps. After suffering and witnessing inhuman conditions and nauseating atrocities, Dith Pran escapes by crawling through corpse-littered paddy fields, and eventually is reunited with his American friend Schanberg in New York.Slightly hampered by unclear scripting in parts, as well as Mike Oldfield's terrible music score, The Killing Fields is in every other way a stunning film. The appalling and traumatic experiences that Dith Pran goes through are conveyed with near unwatchable authenticity. Indeed, the film hits emotional heights rarely touched upon in movies by placing a lot of emphasis onto Dith Pran's unimaginable experiences, and by showing the way he strives to survive even after these experiences have stripped him of his dignity. Ngor as the Cambodian interpreter gives a performance of real power in the role. Sam Waterston is also terrific as Schanberg, a dedicated journalist who faced the gravest danger by remaining in Cambodia after the Khmer Rouge rebellion, and who bore enormous personal guilt for failing to help his Cambodian colleague to escape from the ravaged country. One of the key films of the '80s, and indisputably one of the most provocative tales of survival in the history of cinema, The Killing Fields is an essential movie.",

            "content": "For many Americans, Southeastern Asian history ends in 1973 with the fall of Vietnam. But S. Vietnam wasn't the only government we were propping up in the area. When Lan Nol's Cambodian govt went under in 1975, the Khmer Rouge took over. Originally hailed as liberators, they responded to the cheers by emptying the entire population of Phnom Penh into the countryside and through a combination of murder, starvation and sheer economic stupidity, killed almost all of them. This is the backdrop of Joffe's film and it's greatly to its credit that it doesn't let the Cambodian holocaust overwhelm the entire story.Oldfield's score is particularly effective at evoking the sense of impending doom as the last American helicopters vanish into the sky. It's too bad he didn't fully flesh out the rest of the film score as well as he did these scenes. More than even the suberb acting, his music creates the mood of a world spinning out of control.The movie has an excellent pace--quick, tense, never becoming boring or pausing to lecture us about what happened. We don't get dry statistics about the killing fields--we get a scene in a dead swamp full of dried out, weathered tree stumps, and the remains of thousands of victims. As some other people have noticed, the tendency to blame the US for what happened is a bit heavy-handed (not to mention wrong). The real guilty party wasn't Nixon, but a man called \"Pol Pot\" who doesn't show up in the movie, but whose evil influence via the \"Angkar\" is omnipresent.The movie is primarily the story of a Cambodian reporter named Dith Tran who covered the pre-1975 war along with a NY reporter (played by Waterson). Unwilling to flee the country when he had a chance, he instead chooses to stay in Phnom Penh and after a desperate attempt to forge a British passport for him fails, is captured by the Khmer Rouge and sent to a work camp. He escapes, and by following his escape across Cambodia into Thailand, Joffe shows us the fate of Cambodia after Angkar's \"Year Zero\" in which the Khmer Rouge attempted to obliterate any memory of how things had been before their takeover. There are numerous disturbing scenes of children holding weapons or taking part in executions. This isn't an exageration. The Khmer Rouge looked to the youngest part of the population as the hope of the future since they hadn't been contaminated by capitalist thought. They also had to have a source of manpower, so many adults having died even before 1975 during the communist insurgency and the US bombings.While the movie had a happy ending, Cambodia did not. The chaos continued for years, Pol Pot was never tried for his crimes, and the devastating poverty left in the wake of \"Year Zero\" reduced Cambodia to an absolute destitution that it is still trying to climb out of. There's no great moral lesson here: just a powerful film about two reporters a Cambodian and American and what happens when a country implodes on itself.RstJ",

It started with the US bombing of Cambodia during the Vietnam War and jumped all over the place before finally settling into the Khmer Rouge's regime. One needs to have a thorough knowledge of Cambodian history to even vaguely understand what is going on in this film. I had to constantly explain what was happening to my parents while watching, and even I had trouble figuring out exactly what was meant to be happening during the first half of the film or so. They tried to squish the US bombing of Cambodia with the Khmer Rouge regime and it just didn't work.There is far too much focus on America and the journalism thing just got in the way. There was almost no exploration of who the Khmer Rouge were and what they were trying to achieve in Cambodia.Honestly, the movie could have been great if it was simply edited down, a bunch of scenes taken out, and some more explanation so the audience actually understood what was happening.

Another good way to look at the movie, in terms of Emerson students, is to learn of the passion that the journalists have for their work.

Maybe because I have seen him in so many b-level tv-movies and shows such as Law&Order and his somewhat preachy posture in his films. The story is an important one and it deserves to be told but the film doesn't suck the viewer in very well, possibly this is due to the fact that the Cambodian/Kampuchean conflicts are not as widely known and filmed as is e.g. the Vietnam war. Anyway, I suppose the film is good in that it tries to tell an important story and enlighten the audience. Something that was said by an earlier reviewer caught my attention, even though the film doesn't focus on the support that the NVA gave to Pol Pot and his movement I would definately not deem this film as false because of this. Also the fact that it was the Vietnamese army that finally toppled Pol Pot's reign is an indicator that he was not a very popular figure in the _very_ shattered sphere of communistic countries. I do not see this film as particularily anti-american or anti-nixon, the most poignant points are made about the actual acts of genocide committed by the Pol Pot regime.\nAnyway, this film is a fictive tale of horrific events that still haunt the lives of millions of Cambodians. 5/10",

This has the passive feel of a David Lean movie and while it is very well made, you feel removed from the horrors on screen; it gives us a tasteful view of genocide.The Killing Fields of the title are, of course, those in Cambodia during the reign of terror of the Khmer Rouge in the 1970's and Haing S Ngor, who plays the translator, Pran, was himself a non-actor and survivor of the killing fields (and like that other non-actor recreating something akin to his own real-life experiences in a movie, Harold Russell, Ngor was given the Oscar). One would expect, then, a greater urgency than first time director Roland Joffe gives the film.It is based on Sydney Schanberg's article \"The Death and Life of Dith Pran\" and Sam Waterson plays Schanberg, wracked by guilt and having left his interpreter behind in Cambodia when he escaped to the freedom of the West. Waterson plays Schanberg with moon-faced sincerity yet he still comes across as a decent, honorable man who probably could have done no more than the situation allowed. The superb cinematography is by the British cameraman Chris Menges who went on to direct \"A World Apart\" which told another true story about the horrors of apartheid and touched nerves far more deeply than this film does.",

            "content": "Periodically in the history of warfare there arises situations that seem to be of transcendent madness and darkness. While Vietnam was already a fully developed and unnecessary war, the civil war that erupted in Cambodia has only the European Holocaust as perpetrated by the Nazi's to be more evil. It is estimated that over 2 million people died as a result of the Khmer Rouge. The levels of brutality that Cambodians foisted upon one another is breathtaking in it's scope and depth. The wholesale slaughter of intellectuals, the educated professionals only touches upon the torment that tore apart an entire nation. The forcible relocation of millions of people into death/labor camps where brainwashing and starvation were applied with a ferocious evil; one can only wonder if death was gladly welcomed when it came. Life itself was for a time so bleak, so hopeless, so many cut off from any outside help, almost all nations having had their embassies forced closed, staff evicted; it beggars the imagination to wonder how this happened? Years later, Robert McNamara admitted that he and those around him (during the war) totally misunderstood the Vietnamese and their intentions. What was even more galling was the secret bombing of Cambodia (as ordered by Nixon and Kissinger). The relentless spread of war from Vietnam into bordering countries only looks like the spread of a virus. That the US played their deadly game of seeking an exit with honor at the expense of millions of Vietnamese and by extension, Cambodians, is a very dark spot in American history. The film is graphic in it's depiction of the horrors of the war. There are many scenes that haunt the mind long after the film is over. All the actors give excellent performances, especially Haing S. Ngor. His recreation of suffering is heartbreaking to watch. It is even more heartbreaking to shed a tear for him at the end of the film when you learn of the senseless death he suffered - the real person, in real life just a few years ago. All in all it is a depressing film because it is so close to the truth. It is a story of ambition and courage, chaos and survival. Cambodia is one of the poorest nations on the planet, and it is something of a miracle that the country survives. Why such horror happens in such poor places (think of Haiti as another example) is hard to calculate. Many countries have undergone civil wars; this one was one of the very worst in recent world history. The film is an anguished cry and is a fitting testimony to true darkness.",

            "review_title": "Pros And Cons Of The Killing Fields",
            "content": "Pros:1. No review of The Killing Fields is complete without praise for the amazing work of Haing S. Ngor as Dith Pran. What he lacked in official acting training was balanced by a level of sincerity and heartfelt emotion. Sam Waterston may have been nominated for Best Actor and appeared on the cover but Dr. Ngor is the #1 reason the film was so successful. From what I've heard, Dr. Ngor himself witnessed a fair amount of the atrocities that occurred in Cambodia in the 70's. I can definitely see why Dr. Ngor won the Supporting Actor Oscar, though I still say Tom Hulce would have won the 1984 Supporting Actor if Orion hadn't unwisely campaigned him for the Best Actor Oscar.2. Just as Dr. Ngor is so worthy of praise, the movie deserves praise for shifting focus from the Caucasian perspective to this profoundly more interesting story of Dith Pran's journey to freedom. It's a journey with endlessly fascinating turns like when a Mercedes car logo saves Dith's life or when Dith learns some members of the new government are decent people..3. While Dr. Ngor is the jewel of the movie, the Cascasian actors are good. Sam Waterston vividly portrays Syndey's flaws (his impatience to get the story out lands him often in trouble) and his good side (he really cares about Dith Pran's struggle). John Malkovich provides some badly needed levity with his speech on oysters or the reporter using chickens to get stories out of Cambodia. I was a fan of the sitcom \"Coach\" and I enjoyed the work Craig T. Nelson does here (this movie was released a little more than 4 years before Coach debuted on ABC). I also enjoyed the work of Jillian Sands as the blonde British reporter. This and \"Room With A View\" marked 2 times in 3 years that Sands was in a Best Picture Nominee.4. Forget about Nightmare On Elm Street or Gremlins, you want good scares in a 1984 film? Watch this movie. It's horrifying enough when a man speaking your language points a gun at you but it's 100 times scarier if you can't understand what he's saying. Dr. Ngor argued with Director Roland Joffe over how soon to reveal the KIlling Fields. I think Joffe was wise to delay the reveal as the build-up made it all the more scarier. No wonder Joffe was Oscar-nominated for Best Director and \"The Mission\" in 1986 made it 2 Directing nominations in 3 years.5. The movie won a well-deserved Cinematography Oscar. It shows Cambodia's beauty even at the worst of times. I especially loved the scene with Sydney and Dith Pran that just showed their silhouettes.6. The film is great at showing the horrors of war and not just on the battlefield. One minute you're at this cafe giving this silly speech about oysters and suddenly this terrifying blast is just far enough away to avoid hurting you. There's also the darkness of the human soul that war causes, like the family that claimed to be the Pran family to get into the Embassy (not that you can blame the impostors for wanting to escape to freedom). Of course there's always the tragedy of war as Dith Pran learns that nobody is ever really too young to die.7. Best Line Sydney: You forgive me? Dith Pran: Nothing To Forgive , Sydney. NothingCons:1. Good god how I loathe the scene of Malkovich chewing out Sydney in the Bathroom. Sydney does all he can to get Dith Pran back. He helps out the Pran family as much as he can even though Mrs. Pran has no optimism of any kind. It's not like he is full of himself. He readily admits how important Dith Pran is to his journalistic work. Malkovich, get off your high horse and go F yourself.2. I'm a little mixed about the \"Imagine\" scene. I love John Lennon's work but don't use popular music to tell the audience how to feel. It's completely unnecessary because the scene would still be moving even if it was shown in silence.3. Furthermore, since the film includes John Lennon's \"Imagine\" and Paul McCartney & Wings' \"Band On The Run\", I thing they should have completed it with a solo George Harrison song like \"What is My Life\" and a solo Ringo Starr song like \"It Don't Come Easy\"",

When he arrives, he meets Dith Pran, a Cambodian photojournalist and refugee who survived the Cambodian Genocide. This man becomes Schaberg's guide and translator during the war. When trying to photograph the execution of two Khmer Rouge operatives, they are arrested and later learn that the press had reported a different version of the story. In 1975, people were being evacuated from the capital because of a possible invasion from the Khmer Rouge. Even though Pran's family is able to flee, he decided to stay and help Schanberg cover the story. After going through several situations, in which they get arrested again, Pran is turned over to the Khmer Rouge after they ask for every Cambodian citizen to be turned in. After months of searching for Pran, Schanberg begins to blame himself for Pran's situation. He wouldn't be trapped if it weren't for him. However, after several complications, Pran reaches a Red Cross camp in the border of Thailand. When he returns home to his family, he reunites with Schanberg who apologizes for everything. Pran forgives him and the movie ends. This movie was extraordinary. The acting, camera movements and the realism in the film captured everything necessary for the audience to be caught in the moment. It is credible, touching and it is poetically convincing. It doesn't have a traditional Hollywood structure, but as a human story, it is very well made. It captures a vivid image of how people's lives were during that period.",

            "content": "Acting - Ngor is excellent. He is very believable as a Cambodian refugee, and seems to play this role to perfection. His interactions with Waterston seems to genuinely reflect the overall anxiety shared by millions of displaced Cambodains of the Khmer Rouge era. Even more impressive is the fact he pulled this off without having formal training in acting.-Waterston is also very good as Ngor's emotionally tortured friend. Ngor overshadows him in this respect, but Waterston shines in his own way - especially when those around him question his conviction. -Malkovich and Julian Sands have small roles, but they're important nevertheless because of their dedication to their occupation and Ngor. Picture/CinematographyPicturesque Thai vistas? Bombed out temples? Rampaging tank down city streets? Rice paddies? This movie did a great job of capturing the essence of Cambodia and the war itself. Plot Some historical inaccuracies but a fairly good representation of the carnage that occurred in Cambodia. Music I bought the soundtrack to this movie. People looking for a reason to hate complain about the Imagine theme, but hell the rest of the movie is so great who cares about the ending music? Oldfield's catchy tinny music doesn't dominate the action (save the end) and seems to rather fit in nicely with the action. Overall It's emotionally gut wrenching. The first time I saw this movie I wished it would never end - great movies have that effect on you. This movie will demand the viewer not turn a blind eye to holocaust. I connected with plight of all of the characters and wanted to learn everything I could about the genocide (my school had an exhibit for S-21 - really cool).It's like watching a translation of Anne Frank's famous quote that she believes people are genuinely good at heart - this movie portrays both sides almost perfectly and with unflinching determination.The Killing Fields is an original, gripping, and well-executed documentary of the Cambodian genocide. This would make it a very good movie. What makes this my favorite movie is the mutual responsibility and unswerving commitment Pran and Schanberg have for each other. Hotel Rwanda and Saving Private Ryan hardly stack up to this film. Watch it and bring out the Kleenex (and perhaps wikipedia :)",

            "content": "When it comes to war movies, Hollywood either turns a blind eye to the real events in favor of a bloodless glamorization or the filmmaker takes the \"no guts, no glory,\" war motto to heart. British director Roland Joffe chose the latter approach for his masterful yet brutal 3- time Oscar-winner, The Killing Fields.Starring a then-unknown cast, Sam Waterston plays with conviction real-life \"New York Times\" reporter Sydney Schanberg who is covering the civil war in Cambodia, putting the story ahead of his life. Deservedly garnering him an Oscar nomination, it was co-star Haing S. Ngor who won the golden man for his scene-stealing portrayal as Dith Pran, a local journalist and interpreter. Ngor, an untrained actor and survivor of the Cambodian War, is obviously all too familiar with the atrocities of war that are not candy-coated throughout the unabashedly- graphic (and twenty minutes too long) 141-minute running time. However, with Joffe's eye for framing beauty out of destruction and captivating experiences, The Killing Fields never lets your attention wander.With the Cambodian unrest growing more extreme, the Americans are forced to leave. While departing is not a problem for Schanberg (or for his intrepid photogs played by Julian Sands and the quick-tongued tension-reliever John Malkovich), Dirth Pran is stuck in a hellish war zone. Here the movie seamlessly morphs into a nail-biting escape film.Released in 1984 and set in the '70s, The Killing Fields is eye opening in relevancy considering today's war climate. Important viewing to show that what you see on the news might be a watered-down version of reality, The Killing Fields points out that media silence to a civil uprising and ignorance of the public might be just as deadly as bullets themselves.",

Without a doubt, the movie is one of the most powerful masterpieces I have ever known and seen.For me, the movie is not just a product made in Hollywood, it is the history. Every single scene is so real that I couldn't help myself shivering with fear. It reveals the most brutal aspect of Khmer Rouge: like killing millions of civilians in the most barbarian way. To save bullets, Khmer Rouge made people half knee on the side of a very big hole and they simply chopped off people's heads mercilessly. The big hole then became a mass grave. When I came to the Killing Fields near Phnom Penh, there were still several mass graves which are so big. It is said that at least more than 150 were in each grave. The things I learned from Cambodia make me much believe the movie.One thing i like in the movie is that it tells the truth about Khmer Rouge cadres. They were all children \u0096 who had been very transparent before being trained into butchers. Phran made such a great escape for life.The film was produced in the year i was born. I heard of The Killing Fields so much but not until at the age of 21, i eventually saw it. I read about Khmer Rough, setting my feet on the ground which used to be grave, but not until seeing the film feel that \"crazy\" atmosphere stronger than ever.One of my regrets is that I failed to see the Cambodian map made of skeletons.

The bombing and then the invading of Cambodia were neither justified nor in any way effective. The Vietnam war was lost when Nixon decided to invade Cambodia and this invasion spread American troops and military means over two wide a territory to even pretend the war was not lost. The invasion of Cambodia was the last straw that broke the camel's back. We could wonder today whether Kissinger let Nixon do this mistake to bury him in this war and thus enable himself to negotiate some kind of a peace agreement. An American journalist lost in this chaos and overwhelmed by the arrival of the Khmer Rouge in Phnom Penh was a witness to this senseless and absurd caper or continuation of a ridiculous war. But he had to use the services of a local journalist to be the interface between him and the locals. Unluckily this Cambodian journalist stayed too long and he could not escape from the claws of the Khmer Rouge. Then it is a story of resistance and resilience to survive the most horrendous conditions. He will manage to escape absolutely alone though he had started in a group of six or seven. Even the child he had been entrusted with will die along the way blown up by a mine. This is a true story, a testimony about one of the most astounding catastrophe and tragedy of our modern world, a war unjustified and lost even before being started waged by the USA in a country that they did not even know leading to one of the worst ever genocide in modern history performed by the Cambodians themselves onto the Cambodian people they made regress to some medieval state in just a few months and for a few years that lasted centuries. We westerners love exporting our worst nightmares to foreign countries and some of us never learn a lesson and are always ready to do better than some others before us. If the French lost the Indo-Chinese war in 1954 there was absolutely no reason why the Americans could win it. If the French lost the Algerian war in 1962 and the British lost the Middle East and Egypt quite some time before there is absolutely no reason why the Americans could do better. This film is a testimony to the suffering the vanity of some of our inspired western leaders imposes onto millions of people around the world.

He captures the poignance of Pran's situation and exemplifies man's will not simply to survive, but to rise above. The love and friendships presented in this movie are touching, but never cliched. There are many scenes which are quite disturbing (among them, the employment of children as soldiers for the brutal Khmer Rouge) but none that are gratuitously so. Sam Waterston, John Malkovich, and Julian Swain give strong performances, and Monirak Sisowath's performance as a compassionate Khmer Rouge leader is usually overlooked, though Ngor is obviously the centerpiece of the entire film. Mike Oldfield's soundtrack is riveting and appropriately jarring, and it's a shame that Roland Joffe's subsequent films have failed to match the quality of The Killing Fields. The only criticism I can give is that a large part of the movie is in unsubtitled Khmer, and the viewer has to figure out what the actors are saying by context and body language. At any rate, I highly recommend that everyone see this at least once (though given the intensity of the movie, I can fully understand people who would not be able to sit through it again).",

Basically in 1973, American journalist Sydney Schanberg (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Sam Waterston) is a foreign correspondent for the New York Times, he has been sent to Cambodia to cover the civil war between the Cambodian national army and communists the Khmer Rouge, a result of the Vietnam War. Schanberg is joined by local representative Dith Pran (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe winning Haing S. Ngor) as his guide and interpreter, they also meet a number of times with photographer Al Rockoff (John Malkovich), who gives them updates on the latest situations. Over the subsequent years Schanberg and Pran, with Pran's family, become friends, the bond between two men largely due to watching out for each other during potentially deadly situations. Schanberg is able to secure evacuation from the country for Pran's family, when western powers believe an escalation in the war will bring imminent indiscriminate bloodshed. The Khmer Rouge ultimately take over the country in 1975, Schanberg and other members of the western media make it out of the country in April, Schanberg returns to New York, but attempts to evacuate Pran failed, his life is in danger, every western-friendly Cambodian journalist captured has been killed. Schanberg leaves the U.S. begins what becomes a four and a half year campaign to get Pran out of the country, with no knowledge of the atrocities he may have suffered from the Khmer Rouge and/or their North Vietnamese allies, and no knowledge if Pran is still alive. This campaign for Schanberg ends up being a mission out of guilt, he feels largely responsible for Pran's predicament, he receives acclaim during his reporting of the conflict, in the end Schanberg calls Pran's family with the news that he is alive and safe, Schanberg and Pran reunite at the he Red Cross camp, they embrace with a hug.

Nelson as Military Attach\u00e9, Spalding Gray as U.S. Consul, Bill Paterson as Dr. MacEntire, Athol Fugard as Dr. Sundesval, Graham Kennedy as Dougal, Katherine Krapum Chey as Ser Moeum (Pran's Wife), Oliver Pierpaoli as Titony (Pran's Son) and Lambool Dtangpaibool as Phat's Son. Waterston gives a good performance as the journalist filled with both shame and ambition, Malkovich does well in his many moments, but the best performance is indeed newcomer and deserved award winner Ngor, at the time he was a gynaecologist and obstetrician, he is a fantastic embodiment of all emotions of the time, sadly Ngor was murdered in 1996. I didn't know anything about the Khmer Rouge regime in Cambodia myself before this film, I read it was a genocide initiated by Pol Pot, it was also known as Year Zero, the film shows both the humanity and the agony of the time, based on the experiences of the real-life characters, the most gripping moments are obviously those filled with conflict and suffering, all in all I found it an interesting biographical war drama. It won the Oscars for Best Cinematography and Best Film Editing, and it was nominated for Best Picture and Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium, it won the BAFTAs for Best Film, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Cinematography, Best Editing, Most Outstanding Newcomer to Film for Haing S. Ngor, Best Production Design/Art Direction and Best Sound, and it was nominated for Best Make Up Artist, Best Score for Mike Oldfield and Best Special Visual Effects, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama, Best Screenplay and Best Original Score. Good!",

            "content": "The Killing Fields is a very powerful and moving story. Based on the true civil war in Cambodia, this mass genocide is depicted quite well through the interesting viewpoint of a couple of journalists. Some of the things that touched me as interesting in this movie is the way in which many views and atrocities were carried out to see how ridiculous and horrible this whole era was. One of the very interesting points carried out in this movie especially in the first few scenes and in the end of the movie is that of how ridiculous it was of the USA to bomb this area, and exactly what a horrible impact it had on the land. Over and over it is said again that these bombings allowed for this kind of chaos to erupt in Cambodia. In fact, in Sydney's speech, he says that all of these atrocities were brought on by the multi-million dollar bombings of Cambodia. In carrying with this sort of protest against the mass bombings, the movie also did a wonderful job of depicting the violence and gore. Not to say that violence and gore makes a movie good, but in this case, it gets the message across quite well. From the blown off legs, to the dead bodies, to the fields of skeletons, the disgusting atrocities are represented well. Not only the gore, but also just the pure problems of the region are also well represented. The movie touches on the atrocities of landmines, to the evacuation of Phnom Pen, to the murderous methods of the Khmer Rouge, to the people they hate and reasons why the Khmer Rouge hate the upper class.In conclusion, this movie, The Killing Fields, is a very good depiction of the atrocities in Cambodia during their civil war. In essence this movie was an outline for the major events in a few years time span. It covered everything so well from the US military action, to the evacuations, to landmines, to the actual killing fields and the genocide related to that. In studying The actual Killing Fields, this movie is quite good.",

            "content": "Interesting true story of friendship and survival, set against the backdrop of one of history's most oppressive regimes.Set against the Khmer Rouge regime in Cambodia in the 1970s, the true story of New York Times journalist Sydney Schanberg (played by Sam Waterston) and his Cambodian interpreter Dith Pran (Haing S Ngor). They are there in 1973 when Cambodia is a side-theatre of the Vietnam conflict. At this time the Khmer Rouge are on the rise but not a major threat. Then we jump forward to 1975 and the Khmer Rouge have the upper hand and are about to take control of the country. The US, and other countries, are evacuating personnel. Though both of them have an opportunity to leave too, Schanberg and Dith Pran decide to stay to cover what happens next. This will ultimately put Dith Pran's life in grave danger as the Khmer Rouge's reign over Cambodia was one of oppression and genocide.Interesting, though a bit dry. The movie starts very slowly and takes a very long time to find a second gear. Even when things do start to fall into place and you get to understand where the story is going, things still don't really move at more than a moderate pace. However, the last 40 minutes or so more than make up for this. We see the extent of the Khmer Rouge's oppression and atrocities, and the movie becomes a powerful, tense story of resourcefulness and survival. Great, emotional ending.Solid work by Sam Waterston as Sydney Schanberg. Haing S Ngor, a Cambodian doctor and refugee with no previous acting experience, gives a great performance as Dith Pran and well deserved his Best Supporting Actor Oscar. The cast also includes John Malkovich (in only his second feature film), Julian Sands (third feature film) and Craig T Nelson, all of which give fine performances.",

Although the human drama told within this story was great, and therefore I still gave this movie a good rating. (8) I did not give it higher, because I felt the movie didn't provide enough background information about the country's plight to us uneducated. You could argue that it's not exactly what the movie was trying to do, but I felt it would have improved my enjoyment of the film. Also the movie often switches between three languages. Although I speak English and French, I do not understand Khmer(?). This often left me guessing what was going on, and a little confused. This could have easily been averted by using subtitles.Anyway, an excellent story, told very well, my complaints are minor.",

The movie begins with an American reporter for the New York Times, Sydney Schanberg who is covering the war in Cambodia. Sydney travels with his Cambodian interpreter and friend, Dith Pran to uncover information about the war. As the war continues to advance, Pran's family evacuates the country but Pran decides to stay and help his friend Sydney with the report. Soon after the communist party takes over Cambodia, Sydney and Pran flee to the embassy in attempt to evacuate. Because Pran is Cambodian, he is unable to return to America, and Schanberg is forced to leave him behind. Years later, Schanberg receives an award for his reports, but he is unable to be satisfied knowing that Pran is still missing. By the end of the film, Schanberg hears news that Pran is alive, and he travels to Thailand to meet his long lost friend. The last scene, along with many other turning points in the film, had me drowning in tears. The thought of losing a friend in such a manner provoked terrible feelings of sorrow and despair. The film captivates the audience with its moving story of the Cambodian war. Pran's journey through the \"Killing Fields\" of Cambodia had me on my toes throughout the film. It's an excellent movie because it embodies the audience with intense scenes of adventure and tragedy. Although the ending is tear-jerking and eye-opening, it is also reassuring to see these two great friends meet after everything they went through.",

The film is a very gruesome, yet real portrayal of the events that took place in Cambodia in the early 1970's, ending with the re-encounter of photojournalist Dith Pran and Sydney Schanberg.The film tells the true story of American journalist Sydney Schanberg, who was The New York Times' correspondent in Vietnam, and later in Cambodia.

            "content": "Director Roland Joffe artfully depicts this horrific tragedy in his 1984 classic \"The Killing Fields.\" The movie brilliant displays the chaos, confusion, and utter desperation to flee Cambodia as the Khmer Rouge unmercifully seize control. The movie covers all aspects and perceptions of the killings from the Cambodian victims, to the unmerciful killers (Khmer Rouge), and even to American involvement and interest through the journalist and photographers. It is filled with enough historical insight and knowledge to fill an Encyclopedia. The Killing Fields follows the end of the Vietnam War as America begins unwarned bombing and involvement in Cambodia to prevent North Vietnamese invasion. The director does a splendid job showing emotion and friendship in an otherwise dreadful and ruthless situation. It follows the lives of Sydney Schanberg ,a New York Times journalist covering the horrific killings and bombings and Dith Pran, is Cambodian translater and friend who aids him in his quest for understanding. Sydney Schanberg becomes aware of U.S. involvement and interest only after they begin bombing. He is played by Sam Waterson who gives a brilliant and emotional performance. Dith Pran and Sydney grow very close over the four years to the similarity of brothers. DIth Pran is played by Dr. Haing S. Ngor and is the perfect actor for a role with such depth, emotion, and hardship. Ngor Rules. \"The Killing Fields\" isn't just a knowledgeable and important movie from a historical standpoint but it also displays such deep characteristics as emotion, friendship, and perseverance. John Malkovich portrays an American photographer following the story in Cambodia and is sure to \"rock\" your socks \"off\" as Al Rockoff. OVerall its a brilliant and informative movie, which really gives you a sense of the brutality and disregard for human life that the Khmer Rouge had.",

One would think they'd be content to have conditions in our country - as did Bill Clinton - to be as peaceful and prosperous as possible, FOR our own country. This perhaps may sound like protectionism - so be it. Had \"W\" minded his own business, we wouldn't be faced with the decades of terrorism we are in for......just as Richard Nixon tried to hide his intervention in backing King Sihanouk in Cambodia.....think of Marlon Brando's role in \"Apocalypse Now\"......those were Cambodians, folk......before Pol Pot began his genocide. Sihanouk's family is still heavily involved in Cambodia, although they are corrupt and ill-suited to lead. During the 50s and 60s, Sihanouk ruled a peaceful-looking country, but the \"pots\" were boiling, toward \"the Killing Fields\". Although Pol Pot was \"convicted\", he was never imprisoned; he died a natural death in the jungle.......So little of the USA's involvement in Cambodia is shown in the beginning of the film - a couple of jet-bombers and a few bombs dropped - journalist Schanberg's comment \"$200-billion\" meant nothing. Americans were exhausted from the fiasco - and so many deaths - in Vietnam, not much is known about the 1.5 millions-of-deaths in Cambodia. They just didn't want to hear it, although TV newscasts presented stories about refuge' camps. Nixon's sneaky intervention - he is shown in the film in a news-report swearing that USA planes would NOT bomb Cambodia, as they did as he spoke - was one of the ingredients that caused him to resign his office, when the Watergate scandal erupted......good riddance.To demonstrate how ignorant Americans are about Cambodia, many think it was the Vietnam War !! Wake-up \"FeinMess\", \"RBarse\" and \"OriginalmovieBuff21\"......Many commentaries mention the cinematography is so realistic, the viewer is pulled into the story. Sam Waterson played a magnificent role. Rightly so, everyone was astounded by Haing S. Ngor's natural brilliance in his role. I would rather think he was just calling-up ugly memories from his \"re-education\" and potent fear from his past life. Imagine having lost your own family in your native country's genocide and taking-on the protection of one of the \"re-educator's\" children. You can see the grief on his face as he burns the child's clothing - we are left to imagine how he disposed of the child's body. I'd rather not....I also agree this epic film should be shown to every student in every high-school, history-class - but, how many are there left ? If you're interested in that era of our history, it is all on the 'net. It reminds me of the conflict in Iraq. Will we never learn?....make certain every citizen of Iraq sees this film. Yet, it may only be a situation they know very well.Because there WERE Oscars awarded, few of the commentators realize \"The Killing Fields\" is a British release. That's unimportant, in the overall view of the film - the message of this shocking movie is there should be no more of these atrocities - can't we just get along ? Watch this film, it will depressively inspire you to work for freedom.....worldwide.....",

            "content": "After all I'd heard about this film, I was pretty disappointed on several counts.The film makes it pretty clear that Dith Pran stayed in Cambodia mainly for the sake of Schanberg. At first the claim is that because Pran's a journalist he feels a moral obligation to stay behind, implying that he intends to cover the Khmer Rouge's takeover, but later says that he'd \"do anything\" for his Western colleague. So his intentions are not made clear, and this is a pretty important part of the movie. I could be mistaken, but there seems to be an almost sexual tension between the two main characters. The way the director deftly avoids this issue by allowing Pran's intentions to contradict each other from act to act leaves an unforgivable hole in the plot. And either way, it's not hard to take issue with the outcome: on one hand Killing Fields becomes an unsettling and sadistic paean to self-destructive altruism a la Breaking the Waves, and on the other it's a story of love across cultures, with Schanberg seeming like a domineering and selfish lover.Nonetheless, Pran is well portrayed as a man who genuinely cares about life. He is forced to steal to keep himself alive, but later selflessly risks his own life to save that of a child. Pran negotiates the release of several journalists, even though in doing so he loses a little pride by almost kowtowing to the captors. Perhaps the variances and apparent contradictions in his character are merely true-to-life portrayals of the extremes to which the vicissitudes of history propel us.",

I had overheard an old woman saying \"Fancy letting a kid like that into a film like this\". All I can say, is I'm glad I was, as this film opened my eyes to the realities and horror of war. Although more a political film, than a war movie, The Killing Fields has some stark and confronting images, one I never got out of my head, was that blood being swept off the top of that staircase like rubbish. The Killing Fields is a biographical account of two tight journalists, one who's really experienced war, up close, a first hand witness to the atrocities of the Khmer Rouge. Unfortunately this journo, Dith Pran ( wonderfully played by the \"much left us too soon actor\" Haing S 'Ngor who really puts real life into the role- Oscar naturel) becomes a hostage, but manages to escape, another haunting scene has him wading quietly through a canal of skulls. It really becomes a vital want for audience through gruelling suspense to see this guy get back with his journalist mate. We really fear for him. The film has a surprise cast, none more than Graham Kennedy, while Waterston still, I believe, did his best work here in the lead as Pran's hot shot journo mate, while unearthed here too, was the great John Malcovich, and obscure star, then, Julian Sands, completing the chain of journo's. But what I love about the film, is it's more real, than movie, It really follows through on the facts, and what unfolds is a film of excellence by any measure. See this film if just once, please.",

Things turn ugly and the entire population of Phnom Penh is deported to the countryside.  Schanberg arranges for the evacuation of Pran's family, but the two of them want to stay as reporters.  But, sadly, Pran is taken from the embassy too, and Sydney is forced to leave Cambodia.  Pran is lead to work in the death camps of the Khmer Rouge.  The story continues on from there, but I don't want to give away the ending.  This a beautiful and tragic film and I will remember it for years.",

It's also very suspenseful and touching at how the expatriates try so hard, and remorse harder when they failed, to fake documents for Pran. Later the movie nicely changes too insert touching remarks as Sydney can't let go of his guilt for leaving Pran behind. I like how the movie tried to depict as similar as possible the environment of the location and time frame. GThe props and location settings are chosen well to give a good portrayal of the crisis era. The acting in overall feels nice. James Waterston handled his character's stubbornness well enough that it permeates into the whole movie. Haing S Ngor is the real jewel as the seemingly calm character he played as Pran can somehow emanate the aura of worry and his family and at the same time caring for his partner Sydney.",

            "content": "\"The Killing Fields\" is an excellent movie portraying the atrocities of the Cambodian civil war/ bombing through gore and personal stories. The films excellent cinematography thoroughly succeeds in capturing the tragedy and horrors of Cambodia as the communist Khmer Rouge terrorizes the country. The movie depicts the \"civil war\" between the Khmer Rouge and the U.S.-backed regime of Lon Nol. In the beginning of the movie, viewers see the involvement of the United States, who strives to fight against the Khmer Rouge in order to not let Cambodia become the net domino in the Communist take over in Southeast Asia. The disorder and chaos of the period is shown through the personal stories of Sydney Schanberg, a New York Times journalist reporting the horrific killings and bombings and Dith Pran, a Cambodian translator and journalist who helps Sydney gain information. Both characters were greatly played to the actors' best abilities, and both actors did an excellent job relating the characters' emotions to the audience. The movie does an excellent job showing the lives of the people affected by the war. The movie also played off the true realities of the war, such as the fields of bones and skeletons and the ruthless killings caused by the Khmer Rouge. Like many Vietnam War related movies, the Killing Fields hits hard on American hearts. We see that the American's ridiculous bombings in Cambodia, and the many civilian and innocent lives that were taken and affected. When America pulled out, we left and abandoned Cambodia to its horrible fate. Viewers see in Sydney's speech after winning the award the negative public reactions towards the war. Sydney mentioned that Killing Fields in Cambodia were all due to America, and the \"multi-million\" dollar bombings on the poor country. As a student, I had never learned about the horrors in Cambodia till this year. This may be because of the negative perceptions it casts on America and its government and involvement in the war. However, the movie was extremely educational and real, and greatly showed the true events of the Killing Fields.",

To risk getting shot and blown up every day... just for a few paragraphs in your local paper... nope, not worth it.

But the three USA journos have made friends with the native guy, and they want to take him along. But after a failed attempt at giving him a phony passport, they're forced to leave him behind in the hands of a new fanatical regime. This sets up the best part of the film, as the newsmen try to track him down from the States while he suffers at the hands of his sadistic captors...Based on a true story, it is impeccably acted and holds the attention till the end, as danger lurks round every corner and people take extraordinary risks to help those they care about. It just goes to show that even in this hell on earth, lifelong friendships can be formed and whatever happens, NEVER give up hope.

Those 45 years passed could be as nothing for an older person who was there, but they are an enormous expanse for a younger person of this new generation, which is why art and stories like \"The Killing Fields\" can be so important to pass on history to new generations, so that they can grasp it and hopefully not repeat the same mistakes and cycles.It is no doubt a tough watch though, with heartbreaking content, however at least the viewer is given a little bit of a happy ending with the two main characters being reunited to the great John Lennon song \"Imagine\"; a memorable scene. But the film as a whole can be a slow plod and the Times reporter main character is a little bit unlikeable. Also the action and plot is so localized and narrowly focused on a few persons that the viewer does not learn a great deal about the broader aspects of what was occurring in Cambodia. The Khmer Rouge leader Pol Pot's name is not even mentioned.All in all, it's a tough film to rate. An important work, though somewhat upsetting which may not appeal to everyone.

One example of this, as others have mentioned here, is the song, \"Imagine\" by (a hypocritical) John Lennon.  While most would agree the basic premise of this song (peace/ending war) is very touching and would be appropriate, Lennon's tirade about having no possessions, no religion, etc. ends up sounding an awful like a Pol-Pot theme song.One note on the scene in which the Pran's picture fades...

            "content": "Whilst the war in Vietnam has produced dozens of Hollywood movies about that conflict, THE KILLING FIELDS remains the only film about the side show conflict in Cambodia and its consequences. Perhaps more unusually - and what few American viewers of this film realise - is that THE KILLING FIELDS is an entirely British production: written, produced and directed by English filmmakers with an entirely British production team on location in Thailand and funded largely in the UK and not Hollywood. The film, released 22 years ago now, won 3 Oscars and eight British Academy Awards (including Best Picture).For that reason THE KILLING FIELDS - at least visually - rarely resembles a Hollywood studio product. Chris Menges' cinematography shoots in drab colour and uses what appears to be natural light. Roland Joffe's direction is documentary-like, always realistic and never over blown; and Bruce Robinson's screenplay avoids sentimentality and clich\u00e9.The film takes place in Cambodia between 1973 and 1979 and focuses on the American journalist Syndey Schanberg (Sam Waterston) and his interpreter Dith Pran (Dr Haing S. Nor, a real life survivor of the atrocities depicted in the film). The initially scenes are slow - Schanberg and Pran finding a Cambodian village accidentally bombed by the USAAF. The centre of the film is the fall of Cambodia and Schanberg, Pran and the other Western Journalists' decision to stay behind. Pran saves their lives when they are captured by the Khmer Rouge and they subsequently hide in the French Embassy. Pran - as a Cambodian - must be handed over to the Khmer Rouge.The final third of the film accounts the Cambodian holocaust, which is pure 1984, full of purges of the past and whole hearted obedience to the Party. Pran survives a rural labour camp and flees to Thailand, eventually being reunited with Schanberg in 1979.The best sequence involves the attempts to get a photo of Pran so he can use it in a British passport and not be handed over to the Khmer Rouge (the ruse fails). The film never uses subtitles, so when long sequences are in Cambodian (such as when Pran negotiates the lives of the journalists) we are simply confused and don't know what is going on. Also, Robinson's screenplay never really develops any of the supporting characters - and Schanberg himself, despite a sincere performance from Waterston, is something of a one note grim character. The film is often slow and uninvolving when it should be tense and dramatic, and Mike Oldfield's score is simply awful.So the KILLING FIELDS is a mixed experience. But despite these flaws, it remains a superior and important movie, well-made technically, but flawed dramatically.",

            "review_title": "A gripping and saddening film, despite its numerousflaws",
            "content": "This film has many strengths. And a few weaknesses. Its powerful true story is one of the most haunting of the twentieth century, the systematic torture and genocide of 2 million people from the Cambodian population of 7 million during 1975-79 by a radical communist regime, the Khmer Rouge (\"Red Cambodia\"). The film depicts, with near perfect accuracy, the psychopathic guerillas who menacingly enslave and eradicate their countrymen while slapping and screaming. The graphic display of bloody bodies which litter the streets and fields, while very upsetting, adds to the authentic depiction of the Cambodian Massacre. A viewer is so powerfully convinced by this elegant presentation that he can actually picture himself there, in the heat of terror. No wonder The Killing Fields won an Oscar for best cinematography! As for the actors, I am among the minority of viewers who was not impressed by the main players. Sam Waterson portrayed the brash Sydney Schanberg with an annoyingly pompous attitude. John Malkovitch, though critically acclaimed for his role as Al Rockoff, didnt really add more than a few minutes of amusement. Julian Sands, who is a fine actor and probably the best of the Caucasian actors in this film, was too despondent to give a really inspiring performance, but that was the tone of the film, so he really isn't to blame. Haing Ngor, a real life Cambodian survivor, deserved his best supporting actor oscar for such a focused portrayal of Dith Pran, but even he came across as bland at times. Some of the Southeast Asian actors, while unknown to the western world (and probably the eastern world too) were so authentic and powerful that one wonders if they were really Khmer soldiers and peasants in real life. The scene where Phat, an educated landowner turned Khmer Rouge revolutionary, explains to Dith Pran how he sacrificed everything for the Khmer Rouge, only to be distrusted by them to the point where his life is in danger, was one of the most brilliant in the film. Another amazing scene was during the first hour of the film, when the American Embassy in Phnom Penh is evacuated by US Marine helicopters to Mike Oldfield's very bizzare (though appropriate) musical theme.I object to the left wing political views of this film. Repeated references were made to the US bombings of Cambodia and Vietnam, and President Nixon is even shown giving an address on the \"Nixon doctrine,\" as if the US was to blame for the Cambodian Massacre. It was not. America made some serious policy errors when intervening in the Vietnam and Cambodian wars, but they had nothing to do with the radical communist principles which have killed over 100 million in Europe and Asia during the past 80 years. And even more insulting, Pol Pot, the Khmer Rouge chief who led the slaughter of his own people is never even mentioned in this film. Sydney Schanberg, when asked in the film by reporters if he and other journalists were to blame for underestimating the brutality of the Khmer Rouge, answers \"maybe what we underestimated was the paranoia that 7 billion dollars worth of bombs could cause\" another shift in blame from Pol Pot and his murderous communist regime. And finally, the last major flaw in this film was the cheesy ending, where Sydney and Pran are reunited to John Lennon's song \"Imagine.\" Many critics have denounced that as a significant mistake by Roland Joffe. However, I did enjoy this film and hope that viewers who havent seen it yet but read this take heed, and try to see the facts through the mild distortions.",

In The Killing Fields, Cambodia is the canvas, while politics, journalism, friendship, and the human will are the paints used to depict an in-your- face, true story of survival against all odds. The US government takes its lumps as we abuse, then abandon a people who are then embroiled in a bloody internal cleansing that kills several million Cambodians. The journalists Sydney Schanberg (Sam Waterston) and local Dith Pran (Dr Ngor) capture and transmit the daily atrocities back to the states for US consumption. Dr Ngor was an actual survivor of the real Killing Fields. How he had he courage to portray Dith Pran, I don't know, but it speaks to the courage he had, and apparently to promises he made to his wife to educate the world about what happened in Cambodia. That Dr Ngor won an Academy Award is astonishing, but after you watch this movie, you really feel like you lived through this horrific event because of Ngor's tremendous performance.Sam Waterston also turned in a strong performance as Shanberg. He realizes he took advantage of Pran as a means to his own ends, but by then, it's too late. Waterston was at his best when he stands toe to toe with Army reps, like Craig T. Nelson (from Coach), or the politicians. But near the end, when he has to take criticism from his own colleague who was with him (terrific performance by John Malkovich by the way), Waterston has no valid reply, and he knows it.The war scenes are incredibly real, the suffering in the killing fields is palpable, and the hopelessness of those trying to stem the entire unimaginable craze of hatred overtaking the Khmer Rouge is smothering.Some scenes are a bit long, and the ending would have been better without that particular song,which introduced a bit too much of a Hollywood ending at just the wrong time. Still, this is a must-see film that will stay with you long after the credits roll. Enjoy.",

He browbeats a man with a family in a vulnerable position into entering into a life-threatening and altering situation for his own gain and never apologizes for it until the last second of the film, when the reaction to the apology is less than believable, despite the fantastic performance of the actor who accepts the apology.The other actors are good, but Waterson comes across as weak, perhaps because of his over the top performance during virtually every scene, perhaps because of poor writing (curiously, only for his part), but when the \"lead\" of the film is weak, it's hard to build something decent around it.At one point in the movie Waterson's character says that half of his award belongs to his friend who is presumably dead. It makes you want to turn off the TV and be sick, because anyone with a conscience following the movie realizes that all of the award should go to his friend. One character in the movie calls him on it briefly and he tries to (angrily, as always) deflect the argument by ignoring his actions back in Cambodia that led to his friend being captured, and focuses on what he's doing now to find his friend, which won't do much good anyway. Apart from getting the man's family out (which we can speculate with a considerable amount of ease, was done only to secure his colleague's trust, to get him to stay for an almost certain doom), the journalist does very little indeed for his friend, apart from barking at him when things don't go his way. The film is as much a study in the art of avarice and cowardice on the part of Waterson's character as it is the courage of the Cambodian journalist.(It should be noted, that in my opinion Waterson's performance on Law and Order is top notch, and it makes you wish that he had that kind of patience and talent on call 20 odd years ago when he did this project.)",

Compared to 'Schindler's List' and 'The Pianist',  both of which seem to be somewhat less than the sum of their parts,in contrast 'The Killing Fields' distinguishes itself by being more than the sum of its parts and is indeed one of the great achievements in cinema. As someone here said, \"Sam Waterston is at his self-righteous best...\", that is so true. But, Haing Ngor is a revelation! His performance is one of the great acting performances ever. I know that is a mouthful and sounds preposterous but it is absolutely true. This film reaches out and grabs you by the throat and engages you emotionally without bludgeoning like 'Schindler's List'.There is not an extra minute or unnecessary scene in the entire movie, as there is in 'The Pianist'. The supporting roles are given the time and space to make their impact and the acting is top notch. The photography is unbelievably real and beautiful as well as sensitive and nuanced. The direction is as tight as in a great thriller but respectful and beautifully paced. A Triumph. It disturbs me to note that this film is number 240 something out of the top 250 and 'The Pianist' number 29! That is shocking and not at all indicative of the relative merits of the two films. This says to me that many of the people who watch films and vote on this website are sorely lacking in a real knowledge of film history and indeed of history itself. Thus they are taken in by Hollywood's 'PC' attitudes these days and are unable to make distinctions between mediocre and great or or even between fact and fancy. Is this because of the youthful age of many of these people? My guess is yes. Many of the so-called generation 'X-ers' and their successors have been treated to a dizzying menu of mediocre films from Hollywood for the last 15 years or so. They missed the great films of Hollywood's apotheosis, they missed the New wave and also the great films of the '70's and lastly they missed the stunning films that came out in the early and mid '80's. I can only say that every film lover should go back into the vaults and look again or for the first time at some of these great films and then come back and look once more at 'The Killing Fields' and 'The Pianist' and then put them in their proper place. I give the this film a 10/10 and put it in my own top 20, if not top 10 of all time. That's where it belongs here at IMDB.",

My other criticism is that it lacks unity, somewhat like Full Metal Jacket but even more so.  It touched on many important and interesting topics (the friendship and quest for Pran, the \"year zero\" program, the hypocrisy of war, the hardships of journalism, etc. , the list is long) but  ended up skimming the surface of each. As a result, this movie is under-developed. It could have been made into more than one movie; Pran's experience in the labor camp, for example, could / should have been made into a movie of its own.On the other hand, \"The Killing Fields\" should be given credit for coming before all the great war movies we all refer to now (Platoon, Full Metal Jacket...) and most likely influencing them.  It should also be given credit because so few movies actually refer to Cambodia.  Everyone is so interested in Vietnam and WWII that Cambodia is very often left behind. The acting was great (although I'm not sure about the Oscar... opposite John Malkovich? No-one should win opposite John Malkovich!) but the music got on my nerves for the most part.Overall, the fact that the movie was so chopped up and that it went everywhere (and that it was long) didn't really do it for me. I just waited for it to end, but I suppose I'm glad I watched it.",

So different to the rubbish Hollywood films that pollute our screens nowadays and try and squeeze everything into their separate genres which bore the hell out of me. I was amazed when seeing the credits I had actually visited the location of the filming in Hua Hin and Phuket, Thailand without even knowing it. I think this movie makes me a lot more sad than films such as 'Schindler's List' because this was just before my life time and this is 'auto genocide' the killing of your own people and south-east Asian people are so nice and welcoming usually. I believe every movie lover should watch this film, which has modern connotations due to the harsh, unnecessary involvement of U.S. forces in global conflict leaving a power vacuum to be exploited on the people as in modern day Iraq. I will visit Cambodia next year with this movie in the back of my mind wanting to a find a beautiful people unfortunately still suffering today.",

Great script, great cinematography, emotionally powerful, great acting, etc.And yet...I just can not enjoy it as much as I should because of the anti-American premise that is the centerpiece of the story.  The filmmakers essentially blame the Cambodia genocide on America!  As if America was directing Pol Pot in his massacre of two million of his people!  I can not BELIEVE this film totally neglected to explain who the Khmer Rouge were, why they did what they did, and what they were trying to accomplish.  Of course, the American involvement in Vietnam and Cambodia is expounded upon and criticized in great detail, but they don't even mention Pol Pot, not once!  That tells you all you need to know right there; the film is more interested in giving America yet another black eye than telling the story of the Cambodian people.  What should have been a vivid illustration and condemnation of the communist butchers America was FIGHTING AGAINST in southeast Asia (which is what I thought it was when I rented it), instead falls back on the tired liberal line of \"blame America first\".There is a REASON \"Schindler's List\" will always be remembered before this movie.  That movie had nothing to do with the politics and confusion of war and international policy; all it wanted to do was tell a story about the perseverance of people during the lowest period of human history.  Sadly, I can not say the same for \"Killing Fields\".",

            "content": "'The Killing Fields', is Roland Joff\u00e9's ground-breaking, British-made drama about the Kymer Rouge's brutal, 5-year regime in Cambodia. This Academy award-winning film, made in 1984, tells the true story of an American newspaper journalist, (Sydney Schanberg) and his Cambodian Assistant, (Pran) before, during and after the takeover by Pol Pot and his murderous Khmer Rouge regime.The film is beautifully directed, shot and acted and it accurately portrays a truly harrowing and heart-breaking period in Cambodia's recent history. The Killing Fields should be compulsory viewing for anyone who lives in this region, particularly in Thailand, Cambodia or Vietnam. This genocide only took place some 37 years ago, yet for most people under thirty, they have little or no knowledge of what took place, right on their doorstep. Here in Thailand, there seems to be universal ignorance of tragic events that happened so close to their common border. Estimates of the total number of deaths resulting from Khmer Rouge policies during the period they controlled the country (1975-1979), including from disease and starvation, range from 1.7 to 2.5 million out of a population of around 8 million, or give or take, 25% of the population. One American reviewer recently described this film as 'The Ultimate Ugly American Movie' and goes on to say: '\u0085.that amazing film about the human price of American involvement in Southeast Asia\u0085.' The film includes some 'telling references' about America's dubious role in the terrible events that overtook Cambodia, such as: \"After what the Khmer Rouge have been through, I don't think they'll be exactly affectionate toward Westerners\u0085.\" (spoken by a US embassy official) and: \"Maybe we underestimated the anger that $7 billion in bombing would unleash.\" (Sydney Schanberg.) During the U.S. war in Vietnam, Cambodia was embroiled in a bloody civil war between the communist Khmer Rouge, backed by China and North Vietnam, and Cambodian government forces backed by the U.S. From 1969-73, the U.S. military covertly carpet-bombed eastern Cambodia in an attempt to disrupt North Vietnamese operations and defend the government against the Khmer Rouge, causing the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Cambodian citizens. For a country which at the time had a population of about 6 million, the losses were enormously devastating. Amongst the Cambodian populace, resentment grew against the U.S. and what was perceived as the American \"puppet government\" in Phnom Penh. The Khmer Rouge represented resistance to the U.S. and consequently, as bombs continued to fall, Cambodian citizens flocked to join them.Sydney Schanberg, who was a New York Times reporter and renowned for his experience in Cambodia at the time, said the Khmer Rouge \"\u0085 would point\u0085 at the bombs falling from B-52s as something they had to oppose if they were going to have freedom. And it became a recruiting tool until they grew to a fierce, indefatigable guerrilla army.\" Eventually, the Khmer Rouge were able to overwhelm the government forces and establish control over Cambodia, leading to Pol Pot's \"agrarian revolution\", the killing fields, the torture centres and the loss of some 2 million Cambodian lives.In his memoirs, former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger has denied that the U.S. is at all responsible for the rise of the Khmer Rouge. But bitterly recounted descriptions of the bombings by survivors of the Khmer Rouge terror demonstrate that there is little to separate the U.S. bombings and Khmer Rouge brutality in the minds of Cambodian survivors. Who better to determine accountability than those who most directly suffered? It is impossible to say for certain, but such personal accounts are a powerful condemnation of the bombings and evidence that the U.S. government at the time was significantly responsible for what occurred thereafter.It is impossible to know for sure whether the bombing of Cambodia from 1969-73 led directly or indirectly, to massive suffering and the deaths of a full one-third of Cambodia's population at the time. But worse is the dysfunction caused by that tragedy which continues to profoundly affect Cambodian society to this day. I have been to Cambodia several times in recent years, and it was a very rare occurrence when I met anyone over 40 years of age.If you missed the Killing Fields when it was first released, or you were too young - or yet to be born - go search it out and watch a piece of truly horrifying history within living memory.",

We can only compare the experiences of the Cambodian nation and people with all the subsequent horror stories--whether in Rwanda or Bosnia or Iraq. The film has, at its core, an amazing story to tell. But notice how so many of the scenes are filled with images of all of the innocents caught up in the unfolding horror story. There are so many close-ups of the \"extras\"--their faces filled with sorrow, or disbelief--or blankly staring out like masks of good and evil. The final closeup photos of young and old-- innocents caught up in the awesome and incomprehensible history of a tortured land are absolutely haunting. You sit through the movie and keep asking yourself--why, why, why does such cruelty exist on this earth. I recently visited Cambodia, and the breath-taking beauty of its culture and cultural history, the warmth and friendliness of its people makes the events of the late 20th century almost impossible to believe. And yet the events occurred. The film is emotionally overwhelming--and what gets the viewer through the harrowing scenes are those scenes of basic human decency. As there are endless scenes of violence in the film, there are equally as many scenes of human kindness and compassion--scenes of the love of family members, of the dedication of the doctors helping those who are almost beyond help, of the desperate concern of all of Dith Pran's colleagues vainly trying to help him and of the heartfelt friendship of Dith Pran and Sydney Schanberg. Maybe basic human decency and those emotions of love and compassion is what is helping Cambodia recover, and will help all of the desperate people in this world caught up in war and conflict to eventually recover. Let's Hope!",

The Cambodian situation was dreadful and certainly not a part of history anyone can be proud about.

Due to the close proximity to Vietnam, and the United States wearisome involvement in the on-going communist and democratic conflicts in South East Asia, American foreign policy and public interest paid portentous attentiveness to the affairs of Cambodia.The film is introduced at the time of America's covert aerial bombardment of Eastern Cambodian military targets following the communist guerrillas refusal to adhere to the 1973 Paris Peace Treaty. Zealous journalist Schanberg is eager to and hindered from reporting to the American public the trepidation caused by the American bombing. Succeeding this introduction, the film moves intensely to the 1975 evacuation of foreign nationals from Phnom Penh during the seizing of power by the totalitarian communists Kampuchea before focusing on the consequent killing fields caused through social transformation and the year-zero policy. The film's final act, following a left behind Pran's escape from a national forced labour camp, is the eventual reuniting of the two journalist friends. From one stand point, British director Ronald Joffe does not shy away from exposing the human atrocities caused by armed conflict. Yet, Joffe does not over-embellish the horrors that inhabitant's encounter in a war-torn Country. Particularly, The Killing Fields centrepiece is the acts of humanity both moral, relationship between close friends, and immoral, the killing of innocent civilians and possible to a lesser extent, the unintentional minor selfish betrayal of Schanberg towards Pran. Rather than taking a more dramatic conventional route, the films interesting aspect is to view from a pragmatic everyday journalistic media approach. Also, interestingly The Killing Fields is one of a handful of English language films to call attention the violence, economics and political ideologies of twentieth-century revolutions. The horrors of the Khmer Rouge and the story told in The killing Fields draws parallels with events in the 1930's collectivisation of Ukrainian agriculture, the Nazi Holocaust of World War II and Mao's Great Leap Forward in the 1950's, all of which resulted in systematic extermination.Unfortunately I was unable to view the film in anamorphic widescreen 1.78:1 format. Although not as detailed, viewing the film in standard format did not eradicate the intensity of the film. As well as a story of friendship, The Killing Fields is an exceptional example of a former colonial countries dilemma when faced with dissimilar political ideologies following independence. Furthermore, the indescribable torment citizens' encounter in a brutal civil war and the mass suffering during the course of inhumane social experiments and the forced undemocratic reorganising of a society.",

            "content": "The film provides a very partial, but astute overview of the situation in Cambodia in the 1970s, focussing in particular on the characters of two journalists - American Sydney Schanberg and Cambodian Dith Pran. The two play the part of witnesses to atrocities committed by the warring parties, mostly on innocent civilians - but their role in practice is much more central. Because this isn't a historical film, but rather a film about the enduring power of friendship.On that account, the film is a resounding success. Waterston and (especially) Ngor bring life to the drama between the characters, making their trials and tribulations painfully intimate. In fact, Joffe banks on this approach. He turns a film about a historical event into a series of vignettes populated by actors performing a very real-life tragedy. Because it's acted so \"authentically,\" the film works well enough to cover most of its faults.That soundtrack hasn't aged well, though.",

I was not only interested in the movie for it's war theme, but more importantly, for the theme of the incredible friendship between the two main characters. Such caring is rare and hard to find, and the beauty of the love between those two friends eclipsed all the horrors and struggles of the war depicted in the movie. The hauntingly beautiful soundtrack is also one of my favorite movie soundtracks of all time. The backdrop of the music really does a fantastic job of giving the movie the impact that it has. I consider this movie one the most unforgettable that I have ever seen, in terms of acting, storyline, historical significance, and overall emotional impact.",

            "content": "Now, first off ill confess that i require 2 senses to watch a movie (sight and sound). This movie's music was just horrible, it didn't exist in most parts where there should have at least been some type of chasm. The parts that actually did have music just sounded awful and ill-placed. For example when phran is walking along the lake and you see the massive amount of skeletons all over, there isn't any noticeable music playing for a little while. Then all of a sudden they start playing some scary music like he never actually saw the skeletons until after walking around for 5 minutes. There was another part where a helicopter was flying around and they played some horrific sound that didn't even seem like music at first, but apparently it was. The other issue about this movie is they did a terrible job of outlining the plot. They used a lot more filler then they needed to and it ultimately droned out the plot of the story. This movie could have easily been an hour or 1.5 hours long. One more thing about this movie is you never fully understood what was going on in the scenes. For example in the beginning of the movie when phran and sydney are captured? and sydney is all complaining about how he needs to go so he tries to leave then a guy puts a gun to his head and he goes back. Alright, that makes sense, so phran and sydney aren't going anywhere but wait... the next day?? Sydney just walks out and it is no big deal. Then near the end of the movie Phran starts crawling around in a pond like an alligator and none of the khmer rouge are supposed to see him apparently. So he \"escapes\" his prison camp and walks around for a while. but wait, almost the next scene later he's back in prison camp? and talking to the supposed leader of the prison camp? then a while later he leaves the prison camp again and he walks around in the same area so you think hey he's just out on a stroll. However he finally ends up in thailand after this stroll....If you have no idea about the background history of any movie you watch (me) then this is a terrible movie. If you're a cambodian history buff or even Vietnam war buff then you'd probably like this movie. overall i'd say this movie is a catastrophic failure but people seem to like it and i don't wanna ruffle anyone's feathers.",

The movie is very well made, from great acting from Waterson and Ngor (who won an Oscar deservedly) and great cinematography, I think this is one of those few \"Based on a True Story\" films that actually work.

            "content": "The Killing Fields is a remarkable film that shows the incredible cruelties of human beings in regard to their treatment of one another. The film begins in 1973 in Cambodia during the civil war in which the Cambodian national army is battling the communist Khmer Rouge party. The film centers around American reporter Sydney Schanberg (Sam Waterson) and his Cambodian guide and photojournalist Dith Pran (Haing Ngor) as they attempt to both cover the story of the conflict and survive in a treacherous war-torn land.Before watching the Killing Fields, I was completely unaware and uneducated about the horrors of the Cambodian civil war. I have seen my fair share of war films; this one truly left an imprint on me. Although the movie is not told from a soldier's perspective, it does not lack the gruesome images or hardened emotions that war films typically present. It possesses moments of suspense, sorrow, empathy, and great tragedy. Sam Waterson is entirely believable as the determined New York Times reporter Sydney Schanberg, but Haing Ngor is absolutely fantastic in his portrayal of Schanberg's Cambodian interpretor Dith Pran. The emotional torment that Ngor reflects as Pran, when he must choose between reporting the war with Schanberg and being with his family, is undeniably heartbreaking. The images of bloodied corpses, orphaned children roaming the streets, and the cultural upheaval that the country undergoes are presented realistically but in a cinematically breathtaking technique. The danger and suffering of the people due to the Khmer Rouge's purging of the urban and educated segment of society is presented so vividly that the viewer believes he or she is watching a true report straight from the newsroom.",

Possibly the best thing about the film is the ending, it manages to, with almost no words express the entire message of the film.The Killing Fields is an un miss able movie that manages to characterize people, not war, as most wars films do, in fact it characterizes people so well that it becomes apparent that people love war, but it doesn't have to be that way.",

How many times and ways can you blow up Coca Cola? I'm nearly convinced that they actually paid for product placement--the poison-beverage showed up so often in the movie as a metaphor for American materialism, decadence, soft imperialism, corruption, etc. Vending machines, bottle distribution facilities, restaurant signs...Coke is always being spilled--almost as much as blood. (For the most blatant placement of Coke products--nay, a two-hour commercial for the product--see, no, don't see!, \"Strictly Ballroom\"). Additionally, the Schanberg/Waterson character's self-righteousness and persistent blaming of US policy (\"Maybe we didn't realize that so-much tonnage of bombs and billions of dollars spent on it's military could unleash such insanity\" or some garbage like that).

            "content": "The Killing Fields is a 1984 Roland Joff\u00e9 film about the Khmer Rouge regime in Cambodia. It is unquestionably a touching film that does not glamorize the war effort. The Cambodian and American protagonists, Dith Pran and Sydney Schanberg, are journalists who bond over finding the site where an American B-52 set off bombs. By April of 1975, the international embassies in Cambodia are evacuated and Pran's family leaves the country without him. Unfortunately, the state of the country only gets more gruesome and the Khmer Rouge soon order that all Cambodian citizen must be turned over from their refuge with remaining foreigners. Schanberg returns to New York City and wins a journalism award for his report of Cambodia while Pran is sent to labor under the new regime. The perspective of The Killing Fields is unlike so many other films of its time because it paints a clear picture of the state of Cambodia under the Khmer Rouge. The grisly corpses and injured civilians are stomach churning, and they are especially outstanding considering the film was made in 1984. Haing S. Ngor's Oscar winning performance is as real as it gets. He survived the Cambodian civil war himself and his acting in the film is unrivaled.As Emerson student, watching The Killing Fields opened my eyes to the importance of communication. It is crucial to share the truth when we live in a world where every message from the media can be manipulated. Without the medium of journalism, the world would of been blind to the atrocities going on in Cambodia. Therefore this film can teach students that it is crucial to use mass media to share the truth.",

He also tries to convey the Khmer Rouge in a terrible way to get the point across of how awful they really treated everyone. The main characters give a great performance as they play the parts of reporters during the war. It is great to see this because not only did they provide a reporters view on things, but they came to self realization when they experienced the horrors of war themselves. The only flaw that I felt was in the movie is the idea of how people would look in the wrong direction and get killed, but Pran would runaway, get caught disobeying and would never get punished. Obviously it is a good thing but it is just a little unrealistic I thought. I definitely think you should see the movie and the great job everyone involved did to piece it together to let the audience feel the experience.",

The movie wasn't too gory it did a good job on showing details without exaggerating it. The United States was scared of people traveling along the Ho Chi Minh trail and that is why they decided to attack Cambodia. As US intelligence received reports of communist supply movements within Cambodian territory, the CIA began to recruit Vietnamese of ethnic Cambodian descent and to infiltrate the border and stop the flow of shipments. In the movie we saw how the Khmer Rouge really did torture the people from the middle class. The history part of this film is an incredible one that many more people should know about.

When the situation in Cambodia got too unstable to even live there, Dith sent his family to America where he planned on coming later. After a series of events of trying to escape the country with his American friends, Dith got rejected and all the Americans left back to their homeland. The Khmer Rouge, a movement of rebels, moved into Cambodia and destroyed the country completely. Dith was taken as a slave and almost died like many other innocent people did too. He finally escaped with a few other people, of whom none survived the long hike they had to take, so he arrived to a refugee camp alone, where he got saved. There they recognized his face because his old time friend, award winner, Sydney Schanberg had sent a picture of him to many organizations around the world because he wanted to locate him. Sydney and Dith both move back to America where they lived happy.According to the User Reviews on www.IMDb.com \"movie is so beautiful and touching (and so very graphic) that one cannot help but be affected by it.\" It is rated as 8.0 out of a total score of 10. Rated by David Gruder on November 2004, he definitely rates this movie as one of the best ones he has seen. He clearly explains \"I'm not a huge fan of action or fantasy or romance movies, I have so-called \"comedies\" but I love genuine FILM, as in FILM not MOVIE; art as opposed to enterprise.\" What he means by this statement is that this is not a movie to laugh at, or to enjoy, it's a true story based on extremely tragic events.This movie, not as all other true story films, is sending a very strong message; especially to journalists. At Emerson College, one of the most important majors is journalism. It can be very hard to debate until what extent is a journalist willing to go to in order to release the truth about something. Emerson students should be informed of this because they were a series of events that marked history in a very strong way; something everyone should know about.",

I only watched it in 2018 because so many people reviewing Angelina Jolie's First They Killed My Father kept insisting that this is THE movie to watch if you want to know more about the Cambodian genocide. And that Jolie's movie was uninformative and cheesy. Well, this one is equally uninformative and way more cheesy! Maybe reviewers preferred the story being told my a guy rather than a girl? I have no idea. At least FTKMF left me intrigued to find out more about the situation and I was also immersed in its atmosphere. I can't say the same for this one. It looked like a poor man's Empire of the Sun. Such important stories that need to be told, but it doesn't work every time just because of the shock value. Lastly, as few others already mentioned, this movie was in need of editing. Too long with little substance. Sorry!",

            "content": "The Cambodian genocide that took place during the rule of Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge in the late 1970's is considered to be one of the worst genocides in modern world history. The film, The Killing Fields, takes its name of those who have died due to disease, starvation, and violence upon innocent civilians from the restrictive policies of the Khmer Rouge, numbering from 1.8 to 2.3 million, in which the land of Cambodia became their corpses. The Killing Fields is an important and eye-opening portrayal of a significant period of world history in Asia. The film is based on the true stories of New York Times journalist Sydney Schanberg, and Cambodian journalist, Dith Pran. Both undergo the events of the genocide themselves throughout this historic film.The director of this movie does not hold back in showing the events leading to the genocide, which started in 1973 with an accidental bombing of a town by American planes that killed hundreds. Along towards the end of the film, Sydney is in New York, trying to find any sign of Pran's whereabouts, for he was recently enslaved in a forced labor camp under Khmer Rogue rule. If the film had focused entirely on presenting the historical events, the film would be too overwhelmingly depressing to view. It shouldn't be viewed as a historical drama but as a reminder that such atrocities exist and still happens in our world today. By simply ignoring them, those atrocities will never go away.Despite the horror of this inhumanity, this movie is not widely taught or discussed within schools in America. As an Emerson student, it is profoundly important to know of this historical tragedy because the characters in this event have risked their lives to use the art of media to communicate what is going on in the country of Cambodia. It was a duty to themselves that they were proud to accomplish. Many people aren't aware of such events in the world unless it is being passed on through the arts such as movies like this, or even through mass media such as newspapers, radio, TV news, etc. As a student, it is our duties to spread the word of what goes on in this world as a message because every little matter that happens to one community can have the powerful, domino affect to impact everyone else.",

Before his report many westerners thought of it as a paradise, \"Another world, a secret world\" Sydney once referred to it as. What many people didn't realize was that the war in neighboring Vietnam expanded its borders into Cambodia, which was neutral at the time. In 1973, Sydney went to cover this horrid event for the New York Times. He then met Dith Pran, a Cambodian journalist and interpreter. Pran states that if the war continues it can lead to a catastrophic end for Cambodia. Eventually Sydney returns to New York and wins a Pulitzer Prize for his story while Pran is trapped in a concentration camp led by rebels. The guilt of leaving Pran behind and exploiting him starts to eat at Sydney to the point where he returns back to the war-torn country to find his friend and confront his unatoned sins. Pran escapes the \"killing field\" and is reunited with Sydney in a Red Cross camp. It is there that Sydney begs for his forgiveness, but Pran replies \"nothing to forgive, Sydney\". I really love movies that test the bonds of friendships. Everyone in this world has a friend that they would travel to Cambodia and back for, and it makes this story relatable. And seeing the war, the concentration camps and all the deaths shocked me tremendously. I was never able to imagine what Cambodia was like so seeing films that enhance my cultural knowledge are really beneficial. In fact, I think this movie is beneficial to all Emerson students. In a school based on international communication, it is important to know what the world around us is like.",

Journalists stepping into battlefields at times like these were frowned upon. A New York journalist by the name of Sydney Schanberg stepped into the war to document what was going on. The movie is an adaptation of the magazine article that was written. While spending his time over in Cambodia, Schanberg goes for a wild journey that consists of attempting to rescue his translator, witnessing some of the most horrific crimes, and a fight to escape the country alive. The film is a great representation of what really went on in Cambodia at that time. It also shows how much journalism played a part in people being aware of things that happen in other countries. With this film being so successful, it broadened the awareness of the awful tragedies of what happened.",

In it, a small cadre of reporters witness the American bombings in Cambodia, followed by the overthrow of the Cambodian government by the Khmer Rouge. As Phnom Pen falls to the insurgents, all of the expatriates are deported, forcing the group to leave behind their translator, Pran. He is subjected to the horrors of Pol Pot's \"Year Zero,\" a policy of genocide that killed one fifth of the population of Cambodia, until he can escape in the confusion of the Cambodian-Vietnamese War. The movie is filmed with a shocking and powerful authenticity. The actor who played the hero, Pran, Haing S. Ngor, actually was a refugee who had escaped the same tyrannical regime depicted in the film, and the portions of the movie focusing on his escape from the Democratic Republic of Kampuchea are harrowing. The scenes are almost all in Khmer, and without subtitles, the audience feels just as estranged and alone as Pran does. It is not just important for students to learn about the atrocities of the Khmer Rouge. In the age of information, where the ability to communicate can topple governments and be an agent of change, it is the duty of all people who call themselves civilized to know at least something about the terrible things that go on in the parts of the world we choose to forget about.",

The film is about a New York Times journalist, Sydney Schanberg, who is in Cambodia investigating the situation, learning more about the US bombing campaign and the communist Khmer Rouge. The other protagonist is Dith Pran, who was Sydney's interpreter who helps him develop his stories, and eventually becomes close to Sydney. Dith spends most of his time behind Sydney in order to develop the story about the Khmer Rouge taking over the power. The Khmer Rouge were vicious guerrilla groups in Cambodia, that eventually caused many deaths. When Cambodia began to feel unsafe Dith decided to send his family to the United States, while he stayed in Cambodia helping Sydney create his story. Later on, after the uprising of events, they decided to leave to the US. Dith tries to breakout of his country with his fellow American journalist, when he was caught, and wasn't able to leave the country. A number of things happen, until he finally escapes with a crowd of people, but he is the only one that eventually makes it, to the US with the help of Sydney Schanberg. This film contains many bloody realistic events, that helps the audience to have the first hand experience of the events in the civil war in Cambodia at the time. According to Robert Ebert, \"One of the risks taken by The Killing Fields is to cut loose from that tradition, to tell us a story that does not have a traditional Hollywood structure, and to trust that we'll find the characters so interesting that we won't miss the clich\u00e9. It is a risk that works, and that helps make this into a really affecting experience.\" This historical tragedy is important to students in Emerson because, journalism is one of the most known majors at Emerson. Students need to be aware of the historical events that journalists have been through and learn from those events. This is also a way for journalist to become aware of their surroundings when covering a story, and to be safe while doing what they most enjoy.",

The music, or the lack of it, is also very appropriate. Mike Oldfield managed to successfully pair the music and the wild track in order to convey emotion or achieve a higher sense of reality depending on the scene. The Killing Fields definitely deserved the three Academy Awards, eight BAFTA Awards, and other 15 accolades from different cinematography societies that included various nominations for best supporting actor to Haing S.

Back in history, in Cambodia the soldiers wanted to change the regime from Khmer Republic to Democratic Cambodia. They attacked the civilians, they killed innocent citizens, they destroyed families, homes, streets and many other things. As watching the film, we -the audience- see all these events from the point of view of two journalists, one from Cambodia, Dith Pran, and one from America, Sydney Schanberg. I think the film is well developed. The film makers used strong visual scenes which are not either too negative or too optimistic. It eventually convinced the audience about the historical accuracy.

Deserving of these honors, the film created a vivid picture of the horrific tragedies that occurred in Cambodia in the 1970's. The plot revolves around an American journalist for the New York Times, Sydney Schanberg, who tries to bring to light the tragic killings that were occurring in Cambodia. Working alongside Schanberg was his close friend Dith Pran, a Cambodian journalist and translator. The movie adapts the historical events of how the Khmer Rouge, the ruling communist party of Cambodia at the time, massacred thousands of people in an attempt at social engineering. While press corps were sanitizing the story, Schanberg and Pran continuously endangered their lives to expose the gruesome reality of what was happening to the innocent people of Cambodia. Eventually Schanberg is able to return to the U.S, while Pran is forced to stay in Cambodia and be of service to the violent Khmer Rouge. Yet after many attempts and failed efforts, Pran survives and escapes the communists' influence, and the story ends with the reunion of Pran and Schanberg. \"The Killing Fields\" gives a detailed dramatization of the cruel genocide that occurred in Cambodia. Although the truths of these events were eventually documented, it did not receive the full attention that it deserved. This film appeals to the audience's emotions and further advocates for the awareness of what happened to Cambodia in the years 1975 through 1979. Therefore, I commend the staff that worked so hard to promote the awareness of these occurrences. Considering that Emerson College is a school that is concentrated on \"film, theater, journalism, marketing, communication, writing, literature, and publishing,\" it is very important for students to know about this historical tragedy. This film shows how important forms of communications can be in times of political turmoil and heartbreaking violence.

The Killings Fields (1984) was an Academy Award-winning movie that showed the strife that Cambodians endured during the reign of the Khmer Rouge and how two journalists documented it. The movie begins in 1973 with the arrival of American journalist, Sydney Schanberg, in Phnom Penh, Cambodia. He and his partner/translator, a Cambodian journalist named Dith Pran, set out to cover the ongoing civil war between the current Cambodian government and the Khmer Rouge, a Communist regime that is beginning to take over. They risk their lives numerous times, including an attempt to visit Neak Leung, a town that is accidentally bombed by American forces. When the Khmer Rouge eventually takes full power in 1975, Pran is taken to work at a concentration camp as a field worker and Schanberg evacuates to America. Schanberg then begins a successful personal campaign to locate Pran. The movie ends with Schanberg and Pran reunited and Schanberg is awarded for his coverage of Cambodia. The Killing Fields is an incredible movie that should be viewed by all generations to come, for it shows how inhumane people are in this world and how there are some people dedicated to exploiting them.

The main character Sydney is a reporter who is out in Cambodia covering the war. Sydney's close friend and translator Dith helps Sydney out of several dangerous situations. They are either in a peaceful embassy or held captive by the Cambodian army. Sydney escapes by switching a French passport while Dith's passport picture turns gray and has no choice but to be turned over to the Cambodian army. Dith ends up in a concentration camp run by child soldiers while Sydney is winning an award for his literary works for his time in Cambodia. Dith eventually escapes with the help of one of the camp leaders he meets during his first escape. With a map and money secretly given to him, he escapes to a hospital camp where he is rescued by Sydney. The quality of the film was extremely poor. A lot of the time the movie was in a different language without subtitles. This movie was about history and started off with no background of what was going on. I understood it was a war in Cambodia but I thought it was between Cambodia and the United States by how the beginning of the movie interpreted things. The main characters were in danger one second than randomly they were in a peaceful embassy. How could one go from about to being killed to a peaceful serene environment? The use of animals during this film seemed to be very cruel, I don't know if it was a special effect when the cow was cut open on its neck but it seemed to be real. Also the faux bombing and intentional startling of animals seemed to be unnecessary.I think this movie is not an accurate depiction of the Cambodian civil war, with that said I cannot say it is important for an Emerson student to see this film. The movie is sad and what happened during that period is horrible. History is a very important thing to learn so it is important for an Emerson student to know what happened during this time. However this movie on the other hand is not an appropriate way for them to learn about this event. -30-",
