            "review_title": "The Greatest WTF Movie Ever Made",
            "content": "The Canyons (2013)1/2 (out of 4) Paul Schrader's latest deals with the rich Christian (James Deen) who's living in Los Angeles and seems to have it all until he learns that his girlfriend/sex partner (Lindsay Lohan) is having an affair with a man (Nolan Gerard Funk) who he hired in his latest movie. THE CANYONS is without question the greatest WTF movie in the history of cinema or at least to date. I say this because there was never a single second during this film where I understood what was going on or what director Schrader or screenwriter Bret Easton Ellis were trying to say or do. This film is without question a complete and utter mess and for the life of me I can't understand what the point of it was unless the only goal was to make it as cheap as they could and hope that the Lohan nude scenes would gain enough interest to make some money. Both Schrader and Ellis are so incredibly talented that it would be easy to make fun of this picture but I personally found it rather sad as neither man has found themselves involved with something this bad before and worse of all is the fact that the film makes no sense. It's meant to be some sort of twisted erotic thriller but there isn't a single thrill and the sex scenes aren't nearly as shocking as it appears the filmmakers think they are. Had this been made twenty-years ago then it might have been considered shocking but in today's day and age everything just comes across as pretty lame. Deen is fair in his first non-porn role but he certainly doesn't show enough here to warrant any future movies. The supporting players are all either bland or downright horrid and often times it seems like we're watching line rehearsals instead of an actual take. As for Lohan, well, sadly she once again is pretty bad. She just doesn't have any emotional depth here and even during her nude scenes she just looks incredibly uncomfortable and especially during a shower sequence. I'm sure this nudity is what's going to make most people check this thing out but it's really not worth it. The film also features a bad music score, some forgettable cinematography and worse of all is how deadly boring it is from start to finish. The dialogue is downright laughable and the overall feel is something cheaper and worse than what you'd expect to see on Cinemax at three in the morning. I guess the best thing I can say is that it's actually the best of the three movies Lohan has released in 2013.",

            "content": "Seeing that this stars Lindsay Lohan the train-wreck and James Deen the porn star, the long knives are coming out for this movie before it finished taping. With all the bad press, I was expecting an amateurish mess. The one main thing that I got from this film was that this was professionally made.The filming style looks good. Lindsay Lohan is ... well ... Lindsay. Certainly she's not going to win any awards but she still has the screen presence. James Deen does a good douche bag. Maybe that's just his real personality. Everybody fit their roles. Lindsay is a cold emotionally damaged ex-star. Deen is sexually perverted. They might as well used their real names.The one thing that I wish they would improve on is setting up more danger at the start. A better foreshadowing would improve the tension. Instead, it's strictly a linear time line and the start of the movie is rather slow. It doesn't actually start moving till the middle of the movie. Overall, it's a good effort for a low budget indie.",

            "review_title": "Surprisingly Un-Sexy",
            "content": "This film suffers heavily from a distinct lack of sexiness and way too much boring dialogue. And that is just the beginning of the problems. You really know a film is bad when Lindsay Lohan is the only bright light in it! The Acting: Lindsay Lohan does quite a good job in a couple of scenes involving emotion, though she is much less effective in the (too abundant) dialogue heavy scenes. James Deen shows a few flashes of talent but mainly seems as if he is trying to emulate a method actor with no real understanding of how to actually pull it off. The other \"performances\" are uniformly bad to less-bad.The Writing: One word... Awful. Boring dialogue and unbelievable story. Poor ending. I think Bret Easton Ellis is a one-trick pony. He has never managed to equal what he achieved with American Psycho.The Directing: Same word as above... Awful. Paul Schraeder really should sink back into obscurity. This project is definitely not going to help his career. Poor choice of camera angles and poor framing abounds. He shows no sign of his earlier talents. I think he is lost in his own imagined \"genius\" as he tries for a gritty realism and gets ugly pretentiousness.Camera, Lighting, etc.: Poor lighting in almost every indoor scene. It looks like it was shot on a smart phone. The music is irritating. Wardrobe... What wardrobe? It looks like the actors supplied the clothes they wanted to wear. There is no costume design or set design in evidence here.Sexiness: Basically there is none. Lindsay Lohan looks pretty sad with her prominent beer belly, sagging breasts and 1960s style lingerie. Control-top granny panties are not lust-inducing! The sex scenes are boring and much less spicy than the hype suggested. The \"orgy\" was so badly filmed it and lit that it was impossible to find it sexy or even interesting. Women or those with a gay interest may find it more sexually appealing but I don't find dangling limp penises to be anything but silly looking. The entertainment media painted this as shockingly graphic but it is pretty tame compared to cable shows like True Blood if you discount the number of penises on view.In Conclusion: Not really worth a look even if you just want to see Lindsay Lohan in the buff. There was more of her on view in Playboy and her body looked at least a bit better in the magazine. If you are looking for titillating sex scenes you would be better off with Skinemax. If you want to see a dramatic expose of Hollywood's dark underbelly look elsewhere. In fact just look elsewhere. Period.",

If anything, it gives me a lot of hope for Lindsay Lohan. She's actually pretty great in this, by fat the best. Nolan Gerard Funk is also pretty solid. Now, James Deen is one beautiful man, but the shot of his junk is probably the most impressive thing about him in the film. I think he needs some serious acting classes, and while I appreciate his effort, he totally overplays the narcissism and many times delivers lines without any range or charisma. The ending is sort of weird and unsatisfying, but overall, very much a guilty pleasure.",

            "review_title": "Underrated Schrader, with an excellent performance by Lohan",
            "content": "\"The audience is now fully interactive. Unfortunately, the spectacle is a corpse; a surgeon operating on his own brain whilst filming and watching it on his own phone.\" - Dean Cavanagh Paul Schrader directs \"The Canyons\". Based on a screenplay by Bret Easton Ellis, the film was mauled by critics. Reminiscent of the director's own \"American Gigolo\", \"Light Sleeper\" and \"The Walker\", it remains one of Schrader's better films.In 2006, Schrader wrote that the \"human narrative as we know it will end\" and that \"art's seeming demise is not a sign of creative bankruptcy but the twinkling of changes to come.\" \"Canyons\" is itself concerned with demises and changes. It opens with shots of decaying cinemas and crumbling theatre houses, communal spaces which once preserved old fashioned subject/object, spectator/artwork divides, but which have now been replaced by something else. But what and to what effect? Schrader then launches into a sleazy, neo-noirish plot (Schrader famously wrote \"Notes on Noir\" in 1972). Here Lindsay Lohan plays Tara, the love interest of Christian (pornographic actor James Deen), a wealthy playboy who spends his days funding films, relaxing in his Malibu mansion and having anonymous sex with strangers. Christian's personal assistant is Gina, who's overseeing the film Christian is financing. Gina is dating Ryan, who once had a relationship with Tara.\"Art is a narrative. The universe is a narrative. Each and every thing has a beginning, middle, and end,\" Schrader would say in promotional interviews. In \"Canyons\", old modes of storytelling, amusement and spectacle have given way to new media. Everyone's making amateur pornography, recording their lives on smart phones and traditional movies are only half-watched and constantly interrupted by pop-ups and instant messages anyway. The human body is itself now the new canvas, a carefully managed profile uploaded and broadcast for digital adulation. In this world, interactive and performative rituals abound, signalling the all-encompassing voyeurism of a surveillance culture that generates a bigger buzz than the lowly cinema screen ever could. \"Nobody has a private life anymore,\" Christian mumbles, and Tara, an ex-actress, outright states that she no longer has interest in films.With this comes a host of neuroses. Schrader's lovers rely on a hook-up application called Amour to arrange sex parties, and everyone is too busy shopping, f***ing, texting and micro-managing their profiles to pay attention to the faces in front of them. \"Who knows anyone? Who is really happy?\" Christian asks. Schrader provides the answer: Gina, the film's one character to believe in, not only old-fashioned values, but the power of cinema. She remains the only content character in the film, a happiness which is revealed to be hopelessly naive when she discovers, amongst other things, her boyfriend's infidelities.Issues of power and class begin to seep into Schrader's narrative. Tara stays with Christian, and allows him to film and record her, only because he's loaded with cash and she wishes to avoid dehumanising work conditions. Ryan is similarly exploited by men, bosses and cameras. Christian, meanwhile, craves power. He forces others to have sex, forces them to watch him, and forces others to be watched. He loves the vantage points afforded by power. Loves controlling who and how and what is being watched. Unsurprisingly, eyeball to eyeball contact during sex infuriates him; he hates being observed unless on his own terms.As the film progresses, Christian loses power as Tara gains. She subtly \"manipulates\" Christian into kissing another guy during an orgy, and begins to rekindle an affair with Ryan. Christian doesn't like this. \"I like the idea of someone looking at something they can't have. Guy thing. Power! Control!\" he says. But Tara's encroaching on Christian's terrain. \"I don't feel in control anymore,\" he complains. \"Usually I direct the scene. They made me feel like I'm an actor!\" Being a spoilt-brat, Christian responds by going on a murderous rampage. On the film's meta-level, though, the \"opening up\" or \"democratisation\" afforded by new media is shown to be threatening to those who have inherited status. With everybody selling their bodies for cash and digitally, willingly pimping their profiles, top-dog Christian, like a defunct movie studio, finds his terrain shrinking. In short, techno-capitalism's age of spectacle has mutated. In \"Canyons\", Hollywood movies are themselves dead, replaced by micro-budget, Kickstarter-funded shoestring productions. Meanwhile, new media supplants passive looking with active touching. Gina finds these new experiences shocking.\"The Canyons\" was shot on a tiny budget in a little less than three weeks and distributed online through video-on-demand networks. Schrader casts pornographic actors in a number of roles, a tactic which helps blur the lines between next-generation actors and pornography; everyone's now a pimp, producer and hooker.The film's aesthetic is novel. This is an emotionless, open and artificial world whose wheels are lubricated by blood money and whose streets are populated by rootless souls, blood sucking tics and jaded eyeballs which no longer believe in the allure of Hollywood fame. Elsewhere Schrader's cinematography and material plays like clash between \"Double Indemnity\", \"Eyes Wide Shut\", \"Sunset Boulevard\", \"The Girlfriend Experience\" and Wong Kar-Wai.What really elevates \"Canyons\", though, is Lindsay Lohan's layered performance. A child actor who came through the studio system, only to find it crushing and discarding her afterwards, Lohan knows what it's like to be trapped in a golden cage. With her beautifully gravelly voice and interesting looks, her Tara is caught between abandonment, strategy, despair and rebellion. Lohan out-acts everyone in a generally poorly acted film, which is perhaps the biggest irony of \"Canyons\". All your Youtubes, Facebooks, porn-sites, amateur actors and pornographers can't replace the power of a lowly but seasoned thespian. Lohan's strong performance almost refutes Schrader's entire film. Almost.8/10 \u2013 See Olivier Assayas' \"Demonlover\" and Lohan's performance in Altman's similarly themed \"A Prairie Home Companion\".",

            "content": "I've been waiting to see this film for some time, and was finally just able to see it on VOD. Unfortunately, it was a disappointment, especially considering Paul Schrader directed it. The combination of he and Bret Easton Ellis is not a good one. The film is yet another saga of bored Hollywood individuals looking for meaning in life - pretty much the common theme of BEE's novels - and indulging in sex, mind games and jealousy while attempting to hold on to their flailing, angst-filled existences. Mr. Schrader drives the point home further by occasionally interspersing shots of dilapidated, closed movie theaters to show us how the \"old Hollywood\" has decayed. \"The Canyons\" attempts very hard to shock, but unfortunately, we've seen it all before, as Hollywood has been making these caricatures of itself since the 70's and 80's. Lindsay Lohan is surprisingly effective in her role most of the time, and carries a lot of the film. James Deen, who I was not familiar with as I'm not that into porn, also does a believable job (and illustrates WHY he's had a career in porn during his full frontal shot). There's also a refreshing twist during a four-way sex scene. But I was left wondering at the end of the film - and it ends very awkwardly - what was the point, and how could anyone invest much empathy in these characters? I understand \"The Canyons\" opens today in Los Angeles and New York, as well as being simultaneously offered on television and Itunes via pay-per-view. I would be very surprised if this gets any further than those two major cities; it's just not engrossing or original enough to draw in much of an audience.",

            "content": "'The Canyons' portrays a collection of characters deceiving and manipulating each other to distract from the emptiness of their lives. Chief among them is a sociopathic film producer, Christian, whose jaded girlfriend Tara reluctantly consents to the sex orgies he arranges with random internet strangers. After Tara helps a former boyfriend, Ryan, get the lead role in Christian's new movie, they resume their old affair, despite Ryan having a girlfriend called Gina who is also working on the film. Christian grows increasingly suspicious of Tara's fidelity outside the group sex dynamic, and has her followed by a slacker private eye, while he hooks up with a former assistant, who is also an old girlfriend of Ryan.This incestuous merry-go-round is merely the set-up, and director Shrader fails elevate the subsequent hokey-pokey above soap opera level after making disastrous casting decisions with Lindsay Lohan, James Deen and Nolan Funk as his lead trio. The only competent actor is Amanda Brooks who plays the scorned Gina in a minor role - although she's actually five years older than Lohan, she looks fifteen years younger and fifty times more desirable than the supposedly irresistible Tara. Sex is a crucial plot element, but no erotic intensity is generated since the characters are more robotic than human. The film wastes many tedious minutes on lengthy shots of them entering and exiting cars and buildings. 'The Canyons' limps along with wooden direction, dialog, acting and storytelling until the deceptions and manipulations lead to a pointless act of violence and an implausible conclusion.",

The acting is pathetic, I'm pretty sure school kids could act better than this, but then again it's not like they had a lot to work with as I've already stated, but I feel distinctly sure that even if they did, they'd still be horrible. The directing is amateurish, trying desperately to make the movie seem \"arty\" but failing. A lot of the stuff didn't even make scene, like counting the days (Monday-Wednesday), why were we doing that again? How exactly did that fit in with anything else?

            "content": "While \"The Canyons\" is not a total loss, it still doesn't work. As mentioned, it's about this spoiled and mentally unbalanced trust fund baby named Christian (James Deen) who's accustomed to getting his way, and his gold-digging yet not entirely unsympathetic girlfriend, former actress Tara (Lindsay Lohan). They live in a stylish mansion and have sex with each other and sometimes have guests join them. Partly on his father's insistence that he work, Christian produces the occasional film and one of those films stars Ryan (Gerard Funk Nolan), a hunky actor whom Tara was once lovers with and whom she still secretly loves. This unexpectedly makes Christian violently jealous (even he's surprised by his reaction) and sets in motion eventual tragedy. None of the people here are all that likable, not even the seemingly idealistic Ryan, and the low budget shows. The gratuitous sex and violence is reeks of exploitation. Yet the film is watchable at times. The entertainment industry is somewhat captured and some of the dialog is perceptive. The acting is somewhat better than one would expect. James Deen is a porn star, yet he shows he can carry a lead role without sinking a legitimate film. More importantly, Lindsay Lohan gives her best performance in years. She's a greedy user not because she likes to be, but because she believes she has no choice, yet she's still capable of love isn't really out to hurt anyone. I don't recommend this film, but it's not as terrible as it could have been. For all its faults, \"The Canyons\" has its moments.",

            "review_title": "Great movie, typical Ellis - detached and cruel",
            "content": "I think that a lot of the criticism of \"The Canyons\" is missing the point. All of Ellis' stories have a detached quality in them which makes them hard for audiences to relate to, especially on screen. They seem \"unreal\".A constant theme in Ellis' work is the existential \"ennui\", the boredom and emptiness of life, the absence of deeper meaning. His main characters feel that something is missing, but they can't pinpoint what it is. As an audience, we know what they are missing - connection with themselves and others, and genuine emotion. This is why there is so much disconnect between the protagonists and the viewers.It may be that the choice of Hollywood as a backdrop for this display of existential emptiness is an unlucky one because few people can relate to wealthy Hollywood life on a personal level.However, I applaud the filmmakers for at least having the guts to try. The people in this movie are all choosing materialism over personal connection, and mechanical sex instead of intimacy, an orgasm is for them a reflex just like sneezing. Neither money, sex, nor social status provide happiness for those who get it in abundance; only those who don't have it in abundance think they will bring happiness. The values that popular culture upholds are devoid of value.In addition, I think James Deen does a perfect job playing a narcissistic, controlling, emotionally empty vessel on the verge of snapping, and Lindsay Lohan (this is her first movie I've seen, and given the bad press, I'm positively surprised) does a great job playing a woman despairing from choosing hell in physical luxury, while starving emotionally.",

            "content": "Whoo-boy, saw \"The Canyons\" and I guess to damn it with faint praise is that it isn't the worst movie I have seen this year (congrats still, \"Grown Ups 2\"). \"The Canyons\" does have its minor moments of art-directed, abject L.A. decadence and contains a modicum of car-crash curiosity. Lindsay Lohan is OK in it, as is porn star James Deen - although both are characters I'd pretty much cross the street to avoid in real life. The movie is as nihilistic and dead-at-it's-core as it was designed to be, particularly expected when you have the guys who collectively created American Psycho and Taxi Driver piloting this thing. In fact, if you took Bret Easton Ellis' \"Less Than Zero\" and spliced it with Paul Schrader's \"American Gigolo\", you've pretty much got this movie's number. Schrader's camera captures the vacuum of this glam couple well in the early going setting up Lohan and Deen's hedonistic, vacant relationship - its coolly pointed in its visual observation. Ellis manages to make a few catty points about the movie industry and those who work in it. It doesn't add up to much, though.Perhaps coked-up \"The Canyons\" greatest misstep is that it settles to be forgettable mid-grade trash instead of a batsh*t-great guilty pleasure. The movie seems satisfied to recline in low-speed soap-opera theatrics, softcore antics and smug button-pushing instead of putting pedal to the metal and really going gonzo - which both writer and director are prone to do in their own individual projects. In the end, the film's final act basically torpedoes whatever low-budget goodwill the picture had cobbled together. Both director Schrader and writer Ellis are expert provocateurs and have done - and will do - better than this shoestring experiment. Still, it coulda been worse.",

Script flatters to deceive, however. Starts well, builds well, but ends badly. A few more scenes were needed to tie everything together, and/or make a point.Performances vary. Lindsay Lohan is pretty good in the female lead. I suspect some of the dislike for this movie stems from her starring in it, but she does a good job. She's not a bad actress, but I guess her private life alienates people.

I'm not a LiLo fanatic by any means, but I have always thought that given the right script and director she would be primed for a comeback. And if she can clean up her personal life then maybe she deserves one. The film for me was neither horrible nor far from perfect. The movie opens with scenes of boarded up movie theaters's, and I don't quite get the symbolism there since Hollywood seems alive and well. It is puzzling to me though that the Schrader/Ellis team had to go the Kickstarter route to raise a minute $250,000 for the budget. As you probably know, the film center's around two couples- a trust fund 'doucebag' named Christian who hasn't even read the script for the movie he is helping fund and Lohan as his girlfriend Tara, and unknown to Christian, Tara's ex Ryan, who is now dating Christian's assistant. Ryan has also been cast as the lead in the movie, and he and Tara are still hooking up. You would think Christian wouldn't be jealous of Tara's sex life since he constantly invites strange men and women into their bedroom, but of course he is. He suspects Tara is sleeping with Ryan, and things spiral out of control from there. Much has and will be said about the sex scene's in the film, but for me what really worked was Lohan's performance. You can sense that the actress knows her career is in trouble, and when she talks about needing to be taken care of, and not wanting to go back to being poor, you start to wonder where the acting stops and her real life begins. The movie isn't perfect, and the performances are flawed. I'm not at all happy with the ending, but I still think it's worth watching.",

            "content": "Release Date: 2nd August 2013 (US) After starring briefly in two of the years worst films, Lindsay Lohan makes her full length return in Paul Schrader's \"The Canyons\". A film that documents just how crazy one individual can go, when he finds out about the secret love affair between his girlfriend and the lead on his film project.With this being Lindsay Lohan's first full length appearance since the critically panned, \"Labor Pains\" released in 2009, there has been a lot of correspondence and speculation surrounding this indie flick.Despite hearing some very mixed opinions, I have to say I wasn't particularly fazed by \"The Canyons\". The film is littered with problems, yet I never really had any trouble sitting through it. It is overdramatic and slightly ridiculous, but at times, that alone makes it a very compelling watch.Don't get me wrong, I didn't enjoy the movie, but I didn't dislike it either. It's a very middle of the road experience. Well at least it was for me anyway.The films production budget is very low. So don't go into it expecting some extravagant revenge-romance esque thriller, because that's not what it is. In a way, the films plot-line could be compared to that of a soap opera. It's not particularly exciting, but it is partially entertaining watching it unfold.However, for such a low budget film ($250,000 to be precise), the film is actually rather attractive. It is very well lit and the various locations work with the direction that the film goes in. It's well cinematised, and in terms of shots, whilst it doesn't do anything original, there were times when I was watching the film amending some of the cinematography.Now a lot of media outlets have compared to the film to porn. I don't necessarily agree with that statement. Sure there are specific body parts that are revealed on numerous occasions, but whilst there is an emphasis on sex, it's not as explicit as a lot of people have made it out to be.The performances are average. Nobody really impressed me and whilst nobody is bad, some of the dialogue is very cheesy and repetitive, but of course that can only be blamed on the writers. Lindsay Lohan offers a solid turn as does real life porn star, James Deen, but nobody does anything that you're going to love or remember the next day. Everyone's very mediocre, and due to how ridiculous the film eventually becomes, the characters all end up becoming rather comical.Whilst the film does lack in its key areas, along with the cinematography, one of the aspects I liked was the score. I will be the first to admit that it does sound very amateurish, but the electronic nature of it occasionally works, with what the movie is trying to present. That presentation being that shouldn't have affairs, especially if you're dating a complete an utter psychopath.I have to admit The Canyons was lot of better than I expected it to be. I didn't necessarily enjoy it, but there were aspects to it that I liked. Perhaps I'm being too nice, but for a low budget production I didn't find it too bad. If you have a partial interest in seeing it, see it. But if you don't, then I wouldn't bother.5/10 Check out my website: www.jacks-reviews.com",

            "content": "This is a failure from the normal standpoint where films are the perfected sum of their construction. There is no beauty to speak of, no clever writing. They could have found better actors. But is this the only way we have to evaluate films? Sure, we celebrate Kubrick for his meticulous beauty, Nolan for his mechanics of story; there's none of that here. But we also celebrate makers like Herzog or Cassavetes for their intuitive pull to unmask a real life trying to balance, the stories all about this effort.This strangely works for me because Schrader reached out to where the cracks and damage have settled on real lives by the turn of things.For an enhanced effect, you might wanna see this in a row after Mean Girls and a bunch of James Deen porn\u2014I didn't but I could feel a faint tension humming at the edges, already interwoven with the fiction. And if you read about the shoot, there's I think a Variety article that covers the gonzo wreck it was, Schrader jeopardized the whole thing several times over by casting Lindsay. I'm sure she was the most recognizable name he could get on his budget, but it's also obvious he had to have someone like her and not any other girl.It is soap as others say: games of power over the viewer with nervous exposing of souls as the trophy of cruelty. But having Lindsay and Deen in there asks of us to recognize the bare selves we know before anything could be touched over, it's to see her withered beauty, cloudiness around the eyes and sense of being lost as truly heartbreaking because we know it's not all acting. Deen is much less interesting, a simple lust for control. But it registers as a callousness that was already there before any character trying to act; no one who slaps women in hundreds of videos is merely 'acting'. So when we see Lindsay trying to avoid another character prying into her life, when later she's on a bed making out with a girl for a movie like this (and being filmed in it) or when Deen erupts on her in a frenzy; that's real dust flying through the air. This is the kind of stuff Herzog tried for when he got Bruno to America for Stroszek, looking for entries into someone experiencing this as not simply artifice. We're in lesser hands here but having this as our anchor rubs off on everything else, suddenly we have a whole mess of things that are no longer just flaws but the thing showing itself. I like that it's not all dressed up and somewhat raw, that the acting is inexperienced, that Deen's mansion is that mansion from porn videos, that the camera discovers an ordinary Los Angeles. It wouldn't be the same without LA around these people. We reinvest all the cinematic dreams we've had from Sunset Blvd to Mulholland.Oh, all the stuff about the abusive richboy being a filmmaker, acting as life and feeling objectified in images are as obvious now as that whole filmmaker subplot in films like Last Tango and Blackout. The film does reflect Ferrara who was caught in the 90s between obvious constructions and evocative air. So it's not some great film by design. But Schrader was smart (or cynical enough) to know he could create a situation that would pull everything else, bending it to where he'd like to go, skiing on the pull.Watch like you were unsure yourself where real life picks up again.",

            "content": "The credits show a series of derelict cinemas, now just ruins, before cutting to a kind of business lunch in which beautiful, vacuous movie people talk about movies and sex. The scene would appear to be 'badly' written and acted but brilliantly directed; if this is what constitutes the movies today it's little wonder so many theatres have closed down. You might call Paul Schrader's \"The Canyons\" a satire on the movie business but it's much too sour to be truly satirical. For decades Schrader has always been Hollywood's Number One Avenging Angel, condemning sex and violence in his puritanical fashion while showing it in extremis.Now he has turned his jaundiced eye on the business that has been providing him with a livliehood from the seventies onwards. It takes time to get your head around the inane dialogue and the stilted acting that in lesser hands might have condemned this to a straight-to-video release but this is an expensive production, brilliantly photographed in widescreen by John DiFazio, its money shots coming, not from below the belt, but from inside Schrader's head, or should we say from inside Schrader's head and that of writer Bret Easton Ellis who has also been biting the hand that feeds him for quite awhile now.The problem lies in the casting. It's one thing having good actors play 'badly' but it doesn't really work in reverse. The lead here is played by porn star James Deen who is supposed to be someone who, if not exactly intelligent, is at least successful and in this role Deen never convinces for a second. Lindsay Lohan, on the other hand, is somewhat better. Lohan is someone who might have had something of a career had her personal life not got in the way. Everyone else is cast for their bodies and not for their brains which, I suppose, is just as it should be in a film about an industry that seems to have been founded on sex. No doubt the 'Me2' movement will find much here to back up their argument that Hollywood has long been operating on exploitaiton. At least Schrader has fun telling us that all this is bad while wallowing in it. Of course, most people haven't caught Schrader's little jest as intended and the film flopped. It may be far from his best work but I think it fits perfectly into his canon.",

The story is about some trust-fund kid (James Deen) who's also producing a movie so that his (unseen) dad will get off of his back. His live-in girlfriend is played by Lindsay Lohan, and the small cast is rounded out with other characters who know each other, and sleep or have slept with one another. Still, most of the movie is just boring, lifeless dialogue interspersed with some of the most unerotic sex I've ever seen, which includes a foursome. I mean, what were these people thinking?

            "content": "\"The Canyons\" is not the sort of film I'd normally watch. The movie is essentially a low budget porno film with more plot...which surprised me a bit since the film was on Netflix. The reason I chose to see it was because it has a rating of 3.8....nearly enough to merit its inclusion on IMDB's infamous Bottom 100 List...something I try to see as many of them as I can. Yes, I am apparently a masochist.As I watched, I assumed that the low score was simply because it's a Lindsay Lohan film. But after reading up on co-star James Deen and the dozen or more rape allegations against him, perhaps this is much of the reason the film is hated by so many viewers.The film itself plays like a porno film with a little less nudity (just a bit) and a bit more plot...albeit not a very deep one. Apparently, Tara (Lohan) wants money and to feel wanted...and the oddly named Christian (Deen) fits that bill. He's an odd man. While he encourages her to have sex with various people while he watches, he MUST be in control. At first, this control is exciting because Tara can just turn off her mind and let him run her life. She also likes all the kinky hookups with him and various other folks joining in with the fun. Later, Christian shows his jealous and possessive side...especially when she begins seeing another man. Eventually this leads to very violent things....provided you keep watching the movie...which is a bit doubtful.If you are looking to see a lot of Lindsay, well you might feel disappointed. While there is lots of male frontal nudity and other women, it's odd that Lohan is mostly covered up in her nude scenes. As for me, I wish all the nudity wasn't in the film because it seems to take the place of plot AND isn't very sexy...especially that green sparkly scene.So is the film worthy of an inclusion in the Bottom 100 or is there more to it than this? Well, I will say it was hard to like the film because the characters were difficult to like, being mostly selfish and underwritten jerks. Of course, it's not like folks watch porn for the plots...and the plot and nudity don't deliver. The film just didn't have enough plot for a mainstream film nor enough nudity for porn. I personally would have preferred the story with less nudity and more character development. Finally, I felt uncomfortable with the juxtaposition of sex with violence. Overall, a film that isn't particularly enjoyable to watch....not so much bad as not.",

Sure, it has some major flaws, but nevertheless I was intrigued and entertained until the last minute. The premise is interesting enough, and the acting is surprisingly good, taken into account that one of the leads is renowned as a porn actor and another one is an equally renowned (if not notorious) pop star.It seems to me that the makers wanted to give this project a certain mysterious and sensual David Lynch or Brian de Palma feel (I hope I don't offend Paul Schrader with this!), and they partly succeeded. It definitely has a fascinating, brooding atmosphere, and the story, with the characters and their sub-plots gradually getting interwoven with each other into an erotic and dangerous web, seemed to build up to a thrilling climax. Well, there's my biggest let-down: this climax just never comes. In fact, it all ends in a disappointing puff, and the lasting impression is that the whole thing just went no-where and lacked real urgency.That's such a pity, because there are some good things to mention too. I loved the settings in the sordid back-streets off Sunset Boulevard, with the dilapidated theaters. The house of Christian is awesome, breathtakingly located in the hills, and the scenes in the house are beautifully photographed. Lindsey Lohan is, in spite of all the hoo-ha and troubles she apparently caused during filming, absolutely convincing in her difficult part. And pornstar James Deen plays main character Christian in my opinion fabulously, extremely sinister and menacing, all the time making you feel that his cold and aloof attitude could explode at any time. I don't know if he does more main-stream movies, he sure should!",

            "content": "I know I shouldn't reference a classic movie while writing about this film but I have to because there's a certain strange connection between both, despite the different outcome each one had. The majority of viewers of \"The Canyons\" might never have heard of \"The Misfits\" (1961), that depressive tale starring Gable, Monroe, Clift and directed by John Huston, a reunion of washed up characters that never seem to do anything right in life, and behind the scenes it was another sad story as well, becoming the final films of Marilyn and Clark, and Monty's career already in ruins, didn't get better later on. Rumor has it, the movie was on TV the day he died, someone asked him if he wanted to see it, to which he replied with a 'no'. Yet that was a marvelous picture and still interesting to watch. What's Paul Schrader movie has to do with it? It's also a story about washed up people (in and off the movie) who try to do something with their lives but only manage to complicate things. Unlike \"The Misfits\", this excuse for a movie is simply dull, hollow and idiotic.The same hands that wrote the great \"American Psycho\" and \"Less than Zero\" are the same that brings this movie to life. Can you believe that? Yep, Bret Easton Ellis tries to deliver a piece involving Hollywood and its nasty schemes of money, power, sex, lies, betrayal and love going out the window. In it, famous producer film Christian (porn star James Deen, trying his big break in conventional films) goes bazoork after finding out that his wife (Lindsay Lohan) is having an affair with Ryan (Nolan Gerard Funk), the leading man he selected to star in his new project. Conflict, or catch some might say: Christian doesn't mind sharing his lovely wife with other partners in orgies and wild parties as long as he's there as well, so it's kind of weird when he reacts in a psychotic way after discovering the affair. \"I love you because I trust you\" he says at the beginning, maybe it's the other way around, I don't know. That side of the story is pure garbage, and the more the film tries to bring sensuality or just throw some sex scene, the more embarrassing it gets. It looks like a lousy carbon copy of a softcore (and trust me, there's softcore flicks with better plot and sexy moments than this thing), the sex is just presented very briefly, with no deep connection with the story, and even the sequences involving nudity are tame, prudishly captured. Whether being a weird drama or a unsexy thriller, \"The Canyons\" doesn't hit right at anything. There's not even a bold or original take into Hollywood way of running things, no critique, no judgment, just the exploitation of us unfortunate viewers.I only (slightly) cared about \"The Canyons\" in the sequences involving Ryan, the young and struggling actor caught in the middle of complicated situations, torn about acting in a good project - but what's it about, anyway? the movie never tells us - and staying with the love of his life, the decadent actress married with Christian, and Ryan also happens to be married. Throughout the film, he spends his time trying to find ways to be in the picture, no matter the consequences (since he's a drop dead gorgeous guy, he's frequently tempted by guys who have power in the business) he fights for that role mostly because it's the only thing for him to do. Gathered here is the ultimate members of the decadent career group: Lohan post-rehab career, another low movie for her; the unlucky director Schrader - his latest ventures are quite troubled, specially with producers who remove the man cause he never delivers the movie they wanted (apparently, that didn't happen here but it happened with the fourth Exorcist and the recent \"Dying of the Light\") but at one time he was a gifted filmmaker and writer; and Ellis, whose script is just another proof that some novelists shouldn't write original film material. Coming out of the porn universe, Mr. Deen proves to be a suitable and good choice for the frightening character he plays, his alpha-male quality was powerful enough to make you believe this guy can do anything he wants and with anyone he wants. A little bit of acting classes and he might have a future in mainstream films. Also from porn, but just doing a bit uncredited part is Danny Wylde who should have a better and bigger cameo. The only ones who escape without injuries are Nolan Funk, quite good in some moments, and one scene stealer Gus Van Sant as Christian's shrink. Just because it's a movie about decadence filled with down and out people that doesn't mean the final project should be like them. The fore-mentioned classic is a clear evidence of this. 3/10",

            "content": "The Canyons lays it's cards on the table right from the beginning. The opening scene introduces the main protagonists right off the bat, a curious tactic that immediately signposts the motivations of all the characters.Tara (Lindsay Lohan) and her rich boyfriend Christian (James Deen) are a couple seemingly living the Hollywood dream. Christian is in the process of cobbling together a low budget slasher movie, using his considerable trust fund in order to break into the film industry. However, the movie's lead, the naive and inexperienced Ryan (Nolan Funk), has a secret that threatens to derail the movie and shatter Tara's relationship with Christian. What follows is a story of suspicion, betrayal and secrets, set in the seedy underbelly of a Los Angeles populated by dream chasers and wanton, predatory selfishness.The first ten minutes tell the audience immediately that we are dealing with shallow and vacuous individuals, grasping at every opportunity in order to satisfy their self serving natures. This presents the main problems that ultimately ruin any chance that The Canyons might have had of being a compelling drama. In order for a drama to succeed where the majority of the characters are simply dreadful, there has to something to engage the viewer. That could be an interesting script, stylish direction or passionate and sincere performances. The Canyons regrettably has none of these to offer the viewer.Bret Easton Ellis' script is quite amazingly dull. It really does give the actors very little to work with. The story line contains an unbelievable series of coincidences, the dialogue would embarrass an amateur dramatics class and the characters have no depth to them at all. Lohan tries gamely to prove her acting chops in some scenes, but the dialogue gives her nothing but tired, predictable lines to try and give some life to. It doesn't help matters any further for her that she spends most of the movie opposite James Deen, a porn star who has little or no real acting experience. He starts the movie off reasonably enough, but by the end his acting becomes forced and clich\u00e9d. Unfortunately, although Deen isn't primarily a dramatic actor, you can't help but feel that a better director could have coached more out of him. However, even he is streets ahead of the ludicrously named Nolan Funk, who gives a vacant, amateurish and dreadfully stilted performance. That leads me to one of the most significant problems that The Canyons suffers from, that being director Paul Schrader.Despite his impressive list of past credits, including directing edgy and challenging projects such as Blue Collar and American Gigolo, as well as writing screenplays for most notably Taxi Driver and Raging Bull, it's made abundantly clear from The Canyons why he doesn't make many movies these days. His style is quite simply outdated and his efforts here show that he has done little to keep up with the changes in modern film making that audiences do not unreasonably expect.The camera-work is creaky and linear, the editing is poor and he overwhelmingly fails to get the best out of an admittedly ragbag collection of actors. You always feel like the crew are in the scene, such are the hackneyed nature of the set ups. For example, many scenes feature an entrance from a character walking into a room with the camera at first at a distance, then either panning across or following them in an unimaginative and linear fashion once it leaves it's previously rigidly static position. Many set ups feel disconcertingly framed, yet they feature hardly anything of interest, lending a stagey, unnatural feel to the proceedings. Strangely, the much talked about sex scenes are so tepid and perfunctory you wonder why they were even bothered with, yet it seems Schrader wanted to elicit some kind of outrageous shock value from them. As they stand, even the actors look rather embarrassed to be in them, even though of course one of them is a porn star.The talky nature of the dialogue also grates even more than it should as the scenes appear disjointed, either being too long or too short, then simply going on to leave the plot devoid of pace and flow. Locations are curiously bland and the cinematography is completely by the numbers. It all feels very much like the work of someone who didn't have any fresh ideas or flair to assist this very oddly assembled cast who were stuck working with such a tepid script. Everything feels very clich\u00e9d and predictable, almost to the point of ridicule.While Lohan's allegedly erratic behaviour on the set of The Canyons has been well documented, she is actually the only member of this motley crew of a cast to show any real acting ability. There are a handful of scenes that serve as reminders that before her life descended into chaos, she was indeed an real talent with great potential. It would therefore be unfair to blame Lohan and point the finger at her, as many have done, for the critical mauling that The Canyons received. The real blame must go to Ellis and Schrader. I find it remarkable that such an empty screenplay would be made into a movie in the first place and Schrader is a director who is squarely stuck in the past, with his best days as an auteur sadly long behind him.It's hard to fathom out to what kind of audience The Canyons was aimed at, as it has contains so little in the way of redeeming features. It all amounts to what is frankly an irrelevant and entirely unessential piece of film making that's unquestionably one to avoid. Unfortunately for Lindsay Lohan, this project should have been one for her to avoid as well.",

            "content": "Written by Bret Easton Ellis, the same literary mastermind behind American Psycho and The Rules of Attraction, you just know there's going to be something great about this film. So what's all the hate? Let's take ourselves back to Tara's dialogue in the film, \"Do you really like movies?\" It doesn't take someone to be part of the actual process of filmmaking or have experience working in the production of one for them to like movies. What's my point? What most people fail to see is that the whole movie is a reflection of the destruction of film as an art form. I'm not saying the movie intended itself to be bad or flawed. It only failed to get its message across because most people are too focused on several other things. This is how \"Film\" degraded as the once highest form of art.We are more interested in the technicalities and we started becoming \"film Nazis\" in our own right. Instead of focusing on the message of the film and how that message is delivered through the art form, we try to base a film's greatness on the sparkling visuals, the \"Meryl Streep\"-ness of an actor's acting ability, and the witty, memorable dialogues. Films have become a spectacle, rather an object of meaning.How did I come up with this outrageous claim? Let's go back to the movie itself (especially for those who have seen it). The story revolves around the main character Tara (Lindsay Lohan) who lives with her producer boyfriend, trust-fund kid Christian (James Deen). As the plot unfolds, you find out that Tara is secretly involved with her ex, Ryan (Nolan Funk), who is still trying his luck as an actor. Ryan's current co-producer girlfriend, Gina (Amanda Brooks), is trying her best to help her boyfriend's dreams come true and make it big. What characters do we have? People who are all in the industry for their own personal gain. No one is actually concerned about the content of the movie they are making.Christian is only on the project so he can show his dad he is doing something with the money. Both Tara and Gina only did their part so they can help Ryan achieve his dreams. Ryan wants nothing but to finally become a big film star and he will do anything to maintain his role in the project. Even the minor characters working on the project expresses their shallow concerns, such as those working on the set only treating actors. The plot in itself shows more concern over the infidelity of Tara and the attempts of Christian to uncover the affair.As viewers, how did we miss the point? We were more concerned on the technicalities of the film. Everyone was dubbing it as Lindsay Lohan's \"comeback.\" People were looking in with utmost scrutiny whether Lohan can pull it off or not after being a tabloid staple. Much attention was also focused on famous pornstar James Deen as he crosses over to mainstream cinema. Can he act at all? Will there be nudity? If there is, how much of it? It also marks Lohan's first time to bare her chest in more than one scene in the film. This also became a news item for several weeks while the movie is in production. Other troubles on set leading to the film's unsure status on its release.The Canyons, is an erotic thriller set in the Hollywood backdrop about a group of narcissistic individuals working on a film project. It has a film noir feel to it and boasts a picturesque opening credits of theaters in various states of destruction. Lohan's performance, in my opinion is better than some of the movies I've seen her in. One great scene to showcase this is when Christian threatens her into an alibi. When Christian says \"That's a good girl\" and she breaks down while trying to compose herself. That was topnotch. James Deen, on the other hand, while not perfect is a surprise as a flat and sinister brat who has deep psychological issues. Nolan Funk has his very visible good and bad moments which contributes to the flaw of the film while Amanda Brooks shines. Bret Easton Ellis' continues his trademark of narcissistic characters and director Paul Schrader brought style to a difficult script. While the opening scene is great, a certain number of scenes undoubtedly require better execution.While not among the greats and not necessarily on par with the worsts, The Canyons is still a movie worth seeing. It's a thriller that displays dominance, power play, and the hazards of discontentment.writelikesundance.wordpress.com",

I kinda appreciate the approach of choosing a porn actor as your leading man but James Deen as Christian mumbles his way throughout the film when his dialogue is calling for him to be more assertive. It's a casting mistake and as a result much of the cast crumbles around him.

            "content": "\"The Canyons\" is probably one of the most talked about low budget indie films ever made thanks to Lindsay Lohan. People aren't talking about her acting work in the film, but her on set antics instead. Since 2004 or so, Lohan has been a tabloid fixture as a Hollywood party girl, and her tabloid profile has only escalated thanks to her brushes with the law, rehab stints, and fame hungry parents. Her personal life eclipsed her acting career and sometimes it's hard to remember that Lohan started out as an actress...a promising one at that! I am a fan of low budget, indie films. Sure, they aren't the best quality, but I find most of them to have interesting concepts and passionate ideas. I love the idea of saying \"fuck the Hollywood studios, let's go film this the way we want to\". That's why I've always enjoyed low budget independent films. They're made out of love, and not made for money. So when I heard about \"The Canyons\", I was of course immediately drawn to it.I just finished watching it, and I'd saying it had a lot going for it, but ultimately fell short of my expectations. For what it was though, I'd say it was a fairly decent film.\"The Canyons\" is a skeleton of a great film, but doesn't have the goods to back it up. It has a neo-noir style/tone but it doesn't stay consistent with it. It's visible in some scenes, but not so much in others. It has a lot of interesting themes about Hollywood, fame, power, and the film industry. It sets-up these interesting themes in the first half hour of the film, but they are never really incorporated into the plot. The script was good, but the story got lost in the relationships/dynamics of the characters. I felt it sort of lost focus halfway through and never found it again. It was enough to keep me interested, but ultimately the film wasn't deep enough to get much of an emotional reaction out of me.Now, onto the acting...obviously having Lindsay Lohan in this brought a great deal of press for the film. Without her, this movie would have been released and nobody would have known about it...it would have faded into indie film oblivion. But what's really interesting is that Lohan not only gave the film publicity, but she actually carries the entire movie! I wouldn't say her acting was astounding, but she did successfully create a great character out of Tara, who otherwise might have come across as underwritten if another actress had played the part. Lohan gives her character a lot of depth and emotion that probably didn't even appear on the page. It is clear that despite all the intense drama that surrounds her on a day to day basis, she still has talent. What sets her apart from other actors, though, is her amazing screen presence. She is no longer the teen beauty queen she used to be back in 2004-2008, but something about her makes you focus all of your attention on her whenever she is on screen. She has a rare gift of commanding a scene no matter what role or what movie. Lohan is clearly a star. She has a horribly notorious and infamous reputation in Hollywood, but she can still act pretty damn well. If she just got her personal life sorted out, she could have a chance at a major comeback.James Deen, on the other hand, has the looks of a movie star, but not the acting chops. In some scenes, he is fine. In others, he is very wooden and, unlike Lohan, fails to give his character depth or layers. Not that he had much to work with, anyways, because his character, Christian, is VERY unlikable. And not in a fun or epic villain kind of way, but in more of a forgettable and wimpy sort of way. Christian has no redeeming qualities at all. The script has Christian written as a fairly one dimensional character, and Deen unfortunately doesn't have the acting chops to bring the character to life or do much with him. Deen was such a bore to watch other than the scenes where he was naked. Deen does not have any charisma or screen presence (again, unless he is naked). He might want to take some acting classes if he wants to continue getting roles outside of porn.Nolan Funk, the other lead who plays Ryan in the film's love triangle, does an adequate job in the film. I think he has a lot of potential and I'd like to see where his career goes from here. I think he has a lot of natural talent.Overall, \"The Canyons\" was not a complete waste of time. I think people are being very hard on it because Lindsay Lohan is in it, but she is honestly the best thing about it. Its biggest flaw was that it was not consistent. Also, casting James Deen in the role of Christian was a mistake because he is simply not talented enough to give a character like that any sort of depth.I think with a better script and a bigger budget, the film could have been great. But there just wasn't any \"umph\" to it.It is worth checking out if you are interested in and can appreciate low budget indie films...otherwise I doubt you'd enjoy it.I give this movie a 5.5 or a 6 out of 10.",

In fact, the entire cast turns out to be better than Lohan in this film. She seems to be there just because of her name. Not only is she horrible at acting, but she looks 45 when she's only 27! I am sure that a high percentage of the male audience for this movie was motivated by the fact that Lohan is showing her breasts. That makes the disappointment even greater. As for the storyline of this movie it is nothing new: it is about jealousy. But the movie fails to present it from a fresh perspective. I give it a 3 because James Deen shows in this movie that he can act.",

            "review_title": "A weak soap opera with few redeeming qualities",
            "content": "This film was intriguing to me for a few reasons. I was curious how Lindsay Lohan fared in this role. As her private life imploded, her career vanished in an instant. Not that I'm a big Lohan fan but she showed promise once and I was curious if that spark was still there. I was also intrigued by the fact that Bret Easton Ellis had written the script and that the film was created on a mere $250,000 Kickstarter budget.A fairly simple (if not somewhat familiar) plot, Christian is a trust fund baby turned movie producer who is in a swinging relationship with Tara. When Christian discovers that the lead actor in his film has a past with Tara and that they are having an affair, he decides that murder is the best way to deal. As another reviewer stated, this film basically felt like one big soap opera. And a weak one at that. The film focuses on the assumptions and dramas that surround the characters but we never see them actually working. In fact, the film only occasionally ventures outside of the characters' impressive apartments/homes so we don't see anything of these characters other than their sordid personal lives. I was unimpressed with Ellis' screenplay. The concept of sleaze, sex, money, violence and apathy has been done to much greater effect in his other works, such as American Psycho and Less Than Zero. With a runtime of 1 hr 40 min, it feels much longer. I found myself fighting to stay invested in the story. I wasn't interested in the characters and the plot was thin. After watching Ellis slam yuppie Wall Street and trust fund baby drug addicts in the previously mentioned films, his trademark of extreme actions performed in an unaffected way when applied to the world of Hollywood and filmmaking felt derivative. We already know Hollywood is heartless and superficial. What's new? The acting, while not bad, wasn't too good either. The dialog seemed rushed, as though the actors were just waiting on each other to finish their lines. Lohan looked tired and bloated and her performance too subdued. I'd like to think Lohan can turn out some quality work but it's difficult to tell from this film, as I just didn't feel she was the right fit for the role and I couldn't tell if it was truly bad acting or just botox and booze that was limiting her range. Nothing yanks me out a film faster than an actor whose face doesn't move. It renders any scene involving expression of emotion ineffective. I've read somewhat positive reactions to James Deen's acting. While I do feel his acting exceeded my expectations, my bar wasn't set very high. Porn actor or not, his performance was better than I expected but still a bit too subtle for me.Funny thing is, for me, I think the film would've been much better if the actors never said a word. I found the cinematography outstanding. Desaturated, washed out images of decrepit, abandoned movie theaters scattered throughout the film and during the end credits were visually stunning. I found myself enjoying the end credits more than the film itself.I haven't yet decided if I disliked the script because of the script itself or because of the acting. Something I've discovered after watching The Canyons is that Ellis' work requires very strong, talented actors. Otherwise, the overall effect is hollow, unconvincing and uninteresting. The characters are detestable and one dimensional. I did wonder for a moment how this film might have been different if it had a Hollywood budget. But then again, one could argue that this film was a big middle finger to the world of Hollywood and the studios.Overall, I wouldn't say this film was a waste of time. The stylized visuals set the mood and feel so if the actors themselves didn't compel, the visuals did. I also stop short of saying the acting was \"bad\". It wasn't good but not bad considering the actors were paid next to nothing. I wouldn't pay to see this but it wouldn't be a total waste if you happen to catch it on cable. Watch it on cable and form your own opinion but I don't feel it's worth shelling out any money.",

View on the film:Despite there being some rather large challenges faced during production, (with Leslie Camila-Rose having to be an understudy for co-producer/lead actress Lindsay Lohan,in case Lohan suddenly decided to not turn up on set!)director Paul Schrader and cinematographer John DeFazio are still able to show an excellent stylised eye for the decaying Hollywood which their characters inhabit.Opening in a bar,Schader and DeFazio use neon lights to give the title an icy atmosphere,as Schader shows the characters cynical,rampant egos to be cold,hard surfaces which are impossible to penetrate.Whilst his fangs have lost some of there (infamous) Black Comedy bite, Brett Easton Ellis still delivers a wonderfully harsh,decaying screenplay.Keeping everyone at the bottom of the Hollywood ladder,Ellis initially shows everyone to be rather complacent with their position in life.As Christian (played by a terrific,smirking James Deem) dangles a shiny future in front of Ryan,Ellis slowly burns away the glossy outer appearance of the characters,to reveal the decaying stench laying within each of them,as Christian makes a gorge in the canyons.",

            "content": "Paul Schrader's \"The Canyons\" plays out as a cautionary tale of producers & actors ambitions gone awry. Porn star James Deen is Christian, an obsessed film executive producer. Performed with much dedication and delight, he is definitely a talent to watch as his presence lights up the screen with a dual vitality of charm amongst the midst of darkness in this sordid story of manipulation, vengeance and greed. When Tara, Lindsay Lohan, crawls her way to a better life via wealthy Christian, she also finds a way to carry along her long time love interest Ryan, Nolan Funk, only to realize that in life and relationships alike, everything comes at a price. Sex is used as the main tool to enact corrective enforcement from Christian as well as Tara. Using this same device, struggling actor Ryan realizes that he must go above and beyond the call of duty if he's to save his principal role in Christian's film. What is to be determined by the protagonists who engage in very sultry situations, is how far they are willing to go to pay for the price of personal and career fulfillment.Everyone has an agenda in this movie. some with plans more evident than others, and when actions don't align the consequences can be severe. A much publicized foursome including LiLo & James Deen and another couple they invite into their bedroom smartly creates a table turning set up that will ultimately plunged the tug of war between the two protagonist Tara & Christian into a surreal, albeit conflicted ending. Actor James Deen beautifully carries the film with a dark charming eloquence as he smoothly enables his obsessive plans into action inconspicuously through anyone surrounding Tara who can be bought or swayed by any means necessary. There are minor technical flaws with sound and focus which by no means are a deterrent to the story Schrader wants to tell. It only becomes a reminder of the limited resources used to bring this independent visions to fruition. Performances from the cast is somewhere between dead serious to campy. This interesting range, some may find it distracting from the story, others may welcome it as an additional oddity within the assaulting feeling of doom and gloom that permeates the picture. The beginning of the film smartly defines the setting and much of the tone of the characters by showcasing once vibrant movie theatres now sadly abandoned defunct venues. This is an allegory that may very well parallel the unforgiving ways of Hollywood and how if left unchecked, unscrupulous cunningness with a bulldozing determination can decay beauty & innocence. That is the case with Tara & Ryan. In a business where the main commodity is the human trade of talent, \"The Canyons\" does succeed in demonstrating a microcosm of real personalities as they struggle to find their voice in a sometimes all consuming illusionary reality created by Hollywood and the ever revolving doors this dream machine creates.review from Entertainment Film News",

            "review_title": "Erotic neo noir",
            "content": "\"The Canyons\" is Hollywood's latest offering in noir genre. This is more akin to the extra marital affair theme. The trailers were very intriguing at first that never seemed to reveal any elements of the plot. The only thing that was depicted was that the film involved the complex relationships between three main characters. From the start I had the doubt that this will not have much in terms of substance or plot. After seeing it my doubts were confirmed. I was disappointed with the lack of narrative.Directed by Paul Shrader, whose previous works such as 'american gigolo, raging bull, and taxi driver received much appraise and he became renowned as a high level director. However I would give the man more due for his writing capabilities as many of his screenplays have been original. Though I feel pity for him seeing that he never won any awards which he truly had deserved. Some of his works may have inspired Abel Ferrara's ideas like 'Ms 45' and 'Driller Killer. This movie doesn't categorise under his speciality but he deserves credit for attempting something that most directors would refuse to do. The theme of adultery in it self is something that many film studios no longer have the interest to invest in. It is a risky venture that has minimum profitability and generates less revenue than big budget movies. It doesn't seem to attract producers neither the audiences. But in this situation if there are established stars mixed with a little erotic and sex, it can go a long way. This film takes a different look at relationships. The common aspects are still existent. There is less emphasis on the female star but more depth to the character of the male. Certain qualities of his are difficult to accept, but here the lead actor is depicted as in obsessive and intelligent individual. It is almost as if the roles have been reversed. It reminds one very much of Michael Douglas from 'A perfect murder'. Very devious and cunning. The elements of affairs, deception and murder are all included in the film. However there was an opportunity to do more with the script. But I guess with the limited budget there was restrictions with the plot. The film is very straightforward. There is mystery to solve. What is intriguing is how each character is developed and the interactions and relations they have with one another. This is the unique element of the movie. They play mind games and try to conceal link ups they have. The screenplay has been written by Bret Easton Ellis who is formally renowned for his famous 'American Psycho' novel and many others., which was adapted to the screen in hilarious fashion. I appreciated his 'Informers' that came across as shocking for it's self destruction content. This enabled me to understand Bret's imagination more. He prefers to dwell in to the psyche of the individual rather than telling a story. He seems to have a very negative view on human behaviour. Although I could agree on some of his perception of people. But he seems to depict the entertainment industry and struggling celebrities as people who are hungry for sex to achieve fame. I would agree on certain elements of his thoughts. But how about showing the industry in positive light?. It is almost as if he is trying to send a message out to people. Initially I thought 'The Canyons' was based on one of his novels, but it turned out to be a fresh screenplay. I was surprised to say he has done a commendable job. His style is very reminiscent of his novels. There is nothing new in terms of a plot but the highlight of the film is the interactions and conversations that the characters have with one another. And I was very keen to see how this would end.As I mentioned, this is not a movie to admire for it's plot. But what is unique are the performances and the dialogues the actors have with one another. Breat Easton has managed to depict another side of the human mind. Here people are portrayed as ambitious individuals who will go to any extent to achieve their dreams and ambitions. I found Christian's character to be quiet hard to believe. He seemed to have double standards having open relationships with other women, but was hostile when he discovers Tara seeing someone. This makes it difficult to a certain extent to accept him. In relation to the climax he neither takes the typical form of revenge, but instead his alternate action is understandable. It reminded me very much of what Richard Gere had done when he discovered his wife was seeing somebody in 'Unfaithful'. Once again as in a majority of neo noir films the female is portrayed as the innocent victim. Tara is selfish but desiring to reacquaint a relationship with somebody from the past was absurd. However I would not say I was dissatisfied with the ending. It was just a surprise.This film marked the debut of adult film star James Deen. He seemed very convincing and gave an honest performance. Initially I was curious to see how he would act in a mainstream film. I was surprised that his screen presence was suitable on camera. But in the end his psychotic behaviour seemed overrated. Lydnsey Lohan gives possibly the best performance of her career to date. Many film audiences have criticised her acting for being below standard. But here she proves them wrong. Overall the film has nothing new to offer in terms of plot. This may be a issue for some, but instead it gives a different perspective on relationships. The entire film has a 50's atmosphere. Perhaps if shot in black and white it could have had a different outcome. The erotic scenes may encourage some to see it.",

Boredom is too subjective, what I find interesting you might find boring. So, back to the film which I loved (but some may consider boring!) Lack of strong narrative flow will be a problem for some and the slightly stilted dialogue takes a few minutes to get used to ( James Deen's fast talking is also problematic at first). Overall, though this is most engaging and a highly pertinent look at just how we are all engaging with one another. More and more of our lives are either monitored by others or advertised willingly by ourselves and there is less and less free and private space. This inevitable means that when people actually engage face to face there is more than a little strain caused by all the other 'engaging' going on electronically. This film presents an exhilarating look at a small group of people struggling within this environment we have created and managing not too well. Somehow I have missed all the hype surrounding the career of Lindsay Lohan and barely recognised her. James Deen I knew only what I had read regarding this movie and his porn stuff. I have to say, however, that both are most persuasive in this. Deen's is a mighty performance and considering the low budget environment of this film, probably as good as anything his namesake achieved in his short life. Lohan is also a revelation, oozing charisma despite the achingly evident fragility. Nothing like as much sex and violence as you may have been led to expect but enthralling and even exciting in the way it engages in such a raw and intense manner, whilst, it has to be said, remaining beautifully shot and stylish to the end.",

And for sure, Lindsay has two beautiful arguments well displayed in this movie and foremost the character that goes with them: nude shower, sex with a porn-star and a group sex orgy!I think this movie looks a lot like her real life as she likes to have fun, to party and to have sex with whoever but fails to find yet her charming prince ! Anyway, after Laurel and Mulholland, it's also another LA canyon where very hot things happen!! Like Jackie Collins, this movie helps to discover the real (sex obsessed) Hollywood and not the one they want us to believe!",

Lindsay's acting isn't bad. It's actually good, at least in parts. It is Lindsay who looks so phony herself; she's difficult to look at with cheap uneven hair extensions and hard makeup. Her face looks puffed up. She works pretty hard at throwing away her career. I can't understand why she did this.What got my attention was a guy who takes off his pants for a full-frontal view of him, not a quick view, maybe five seconds or so, while he moves around with his jewels exposed, followed by Lindsay taking off her top to show her boobs, and a third guy going down on her on the sofa while the naked man has his way with himself. Yuck and ick.The first thing wrong with the movie is the script. None of the dialog is clever. No witty banter, and there should be, because the only thing to this movie is dialog....and some boring sex. Not much action. Just a little. There is only one storyline going on. A good script will have several mini-plots interwoven into the main plot. Here is the gist of it that is revealed early in the movie: Will he or won't he catch her cheating, and what will he do about it? This should be a sub-plot, not the main story.These actors looked like soap actors or waiters, not that I have a thing against either. All the cast seemed to be roughly the same age. I'm attempting to explain why the cast of men seems generic to me. A pug nose with a good head of hair and some muscles will get you into this movie if you don't mind saying the F-word 20 or 30 timesThe music is pretty funny as well. I confess to watching this movie for the fun of it.

How about the fact that you cast a porn star as one of your leads? There's one reason. James Deen gives you a performance here that is no different than what he gave you in \"Anal Buffet 8\" (not making that up folks). I half expected him to show up at Lindsay Lohan's door in a pizza delivery uniform. The other lead, Nolan Gerard Funk, was slightly better than Deen...slightly. Here's another reason for the hate. The script was dismal. Christian(Deen) and Tara(Lohan) are living together in a huge house in LA where they enjoy, or at least Christian does, an open relationship where Christian gets his meat and two veg off sharing Tara with other men. When he finds out that Tara is having an affair with the lead in a movie he is financing(Funk), he goes nuts. Huh? Christian has Tara followed everywhere and starts messing with Funks's character by hacking his bank account and pretending to have him replaced in the movie. At this point Christian is in firm control over Funk's character and Tara. So much so that he decides to murder Funk's ex girlfriend?! Say what? To top it all off, he confesses to Tara that \"something happened\" to this poor girl and needs an alibi. All this while Tara is trying to break off the relationship. Christian is of course upset that Tara is leaving...I think...You know, I couldn't tell. That's how good Deen is here. I won't give away the ending because I had no idea what the heck happened at the end...yeah. To summarize, this movie had terrible acting, a ridiculously bad story and dialog fit for Deen's main profession. Don't see it, really.

            "content": "Lindsey Lohan's huge return to the big screen after her sixth stay in rehab for addiction problems in 2013, did not revitalize her career at all. If anything, this low budget independent motion picture directed by Paul Schrader probably killed what left of it. Without spoiling too much of this Hollywood manipulative and scheming thriller, the plot written by Bret Easton Ellis is supposed to be about a sleazy sex fiend young trust fund movie producer Christian (Brian Sevilla AKA James Deen) learning of a secret affair between his girlfriend Tara (Lindsey Lohan) and the lead actor of his film project Ryan (Nolan Gerard Funk), resulting into his psychological and sexually-charged breakdown; however the themes of sex, control and obsession was not well delivered. Things happen way too quickly without much breathing room. Look I get that the rough cut of the film was 1 hour 44 minutes long, but there were some certain moments that need to dragged to show realistic crock pot emotional brewing. After all, themes like Christian's love/hate struggle with homosexual come across as half heated somewhat left out microwave melodrama that barely had any deep connection to the main story. Then there are other scenes that are not needed that goes a little too long. Such the case of the long drawn out shot of Ryan visiting his visiting his bartender's job and getting hit on. It has little to do with the main plot. Because of that, the film pacing was a bit off. Also, everything is told in badly told over wordy exposition dumps rather than just shown. This wouldn't be much of a problem if the dialogue was a little slyer. Yet it wasn't. None of them were really that memorable. To add onto that, the way these talking sequences were shot is highly distracting with UPS trucks about to plow into them at a restaurant table before turning or focusing the camera in another scene on background characters mouthing silence sentences as the main people speak. It's so bizarre. If that wasn't bad enough, the acting is also not really that good. Lohan really gives a dead eye bland, uninteresting performance throughout most of the film. Little emotional depth. It's clear that the former child actress's mind is on other things such as partying with Lady Gaga that often cause her to miss shoots than bringing the snobby golddigger unfaithful Tara to life. Her repeated absences got so bad that Schrader had French actress Leslie Coutterand on call throughout the entire shoot to replace Lohan at a moment's notice. Even when she did show up. She would drink, both on camera and behind the scenes. Allowing her to do that on set probably wasn't the best for her. She really seemed wasted or suffering from a hungover in certain moments of the film. It doesn't help that Lohan felt very uncomfortable with the nudity and the sex scenes. Having the director show his junk on set to come down her nerves probably make it worst. Getting a lot of Harvey Weinstein-like vibes here. No wonder why she never helped promote the film with Schrader afterwards. As for her onscreen counterpart, James Deen. the director was just as mad at the actor with his absences to shot porn during production. Yet his performance was surprisingly decent that the director forgave him, even if Deen's role in this movie is not that far off from what he used to do as a former pornstar. I guess he projected just the right amount of cocky sex appeal with an edgy demanding tone as Christian. I kinda do see it even if the trust fund baby wasn't as much as a pathological control freak as people within the story make him out to be. Still the character is really nothing new. After all, Ellis been writing for years deliberately unlikable completely unsympathetic and borderline sociopathic rich people who engage in self-destructive behavior that it became a common trope. Many of Christian's action felt clich\u00e9s such as attacking people with knives while having threesome. We seen this done better in the way better horror film 2000 'American Psycho'. Christian felt like low budget Patrick Bateman. Better yet the leftover troll remarks that Ellis doesn't write on Twitter. As for Ryan. Nolan's acting works as we really do see glimpse of his character's over submissive behavior. Yet like Tara. Ryan is a terrible person not worth rooting for. The only courteous character in the film is the na\u00efve Gina played well by Amanda Brooks whom tries her best to help everybody. I know the movie is called 'The Canyons' as the movie is supposed to be about people within Hollywood sink to new depths of awfulness, but it sucks that we the audience never got to see a happy ending for her. In the end, two versions of the film are now available: the normal version and unrated director's cut which feature a minute of additional footage of a guy masturbating. In truth, both are not really worth watching. Overall: While Lohan's reputation in the media did hurt the motion picture. The movie was still badly made. It sucks because it could had been a powerful film about the magnitude of the troubles within Hollywood when it comes to sexual harassment. Yet it doesn't work that way. Even the metaphor of the decay of the American Dream with the all the shots of the rundown theaters didn't quite land with most people. It didn't get through. In the end, this movie was rough around the edges. Mostly empty and void of life. A true canyon of a film.",

            "content": "Bret Easton Ellis is probably the most misunderstood author in the United States. His characters are often described as flat and uninspiring. Their story lines are described in much the same way. And yet, he still remains the same writer, as Norman Mailer described with the 1991 release of American Psycho, that 'shows older authors where the hands on the clock come to.' The Canyons is no exception. Ellis is the screenwriter for the film alongside longtime writer/director Paul Schrader (Taxi Driver, Affliction). After viewing the film, I was surprised to see it was almost universally panned. But it didn't take long for me to remember the history of Ellis and his critics. Evidently, the deliberate work of Schrader was still not enough to help them see the hands on the clock.The film's plot involves the relationship between two couples living in Hollywood. One couple is made up of the boyish, aspiring actor Ryan (Nolan Funk) and his dedicated girlfriend Gina (Amanda Brooks). The other are the subversive, mover-and-shaker Christian (James Deen) and his masochistic girlfriend Tara (Lindsey Lohan). Gina knows Christian and pulls some strings to help Ryan get a role in a low-budget horror film. Right off the bat, it is made clear who is corrupt and who has maintained some level of innocence. The line drawn between these two qualities isn't as bold as the film continues.The film was shot well and the acting was fittingly detached. Schrader is known for being psychologically penetrating and, contrary to many other critics, I believe he shines in his direction here. The mistake commonly made when viewing (or reading) the work of Ellis is to expect his character's intricacies to be spoon fed to you. Much is implied in the dynamics of their interaction. Their unrelenting one-dimensionality is what makes them compelling. Why do they care so much about material gain and power, in spite of the extreme pain it causes them? Or better yet, why do we? The answer is in the mirror. This is the territory Ellis's characters enter. And it is a place where, if we look closely, we might see what time it is, if we don't cringe and automatically dismiss its relevance in the wake of our confusion.",

While \"The Canyons\" managed to hold my attention throughout (a topless Lindsay Lohan at seemingly every opportunity doesn't hurt), it never really compelled me. It was kind of like watching a TV show when nothing else was on. Probably the main failing of the film, and I'm unsure whether it was the acting, writing, or directing (I'm thinking the directing), was that the main character of Christian played by James Deen was in no way scary, crazy, or psychopathic, despite the fact that he was supposed to be. I can't help but think of that other Ellis vehicle \"American Psycho\" where Christian Bale and the director of that film made a highly compelling case of psychosis. If Bale and that director were transplanted into \"The Canyons\" in place of Deen and Schrader, we very well may have had a minor success, instead of a film that was almost universally panned. I was going to really slam Paul Schrader's directing skills until I saw the budget. Now I'm reconsidering. On a dollar/goodness ratio the movie seems a bit remarkable. There are multi-million dollar movies that I would never willingly sit through again, but I could probably be convinced to give \"The Canyons\" another spin someday. All that being said, I do think the film suffers from poor production, bad music, and I still don't think Paul Schrader is a very good director.I'm not privy to what sort of machismo made Ellis/Schrader/The producers decide that $250K was enough to make this movie, but they were wrong, and end product suffered as a result. There is a sub- theme that kind of cast derision on the entire film industry and Hollywood itself, and it seems like this bled through into the production itself. The irony is that such an attitude makes it impossible to actually make a successful film, and it begs the question to the aforementioned group: \"why even bother?\"",

Bankrolling this slasher film to be made in Mexico Christian had Rayn picked for the leading role as the slasher.

Still pulling the string Christian uses Jon's internet expertise to clean out Ryan's bank account, all $15.12 worth, leaving him penniless and causing his relationship with both Tera and present girlfriend Cynthia, Tenille Houston, to brake up. Not only that he frames Rayn for Cynthia's murder that he in fact committed! ***SPOILERS*** The movie was about a spoiled brat, Christian, who always had everything go his way and when he didn't he struck out with deadly force at those who were in his way and didn't go his bidding. It was poor Cynthia who ended up getting the worst of it by paying the ultimate price, her life, for not staying with him despite his obvious deteriorating mental condition. As for his surviving girlfriend Tara I can imagine what her life will be like with this crazed and power addicted lunatic breathing down her pretty neck.

So for that simple reason alone, the Canyons was a giant success. There are many box office bombs that are brilliantly filmed with a moral message, but bottom line, they failed to find an audience or make a profit. Lindsay Lohan is the only reason why one would want to watch this movie. Millions have paid to watch and Millions have googled certain images of this movie. The Canyons is an example of a Lifetime Movie with nudity. With that said, it is hard to consider the Canyons a good or even a serious movie. Everything about this movie is hard to watch. The acting, the directing, the storyline, and the movie's overall message to the audience. The \"magical movies\" which Lohan's character talks about is lost among the audience. I believe the Canyons does represent how Hollywood has been to many people. After all, the Canyons is located in the city of Lost Angels. A canyon after all is a giant hole, an abyss. The Canyons comes across as a \"cry for help\" of a movie that talks about how people have been victimized by the movie industry and by the people in that industry. The Canyons covers: sex, physical & mental abuse, murder, drugs, prostitution, homosexuality, manipulation, with failed therapy, failed love, failed relationships, failed dreams and the movie industry that is somehow connected to all this. The hundreds of closed cinemas is an attempt to showcase the reality of where dreams were once present. And in the middle of all this is Lindsay Lohan, whom, is a survivor but an overall victim of this industry. In the end, everyone in the cast has been used and has lost their innocence. From Disney to pornography, the journey of these characters who came to Hollywood for the magic of the movies are left on the side of the road. They live surrounded in fear and regret. Like a failed audition, they are over looked and passed by where no one has chosen them and no one wants them to be apart of the movie. Sadly, the taboo issues of sex draws the movie's only audience. There are no powerful acting performances or amazing cinematography that will attract a non bias audience to judge the Canyons for what it truly is. The hidden message the Canyons gives can only be understood by the ones who have been jaded by Hollywood.",

They don't act, at some parts they look like they are reading the lines.And what happened to the camera ? it shakes all the time, is that a new trend, low budget or just bad professionals ?The only thing i liked was the soundtrack, really well chosen and right for what was happening on the screen.I like the writing of Bret Easton Ellis, but this story was kind of a mess.Mr. Schrader, i hope to see a good movie from you, the next time.",

Except that it is (almost) not a movie about movie people, contrary to what said Schrader (who mocks the person who asked him what his film dealt with), but a critique of modern youth (there goes Ellis) and its digital alienation. The film industry it is supposedly taking place in is a pretext here and all the shots of abandoned film theaters dotting the story may be the prophetic vision of an artist sensing that his means of expression will soon see its classic format (the silver screen) disappear forever. For in The Canyons, the protagonists cannot communicate otherwise than lying to those they \"love\", but above all they cannot take off their eyes and fingers of their smart-phones screens. These terminals, housing both the existence of their owners, but also allowing them to follow all their past and present \"friends\" (through sms, emails, social networks, applications to find f**k buddies) are for Schrader the emulators of the paranoia and jealousy of his characters. And, finally, all the shenanigans that these people can do remain more entertaining to fill their life than making a film or even than sitting in a theater to watch one.",

The characters spend a lot of time getting out of cars, walking up to a door to enter and find someone in a room. And the worst people for the leads were picked, probably because they were so well known as celebrities but not quite as much in the acting department. James Deen has 200 porn films, Lindsey Lohan 200 appearances on SNL and probably as many substance abuse incidents. The scripter, Bret Easton Ellis, should go to an unplug camp for internet junkies and stay a year where he can write five minutes of film without the actor talking on a cellphone or picking up a laptop. No doubt Deen and Lohan just needed a career SOS on their resumes, with him getting old and her running out of acting work. They do well in spite of the dull pacing. Christian is a tyrant director jealous his girlfriend (Lohan) is seeing another guy, the lead in his film, so he knocks off a girl who knows a scandal in his past. He seems to have gotten away with murder and you'll think so did those who churned out this tripe. Agents need to stay out of producing films.",

You actually get to like her character and get to bond with Tara as you watch her struggle with Christian and Ryan. James Deen did a good job, too.2. Good photography. It was nothing spectacular but it looked pretty decent for an Indie movie which has a low budget.3. Even if the movie was boring at times, it kept you wanting to know what was going to happen next. A hook is needed in every movie, and The Canyons does not fail here. You what to understand the story and you want to know how the movie ends.4. The Canyons, even with a lot of weak points (direction, editing, script) is fresh, unconventional, edgy and, after all, that's what an indie movie should be so it fulfilled my expectations.5.The ending leaves you wanting more, you don't expect that to be the end, and I think that's wonderful.Overall, it's a good movie, y'all should watch it, just remember to focus on the movie and NOT on it's controversy and media reception.",

            "content": "It's the year of rutting apparently. Big name acclaimed directors are making B films - Refn's Only God Forgives and Shrader's The Canyons but the works are alive with cinematic life.Let's not be snooty about the specifics of how a film was made or who is in it or who made it. If any of that influences your opinion, it is prejudice. The proof of the pudding is in the eating and watch the film and then form your opinion.The script by noted misanthropist Bret Easton Ellis is actually pretty good as it lays out a web of lies and deceit that swirl amongst its compact and well defined set of characters. All are extremely vapid and soulless, all of these people have sold their souls, they are the so called \"Hollywood\" people that this film wanted to satirize and the film at least successfully nails the inhumanity or the disconnection that can entrenched in people when they suffer from ennui. Think Michangelo's L'Avventura but without a PHD degree.At the center of this web, we have a genuinely sympathetic turn by Lindsay Lohan who gives a strong performance as a lost soul who at least had a shred of decency that the other characters lacked.James Deen, the porn star, is actually used for his acting and delivers a dead eyes performance not unlike that of Christian Bale in American Psycho. He's another one of Ellis grade A psychos.Perhaps surprisingly, another lead emerges in the film in the form of Nolan Funk who also gives a good performance as the other lost soul caught in this unwilling game of cat and mouse.The direction is strong and the film is indeed well shot and credibly performed. There is a looseness about the enterprise that befits the picture and I am sure is entirely intentional. There is almost a reluctance in the film-making for tightness or neatness and perhaps a rigorous embrace of casualness that some people might mistake for amateurish film-making.A tight and perhaps what is called an A picture could be made out of this - it would have higher production values and a bigger name cast, but that would be besides the point - THAT would have been ordinary. In its current form is the film truly what it wants to be, a completely non precious portrayal of an industry and culture in the grip of vapidity and mental shutdown.The resolution of the script didn't quite please me but as the film stands, the film is competently made and absolutely worth your time.",

If you didn't know the pedigree of the players you would think this was a first film by a pair of twentysomethings. Perhaps, that's where Schrader was on the money with his complaint that SXSW should have included them in their line-up. I suspect Canyons was rejected by SXSW b/c in so many ways its an unintentional parody of the type of crap Indies that SXSW loves to show. The kind where the acting is awful, barely any plot, no style and the characters blah blah blah about nothing. The blah blah talk reminded me of that awful SXSW film, The Weekend. Jimmy Deen is terrible. He delivers his lines in a monotone too quickly. The only shining light is Lohan and poor baby, some of the camera angles and makeup choice are just unkind.

Did she look in a mirror before she walked in front of the cameras?

Deen wisely underplays it, with considerable subtlety, avoiding any suggestion of camp and thereby becomes quite realistically and quietly menacing. These two actors carry the film with enough skill to make it believable. In some ways reminiscent of \"Gone Girl\", but far more effective and meaningful than that over-rated, far more popular film.

With the amount of graphic nudity shown by the two male actors, and in particular Deen, I can understand Lindsy's protests during production, as this has the potential to tar her reputation as a porn actor, rather than lift Deen's image. By media reports, if Deen behaves in real life as he does on film (one of LiLo's protests), then I can also understand her concerns and having days where she does not want to show up.With everything so vague and by the end of the show, I could not make out what was the goal of the whole movie.

Actually as bad as she is, she's not even close to being the lowest on the acting scale here. Deen is terrible, but I guess he wasn't really hired for his speaking skills.

And, even though I knew it could have been better, I didn't entirely regret the experience. Because, somewhere buried deep within the screenplay, is actually quite a good little film.It's written by (American Psycho-famed) Brett Eastern Ellis, who specialises in showing us shallow, rich, decadent characters. Therefore, don't expect to particularly identify or relate to any of the leads. It's about a rich young man who has links to the film industry. He starts to suspect that his girlfriend is having an affair and sets about destroying his potential rival.Its plot is nothing special, but, there must have been a way of getting a little more intrigue out of it. However, all you have is beautiful people, wandering in and out of equally beautiful (or actually quite sleazy) locations, having conversations and then moving on to the next.Yes, despite being pretty short on action, it definitely had a 'vibe' to it. It was certainly raw, as if it was filmed on video without much thought going into the shots' framing or lighting. If you've seen David Lynch's Mullholland Drive, then you'll know the kind of haunting atmosphere which was created here (only minus the supernatural element). That's the main reason I stuck with it. The film was genuinely creepy, showing us much of the seedy underbelly of L.A.It's a hard film to watch, especially during the first two halves, as little excitement is contained within. If you're looking forward to the sex scenes, they've been somewhat exaggerated and you can probably find better on Youtube!

For this reason I felt I really had to give this a watch.First off, I'd have to say that this move had potential. If they could have replaced some of the cast with actors who could deliver a line with some semblance of believability, it would have had a chance. Surprisingly James Deen was not terrible. Perhaps also surprisingly, Lindsay Lohan was pathetic. I'm not a huge fan of hers, but I've seen her act before and not like this. If this role had been early in her career I'd guess she may not have had one.The plot was weak, and I don't have to warn of spoilers here as there wasn't really any mystery to solve. The second last scene was painful simply because the lines were so poorly delivered. The director couldn't have been present, or maybe he was as high as the actors likely were. I've seen better acting in high school plays.The last scene was funny--there was a clever musical climax to tell you that something shocking happened, but nothing did.The \"sexy\" scenes were decidedly not sexy at all. In fact I don't think I've ever been this utterly NOT titillated by nudity in a film.All in all, I'm glad I watched it just to say that I did, and to know what I didn't miss.

No, not because we all have people like these characters in our lives - we don't and we wouldn't be able to stand being near these sleaze-balls - but because in this movie ABSOLUTELY NOTHING INTERESTING HAPPENS. Just like an average day.People argue, sit around, have dinner, argue, talk to one another, make snide comments to friends, sit around AND argue. Nothing intriguing happens, it's just status quo. You see, most writers write stories and movies with interesting and novel tales both realistic and fantastic to grab and maintain the attention of movie-goers. These writers chose not to even attempt to tell an interesting story. I have to respect that. Bold and risky.Lohan comes off as sedated and keeps her clothes on for the most part (not that there is anything left to see). The other actors are forgettable. The male lead is a porn actor and it shows in his acting.The worst part is the ending. There is no ending. The movie just stops abruptly. Who green-lit this? Anyway, this movie is like a boring episode of a reality show. Skip it.",

May not look like much, but there definitely was.\nPeople can be harsh with their judgements, so I will say no, the acting is not terrible, realistically. I mean come on, there are waaay worse movies for bad acting out there. At least their was real ambition behind these actors.\nSome reviews say the dialogue is bad. I didn't think it was. It was cringy at times, and I wish they didn't say \"babe\" as much, but it wasn't hard to listen to.\nSome parts of the movie have really professional looking shots, yet it is balanced out with home-made looking shots - but honestly, watch this movie in black and white, and the quality goes up. It helps make the movie more artsy. I swear, b&w makes everything look better.\nThe music is unique. I get the vibe.\nBut lets get real people, Lindsay was pretty great in this. She held the film together. I really enjoy her acting, and she had some great moments in this (crying scenes in particular). Lindsay held her own, and I thought it was a great role to see her play.\nSo in conclusion, if you're a Lohan fan, I think you'll enjoy it. It's really not as bad as people make it out to be. There's so much worse.",

When I was watching the movie I wasn't really thinking about it and at the end I thought it was one of the worst movies ever. But then I started to think about it ...I think the movie reflects modern society, because we all suffer from a lack of conversation and lust for material things. It's all about the money, which is shown really good through Tara and Ryan. As I understood, Ryan loves Tara and he is trying to get her back, but even though her new life with Christian doesn't have a meaning and it seems that she loves Ryan as well, she won't give up her new life, just because of money and luxury. Her relationship should't even be called relationship because it is as pathetic as it could be. On the other hand Ryan really loves Tara which shows through the movie, like when she tries to save her from Christian and also in the end when he already knows that he will never get her, he still cares about her (at least that's how I understand the end). Anyway, I think that people should think about this movie and the message that it gives us since we don't even realize that we are all surrounded by pathetic and empty relationships (which shows in empty movie theaters). P.S. I think that the music they have chosen really suits the movie, so another plus.",

It is painful to see how the promising actress Lindsay Lohan has degraded herself through this movie, which she also co-produced.The movie is littered with Nudity and sex scene almost with regular intervals. I guess the storyline became much more weirder to accommodate for the intended spicing up. Their idea of spicing up is to include, straight, orgy, lesbian and gay sex all in one movie and then also add flashes of nudity to keep your attention going.I guess, I said a lot about sex and nudity in this film. But that is only for the reason that there is nothing else in this movie... and trust me, the sex and nudity is not sexy as well.The last nail in the coffin was the ending of this film. I have never seen ending line this... just does not make any sense whatsoever!

If you have an appreciation of indie/artist films then you will most likely like this film. Some of the camera shots are beautiful and although the script isn't top notch it is still good enough that you don't think \"what are they even talking about right now?\" I don't recommend it to people with high morals in regards to nudity as it can be quite shocking at times, but overall this is an amazing film.",

And from my viewpoint, Lohan did a decent job, as did James Deen. In the context of a so called thriller without the thrills, both actors did what they could and did it okay. It just that the story was lousy, once again proving no one can save a bad script.From the opening and closing credits, highlighted by the sight of several closed and ruined cinemas (haven't figured out the symbolism with the story), you're left wondering when something is going to happen or is this just another Hollywood wanabe story.Then when something terrible does happen and the guilty party just about admits his guilt, the cops never nab him and the film ends with Lohan's lovelorn suitor that much more lovelorn.

And that was the way I was throughout the movie. I was just waiting for that moment to say, now here we go, but I never did. A film full of emptiness and not really going anywhere.

All four leads give decent (somewhat uneven) performances, with Lohan and Deen showing flashes of higher ability. There are some tense scenes of man on man action to keep things interesting. Sex scenes are not played for eroticism, but rather as chilled, impersonal interactions and playing fields of psycho-sexual mind games. The memorable, menacing electronic score sets a fine pace for the story to unfold. I wouldn't call this a comeback for Lohan, but it's definitely a big step in the right direction towards legitimacy. My only (minor) complaint would be the sound of her voice when she's crying.. her off-putting, asthmatic squeals do her no favors.

James Deen made me laugh every time he spoke... He sounded like a \"Californian\" from the SNL skit. That other couple was completely dumb, so I guess the actors must've hit it out of the park.

Schrader is old school and deserves to be taken with the weigh of what he has done before. The cinematography is incredible too. Why this film is getting 20 percent at RT and 4/10 in IMDb makes me concerned any film that dares to throwback to 70s/80s styles of movie-making are doomed.

            "content": "THE CANYONS is a film done on the cheap. Financed by rattling the tambourine on Kichstarter, soliciting actors on another website to work for scale, and mostly borrowing existing locations. The reason: Lindsay Lohan, the only \"nomenclatura\" in this production - and the co-producer eager to revive her movie career, was so notoriously into drugs and dodgy behavior that no investors or insurance companies would touch this project. Her co-star is Bryan M. Sevilla, who rejoices in the screen name of James Deen and has attained ephemeral fame in skin flicks ... the press kit dares to say that The Canyons is his first non- porn movie, but that's a fib; The Canyons is just pricier porn.This movie was filmed and then re-edited ruthlessly. There were hopes that it would do well at Sundance or some other film festival, but no such luck. As far as I know, it stained only a few theater screens and then went to DVD and cable.Originally intended as a thriller, this ends up as a noir study of life among over-indulged youthful Hollywood sociopaths. Christian (Deen) is a young Hollywood millionaire, and Tara (Lohan) is his girlfriend, and at various times Christian takes Tara out to restaurants to meet with people who would like him to throw money at their movie projects. If things seem promising, Christian invites these people to his fabulous house in the Hollywood canyons (this was actually rented from the architect who built it), where he throws a little drink-and-drug party with Tara the door prize for all participants. Tara puts up with this because she hopes that someday Christian will keep his promise to make her a star, and even so Christian is cheating on her with Cynthia (Tenille Houston), whom he treats every bit as badly as he treats Tara. There is some back and forth between Tara and her former boyfriend, Ryan (Nolan Funk), and Cynthia, about Christian's pathological behavior, but the simple fact is that Christian is the one with the money and presumably the power. Every now and then we are shown a shuttered old movie house to tell us that the movie industry (as distinct from maybe cable TV) is dying and so are Tara's hopes. Before it's over we find out that even Christian's family keeps him at a safe distance, a fact that would be significant for the others to know.The one remarkable feature in this film is a couple of glimpses of Lindsay Dee Lohan barefoot all over. She was 27 when this was filmed - but she looks closer to 37 and that was not intentional. If this was supposed to be a mystery, the mystery is why they bothered to make this movie. I would suggest several other movies for stories about drugged up sociopaths such as TRAINSPOTTING.",

As one reviewer said, everyone in the film keeps referring to her as exceptionally beautiful and very very sexy, it would have been good to see a different actress in the role. Lohan's face was very puffy, her lips had a trout pout and her hair extensions were very poorly done, straggly and obviously attached. I guess that sounds horribly bitchy of me, but given the script I kept gazing at her in fascination thinking that everyone else in the film must be on drugs.James Deen does a fine job of sinister detachment, and the usual B.E.E. stereotype of rich, emotionally detached, scarred male screwing with people. I find B.E.E.'s characters very difficult to empathise with, but I think that's the point.All in all, I liked the dreamy quality of the film. The sex scenes are a bit offcentre which is interesting. I liked the boarded up cinemas and the beautiful, cold houses.There were a few things I didn't understand about the plot, and I haven't found an answer for online: the final scene doesn't make much sense. I was left thinking Did Ryan manipulate the whole thing? Did he provoke Christian knowing he would lash out and murder Cynthia? Are the two men engaged in some wider battle? Why did Christian let Tara go? I feel like I am missing something, but I'm not sure what. Write back if you know.",

Without any narration to fill in the gaps, it is just sparse, monotonous dialogue and shots of the scenery. The Canyons tries to emulate the characteristics of American Psycho or Less Than Zero, but with no insight into the characters minds like we would get in a novel, it falls incredibly flat. Tara is a one-dimensional character, a woman who men become obsessed with, but we're given no reason why this is so. We don't know anything about her by the end of the film. The same is true of all of the other characters.Ellis deals in superficiality, but somehow this film fails to tap into the tone of quiet desperation that makes his written work so compelling. The direction, also, tries *too* hard to remind us that these characters represent a hundred or more different people - from the opening scene where the camera focuses on the people *not* speaking, to several shots throughout where heads and faces are deliberately cut out of the frame. I understand the rationale behind it all, but unfortunately, with the film trying so hard to keep its characters faceless and shallow, it's easy to end the film wondering what the point of watching it was.For what it's worth, the acting is fine.

            "content": "So this was a notorious project because of the presence of the notorious Lindsay Lohan.\n\nThe thing is it is not a horrible movie. It's not a great movie for sure and someone else would have been better in the role LL plays in the movie, type wise, but she's OK if a bit sad and puffy looking, not great for someone in her mid-20s. But maybe on second thought appropriate for the role of a fading Hollywood woman with a very dim future.\n\nIt turned out the most notorious person in the movie is the male lead, James Deen. He came from porn where he performs bisexually, I have not seen any of these movies. He is one of the few contemporary male porn performers with name recognition. The gossip goes that he was brought into the project via Bret Easton Ellis who wanted him.\nHe is a little weak but good enough in the role even though there was no reason that a porn actor had to do this, there is not that much sex on screen in the movie. He does bring a definite smarminess to the role. I kept seeing him in Overexposed: The Anthony Weiner Story.\nAnyway, he plays a bratty LA mega trust fund guy who produces movies. Lohan plays his girlfriend who is basically doing what Charlie wants which is mostly be involved with hook-ups with other people which he likes to record on his phone. They have an encounter in which she gets him to do something with another man and around the same time he thinks that she is seeing someone else who he doesn't know about. All this causes a blow out of his need to control her resulting in nasty wayward brutal emotions.\n\nThe question is: Is James Deen basically playing himself and are the nasty scenes in the film, brutality to women, reflective of his actual life? (He has since been accused of brutality toward women by a couple of victims.) \nAnd: Did Ellis know this and for that reason put him in the movie?\n\nPaul Schrader has had a really brilliant career. I hope he gets to make another movie after this.\n\nThe themes in the movie, well worth looking into, are more successfully explored in an older movie Star 80 by Bob Fosse. An excellent move.",

            "content": "There's something perversely mesmerizing about the cinematic train wreck that is The Canyons, the latest from director Paul Schrader. Maybe it's the director's confidence. This pulpy, sex-fueled story is utter nonsense, but it's entertaining nonsense. The performances from porn star James Deen and tabloid queen Lindsay Lohan are abysmal, but they're also oddly appropriate. Provocateur Bret Easton Ellis' dialogue is ham-fisted and silly, but he also laces the film with a dry sense of humor that makes it go down rather easily. Make no mistake: this isn't a particularly good movie by any definition of the word. But \"so bad it's good\" seems like an assessment tailor-made for The Canyons.\n\nSet in Los Angeles, The Canyons follows Christian (Deen), a trust-fund kid who makes movies to keep his overbearing father off his back. He's romantically involved with Tara (Lohan), but their sex life involves finding adult friends on the internet and taping each other getting involved with them. Tara, however, harbors a secret from her man. She's in love with Ryan (Nolan Funk), the boyfriend of Christian's assistant Gina (Amanda Brooks) and the star of Christian's latest production, which Tara has gotten heavily involved in. Tara and Ryan lived together years ago, and she left the struggling actor for a more financially secure life with Christian. But upon reuniting, the two learned such intense feelings don't die easily.\n\nThough Christian has no problems watching Tara with another man, the thought of her being emotionally involved with someone other than him starts consuming him. He becomes paranoid and increasingly difficult to be around. Even his long-time lay Cynthia (Tenille Houston) asks him to stop coming around. It's Ryan, though, who bears the brunt of Christian's madness, and soon, the two are locked in a battle of wills so intense that lives truly are on the line.\n\nIt's hard to even know where to begin with a film like this. It oscillates so wildly and from minute to minute between awesome and awful that, 90 minutes later, you'll just feel exhausted. The film's most interesting commentary relates to Schrader's apparent insistence that cinema is dead. The Canyons' opening credits are played over moving still images of abandoned movie houses. Christian waxes not-so-poetic about his non-plussed attitude toward his job. Over lunch, Tara asks Gina when her last meaningful moviegoing experience was. (She blanks.) Christian uses his iPhone-not a camera-to film Tara's sex scenes.\n\nThen there's the who meta idea of The Canyons being a deliberately trite cinematic sex-capade starring a porn star and a Lohan that's a day-and-date VOD release. It's unfortunate that no discussion of The Canyons can be had without acknowledging its roots. (I'll stay away from its troubled production history...that's neither here nor there.) But that's the nature of the beast Schrader has created.\n\nWhether you're of the belief that The Canyons is hollow trash (it is) or a smart, deliberate commentary (still hollow), it seems impossible to me that someone would defend the lifeless corpses known as James Deen and Lindsay Lohan who, apparently, were supposed to be the lead actor and actress of this film. It should be noted, however, that the film's biggest offenders are Easton Ellis and his banal dialogue, but it's delivered painfully by every actor involved (even an unsuspecting Gus van Sant...seriously...)\n\nSchrader's Los Angeles is an interesting place that could have been (and has been previously) explored thoughtfully, but here, he seemed more interested in making an awful movie and seeing if he could get away with it. It's cool that he wants to call his choices deliberate, but I'm calling bullshit. Yes, The Canyons is kind of fun in a truly twisted way, but at the end of the day, I need something to latch onto, and nobody involved has anything to offer.\n\nhttp://www.johnlikesmovies.com/the-canyons-review/",

Because \"The Canyons\" is just a weak copycat of that detached loveless and angst-filled selfcentered zombielike L.A. sphere Ellis has been roaming around in since his debut. A constant theme in Ellis' work is the existential \"ennui\", the boredom and emptiness of life, the absence of deeper meaning. The missing connection within and with others and genuine emotions. A world that I liked and found intriguing back in the 80s, but in 2015 it\u00b4s maybe not so intriguing anymore. The pillars of shallowness, lies, intrigues, wobbly psyches and eventually murder is not handled in a strong way neither storywise nor directionwise. Then again having the train wreck Lindsay Lohan as the poster name is hardly a guarantee that you will get some sort of great and dynamic performance and adding a porn star as her counterpart is maybe not a good decision either. The once freckled faced and cute Lindsay Lohan is gone and a way too worn and undressed version has emerged despite her still young age. Too many wrong paths has been taken for her and she is on the road to become bound to do B-horror movies futurewise unless she truly change her ways and find peace with herself and what she wants to be and do. It can be done. There\u00b4s hope. The actress Leslie Camila-Rose was actually on call throughout the entire filming to replace Lindsay Lohan at a moment's notice due to Lohan's repeated absences, tardiness, and feuds with director Paul Schrader and co-star James Deen. Coutterrand was essentially paid to be Lohan's understudy in case Lohan was fired or left the set and never returned. However, I did like Tenille Houston as Cynthia. The acting in \"The Canyons\" is hardly convincing and there\u00b4s no suspense what so ever in the film. The direction is average at best and I reckon Schrader\u00b4s attempt to make the movie a suspenseful thriller \u00e1 la Brian De Palma in his heydays fails pretty big. Linda Barnard of the Toronto Star gave the film one out of four stars, calling it \"a howlingly bad soap-opera-meets-soft-core-porn mash-up\". \"The Canyons\" is not Ellis, Lohan\u00b4s nor Schrader\u00b4s finest hour and this will only end up as footnote in movie history.",

            "content": "I'm going to write this review as an unbiased to Lindsay Lohan. I'm not her biggest fan but I don't dislike her either. I will say I'm a fan of James Deen (incriminating statement).\n\nIt appears that Lindsay is over acting, but actually the rest of the cast is under acting and not complimenting her performance. Like when she starts crying, it feels too dramatic since her opposing actor isn't a believable threat. It's like why is she crying so much. You can tell that the director & cinematographer did everything in their power to make sure they wouldn't take any of the blame for this flopping. It looked good, I liked how they tried to make it feel like real life.  The shots were well composited and pleasing to the eye. I think it might have been the writer, the casting, and possibly producers who failed. Although, it is the director's job to pull the talent out of the actor. Either these were really untalented actors or the director didn't put enough effort to make the best of their performances. Now about the writing, really?  I mean everything you could do wrong they practically did. There was absolutely no character development or back story. There is a saying in Hollywood, if Timmy fell down the well would you care?  In this movie I couldn't care. Why was Tara (Lohan) crying so much? Why would she put up with a d-bag of a boyfriend to live a wealthy lifestyle? I mean we all want that life but what was her motivation? What was the source of Christian's (Deen) behavior? We know it had something to do with the father but what did he go through? Why was Tara so desirable that Christian stalked his own girlfriend and Ryan was obsessed with his ex-girlfriend? What was so special about Tara and why do I care? The writer failed to use a vehicle to tell a back story or give the characters depth. The timeline was so linear we failed to see the outer forces that lead these characters down their paths. They could have used flashbacks instead of casually mentioning events in the dialogue. If they really wanted to avoid flashbacks and keep that timeline strictly linear then they should've showed more interaction with characters other than the main ones.  We should've met Christian's father. We should've seen Ryan's failed & drastic attempts to further his career. We should've met someone other than Ryan from Tara's past. We needed to see their self torments and motivation for such deep desire to achieve their dreams or motivated their dark sides. Everybody wants to live a wealthy lifestyle, archive fame, to have true love, to control every aspect of their lives, to enact revenge, to simply have everything they want to be happy & admired. Why did I care about these characters trying to achieve what everyone wants. What I would have cared about is why they would go to such drastic lengths to do so. I wanted to relate to their character and feel empathy or even sympathy. The ending was weak, left me with no closure or understanding of Ryan's continuing obsession with Tara. \n\nTHE ONLY GOOD THING ABOUT THIS MOVIE WAS THAT FOURSOME SEX SCENE!!  Seeing James Deen performing bisexual acts against his will was worth watching the whole movie.",

Maybe it's because there are a few brief scenes involving male nudity and homoeroticism. I don't know, but this is a really interesting movie involving a number of smart and talented people, and it has some interesting things to say about the state of the film industry and how movies get made. Lindsay Lohan gives a genuinely tense, brave, non-airbrushed performance, James Deen gets the sexually dominant guy with Big Issues right and the cinematography constantly evokes an aura of The Death of Hollywood. There's some stilted acting from a couple of the lesser known actors and I thought James Deen's character going American Psycho was overkill on Ellis's part (a more downplayed climax would have fit the film better imo) but this is a much better, much more interesting film than most of its critical reviews reflect.",

Considering his day job is porn, that's a compliment. He pulls off the \"rich kid douche bag\" role fairly well. In a few glimpses, Lohan shows she still has acting chops, but you can tell she is struggling internally with something that has nothing to do with the script. Her makeup is a mess, her face looks bloated and tired, her voice is ragged and sounds like it will die out at any moment, she looks a good five years older than me when, in fact, I am two years older than her. In short, I feel sorry for her. The nude scenes reek of desperation; something to try and save a film that clearly lacks any substance or direction. And while Lohan has a great rack, there was really no need to show anything as sex wasn't even the central plot. It was barely a plot at all. The film only started to get interesting right before the credits ran. The slight twist at the end was cool, I admit. Just as it looks like there could be hope for it to be good- BAM. It's over. They would have been better off making this a softcore porno. Would have been way more interesting to watch. Instead you get an hour of the camera following actors around in real time (this is supposed to be artsy and interesting, I guess. YAWN) and listless conversations between actors who look like they don't want to be there. Can't say I blame them.",

Her career was so promising. She became a famous teen star after the success of \"Freaky Friday\" and \"Mean Girls\". After appearing in independent releases like \"A Prairie Home Companion\" and \"Bobby\", she later became famous for being a tabloid train wreck. 2013 has been especially hard for Lohan. First she appeared in a cameo role in the R-Rated sketch comedy \"InAPPropriate Comedy\" (which I didn't see), she became the latest goddess to sleep with Charlie Sheen in \"Scary Movie 5\" and now she appears in \"The Canyons\", a depressing erotic thriller that is neither sexy or thrilling.\n\nLohan plays Tara, a wannabe actress who gave up her life to be an actress years ago, so she decided to live with her wealthy boyfriend, a young movie producer named Christian (porn star James Deen). Christian suspects Tara of having an affair with her ex-boyfriend Ryan (Nolan Funk), a struggling actor who lives from paycheck-to-paycheck. When Tara can't stay in Ryan's lifestyle, she decides to stay with Christian, they have sex with multiple partners and play twisty games with each other.\n\nAs you can see the plot description I told you about, \"The Canyons\" is a stupid, artless mess. Everybody in this movie is either sexually obsessive, depressed or unlikeable. \n\"The Canyons\" also looks like a soft-core porn film that might've got a theatrical release by mistake. What's surprising is that \"Good Will Hunting\" director Gus Van Sant has a small supporting role in the film as a shrink named Dr. Campbell. What's even more surprising about \"The Canyons\" is that it was written by Bret Easton Ellis (American Psycho) and directed by Paul Schrader (American Gigolo and Affliction). Schrader was once one of the greatest screenwriters ever, he wrote \"Taxi Driver\", \"Raging Bull\", \"The Last Temptation of Christ\" and \"Bringing Out The Dead\" for director Martin Scorsese. Schrader was even a good director he directed \"American Gigolo\" starring Richard Gere and \"Affliction\" starring Nick Nolte and James Coburn. \n\nThe late great actor George C. Scott once said to Schrader: \"You're a great screenwriter but the world's worst goddamned director.\" I wouldn't have said that to Schrader, he's still a screenwriting master. Sure, Schrader makes dark, moody movies about isolated, depressing people, \"The Canyons\" is also dark, moody movie with depressing characters but it has no style and no substance. Bret Easton Ellis is also masterful writer, He writes stories about hateful individuals working in a upper class society but his screenplay for \"The Canyons\" has no tone at all. The plot and the dialogue are way too ridiculous. \n\nLet's talk about the casting of porn star James Deen. Who thought casting this guy was a good idea? Did anybody think that this guy had talent? Why does he look like a weird mix of Anthony Weiner and Paul Ryan? Porn stars should not act at all. Yes, I'm willing to admit this, Paul Ryan might have been the better choice to play the abusive L.A. movie producer. \n\nThe New York Times article about the making of \"The Canyons\" might have been the better movie to make for Paul Schrader and Bret Easton Ellis but what we have here is an inept soap opera. Lindsay Lohan if you want your career to be back on track, don't ask Charlie Sheen or your crazy parents to help you, just get actual help.",

The Canyons is not a good movie but it most definitely isn't as bad as the scathing reviews it has gotten either as most of its cheekiness is intentional and is supposed to be both lurid and sleazy while filled with the melodramatic cheap thrills the film provides.  I believe it is supposed to be a \"guilty pleasure\" type of movie as parts of it are \"so bad it is good\".  Lohan plays an actress who is the unlucky girlfriend of sexually-obsessed and eternally suspicious movie producer Christian (Deen) who makes movies to ensure his trust fund stays intact.  She is asked to do his bidding and please him in many ways ... most often in the nude and quite often playing around with someone else of his choosing (and Lohan does get nude).  When she encounters a person from her past who is trying to win a part in Christian's latest film that she once had feelings for, she is put in an even more difficult and delicate situation as she is once again drawn to this past love but she is afraid of Christian's wild rages and uncontrollable jealousy.  Oh yes ... that is the film and one can only imagine how over-the-top and ridiculous much of the dialogue and situations become.  Lohan makes one laugh a time or two with her delivery but she is also quite good in a few key dramatic scenes making me assume she grasps exactly what this film is.  She makes the film somewhat tragic ... which it actually is for a number of reasons.",

When it turns out that Tara has a history with the lead of his film project his paranoia takes over and we see his mind games spiral out of control with terrible consequences for all.\n\nThis film has already become so famous for being bad it seems a tad redundant to even be writing about it. To be honest I was curious if a film could be as bad as this was being made out to be. This is afterall the film that was turned away from the likes of Sundance and SXSW for being too ugly, a film directed by Paul Schrader and written by Brett Easton Ellis that cannot even get a distribution deal beyond the one cinema it screened in in New York last month. When even something called Sharknado can get an outing on the basis that it's so-bad-it's-good, where has this one failed?\n\nThe film is not terribly made, it's not like Schrader has suddenly forgotten how to put a reel together. In the case of our two leads, the acting is not bad; James Deen makes a surprisingly decent screen presence whilst Lohan manages to remind us that there is (was?) talent there. If you haven't already I urge you to see A Prairie Home Companion, it's a Robert Altman film and despite featuring the likes of Tommy Lee Jones and John C. Reilly, Lohan is the best thing in it. Along with Mean Girls it stands as a testament to how badly the wheels can come off the rails and how far people are willing to let them fly in the name of entertainment. As for the rest of the cast, perhaps budget considerations where the reason most of them made it to the first read through.\n\nIt is terribly written, it makes itself out to be some piece of trashy fun. Like a feature length episode of an MTV reality show but with added breasts. Yet, every time it threatens to get in the slightest bit entertaining in this manner, the film ducks, it bobs and it weaves its way back to an anti-climax. Instead of relishing with guilty delight over how these empty, ugly, superficial characters ruin their own lives, it appears Easton Ellis wanted us to sympathise. With what exactly is still very much unclear. There also appears to be some sort of half hearted attempt at making it a psychological thriller but the script is simply too shallow, the actions and emotions on screen are without motive or justification.\n\nAs a z-list piece of fun this might have worked, however it has aspirations to be a film it simply never was and as a result just comes across as flat and lazy filmmaking. One gets the feeling, especially reading about the fallout from the film that Schrader may be done as a director, this is sad but not necessarily a bad thing, he was always a better writer anyway. Hopefully, Easton Ellis will go back to twitter and realise that no-one is as good as he thinks he is and hopefully Lohan will get herself together and exploit the talent she clearly has.",

            "content": "It's hard to talk about The Canyons without talking about the making of The Canyons. From profiles in The New York Times to think pieces in Film Comment to essays by the filmmakers on their give-and-take with star Lindsay Lohan, they have all magnified the scenes behind the scenes, cultivating an expectation of a nasty piece of work. It is that. But not in the way you were hoping for.\n\nSo before you click download on this sometimes-erotic thriller, know this: you're not about to watch Obsessed. The Canyons is a movie about empty people with empty lives finding a thrill in their nihilistic attempts to feel.\n\nDon't be dismayed by the many critics who were ready to clamp down on The Canyons as soon as they possibly could: it's not as bad as they're saying. It's a low-budget film that looks like it was filmed on a low budget, but in most respects that's its biggest crime. Press-stopping names were hired to make up for the lack of financial backing, and that resulted in Lohan and her renown porn co-star James Deen taking the lead roles. What they do with it comes down to their different schools of performing. Deen, most studious in the money shot, does everything shy of winking at you. At times, it works, especially when Deen needs to be a more playful, sneakingly sinister Christian. At others, it doesn't. There are points when The Canyons could have served itself better by choosing not to show us anything at all.\n\nBut it's Lohan who gives a great performance - and I'm being 100 percent un-ironic when I say that. Perhaps the other roles were filled in with lackluster actors allowing her to gleam in the spotlight, but not only is Lohan the star of The Canyons, she's the most believable part of it. Lohan reins it in and delivers when the script calls for it. It's a shame, then, that the screenplay didn't give her more to do.\n\nSure - you've seen the trailer, and you've read the articles - Lohan strips down and hams it up in raunchy sex scenes, but her role as Tara is given the least story.\n\nThe Canyons is about an ex-aspiring actress Tara (Lohan) and her producer boyfriend Christian (Deen) who work on B-grade slasher flicks. Christian has just hired an actor, Ryan (Nolan Gerard Funk), by Tara's request and as a favor to his assistant (Ryan's girlfriend) who is spearheading the film. There's just one sordid detail: Tara and Ryan have a history. They have a present, too. And Christian grows more and more suspicious and paranoid with each passing moment. Soon, the trio indirectly involve themselves in a play of sexual prowess and desire, pushing the limits of how far they'd degrade themselves to rise to power in the hollow city of Los Angeles. But most of it goes to Christian and Ryan, having Tara pop up to react to most of the situations whenever convenient.\n\nlohan and deen the canyons\n\nIt appears that The Canyons has many things to say: it wants to converse about the conveyor belt filmmaking that has become the norm in Hollywood, it wants to comment on the lack of creativity in the market, it wants to warn the masses of micro-budget films accessible to anyone with a camera-phone, to show you the lack of intellectual connections of this generation, and it surely wants to let you peek into the lives of sexy people who offer not much more than that to the world. Exposing the shallowness of L.A.'s elite and elite-hopefuls is always a fine line to ride, and unfortunately a lot of The Canyons comes up short.\n\nSee, The Canyons touches upon all these subjects, but it never really does more than that. It shows these people to you and then never makes any judgements. It displays them for all to see and then just quietly fades to black. Perhaps that was the intention, mirroring the soulless in a film that's equally as shallow, but perhaps not - the film does open up with images of abandoned theaters, and runs those images throughout, for that matter.\n\nAnd it feels that way - cold. It's dead, airy. The first few minutes are dedicated to four characters just talking at a restaurant, everyone staring into the camera, talking to each other but to no one, really. It's about all of us actually being actors, pretending to feel how we need to in certain situations. Every once in a while a character will look directly at you: \"This is fake. We're pretending,\" The Canyons is saying. None of this is real, for as much as The Canyons wants to feel distant and isolated, it also wants you to have front-row access to these characters and all of their depravity, at times forcing you to stroll along with them in long, tracking movements. And, yes, low-budget filmmaking means The Canyons has to heavily rely on people talking at each other about information (I love you! We were broke! Exposition ad nauseam!).\n\nBut something happened halfway into The Canyons where I stopped thinking that and I became invested.\n\nThe crux of low-budget filmmaking is, of course, the lack of resources - then, the lack of talent, the lack of multiple setups, and the lack of time. But most importantly, unwillingness to dig deeper into the issues of vapidity. If not for that, if even some supporting players were up to task, The Canyons could have soared to Bling Ring and Spring Breakers heights.",

Brilliantly written character study, perfect performances, and beautiful photography. Lohan is exceptional, and I hope James Deen lands more roles in non-pornographic films. He is a young actor with some serious chops, if his portrayal of Christian is any indication. It is unfortunate that the naysaying around this movie hit such a fever pitch before masses got a chance to see it objectively, because their viewings of it have been colored by the negative press and a desire to see this movie in a negative light; alternatively, there are a lot of people who went into this not knowing what to expect from it I think. This *feels* lake an Easton Ellis novel on screen--I see a lot of the character types he explores in books like Less Than Zero and Imperial Bedrooms blended together here, within the context of an erotic thriller, at last delivering a film that I think truly contains within itself the spirit of Ellis' writing--something most adaptations of his work to film thus far have failed to do. In closing, Lindsay Lohan's Tara is exceptionally performed and nuanced, and I can't imagine another actress having played her. The dialogue between characters is very real and intimate, natural and organic, to such a degree that it was positively sublime. A+",

Horrible acting, the worst by porno actor James Deen.

The acting by the supporting cast comes off as line readings by amateurs, but (surprise to say this), Lindsay Lohan and porn-star James Deen are terrific in this twisty, who-done it and who will-do it.  They are bored swingers in the movie business; enter a fresh, young couple working on the film who discover associating with them lead them down a dirty path.  Deen is particularly effective here as a spoiled rich boy producing the film.  He wants ownership of things and even treat women as possessions to hold.  When things do not go his way, he reacts.  Written by Brent Easton Ellis of American Psycho fame, the comparisons are easy to see. But Deen is really good.  Maybe I didn't have high expectations for either lead considering their pop culture status, but the cruel mind games kept me interested.  Several explicit sex scenes add to the enjoyment - including one that goes way off the deep end.  The scenes of decaying movie theaters was an interesting tip to the hat on how the film business is just like Deen's character - obsessed with money & little substance.  Director Paul Schrader likes rough & tumble characters and here he creates 2 I will not likely forget.  *** out of 4-stars",

And if he hates it, I still love it.  We see Deen's character arc from bad to worse. And Lindsay's from scared to petrified. We see a world of people who live for money.  There is back stabbing, cruelty, cheating, and perversion. Yet there is love and romance amidst it all. But in the end the bad stuff extinguishes the good. This is true Hollywood with a true real Hollywood end. It's not the fairy tale people want to be lulled into complacency by.\n\nAnd the music is great. Son of Perdition (featuring Rob James) sounds like a 60s Lee Hazelwood. The rest of Brendan Canning & me&john's soundtrack is great and hits that undercurrent of decayed Hollywood theaters, and decayed Hollywood people; topped of with classic Dum Dum Girls' Coming Down.\n\nYes, there are technical flaws, maybe. Or maybe it's just a casual style. There's stuff that an experienced contemporary filmmaker would look at and say, it's terrible, it's amateur. But is it really flawed or is it just that the viewer is so accustomed to homogenized perfect Barbie world tripe?  And that's part of the nostalgia. 60's films were like that; grungy, less than perfect. People didn't care. They just wanted to see the film, or maybe take their sex-mate to a drive in and get it on . And when was the last time a major Hollywood film was actually X rated? Today's world is so conservatively annal retentive about being political, fashionably, and financially perfect.\n\nJames Deen and Lindsay Lohan\nWhen I watch this movie I look past all that perfection crap and I look at the meat of the matter, and I'm not talking about James Deen's wad or Lindsay's naked breasts. I'm talking about the story and the quality of the basic cinematic story aspects. Get past where you think the lighting isn't right, or there's something distracting in the background. That kind of critical thinking is based on what you expect a  movie to be. It's a perception,  based on media hype about what a film should look like. But that definition of is only technical excellence. You may like the Hangover series. They are technically perfect. I think they suck ass. The Canyons is an unusual film about the decay of Hollywood. Not just the physical decay of abandoned movie theaters.  But the decay of the people who make films who stoop to personal fulfillment over some kind of selfless contribution to film (In case you're from Hollywood, selfless means you don't care about your self, over some kind of greater good).\n\nI think the plethora of critics coming out in droves with hate and disdain for this movie, actually fear what they see in the mirror. Do any of them find anything good to say? Obviously none of them were brought up to stay silent unless you have something nice to say to people (neither was I). And that's why this movie is their mirror. If you believe something is bad and you tell others it's bad, then it's perceived as bad.",

James Deen probably gives the best performance as Lohan's controlling psychotic boyfriend which is ironic considering a perusal of Deen's acting credits on imdb reveal such titles as MILFs Seeking Boys III, No Swallowing Allowed 4, and Anal Expedition 9. Presumably this is why he was so comfortable displaying his junk. \n\nDirector Paul Schrader doesn't seem to be getting anything from his actors. Lohan seems confused most of the time. In some scenes she literally looks like she's forgotten her lines and just improvises on the spot while shaking her head and closing her eyes. The rest of the cast could just as easily be starring in an episode of The Hills on crack. I did keep thinking of The Informers which was also an adaptation of an Easton Ellis novel although this was probably due more to the Beverly Hills setting than any real resemblance to that movie, which puts this to shame. \n\nThere isn't really much more I can say about The Canyons. People go for dinner. People drive around. People have sex. People call each other on the phone. People try and screw each other over; your typical Hollywood Z-listers story or more aptly, an overlong R-Rated episode of The Hills.

I thought Lindsay Lohan was good enough considering the material and saw no signs of her off screen life effecting her performance. James Deen was interesting but there is no way to tell if he can act based on what is shown here. The big 4-way sex scene is photographed and presented in a way that, for the most part, makes it impossible to determine who's what is supposed to be in one of the other participant's whatever. Given the elements assembled here, and given the subject matter, this should have been a much better film. I was fascinated by the shots of closed movie theatres in the credits but have to ask the point. And, frankly, I don't think the title fits the film since the action takes place all over Los Angeles and most is not even set in \"the canyons\".",

There were a few really good lines of dialogue in this movie, the most memorable of which was \"Privacy? There is no privacy anymore.\" That's for sure; the actors in this \"steamy\" slice of cinema had to strut about naked or semi-naked a lot. despite this, it was about as erotic as people playing badminton in the nude. The lead actor, (James Deen? This\n guy's real name must be something like Lester Fickelstein) was effective in his role, but paced about like a bantum rooster in a state of underwhelming half undress. The\n other men likewise required to bare flesh fared only slightly better; one was marred by an over-styled Donald Trump-type hairdo but had great cheekbones and a nice bod. The gay characters in the movie were presented as beady-eyed and desperate for young flesh. Yes, it was that kind of a movie, a sort of pulp novel trash-fest if you like that kind of thing.

She lives in lavish luxury by Christian (porn star James Deen, who can actually act), a producer with a wicked jealous streak, which isn't good for Tara's affair with an ex-boyfriend (Nolan Funk). Christian also keeps her busy by bringing home various individuals for sex. The plot reads like a poor man's Bret Easton Ellis, and made all the more tragic by the fact that Ellis wrote the script. That the director is the great Paul Schrader (American Gigolo, The Comfort of Strangers, Affliction) is the final nail in the coffin. Lohan, who hasn't starred in a decent movie in almost a decade, and this is no different, still has small moments that shows she can still act, but she's pretty much alone on a sinking ship.

Sunday evening I was looking for something to watch, came across it and figured I'd give it a chance.  It stars Lindsay Lohan as a yoga instructor who has a volatile/crazy sexual relationship with a producer played by James Deen.  He becomes obsessed when he thinks she is cheating on him and things escalate from there.  It's a thriller, that offers no thrills, well except to see Lohan naked through a lot of the movie.  This is basically a notch above softcore porn's you see late night on Cinemax.  Lot of nudity, some sex, and a whole lot of bad acting.  It does have one of the weirdest sex scenes I've ever seen in a movie, as a foursome.  Lohan probably is the best thing about the movie here. but even she does horrible.  Deen has 2 facial expressions, bored and a smirkish pout.  Plus, the way the movie ends is pretty stupid.  They probably could have done some cooler stuff with the way Deen's character goes crazier and crazier, but they don't.  It's an hour and a half that drags a lot, just feels too slow.   I give it 2 stars for Lohan's two best assets, but other than that this is a complete skip.  If EW gives this a B+ I'd really hate to see what their version of an A is.",

Your ass used to be beautiful, so to speak (let's look at some great-to-good films he's directed, nevermind wrote: Blue Collar, Hardcore, American Gigolo, Cat People, fucking MISHIMA, Affliction, even Auto Focus!)  And Ellis has, um, two excellent books, and I don't have any desire to read the rest.  Lord do I not now more than ever!  \n\nIt's written and directed like a sub-par Lifetime movie (this confirmed by my wife who suffered through the movie with me and has seen more than her share), and features acting that is some of the worst, most ineffectual, bland, soulless I've seen in a movie not made by film school students.  Shit, at least THE BROTHERS OF MYSTICAL (for my fellow WPU alumn) could be somewhat forgiven by being made by amateurs.  Schrader, Ellis and whoever that DP who loves to make things look all shiny and glossy like it's an episode of the fucking Hills don't have that excuse!  I mean, James Deen.  Good God.

Or, let me amend that - she was good inasmuch that EVEYRONE ELSE was not good so her performance was elevated to be by FAR the best in the film, when she was just doing the best with the turgid dialog she had, though one actress has a halfway decent scene that I can't remember.  It helps that Lohan is basically playing some weird meta version of herself, I think, but she at least is trying, she at least takes the words from the page and tries.  The other actors... I still can't get over Deen.  Why did Paul Schrader think it was a good idea to let this GAY PORN ACTOR onto a professional film set?  \n\nA movie that's supposedly about vapid and narcissistic parasites but ultimately is just a vapid, narcissistic, parasitic film itself.

            "content": "So what exactly is Paul Schrader going for with The Canyons? Is it an erotic B-movie sleaze fest? Or pointed commentary on the state of the movie industry? He seems to be aiming for the latter, as the film opens with a series of ghostly images of rundown, long abandoned movie theaters backed by an ominous score. His point, supported by the Kickstarter-funded path he took to getting the film made, is that traditional views of cinema are dead. The moviegoing experience we've all come to expect is no more. What exactly this has to do with the shallow, disaffected cast of misfits who populate The Canyons is a question you'll be asking yourself until the credits finally, thankfully roll. More than likely it was a warning about the ruinous 100 minutes the viewer is about to endure.\n\nThe Canyons isn't another bad movie; the weeks' new releases are littered with those. No, it's exceptionally terrible and the sort of high-profile embarrassment that would get people fired if there was a studio backing it. But this is worse because YOU paid for it, America, and yet don't have the power to really make anyone's head roll over it. There's something fundamentally undemocratic about that, isn't there? Schrader, whose aloof and observational approach would seem to be a perfect match for braggadocios author/screenwriter Bret Easton Ellis' love of the bored and vapid, delivers an uninteresting movie about uninteresting people in the movie biz.\n\nThe last few weeks have seen Schrader attempting to convince people that this isn't just the Lindsay Lohan porn movie, but the sad thing is it would be more interesting if it was. Certainly the scummy mood, stilted dialogue and half-baked acting have it resembling those comically terrible Brock Landers movies from Boogie Nights. And to be fair, it's not really Lohan's fault. Perhaps she's drawing from her own troubled, empty life, but she makes the most out of a badly written character in a cesspool of badly written ones. She plays Tara, the spoiled arm candy to Christian (James Deen), a soulless, arrogant, and Machiavellian rich kid who wields his power as a producer of crappy movies like a weapon. Not that he really truly cares about any of it, and in true Ellis fashion he only does it so daddy won't put a freeze on his trust fund.\n\nWhat really drives Christian is the ability to control and manipulate others, most especially Tara. He can't stand the idea that she has any sort of life that doesn't revolve around him, so he begins to go a little crazy suspecting she may be sleeping around with Ryan (Nolan Funk), the hunky lead in his new low-budget horror movie. Ryan, who lives with Christian's naive assistant Gina (Amanda Brooks), only got the job at Tara's urging, which adds fuel to the speculative fire. This is one of those movies where everybody lies and then lies about the lies, and the truth only comes out when it can cause the most emotional damage. So when he's not obsessing over her infidelity, Christian sleeps around with whoever he wants, and then scours the Internet for random dudes/couples to bang Tara while he occasionally participates. Without much in the way of rhyme or reason it veers into psycho-thriller territory, perhaps in a lazy attempt to recall the psychotic wackos of Ellis' American Psycho or The Rules of Attraction. Those films at least had competent acting behind them with Christian Bale and James Van Der Beek (last time you'll see him praised on this site!), while Deen acts like someone who has never been asked to do much beyond drop his pants. Glimpses of the old Lohan peek through now and again, and with her aged-beyond-belief face and nervous twitchiness, she resembles a wannabe starlet who has seen and done too much. It's not a perfect performance, sometimes she wildly misplays a scene's emotional beats, but it's good to see her not phoning this one in. The same can't be said for Gus Van Sant, the director who makes an unnecessary cameo as Christian's psychiatrist. Perhaps he had another movie shooting next door and wandered in, but whatever the reason he shouldn't have been there.\n\nPerversion and depravity would seem to jibe well with Ellis' usual explorations of the superficial, but a micro-budget coupled with ill-prepared talent and a flat script is too much to overcome. Sluggish pacing stretches an already interminable runtime, and with all of the shoddy elements The Canyons resembles test subject put together by a bunch of amateurs, but definitely not the work of seasoned professionals.",

Ryan is a struggling actor, Tara helps to land him the role on a new film. Christian is dating Tara and has his doubts about her relationship with Ryan. What follows is a very slow burn of a thriller. At times, I was wondering what was the point of everything. Then in the last 20 or so minutes, the film finally starts to come together. On the surface, this film seems fairly straight forward, but then as I pieced together everything, there are a lot of subplots going on regarding how all the characters know each other. In a way, a very good Neo-Noir type thriller. Though it loses some points since it felt like things took too long to get going, I did enjoy it in the end. 3 stars",

Lindsay, on the other hand, is mesmerizing, if not always in a good way.\nShe's like Frankenstein as Mary Shelly originally conceived the character... breathtakingly beautiful, yet still a monster no less.\n\nTo their credit, Paul Schrader, writer Bret Easton Ellis, and producer by Braxton Pope cast Lindsay in the lead role when no one else would have her. She was at the very nadir of her once promising film career.\n\nTherefore, watching the film, you can't help but root for her-not her character, but her. Each time she appears on screen, and she mostly monopolizes it, the film becomes engrossing because you never know which Lindsay Lohan you'll see.\n\nAt times, she's very convincing as the conflicted and love-lorn Tara, an actress who is in a dysfunctional relationship with Christian (James Deen), a Hollywood trust fund baby who pretends to make movies so daddy won't cut him off.\n\nBut the dialog is often so unnatural even she can't pull off the scene, much less co-stars Tenille Houston, Amanda Brooks and Nolan Gerard Funk. Why is Lindsay even on the same set with them? Oh... right, she couldn't get work anywhere else.\n\nGranted the film was shot on a shoe string budget; that still doesn't excuse the terrible lighting and makeup. At times, Lindsay looks truly seductive. At others, especially during close ups, you'll gasp.\n\nShe channels Divine, the transvestite actor filmmaker John Waters made famous in \"Pink Flamingos.\" What is with that eye makeup?\n\nLohan's much ballyhooed nude scenes are way over-hyped. \"The Canyons\" is billed as an erotic thriller, but the sex scenes are neither erotic nor thrilling. If sex is this mechanical in Hollywood, it's a wonder anyone gets laid. And, this is where the plot really breaks down.\n\nChristian gets off watching Tara have sex with other guys while he films them. He also likes engaging in four-way, guy-on-guy, girl-on-girl sex. Plus, he's having an affair on the side with his yoga instructor.\n\nYet, he becomes insanely jealous when he finds out Tara is sleeping with a young actor (Funk), whom she once dated. His jealously totally lacks credibility, yet it basically drives the plot.\n\nWhen they're not having sex, the characters are meeting for lunch, having drinks, or engrossed with their cell phones. Toss in a gratuitous murder and call it a wrap.\n\nThe opening credits is the best moment in the film. They roll over eerie shots of abandoned movie theaters. Beyond that, though, \"The Canyons\" has nothing to do with movie theaters, or making movies.\n\nHopefully, Lindsay will survive this film. She shows flashes of real acting ability and deserves a shot at something better. As for \"The Canyons,\" there isn't one deep enough to toss this film into.",

            "content": "Before Veronica Mars success on the high-profile crowd-sourced fundraising site Kickstarter, there was The Canyons. Written by novelist Bret Easton Ellis (American Psycho, Less Than Zero) and directed by Oscar-nominee Paul Schrader (Affliction, Taxi Driver), it promised to be a more legit opportunity for fans to fund a real movie, something they could actually see on the big screen. The production successfully raised a budget of $150,000 with rewards like script coverage by Schrader, working out at the gym with Ellis and his physical trainer, and Robert DeNiro's moneyclip from Taxi Driver. The little production that could got even more press when tabloid darling Lindsay Lohan was cast as the female lead. The New York Times released a lengthy blow-by-blow in January of the tumultuous film shoot, mostly centered around Lohan and her antics. It was a fascinating read. The Canyons is a better behind-the-scenes news article than a competent sexy thriller. The best actor in the film is a prominent male porn star. Make of that what you will.\r\n\r\nIn the City of Angels, Christian (James Deen) is spinning a web of deceit. He regularly invites other men over to have sex with his girlfriend, Tara (Lohan). His assistant, Gina (Amanda Brooks), has a boyfriend, Ryan (Nolan Gerard Funk), who wants to be an actor. She convinces Christian to offer him a small part. It just so happens that Ryan and Tara used to date back when they were struggling actors. They've also started a new affair. Christian suspects something is amiss and schemes to punish and destroy Ryan and his dreams of Hollywood fame. Meanwhile Ryan is trying to scheme himself to get Tara to finally leave the rich and luxurious clutches of Christian. \r\n\r\nWoe to thee expecting a plot or characters worth watching. Despite the presence of artistic heavyweights like Ellis and Schrader, The Canyons is a movie that does a disservice to the word bland. This movie is powerfully bland. There's just nothing to attach to other than the fascination of Lohan. The characters are posh, privileged, unlikable, and morally slipshod, which is the Ellis specialty. Except in the past he's given them personalities to go along with their nihilistic narcissism. Christian is a pale likeness of Patrick Bateman and has no charisma or intriguing sense of darkness to him, something to keep you watching. Mostly he's just a jerk. But he's not even an interesting jerk. The plot is a merry-go-round of infidelity, as numerous characters have secret paramours, which makes their cumulative jealousy all the more absurd. What does Christian have to get so upset about? He invites men and women over to have sex with Tara. They even engage in a foursome. I suppose there is the limp argument that he's not in control, but how tedious is that? Ultimately, you're watching Bland Character A complain to Bland Character B about how unhappy Bland Character C makes them. This scenario repeats many times. I wish there was more gratuitous nudity to hold my attention. It's a soap opera that you want to turn off. The entire screenplay feels like weak, reheated Ellis depravity without anything memorable. \r\n\r\nHere's an example of how lazy the screenwriting gets: after Christian is done having sex with Cynthia (Tenille Houston), a yoga teacher (that's one way of doing it), they relax. In this scene, Cynthia asks questions that have no real purpose other than to advance exposition, and it's sorely obvious. It's all, \"What did she mean by that?\" and, \"Why would you go to this place?\" Every screenplay has exposition but the trick is to make it as invisible as possible. Pacific Rim did a particularly great job at masking its exposition so that it arrived in a way that didn't feel like the plot was stalling. The fact that Ellis doesn't even put forth any effort to disguise what is naked and clunky exposition just speaks to an overall sense of lethargy or indifference on his part with the script. I wouldn't be surprised if Ellis knocked this out over one long, monotonous weekend. \r\n\r\nThe other mortal misstep is that Schrader makes the movie so serious that you'll find yourself laughing at spots. This is not great material to begin with, nor compelling characters, but it could have, emphasis on \"could,\" worked had the production embraced its silly sense of luridness. There's a reason we're more forgiving of late-night thrillers with copious amounts of vice. They accept their identity. I think Schrader may have read Ellis' lackluster script and envisioned another Looking for Mr. Goodbar (I'm not confusing it with Schrader's own American Gigolo). This is not a morality tale but Schrader seems to think otherwise. I don't sense any cohesive commentary about young people and their sexual mores or the predominance of technology and its negative impact on human connection. Christian and Tara text at the dinner table. He films \"movies\" on his phone of their sexual trysts with strangers culled from Craigstlist. There's a big difference just including these items and actually having something to say. Schrader opens and closes the film with montages of rundown movie theaters, many shuttered up and long out of business. What am I supposed to decipher from this exactly? Tara asks Gina, who works in the movies, when was the last time she went and saw a movie, a film that honestly made her feel something. Gina is stumped, but that's all you get for that thematic reference. Is Schrader taking out his ire on the state of Hollywood filmmaking and the studio system? Regardless, you won't feel anything form The Canyons either.\r\n\r\nSo what truly is the draw here? Why would someone want to watch this movie? The only factor I can surmise, beyond simple curiosity, is the presence of Lohan. I doubt this movie would seem as compelling absent the troubled actress. Would people be clamoring to see this movie if it starred, say, Hilary Duff instead? She's been out of the limelight seemingly as long as Lohan but she's also had a stable personal life. I won't pretend I'm above this. I watched The Canyons out of sheer curiosity, and that inquisitiveness hinged upon Lohan. She hasn't starred in a theatrically released movie since 2007's I Know Who Killed Me (my #2 worst film of that year), and she's fresh off the infamous Lifetime movie of Elizabeth Taylor that many websites turned into a derisive drinking game. There's an undeniable rubbernecking quality here not to mention the prurient promise of Lohan taking off her clothes. To pacify the curious, Lohan has two scenes where she goes topless, one during the aforementioned foursome. If you're planning a hot night home alone with you an your VOD, good luck trying to make sense of that foursome. It's shot with all these blinky lasers bouncing off people's writhing bodies, losing just about whatever small sensuality the scene may have gained. I'd expect the scenes to land on the Internet in a matter of days, if not hours, so that salient selling point will be moot. Lohan's acting on the other hand is less deserving of attention. There are a few moments where it feels like character and actress have merged, and her crying jags about lost opportunities, dreams gone awry, feel inescapably real for her. I think she would have been better served with a less solemn tone and more sudsy and sundry thrills. \r\n\r\nDeen has the best feel for Ellis' pulpy material, and while he doesn't really click as a menacing figure even as he's murdering people (he's too much a Jewish boy next door type), he does come across as a megalomaniacal creep. Perhaps my expectations were just too low for a porn actor, so my apologies for my prejudices. Given the right material, Deen may surprise (not by his full-frontal nude scene). I do think that Katie Morgan (Zack and Miri Make a Porno) has the ability to transcend porn. She's just so effortlessly charming, something that most of the actors in The Canyons have trouble with. Funk (House at the End of the Street) cannot get a good grip on his character's emotions and thus he just seems pissy all the time. I'll spare the other actors mentioning but I feel the need to inform that Osar-nominated director Gus Van Sant plays Christian's trust fund-mandated therapist. Guess what doesn't work well?\r\n\r\nThose seeking an outrageous exploitation film filled with soapy sex and intrigue, as well as pretty people behaving very badly, will be surely disappointed with The Canyons. I guess it all depends on your expectation level for a film that bypassed the traditional financial system and crowd-sourced on the basis of Schrader and Ellis' notoriety. I'm glad that both artists found a conduit for collaboration and found a way to make it happen on the (relative) cheap. I just don't know why it had to be this crummy story. Thematically, Schrader and Ellis seem to be completely at odds, which results in a super serious movie about terrible, and terribly boring, characters doing little else but indulging in vices and whining (also a vice?). Without the presence of Lohan to add a curiosity factor, there is honestly no good reason to spend good money on this dithering project. The moderate success of The Canyons is somewhat comforting, but really, this wasn't a movie that deserved people's donations, and it certainly doesn't deserve your time. \r\n\r\nNate's Grade: D+",

Although he had its good scenes, in the scenes that needed to be tougher, he couldn't find it's inner courage and wasn't convincing to make him look like he was really demented.

While parts are glamorous, overall it goes to show what a chapter-by-chapter \"zombie\" so many of us really are in Los Angeles. We set ourselves in relationships and situations that are the downfall of our true selves, because there is some glimmer it will put us in the spotlight briefly... On top of that, there is enough eroticism, including male full frontal, to drop a few jaws and keep them drooling. Bret Easton Ellis has became a master at making popularity, fame and wealth seem cool, while showing the dark underbelly of it all simultaneously. This could have easily come off as high-camp. but stays just under that radar, making it an intricately interesting story. The cinematography and poetic license is all well done.. The acting is steady, and the direction is layered. Just as you are laughing, you cringe... Just as you are turned on, your feel the inner turmoil of characters going through the actions just to get to tomorrow...

            "content": "The Canyons explores the dark side of human nature, while trying to offer critiques on the technology obsession of modern society and a dying film industry.  The film follows the story Christian (James Deen) a manipulative movie producer who makes movies to keep his father off his back and to keep his trust fund.  Trouble stirs when Christian suspects that his girlfriend Tara (Lindsey Lohan) is seeing another man.  The Canyons is a twisted and erotic tale of the darkest parts of the human mind.\n\nDirector Paul Schrader does a good job of creating the sexually tangled and sadistic lifestyle of his characters on the surface.  But the characters feel a little flat, in part due to some bad acting and the direction of the movie goes astray is with its attempt at cultural critiques, the critiques end up to thinly spread over multiple subject matters.  Whether it is society's obsession with technology or The Canyons perceived decline of the film industry it's hard to identify the message that the film is so desperately grasping for.  The cinematography is rather beautiful for the most part and the movie is competently edited.  However this goes out the window during the opening scene for the most part, which is awkwardly shot and edited together.  The film does have an overbearing use of cutaways that can become annoying at some parts.  For instance in the opening scene in the middle of a conversation in a restaurant the film has a sweeping crane shot of a bar on the other side of the restaurant, this all done in the middle of the dialog.  \n\nThe Canyons is a movie that features one of the strangest acting ensembles ever assembled in a movie. A cast that ranges from porn star James Deen to award winning director Gus Van Sant who plays Dr. Campbell, Christian's therapist.  It's a daring move to cast a porn star as a leading man and judging from James Deen's performance it's a move that won't be attempted again anytime soon.  A reason behind Deen's casting though could be the movie's various sexually twisted scenes.  The movie sports some of the most sadistically erotic scenes that I have ever seen in a film, the scenes will leave you disgusted (or aroused depending on whether that's your thing or not) which I'm pretty sure is the movies intention.  The movie at times borders on being soft-core porn, but one that sports a sinister quirk.\n\n\nThe big draw of the movie, or the big question that everyone wants to know is if Lindsey Lohan puts on a good performance.  While it's not the cannonball into the pool sort of performance that some may be hoping for out of Lindsey, it is a foot in the water, towards the right direction.  She puts on a solid performance and is undoubtedly the best actor/actress in the film, though her performance is nothing to rave about.  \n\nThe Canyons is a movie that I would tell people to go see, not because it's a good movie, but that it is an experience much in the way that Harmony Korine's Spring Breakers is an experience.  The movie creates a stylistic, materialistic and infernal hell, but the bad acting occasionally pulls you out of the experience of the movie along with the movie being over packed use of commentary.  The movie is gorgeous at parts and stylish, but it's bad acting and lack of execution and direction keep the movie from becoming an in-depth exploration into the dark and sexually twisted hellscape side of the human experience.",

Gone are the days of \"Herbie Fully Loaded\" and \"Mean Girls\", Lohan has completely obliterated her former Disney charm and has set on a course of rehab and full on nude scenes. And from a very heterosexual man, I cannot completely complain. Lohan is the driving force in this film, directed by Paul Schrader, known for his collaborations with Martin Scorsese, and written by author Bret Easton Ellis of \"American Psycho\" fame. For an actress returning from quite the hiatus, Lohan grabs a hold of this role and never lets go, commanding attention as the sexpot girlfriend whose open sexuality and conflicted feelings between two men turn the Hollywood love triangle dynamic on its head. Reminiscent of Soderbergh's casting of pornstar Sasha Grey in \"The Girlfriend Experience\", Schrader brings on male pornstar James Deen, who actually surprises as being an okay actor. Only flashing the moneymaker in one scene, he relies on dialogue and attitude to get him through the film and even though most of his deliveries are flat, the Hollywood bravado rings through. The story is nothing new, with a jealous boyfriend (Deen) keeping tabs on his girlfriend (Lohan) and finding out she has a secret lover (Nolan Gerard Funk). The unraveling eventual leads to a violent conclusion that slams a giant dot on the exclamation point that is this film. In the case of being memorable, \"The Canyons\" definitely is, with the reemergence of Lohan in her sexual prime. However, on the scale of being a good film, this remains entirely entertaining but extremely lacking and without Lohan, would likely be absolutely worthless.",

            "content": "The best thing about \"The Canyons\" is by far Lindsay Lohan. If I am correct, I believe this is the first known Kickstarter film (that was produced), Lindsay's first film since rehab and porn star James Deen's acting debut (excluding all of the straight porn he has been in).\n\nLindsay does a pretty good acting job given the uneven script. She tries her best and elevates each scene she is in and makes the other actors better for it.  There are times that Mr. Deen is a little stiff and as the lead, he makes it difficult to get past the sterile and stiff performance. But once he has someone with acting experience behind them, he warms up a bit. \n\nDon't be surprised at all of the nudity and and sex involved, but considering I heard there was a ton of full frontal nudity, there really isn't that much at all.  You see more full frontal of the guys than the girls, but even Lindsay shows off her boobs. \n\nWhat's hurting the story most is the uneven script. It's unclear what the point of the film ends up being.  It's like standing in line, things are going on around you, but it feels as though you never reach the destination. Basically, Lindsay's character is dating James Deen's character. They are in an open relationship and often invite others to join them. She manages to get an ex-lover an acting job on Deen's movie. The ex-Oliver's girlfriend is Deen's assistant and he is obsessed with Lindsay's character. Add to that all the men in the film are openly willing to try anything once, there is a shady psychiatrist involved, an openly gay filmmaker, a possible closeted man, and a yoga instructor who is sleeping with both Deen and has had relations with the ex-lover. Got all that?  Basically it is a microcosm and bed of sexual exploration. \n\nIt's slightly unbelievable that even in this small community, all of these people are connected and have had relations with everyone else. I know that there are certain industries and communities that are like this, but the yoga instructor connection is a bit much. \n\nIn the end, one of the characters connected to the others is dead and new relationships are formed while others end. I don't want to spoil the ending, but that's impossible because there is none. \n\nI get that this movie was made on the cheap, but the script didn't have to be. Bret Easton Eliis has written many twisted tales in novel form, and perhaps he is best sticking with that genre. This was supposed to be Mr. Schadder's big come back but even though the director is great in scenes maneuvering around the amazing and beautiful house where it is mostly shot, the beginning restaurant scene feels as though it was filmed with one actor at a time and cut together after to make it appear as if the actors were all together at once. \n\nIf you have done any research on this film, you've probably heard about all of the troubles with this shoot. Lindsay was going through rehab/probation, James Deen was finally not doing a porn movie, Paul was trying to make a comeback as an artistic director and Mr. Ellis was trying to break into the screenwriting business  plus, this was a Kickstarter film.  Given all of that, I was a little more lenient on my rating. I really wanted to like this movie and hoped it would succeed, but in the end it's just blah.  \n\nThe premise was better than the execution and while \"it's not The Hills\", it's not even the great indie it hoped to be. I am truly sorry for that because there were a lot of great things involved in this film despite all of the troubles involved. I'm sure this passion project was an experience that everyone involved will look back on and realize that they are better off for having triumphed and achieved. \n\n\"The Canyons\" is not a horrible movie, but it's not that great either. I just wish they would have tied up the ending because its almost as if it is missing a 4th act....",

The story is about some trust-fund kid (James Deen) who's also producing a movie so that his (unseen) dad will get off of his back.  His live-in girlfriend is played by Lindsay Lohan, and the small cast is rounded out with other characters who know each other, and sleep or have slept with one another.  Still, most of the movie is just boring, lifeless dialogue interspersed with some of the most unerotic sex I've ever seen, which includes a foursome.  I mean, what were these people thinking?  The only redeeming qualities are some good soundtrack selections and good camerawork.  That's it.  It's best just to take most people's word and just skip this trash.",

That's the case it seems in The Canyons, a film about deluded young adults who don't know what they want, and won't tell you even by the end of the film. What mostly brings attention to this small indie film is that it brings the official no-joke-I'm-actually-attempting-to-act return of Lindsey Lohan! A brave comeback into the film, alongside porn actor James Deen... Is that a sentence that should ever be spoken? Yes, the film co-stars a well known porn industry actor who takes the name from legendary actor James DEAN. This movie is already harder to review now that it's origins are explained, so let's go forth with the story.\r Lohan plays Tara, a woman who relies on rich douches to take care of her, a lifestyle suddenly becoming boring with her sociopathic trust-fund leech boyfriend Christian, played by Deen. Christian is a so called producer who only uses the title to show his father he's doing something with his life, and is in a open sexual relationship with Tara; allowing other men or women to join in. The main plot comes into focus when Tara reunites with an old boyfriend named Ryan, who is an actor in Christian's upcoming produced film. What happens when this is revealed is nothing more than a cruel game in which Christian suspects the worst and  with both Tara and Ryan's mind. But it isn't all that engaging if any it sounded that way.\r The Canyons is more of a  film. Nothing really happens in the sense of action or thrills! The Canyons relies on suspense and style, of which for style it get's an Grade A+! Much of the cinematography in the film is excellently done and stylized to a tone that almost resembles the seediness and loneliness of it's own characters. Suspense on the other hand is what barely keeps you going throughout most of the film, but for me it seems just enough that I don't really hate it or love it that much either.\r Lohan has a long and I mean LONG way to go if she wants opinions of her acting career to improve, but for now this role seems to suit her perfectly. Trust me, she's no Marlo Brando (who the hell even  made that reference?). The real steal for the film is James Deen's performance as the twisted Christian, who's sexual style and deviance blurs your vision of him much through the story. In conclusion: Style is something only a few films can master perfectly, and this film doesn't master anything, but with mixed performances and characters that warp your view of the world, The Canyons is a must see for people who want to see the absolute darkness that comes from simple people.",
