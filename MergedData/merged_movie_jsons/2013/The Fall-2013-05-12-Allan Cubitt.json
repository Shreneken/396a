            "content": "This show, as many British shows, takes its time developing. It's not in a rush like American TV. This happens to be one reason why I like British television. Anyway, this show scared the bejesus out of me showing everything in such stark, real detail. It's very very scary to see someone who has such an ordinary life (wife, kids, job) being such an evil person on the inside. Anyway, if you like British television and you like VERY DARK shows, this show will probably rock your socks off. Me? I don't know if I can handle how dark it is in spite of its excellence.",

            "content": "Detailed ratings: Non US users rating: 9.6. US users ratings: 3.6, so far.The above is a very important piece of information, to make up your mind as to the actual quality of this series.I've only watched the first episode so I'll make it short. I thought this dark BBC thriller was not only original, but extremely well filmed, suspenseful, realistic (real northern Irish actors and Gillian Anderson a word perfect English lady, in what clearly is Belfast itself), very well acted all round. It is not a whodunit, we're made to follow from the start both a MET detective and a serial killer's lives, as one tries to figure out, find and catch the other, and the other one fights his addiction to rape and kill on a daily basis. The tone is dark, the story is very chilling, but that's only because the protagonists are so very...ordinary. They could be us, any one of us.It's nice to see a story set in Belfast that is NOT about the troubles, (even though there are - few - references and slang words only local to the north)I really hope this carries on in the same vein throughout the next 4 episodes. While both series have nothing in common, it reminded me of that enthralling underrated gem Ultraviolet, another left-field BBC masterpiece that still has a dedicated following to this day.10/10 for episode 1, can't think of anything yet to even give it a 9 to be honest.Update episode 2, 10/10. Unexpected twists! Update episode 3: 10/10; Infinite shades of grey. Update episode 4: 10/10; I'm bolting my front door and double-checking all the windows. Update episode 5: 8/10. A slightly weaker link to the next season, which I can't wait for, now.I must add a warning for sensitive people: There are a few graphic, realistic, upsetting scenes.",

I mean case and point, the serial killer is sort of an idiot for telling his wife he slept with a 15yr old girl to create an alibi. I mean have a fake affair that's a fine cover, but don't set yourself up for divorce AND statutory rape. This guy is making mistakes left and right and yet the police are unable to anticipate or outmaneuver him. It's not like the killer has an extremely elaborate plan or is playing with them; no! He's horrible at what he's doing and the cops are still having trouble catching him. Hopeful but not holding my breath.",

            "content": "What a powerhouse performance by Gillian Anderson ... this is a murder case, a detective story ... but it also is about feminism in a way. Now you may roll your eyes (or applaud), depending on how or what that word does to you. But while other movies may really use a too obvious way to hammer home certain social/gender issues, this really tackles it all with the right amount of self awareness! The main character is not without flaws ... but no hero is perfect, no matter if male or female.And her acting out (as some might call it), is her just living ... being an independent woman. She may be showing a colder side most of the time, but it is just because she has been hardened by so many years fighting on so many fronts - not just by trying to catch criminals. Her attitude may not sit well with some, but that is just who she is. And yet while she is tough, she has more than a heart of gold. She is the morally speaking the core of it all ... which I reckon some will disagree with - especially considering some of her ... (night) activities.But you shouldn't judge her, especially when you have Jamie Dorman here ... who may not have gone any extra mile in the 50 shades of Grey movie(s - only saw the first one), but goes over the top in this one ... kidding aside and this is quite the serious matter and serious life or death situation that you get served here. The performances are amazing. Some strands may feel not resolved by the end of it and the third season is ... I would call it great, but differently than the first two in so many aspects.A really good show then, that has many interesting aspects, especially when it comes to morals, insanity and social perceptions ...",

            "content": "This series had me gripped from start to finish, and I couldn't be happier that a second series has been green-lit. As a senior police officer leads the hunt for a serial killer in Belfast, we see the similarities in these two amoral protagonists. The story unfolds with an economy of scene structure which never omits important details; every scene drives the narrative, but it never feels unreal or stretches credulity. Beautifully paced, tension abounds with spine-tingling murder scenes. The characters are very well written, and played with pitch-perfect performances from the leads, Gillian Anderson and Jamie Dornan. Another reviewer on this strand didn't like the ending, but for me it was spot on. The story took the time to include complexities and unresolved events which are reflective of real life. Are we to castigate every TV show production team who leave a show on a cliffhanger ending to give them somewhere to go with the next series? If the next one carries the universally excellent production values of the first, then I for one can't wait.",

            "review_title": "Excellent Combo of Prime Suspect & Red Riding Trilogy",
            "content": "And note that both my nods to great crime thrillers were directed to British productions. The hunt for a serial killer gets a complicated but teeth-gnashing treatment in this beautifully produced series, The Fall. Gillian Anderson plays Stella Gibson, a focused, rather humorless, detective who takes control of the investigation once she ascertains that recent murders are indeed the work on one killer. She doesn't have to fight the battles that plagued Jane Tennyson, however. The male officers pretty much cede control and follow her lead & respect her authority and insight. But she is like Tennyson in that she's sacrificed the personal for the professional, indulging in the occasional \"sweet night\" to satisfy her sexual desires. The first episode will definitely hook you. It is as creepy as anything I've seen as we watch the killer stalk his victim and commit his crime. Like the film, The Boston Strangler, we know who the killer is upfront--the thrill is in wondering if he'll succeed in thwarting the hunt. On many levels, the killer remains enigmatic through the season. How I wish American shows--like the recently launched Hannibal--were as top-drawer as this one. Wonderful writing, good subplots, deftly drawn characters that present realistically, not cartoonishly. It's astonishing that yet another serial killer hunt series can provide a story that so skillfully hooks an audience.",

This was even after his confessions and after he led the authorities to where he was holding his latest kidnapped victim. Basically he was left in his hospital bed unguarded and unrestrained. His nurse (who resembled all his victims) was in charge of the alleged serial killer and she became very protective of him, seriously? Of course she also was \"under his spell\". Plus his latest kidnap victim is also in the hospital unguarded and in his adjoining hospital room. It was so ridiculous that it became a comedy of errors....and eventually I started rooting for the serial killer!! I watched the last two episodes of the third season mostly on fast forward. Ugh.",

What a waste of my time. I'm actually half watching the final episode of series 3 as I write this and I'm almost asleep. It's incredibly slow and pointless and huge details I found annoying such as having the killer pretty much on the same room as the victim in the hospital. Unguarded. Seriously?Anyway I would highly recommend the first two series, it really is brilliant. But stop there. You will learn nothing from the third. My rating would have been 9/10.",

For all of you that are used to the fast paced American type of the genre and everything that it includes, the directing will seem a bit/quite slow. But actually it is not because it is very realistic. Real serial, real police people, real police building, with no unnecessary details, no unnecessary high tech gadgets or theatrics. It is purely European (british-irish) style. So, do watch it for what it is and not for what you are used to and what it is not.This is an addition for the second season of the show. The review remains the same except the pace of the episodes. In comparison with the first season they have become faster and tighter. The second season is more personal for both the leading characters. The ending was somewhat ambivalent and can definitely bring a third season if so decided from all parties.Gillian Anderson's performance was even better than the first season. Jamie Dornan's as well. Everything was just as good and a little bit better. In conclusion \"The Fall\" is TV at its best!",

Why is Rose Stag not in a private room under guard ? Why would the they assign a nurse that resembles Spector's victims ? I do hate when they do that !!!! Stella is great as usual, thanks to Gillian Anderson's superb acting, but we need to get out of the hospital now. The writers seemed to have dropped the ball a bit so far, however, I will stay with it on the strength of Stella. I owe her that. I have marked this down from 9/10 for seasons 1 & 2. I do hope the momentum picks up as this progresses as this usually is a gripping drama.",

I'd grown so disgusted with Gibson allowing herself to get sucked in by the psychopath, sobbing because he might die. It was embarrassing.I almost stopped watching. Everything had slowed almost to the point of seeming to be stopped and then it slowly began to wind back up again. To me, the ending is such a brilliant, complex and subtle pirouette of events showing him to be what he truly is (right down to . . . SPOILER ALERT! . . . the death in the mirror) and providing blinding insight into all the women's (save Rose's) 'responses' to him, including Gibson's. It was an amazing miracle of writing, a whole new kind of suspense within itself. Within him, within them. The only one who got away was Rose. Because she saw him for what he was. She COULD see him for what he was. So I went from disgust at the pace and stupidity to astonishment at the skill, complexity and depth. What a ride.",

It's a 'thing' now called Slow TV. I didn't know it was a thing until I started reading the reviews of this, The Klling, Above the Lake, Peaky Blinders and other shows. The reviewers kept coming around to slowness and inactivity as a dazzling new thing not a defect. Like they all loved shaky cam for years and until every movie was a camera tied to a monkey on meth. We can call this KTV where the K is for Ketamine or Klonopin. Anyway as to The Fall it's a straightforward story of tough cop chasing madman but they took that story and wrapped it in hour after hour of mood and atmospherics. I put in 5 hrs of S1 and 1hr of S2 and stopped because another 5 hrs I could have watched my fireplace or caught up on reading. I could put that book down every 45 minutes pay attention for 5 minutes and be all caught up. Maybe that's the intent of KTV; background noise you sort of watch 5% of the time. Give it the briefest of your attention it won't matter. Morally ambiguous good will defeat morally ambiguous evil and so forth.",

The writing is fantastic, the tough old duffer cops show emotion, the strong female lead is a strong woman with dimensions slowly emerging as the series evolves. Without unrealistically ignoring the sorts of prejudice extant in our society the writing avoids her being a typical 'ballbuster' and allows her to develop meaningful relationships and respect among her colleagues.The anti hero is fantastically normal and so much more menacing for this, especially outside of the killing 'events'.The plotting is pacey and involving, the series has become more gripping with each episode.

These criticisms are laughable and shallow in the extreme.GA grew up in England from the age of 2. She has lived in England for well over 10 years as an adult. She doesn't do a Dick Van Dyke mock accent well, she speaks as a middle classed English woman which is basically what she is !!! England is her home.As for it being 'too slow'... it isn't as it builds and shows strong characterisation without spoon feeding the story in the way so many American series do.The subject matter is unpleasant and the presentation of it is very very real. It isn't a relaxing program to watch with a cup of warm cocoa. It is gut wrenching and harrowing. It is set in Belfast and shows the city and it's people in stark grainy reality. I have worked there, it's realistic.All the acting is to a very high standard and the writing is excellent. The director has presented things in a very chilling manner with solid fully 3d characters.This program isn't for the hard of thinking that believe a Big Mac is a quality evening meal to be washed down with a can of pop and high comedy is repeated farts. If your favourite cop series was starsky and hutch or the professionals then it probably isn't for you. you won't understand or appreciate it.I cannot praise this series enough.

The show also follows the life of the serial killer giving the audience an inside look that is rare and quite similar to Hannibal, but less dramatic in a good way. Ironically Gillian Anderson also has a prominent role in Hannibal as his personal Psychiatrist. I wish there were more shows like this on television, but I fear that the average person is more drawn to less sophisticated programming. At times it seems a bit slow, but the characters are so interesting it really doesn't bother me at all. I have yet to notice any glaring wholes in the writing and quite honestly the filming and cinematography is excellent! I pray this show is on for many more seasons to come, often though it is this type of show with all its perfection that gets cut short... let's keep our fingers crossed... they did at least get a 2nd Season.",

The constant whispering and a never-changing facial expression are just pathetic and whilst I realise she is meant to portray a 'cold' character, it is definitely over done.The series itself is poor. It is WAY too long, whole story could have been told in 5-6 episodes as a mini series. There are countless pointless scenes, mainly involving zooming in onto expressionless faces of the protagonists. They can go on for a minute or two and there can be several of those in each episode - it's just extending the episodes for absolutely no reason. The acting is OK but the protagonists responsible for catching the killer just seem to be plain stupid, unable to connect some rather obviously connectable dots.Jamie Dornan's character is somewhat interesting due to how twisted he is, but again not unique. This series is just bland and has no 'wow' factor to it whatsoever, it doesn't stand out at all from all the other crime series out there. In no way does this deserve to be anywhere near the 8.2/10 it currently has on IMDb.The sole reason I am giving 2/10 is because the action somewhat picks up and actually engages the viewer in the second half of season 2. That being said, it then goes right back to being insanely slow, dull and boring in season 3. Not recommended, there is a multitude of MUCH better shows of this genre out there.",

The first season sees some excellent episodes, that must be said. The acting is also pretty good throughout, although GA's 'throaty/whispering' voice grates a bit after a while.However, as the show develops, one started to notice that all the male characters are either; murderers, rapists, paedophiles, wife-beaters, adulterers or alcoholics. Oh, and sexists, of course. For three seasons! Not one 'normal' bloke, it seems. However, all the women are great. It did get a bit tiresome.Next up, some huge plot holes. In Season 3, the killer (a massively violent and physically strong psychopath) is allowed to be interviewed and walk around a 'psyche unit' without cuffs or any security whatsoever. Really? Add to that, the countless times the suspect is in full view of the cops (with all the evidence needed to arrest him in hand)and it does become rather silly. The pace of the show is overly pedestrian, too. As for the the female lead (the'genius cop'), she watches the killer turn his car around 50 yards in front of her on a tiny dead-end country road and says nothing to the umpteen police offices standing nearby. Just takes his license number! While he is the most wanted man in the country! In real life,the lot of them would jump in their cars, call for the roads to be blocked ahead of them and get the helicopter out! As for end, it was a real let down.A missed opportunity. It could've been great. And IMDb's spellchecker recognises 'misogyny' but not 'misandry'. Strange times we live in.",

            "content": "So I have now finished the third and final season of The Fall and here is my review for it. The premise of the season sees Paul Spector recovering from the shooting from the end of Season 2 while Stella is trying to get him into Court and get justice for the victim.Main Character\nGillian Anderson is back for one last run as Stella Gibson and she does a great job here. Her character has developed so much since the very first episode and this last season really shows the humanity of Stella and how the case has truly affected her as a person and as a police officer. Anderson has done fantastic work with this role and it makes Stella Gibson a captivating character that is easy to watch and care about. Jamie Dornan is back as Paul Spector and he does his best with what he is given this season and still gives a really strong performance. His chilling demeanour manages to allow Spector to still be an intimidating presence even though some of the writing for the character isn't as strong this season. These two characters have really carried this show on their backs and have done phenomenal jobs in making these interesting people so hats off to them.Supporting Characters\nJohn Lynch as Jim Burns has been a really strong character in this show, but they take his character in an interesting direction this season and he excels in it. Just like some of the other characters it shows just how much this case has affected everybody involved and him in particular this season. Aisling Franciosi as Kate has been an interesting part of this show and this season you see her pretty much crack and her obsession with Paul is taken too a new level and it really shows just how weak she is and how easy it was for Paul Spector to charm her. I can't believe I am about to say this but Aisling Bea, who I know for being a comedian is here in a dramatic role and she is really good, she plays a nurse and delivers a really strong performance. Everybody brings there top game here and the acting is a real highlight of this show.Story\nFor a final season, the story is really important, it has to finish appropriately and I feel like this show does that. The ending really fits the show and it does justice to pretty much all of the main characters, maybe not always in a happy way but in an appropriate and satisfying way. But this is a weaker story, there is some clich\u00e9 storytelling and I thought for the majority of the season that Spector wasn't given that much to do which was disappointing.Script\nThe script is really good, the dialogue is top notch and and makes you feel like this is a pretty gruesome narrative that has transitioned well from its first season to now. Yes there are some inconsistencies but I think it is told well enough to get over these and make it an interesting story piece.Style\nThe style still has the intensity and drama that the show had before and it really ramps up to get you super invested in the last few episodes. But this show goes a more medical drama route, which feels like a real departure from the show, though it gets over this, I just felt we spent way too long in the hospital with not much going on.Overall\nOverall, I thought this season of The Fall was the weakest, but it still is great and a fitting ending to this show that makes this one of the best British shows that there has been in recent memory.Rating - 8/10.",

I was slightly disappointed in the back- staging of John Lynch in Season 3. I have admired his work for decades. For me, the detail of the psychology and application of it in the British justice system was impressive. Anderson was tremendously convincing as the imperfect sleuth whose personality is in conflict with itself as much as with her suspect's. Her performance is up there with Helen Mirren's in \"Prime Suspect\". She managed to be low-key and riveting. I hope Netflix considers more crime drama of this caliber.",

            "review_title": "Charismatic Killer",
            "content": "When watching movies or series there are a few out there that take the lazy route with a killer who is the most obvious choice for prime suspect. When that happens you feel like why bother when you know the results already. Or if the killer is revealed at the outset you wonder how any police organization could be so stupid as to not know who the killer was.THE FALL is just the opposite of that. In a somewhat COLUMBO mode we know right off who the serial killer is. As the series progresses we witness both his acts and those of the police led by Detective Superintendent Stella Gibson (Gillian Anderson). But the show offers more depth than just a whodunit and how do we prove it.A killer is on the streets of Belfast murdering women. All are a certain type, young and attractive, brown hair, living alone and professionally employed. From the start it gains the interests of the police and DS Gibson is brought in from the MET in London at the request of the department head Jim Burns (John Lynch). The two have worked together in the past as well as having had a personal relationship of sorts at one time.Heading the task force responsible for bringing in the killer Gibson sets about organizing the group she needs to bring the killer in. As she meets various officers when she arrives she uses an ability to scan for new talent to fill out the roster and compose her team. What becomes apparent as the show progresses is that she also fills out the team with potential bedmates, something that will haunt her as the show moves forward.Gibson has a habit of finding sexual partners among those she works with. Never a situation where she expects anything long lasting, these are one night stands and nothing more. But they do tend to create a problematic atmosphere in the workplace.There is also the issue of inner police politics to be dealt with in the series. This sets it apart from most where the stalwart force stands together through thick and thin to catch the killer. Here we have a group that's as concerned about how things will play out in the press as they are in catching the killer. Should Gibson succeed they will take the credit, should she fail she will take the fall. And on the journey to catch the killer they will be the same people who place roadblocks in her way rather than come to her aid.As all of this is revealed we also have the story of Paul Spector (Jamie Dornan). A grief counselor it is Paul who is the killer. We watch as he plans his next victim, stalking her and knowing her every move before sneaking into her house to kill her. He takes the time to insure that no trace evidence is left behind and that he spends time with the victim once she's been killed. This is not an impersonal killer but a man whose fetishes have taken hold of him to the point that he devalues the life of the victim but not the body.The series played out over three seasons, the third of which has just been released on DVD as well as this complete series set. Over those three season we have a breakdown where each one focuses on something different. The first establishes both sides of the coin. The second focuses on Paul's changes as he kidnaps and holds captive one victim. The third deals with his capture and potential catastrophic case of amnesia. No time is wasted in each season and you never feel the need to hold the remote in your hand waiting to fast forward through the boring parts. They're not here.Anderson does a wonderful job as Gibson, a career woman with no time for personal intimacy on a long term scale, just as a woman with needs who fulfills them when time permits and moves back to work. It is her cold and calculating demeanor that helps her to establish links with those she pursues. Eventually that behavior will allow her to get into the mind of the Spector and that's not always something easily left behind. Whether she will remain in that state of mind or break down and realize that she is still human isn't revealed until the final season.Dornan, most known as Mr. Grey in the FIFTY SHADES OF GREY series of films now, does an admirable job as well. The role of the killer here as portrayed by him is one of a man filled with charisma who lures women into trusting him before he takes them out. His character is a family man with two children who adore him and a wife who loves him dearly. His clients feel comfortable with him as he guides them through their grief. And yet at his core he's a twisted man and serial killer. To portray both sides of the same coin is a task that Dornan does well.There are other side stories that are important as well including a teen babysitter for the Spector family who longs for Paul to the point of obsession. He later employs that obsession to use her in providing an alibi. Even though she realizes he's a killer the rebellious teen in her feels he has emotions for her and will do her no harm while she gets a slight thrill from helping him. As played by Aisling Franciosi the character is believable and eventually you just want to tell her to wake up.On the whole the series entertains from start to finish. The characters are fleshed out rather than cardboard cutouts. People have their personal issues to deal with from the smallest to the greatest characters among them. Their lives intertwine and they work towards a common goal, catching and imprisoning a cold, callous and calculating killer. Their lives will be forever changed by what they experience. This is no killer of the week series but one that takes it's time to focus on just one. And in so doing it makes for an interesting show that's worth watching.",

The show degenerated into a pathos of utterly improbable police incompetence, emanating mostly from the supposedly hot-shot chief inspector played by Gillian Anderson, whose entire function appeared to be to watch interminable surveillance and evidence videos while arching her brow and heaving soft sighs, in between wardrobe changes in the washroom where we could get a good look at her cleavage and assess the quality of her latest boob job.Cops swarmed around the perp but lost track of him constantly, failed to locate any evidence, sent armies to tail him but never once thought of putting a camera in his house, held countless meetings where everyone would moronically stare at a screen displaying the waveform of a voice recording (because if they had recorded video they would have caught him in the 1st season), yet failed to make even a positive voice match when they finally nabbed the guy.As the show ran out of steam in its second season, clumsily-inserted vignettes began to appear about Ulster loyalist former-terrorist-turned-gangsters and pedophile Catholic priests. An Ulster loyalist gangster with apparent patronage in high places terrorized the police, the lamentable story of the island's Catholic orphanages was alluded to, and a pedophile priest was put on display, but all of it sanitized and depoliticized to the point of WTF irrelevance.Predictably, more people watched Masterchef than did the show's finale on the BBC, which drew even with a documentary on Apple.",

There is no attempt from the writers to let you like or hate the villain and the same can be said of the detective trying to catch him. There is no profiling of the killer and to be honest the whole show could have and should have been condensed into a 1 hour episode.

The first 2 seasons are pretty similar in pace and style, in darkness and detail. The 3rd one changes all of this and although I did not perceive it as being slower as many have mentioned I did find it darker, more harrowing. Most of it is spent looking at the depth and origins of the killers actions, and in a way these feel more real than the murders themselves. Whilst his actions feel far removed from daily life the experiences that shaped him as they are revealed show how the human in him got broken and then when the finale comes it hits so much harder. It's been a roller-coaster, a captivating experience and I loved it, even if it left me shaken for a couple of hours afterwards.",

A serial killer is on the loose in Belfast (Jamie Dorman). An investigator dispatched from London leads the team (Gillian Anderson), who at first does not know who the killer is, then guesses, then has to accumulate evidence to confound him, because the guy, in addition to being evil incarnate, is a fine psychologist and extremely intelligent.On the side of the digressions, but which give flesh to the characters, there is the sentimental and sexual life of Gillian Anderson. The great quality of the character is that we never guess what she will say or do. Her character remains permanently mysterious.On the side of the killer, it is his family life, with his wife, his children, the babysitter, which will prove to be an important lever of the story.Season 1 sets things up. Season 2 is a bit boring, because of its implausibilities and its slowness, but it revives the interest at the end thanks to an event that will disturb the activities of our chief investigator, but also of our serial killer. Season 3 thus revives the interest and the investigation, and forces the serial killer to develop a new strategy.The series can remind us of Silence of the Lambs (Jonathan Demme, 1991) for its horrible side and its atmosphere of tension film, which is permanent, but with the development of the characters that the series format allows.",

Her wardrobe is haute couture and she's given to wearing low cut blouses and sweaters to show that she is still undeniably feminine and is aware of her sexual power ( and she can flaunt it in the workplace without comment.) She's allowed to exhibit the exact same moral values of the superstud macho cop and does not expect to be judged any differently (which is fine I guess).This writer ( Allan Cubitt) dredges up his themes from \"Prime Suspect\"many years ago and adds even more modern day empowerment to the lead role . He must have had a storyboard up that says; \" How can we wedge just about every current hot button issue into the story and still keep viewers involved in the plot?\" The only thing missing is a couple of gay males adopting a kid, but then again the BMW was being used by the lead character.. maybe there's a limit of one BMW per series.\nWe all know what happens when that sort of thinking gets into a project, it's like a leaking ceiling that gradually discolours and collapses, ruining everything underneath it.This is what happens with this series. In what could have been a gripping and tension filled thriller we see it unfolding like a horse ploughing a potato field.Instead of making the police look smart, they only want to make the heroine look smart and thus it becomes annoyingly focussed on everyone else's ineptitude.\nAdd to that shortcoming the hopelessly managed subplots, where those ineptitudes are highlighted, and you get to the point where it's difficult to carry on watching.The saving grace is the power of the story itself, serial killer stories are intensely interesting profiles. No matter how badly those stories are put together, we all want to find out what makes them tick and ultimately want the satisfaction of seeing them caught (they are almost all men by the way)The entire series could have been condensed into about four episodes and if they had done that, the \"flavour of the month\" issues would have taken a back seat. Some good acting by Jamie Dornan helped me get past the terrible performance of John Lynch but it was a photo finish.\nIn the end, it's just more man-hating breakfast cereal ruining a good plate of bacon and eggs.",

            "content": "The series is about a psychologist who is a serial killer, evading incompetent cops as he kills young women. He is a family man who is fairly normal other than the fact that he enjoys killing women. Actually, the story line is somewhat believable since some of these guys are \"normal\" appearing family men (see BTL killer). Unfortunately, the writers add so much PC baloney that it ruins the whole thing.First, they bring in a female cop who is smarter than most of the local police, especially the men, . She is \"played\" by Jillian Andersen, but her performance is so weak I struggle to use the term \"acting\". She has a smug, aloof look on her mug at all times , especially when she impatiently bosses the men around. She is all dolled up like some aging online hooker, and that blank stare is suppose to look tough, but comes off more retarded. It's like some feminist writer cast her version of what she thought an attractive cougar should look like. What she came up with looks like a sour faced model from a granny porn site with a brand new dye job.Next, they show Andersen hitting on a guy she hasn't ever met, yet she is aware that he is a coworker. I guess they were trying to show how \"liberated\" she is , but it just makes her seem like a psychotic F'bucket. REALLLL Attractive......Lastly, they try to portray the serial killer as an enigma to leave such a nice family for his activities, yet the gal who plays his wife is so unattractive that this idea falls flat on it's face. Speaking of faces, the gal who plays the wife looks like those dolls where they just sew buttons on to a pillow, attach a serrated cap and think they have created art. His kids are really annoying too, as they wake in the middle of the night screaming at the top of their lungs frequently , dance like wooden dolls and don't seem very bright either.It begs the question - did they want to make you wonder why he is nuts, or were they were simply trying to explain it? Oh, and his gluteal faced wife is always bossing him around too . His home-life seemed pretty miserable if you ask me, but I'm not going to say anything.",

The rest is just such waste of time.Lets start with the story line.The police looks so stupid, I hope that in real life they are better. Otherwise, UK is the heaven for criminals. The killer is not even doing anything extraordinary, and it took them so long to find and catch him. Where are the CCTV, surveillance, proper search team?\nThey could not even install wires properly - broke the ceiling. How stupid is that? haha\nThey could not even crack a stupid teenager who was obviously lying. How do you expect them to find a serial killer?Dozens of policemen could not follow one guy - they lose him in a park because he was running. Are you kidding me? How is that even possible?\nThe chief is pathetic, I can't believe that such weak character can manage anyone. How did he even become the chief?And, after he was shot, everything goes to an extra level of stupidity. No handcuffs, no guards, he is treated as an ordinary person, not a suspect of multiple murders, everyone is so nice to him, I almost wish I was him fooling everyone around and receiving such good care.Also, when a guy was murdered protecting his girlfriend, the first thing you do when you get free is you call police, then you go and try to fight.Police captured so much evidence, and still, it's not sufficient. Oh I wish to be so protected, that having all kind of evidence (DNA, murder weapon, victim testimony, videos), the case is so week, like it's all nothing.And in general, it's so slow, I could cut half of the time and speed up a bit and the series would only benefit from it. Even British accent could not make it better. It's like they reduced the speed of an actual tape deliberately.To sum up, it's the city of fools.",

            "content": "I love a good crime drama, but this is not it. There are numerous characters that never get fully developed (Burns, Eastwood, the news reporter guy, etc.), which really hung the show up on a select few stereotypical archetypes. Viewers get a ton of time watching the sexually ambiguous, cold-heated feminist. They also spend a decent amount of time watching the quiet, yet stoic, killer that possesses (mentioned but never demonstrated) genius intellect.If I waned to stay positive, which is somewhat difficult here, I'd say that the show's best moment is the conversation that is had between the two main protagonists in the jail at the end of season 2. It is the most insightful and entertaining 10 minutes of the entire series. I just wish the show had more of this type of suspense instead of watching the surveillance team repeat themselves for minutes on end.Ridiculous aspects of the show- 1. The unbelievably long scene showing a victim pleading for her life. It's so long you could honestly take an extended restroom break and miss nothing. 2. The killer hiding his journal and all other incriminating pieces of evidence in obvious places. 3. The fact that the man-hating cop somehow has a spell on every guy in the police system. She literally sleeps with or has already slept with all of these dudes, while maintaining the most bossy, unappealing, crude personality of anyone on the show (killer included). ^just my 3 favorite ones.

This has been done often and in similar guises since the genre proved a money-spinner in the early nineties.The psychological police process drama of such a story is hackneyed to the point where it has a template for the writer to choose options and even dialog.Why was it popular? Hard to say. Apart from the perp there are only about three male actors, the acting ensemble is largely female and led by a TV star. That statistically may be a reason and no reason why not; men like male-themed films and TV for the same reason.It may have moved things a bit in terms of female/male portrayals but that is moot. Gillian Anderson is photogenic but her performance is copied wholesale from Charles Bronson. Perhaps the right eyebrow will rise in the second series? We can but hope for such a range of technical acting skill and raw emotion on the screen.The production is high quality and the city location adds another layer of tension, or should that be, adds the only layer of tension as the bulk of the piece has already been seen sometime in 1994.",

But season 2 was worse and Season 3 was really off. If you have not watched it don't invest the money or the time on it. The plot is written very badly. There are so many situations that are very silly and does not make sense. Unanswered questions or very obvious points being missed by a supposedly very clever woman (Gillian Anderson). The whole Belfast Police Department is portrayed as weak and incompetent by the show. \nJamie Dornan acts well although, I did not have high expectations of him due to the film he played in (50 shades). But he acts well in his role. But Gillian Anderson was utterly annoying. There was not a scene where I did not get annoyed by her acting. She is trying to portray an icy cold, strong, intelligent and charismatic detective but the way she acts and speaks and also DRESSES is ridiculous. Who dressed her for the show? She is a police officer god's sake but she is under the impression that she is a high profile investment banker or she thinks she belongs to a boardroom. She is constantly in super high heels, figure hugging skirts and silk blouses cleavage of which is always revealing her recent boob job. She tries very hard to look sexy all the time by pouting in 100% of the scenes and whispering for some reason rather than talking with a normal voice. IS there something wrong with her voice cords? or does she think that she sounds sexier and charismatic like this. She puts on a holster on top of a boardroom dress? and high heels all the time.\nIn the film there were so many occasions that the police made stupid mistakes (which even I wouldn't) leading to death and danger to others. I believe the story is full of fillers and extreme slow motion that there was no need to expand this into three seasons. All could be fit into one season and that could have been better. Whoever wrote the story should start watching some of the recent Danish or French crime series and understand how realistic and likeable their characters are.",

            "content": "Set in Belfast this drama followed the lives of two people; one a serial killer called Paul Spector, the other; Detective Superintendent Stella Gibson; the police officer in charge of the case. We see how the apparently charming Spector selects his victims, lays in wait for them in their own homes then brutally attacks them and leaves their bodies posed before returning home to his wife and children. On the other side Gibson is outwardly selfish; she has barely set foot in the province before she is inviting another officer to spend the night with her\u0085 she is clearly used to getting what she wants and what she wants most is to catch the killer. This drama was rather unusual as we know who the killer is from the start; the only question is will his pursuer catch? Gillian Anderson does a fine job as Gibson although it is Jamie Dornan who plays Spector who stands out here; he does a great job believably portraying a man who is a vicious killer some of the time but a caring family man at home. As the series approaches its conclusion it becomes clear just how manipulative the character is as he persuades his wife to believe that he lied to the police because he had done something shameful rather than let it come out that he was the killer. The biggest surprise of this first series was the ending; although it did set things up for another series.The Belfast setting added to the drama; it may be in the UK but it is clear that policing here isn't like in the rest of the country; our heroine must undergo firearms training that wouldn't be required on the mainland and the killer has to worry about upsetting the loyalists on the Shankhill Road in the course of his job.Overall I'd say this series was well worth watching although I wish it had been longer so we could have got a conclusion rather than having to wait ages to find out what happens.",

            "content": "This five-part BBC cop-drama has apparently been such a viewings success that a second series has already been commissioned, which is just as well given the open-ending to this first series. Set in contemporary Belfast, it posits two opposites in the main parts, the cop, Gillian Anderson and the killer Jamie Dornan, the hunter and the hunted, good versus evil, as you can tell a real yin-yan affair but with the differences between the two subtly blurred in parts for dramatic effect. Both are essentially loners and operate in their fields answerable to no-one. They are both users of people for their own ends, emotionless control-freaks and perhaps stretching the term to breaking point, very good at what they do, one profiling and hunting down killers, the other a meticulous but utterly ruthless serial killer stalking attractive live- alone thirty-something females.Although there are the inevitable various sub-plots at play involving Anderson's interaction, if that's the right word, with her professional colleagues and likewise Dornan's home and working life, these are really only there, one suspects to pad the story out to five hours. Thus we get sub-strands of stories which appear and then peter out when the next murder comes along. When the murders do occur they are depicted savagely and make for difficult watching, which makes me guess that Anderson's icy detachment from proceedings is all the more deliberate.At times though it felt like an episode of Prime Suspect, not surprising given that the series creator wrote for the earlier Helen Mirren vehicle while the similarities of the murderer here to the real-life Yorkshire Ripper, himself a bearded apparently happily married family man who killed at night were perhaps too close for comfort. Quite why the action was staged in Belfast I have no idea other than to further demonstrate the BBC's new-found provincialism.I had mixed feelings about the acting, not understanding why such a high-profile actress like Anderson was cast against the relatively unknown Dornan. The latter impressed me more, the actor obviously immersed in the part. I also feel it was a mistake to make Anderson's character so unappealing, even if the writer is knowingly playing games with the audience by having her play the man-using seductress for her own gratification, subverting the irresistible male super-'tec of countless preceding programmes in the genre.If it wasn't for the promise of that lucrative second series, (not another five hours surely!) I'd label the ending a cop-out (no pun intended) and overall felt this series ultimately lacked originality and employed too many subplots bloating its central story beyond breaking-point.Watchable and occasionally gripping, it ultimately fell short of expectations and for me, didn't quite hit the heights or should that be depths, it was aiming for.",

            "review_title": "The end is absolutely frustrating",
            "content": "THE FALL - 2017That is a serial killer series, but we know the serial killer from the very start, like in Dexter, but in this case no notion of justice, of killing criminals. Just killing young women of a special type in a special way. Nothing to brag about. That's the very definition of a serial killer: a type of victim and a mode of operation that are always the same or similar. But we are dealing with Northern Ireland and though the religious details are not insisted upon, there are a few that are important. The serial killer, Paul or Peter, or both according to the situations, was raised by his mother who committed suicide by hanging herself when he was six or seven. Then he went in foster care for a short while and then to orphanages. It appears, when he was a teenager, young teenager, that he was made the \"pretty boy\" of one particular priest, which meant for one year the boy (of 12 or 13) had to satisfy all the requirement of his patron and that could be any oral act or handjob with the priest, with himself in front of an audience, with any boy in the group concerned and any member of the staff if required.That's the most important trauma you can imagine: an orphan, his single mother hanged herself when he was young but old enough to understand (if that sort of trauma is understanding) and then moved from one institution to another to end up in an orphanage where he became the pet, the toy of adults or other teenagers his age or older. It is, in fact, amazing that he managed to get some kind of qualification, to be able to do something in life to earn a living, to get married and have two children, in fact, the third one did not come to the end of his/her gestation because of a miscarriage. But the point is that he had a double life and his wife was in love to the point of being blind to this double life.And this double life is called PTSD and that PTSD can lead the victim to any kind of behavior or crimes, and here it is crimes, you can imagine. I will not discuss the details of the crimes. But what is interesting is that the chase went on for a while but the police only needed to get the hard evidence to arrest him, and hard evidence was difficult to find because he was very careful and because he used at least two identities, one socially known and attached to his family and another attached to his second life's activities. This is a case of split personality. He seemed to control the two sides of his personality perfectly well until he was shot by someone who was connected to one of the victims. This person did not survive the shooting he started and caused and was shot on the spot by the police present, but our serial killer was severely wounded and he lost his spleen. He survived and demonstrated a loss of memory from a certain date to another, in fact, the whole period of the serial killings he was accused of at first.But as he said, the police had done some intelligent work and on the basis of all sorts of documents that they seized in a storage locker under his non-official name, they managed to get some elements about other cases that were before the period he pretended not to have any memory of. So, he was incriminated in cases he could not pretend he did not remember. Was his loss of memory a real loss or a sham, we will never know because of the abrupt ending of the case by the stepping out of the serial killer from the case. He will never speak, and he will never appear in court, so he will never answer a question. His end was violent, super violent as if he hated the main cop, a certain DSI Stella Gibson, he attacked in an interview room, along with her younger colleague. Gibson had just explained how she saw the loss of memory as a practical trick that might enable the serial killer to end up not tried at all. But when the cases from before this loss of memory were brought in, he seemed to have realized he will go down anyway for these older cases. So, he had to perform what he dreamed of, one night: jump and fall from the top of a skyscraper.The series is so marvelously acted that you cannot miss an episode and it becomes slightly addictive. Yet the main actors are too often too static with close up shot of their faces that may express some emotions but at times express the total arrest of any emotional expression due to the horror of the situations or the facts they are confronted to, at least on the side of the police officers, and because a total lack of emotions is a good defense for a caught criminal. Though in this case violence came back when he realized he was just plainly going to fry anyway.I did not say it before, but the serial killer and his orphanage experience must be Catholic and that is in a way debatable in Northern Ireland, the Good Friday Agreement country. Paul Spector, the serial killer, does not choose his victims according to their religion and demonstrates absolutely no religious opinion or feeling or orientation or affiliation. But yet only Catholic kids are sent to Catholic orphanages where there are Catholic priests who have emotional problems with young kids or teenagers, and the priest is very clearly identified as such. Some will say it is a simple fact in the Northern Irish context. But even so, all serial killers in Northern Ireland are not Catholics and all orphans whose mothers hanged themselves or killed themselves in a way or another, causing a trauma and subsequent PTSD in their children are not Catholics, and by the way, the children in such situations don't all turn serial killers, Catholic or not.But a good series and the religious elements are not that prominent as religious facts, so that we can concentrate on other issues, like the alcoholism of the Associate Chief Constable, Jim Burns, because it does not even give any density to the story because alcoholism is not an explication, and certainly not an excuse for several mistakes he did in his leadership role in the investigation of this serial killing case.Dr. Jacques COULARDEAUVERSION FRAN\u00c7AISEC'est une s\u00e9rie sur les tueurs en s\u00e9rie, mais nous connaissons le tueur en s\u00e9rie d\u00e8s le d\u00e9but, comme dans Dexter, mais dans ce cas, il n'y a pas de notion de justice, d'assassinat de criminels. Juste tuer des jeunes femmes d'un type particulier d'une mani\u00e8re particuli\u00e8re. Rien dont on puisse se vanter. C'est la d\u00e9finition m\u00eame d'un tueur en s\u00e9rie : un type de victime et un mode op\u00e9ratoire qui sont toujours les m\u00eames ou similaires. Mais nous avons affaire \u00e0 l'Irlande du Nord et bien que l'on n'insiste pas sur les d\u00e9tails religieux, il y en a quelques-uns qui sont importants. Le tueur en s\u00e9rie, Paul ou Peter, ou les deux selon les situations, a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9lev\u00e9 par sa m\u00e8re qui s'est suicid\u00e9e en se pendant quand il avait six ou sept ans. Il a ensuite \u00e9t\u00e9 plac\u00e9 dans des familles d'accueil pendant une courte p\u00e9riode, puis dans des orphelinats. Il semble que, lorsqu'il \u00e9tait adolescent, il soit devenu le \"joli gar\u00e7on\" d'un pr\u00eatre particulier, ce qui signifiait que, pendant un an, le gar\u00e7on (\u00e2g\u00e9 de 12 ou 13 ans) devait satisfaire toutes les exigences de son protecteur, c'est-\u00e0-dire tout acte oral ou manuel avec le pr\u00eatre, ou avec lui-m\u00eame devant un public, ou avec tout gar\u00e7on du groupe concern\u00e9, ou avec tout membre du personnel si n\u00e9cessaire.C'est le traumatisme le plus important que l'on puisse imaginer : orphelin, sa m\u00e8re c\u00e9libataire s'est pendue alors qu'il \u00e9tait jeune mais assez \u00e2g\u00e9 pour comprendre (si ce genre de traumatisme est compr\u00e9hensible) puis il est pass\u00e9 d'une institution \u00e0 l'autre pour finir dans un orphelinat o\u00f9 il est devenu l'animal de compagnie, le jouet d'adultes ou d'autres adolescents de son \u00e2ge ou plus \u00e2g\u00e9s. Il est en fait \u00e9tonnant qu'il ait r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 obtenir une qualification quelconque, \u00e0 faire quelque chose dans la vie pour gagner sa vie, \u00e0 se marier et \u00e0 avoir deux enfants, en fait, le troisi\u00e8me n'est pas arriv\u00e9 au bout de sa gestation \u00e0 cause d'une fausse couche. Mais le fait est qu'il avait une double vie et que sa femme \u00e9tait amoureuse au point d'\u00eatre aveugle \u00e0 cette double vie.Et cette double vie s'appelle le PTSD et ce PTSD peut conduire la victime \u00e0 n'importe quel type de comportement ou de crime, et ici il s'agit de crimes, vous pouvez l'imaginer. Je ne discuterai pas des d\u00e9tails de ces crimes. Mais ce qui est int\u00e9ressant, c'est que la poursuite a dur\u00e9 un certain temps, mais la police n'avait besoin que de preuves tangibles pour l'arr\u00eater, et les preuves tangibles \u00e9taient difficiles \u00e0 trouver parce qu'il \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s prudent et parce qu'il utilisait au moins deux identit\u00e9s, une socialement connue et attach\u00e9e \u00e0 sa famille et une autre attach\u00e9e aux activit\u00e9s de sa deuxi\u00e8me vie. Il s'agit d'un cas de d\u00e9doublement de la personnalit\u00e9. Il semblait contr\u00f4ler parfaitement les deux c\u00f4t\u00e9s de sa personnalit\u00e9 jusqu'\u00e0 ce qu'il soit abattu par quelqu'un qui \u00e9tait li\u00e9 \u00e0 l'une des victimes. Cette personne n'a pas surv\u00e9cu \u00e0 la fusillade qu'elle a d\u00e9clench\u00e9e et provoqu\u00e9e et a \u00e9t\u00e9 abattue sur place par la police pr\u00e9sente, mais notre tueur en s\u00e9rie a \u00e9t\u00e9 gravement bless\u00e9 et a perdu sa rate. Il a surv\u00e9cu et a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 une perte de m\u00e9moire d'une certaine date \u00e0 une autre, en fait, toute la p\u00e9riode des meurtres en s\u00e9rie dont il \u00e9tait accus\u00e9 au d\u00e9but.Mais comme il l'a dit, la police avait fait un travail intelligent et sur la base de toutes sortes de documents qu'ils ont saisis dans un casier de stockage sous son nom non officiel, ils ont r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 obtenir des \u00e9l\u00e9ments sur d'autres affaires qui \u00e9taient ant\u00e9rieures \u00e0 la p\u00e9riode dont il pr\u00e9tendait ne pas avoir de souvenir. Il a donc \u00e9t\u00e9 incrimin\u00e9 dans des affaires dont il ne pouvait pr\u00e9tendre ne pas se souvenir. Sa perte de m\u00e9moire \u00e9tait-elle r\u00e9elle ou factice, nous ne le saurons jamais en raison de la fin abrupte de l'affaire par le retrait du tueur en s\u00e9rie de l'affaire. Il ne parlera jamais, et il ne compara\u00eetra jamais devant un tribunal, il ne r\u00e9pondra donc jamais \u00e0 une question. Sa fin a \u00e9t\u00e9 violente, super violente comme [...]",

Gripping, thrilling and moving in equal measures, and ending with a cliff-hanger to leave you gasping for more, without leaving too many things unanswered. Anderson was the master of restrained stoicism and strong feminine alpha-ism. Series Three has, so far, seen the killer in bed, not doing anything, Stella seriously needing a glass of water to sooth her throat, but also doing nothing, and nobody else doing anything in particular either, and we're three hours in. Apart from the acid attack (assuming it was acid), nothing has happened. It's a shame they didn't just make the original two series an hour or two longer and wrap-up the story then, instead of stringing it out in this punishing manner. The acting is not too bad given the actors have nothing to work with, but if I'm honest, Gillian Anderson seems slightly like she can't really be arsed anymore, and who can blame her? Another tedious element is that every single professional working with the killer seems to be a young-ish, elegant female, all of whom seem somehow to fall under his spell. This wouldn't work if it was a fat bloke, impervious to his \"charm\". The whole amnesia plot-line is surely scraping the barrel too... such a shame after a promising beginning.",

            "content": "I like British crime dramas because they take the time for cinematography and character development. They generally spend the time to build real atmosphere that is lacking in many US created shows. I am a big fan of Endeavor, Inspector Lewis, Foyle's War, Broadchurch, etc. The Fall is more similar to Broadchurch in its dark and brooding approach to the crime drama. However, The Fall has some major flaws in writing and presentation that really ruin it for the most part.I found the acting to be good for the most part. However, character development was pretty much nil. Characters were exposed throughout the two seasons, but the characters themselves remain stagnant. The biggest flaw is the main character. She is a mysandrist. She treats men like genetic flaws from the normal state (female) and obviously gets sexual satisfaction from dominating men. She uses men as wind- up sex toys and uses her job position to select sexual toys. It is very much an abuse of her job position. All of this is fine. If that's what the character is, that's what she is. However, the writers and producers do not treat this as a character flaw. They treat it like a strength and the preferred nature of society. This presentation greatly detracts from the overall story and gets extremely tedious as the series progresses. Viewers want to see a good crime drama, not an expos\u00e9 on the writers warped views of feminism. This hatred of men is evident throughout the show. All the male characters are thin and uninteresting. They are all doormats.The killer is also pretty much cookie-cutter unoriginal. He is interesting from the point of view of how he likes to invade his victim's lives and privacy. But the follow-through to his killings is ultimately boring. The writer tries to tie this man's aberrations as a normal part of male psyche. They keep trying to tie his behavior to his childhood -- which is simply idiotic. He's deranged -- as are all serial killers no matter what the BBC and Hollywood try to do. This tripe makes the whole investigation of the murders flawed since they are working off the wrong premise the entire time.The final flaw in this series is that they have all the time in the world to develop the story. It's just one detective and one killer. But they still leave gaping holes and pull things in from out of the blue -- such utter coincidence that it defies credulity. For example, somehow, the thug who lost is son and is beating his wife, just happens to know the reporter trying to cover the story on a first-name basis. This leads to a series of events that allows the final episode to end abruptly. There are several cases where random things like this happen in the show and there is simply no reason for it. There was plenty of time to develop a real series of events that make sense. It's just plain bad writing, direction, and editing that leads to these gaps.The ending is silly. It's extremely abrupt. I suppose they're trying for a cliff-hanger for season 3 (if there is going to be one)? But if they are, then it will be of soap-opera proportions. Pretty ridiculous.I'm disappointed in this series overall because of the reasons above. It could have been so much better than it was if the writer/director would have focused the story rather than his own political/sociological perceptions and views.",

Here she stars as the head of a Belfast investigation in \"The Fall.\" Anderson plays Stella Gibson, sent to head up the investigation of a series of murders. It doesn't take her long to realize that they're linked.We see who the killer is, so there's no mystery there. What is intriguing is the psychology both of the killer and Stella. The killer becomes obsessed with her as he grows to hate her - she knows too much about him, and it's made him angry. So he makes it his business to know too much about her.We feel that Stella has a back story, a tragedy in her life - we aren't told what it is, but it's there. She gives away nothing. In the entire first two seasons, she has one moment of real emotion.I found the performance of Gillian Anderson mind-blowing. Colder than ice and professional, she's a woman who goes after sex the way a man does and makes no bones about it. She's detached from her team -- it's only late in the game when she shows a sign of friendship toward any of them. Great to see one of my favorites, Archie Panjabi, in this as a medical examiner.I don't want to give too much away. The story is multi-layered, the characters complicated. I'll just say the story is absorbing and intriguing, and the acting from everyone is wonderful, particularly Anderson, Jamie Dornan, Bronagh Waugh, and John Lynch.Looking forward to series 3.",

Spector is probably the worst, most careless serial killer ever. He leaves mementos of his deeds in practically plain sight for his daughter, wife and babysitter (yes) to find. His MO of a \"warning\" break-in prior to the fatal one ensures that he will be easy to capture once the pattern becomes clear. He uses gloves and mask but takes them off in the process, because why not show your face and leave prints for the nice cops. And he keeps a girlish scrapbook with drawings of his victims, which is probably supposed to be creepy but instead is quite ridiculous.Worst of all, he is a completely shallow character, as is Stella, the detective. Both are mind-numbingly dull, void of emotion or interest. They are further hindered by Dornan and Anderson's wooden acting.Seriously, I could find no redeeming qualities about this series.

I did watch the whole series tho.Things I liked was definitely the portrayal of the killer. It was unlike I've seen before. Not necessarily the most believable one tho - the killer and his wife were not exactly a matching couple and I'm not sure if the character was that consistently written, but he was a psycho after all. Acting by Jamie Dornan is really good tho, I had never heard of him, but if he pulls off his next roles, he might have what it takes to be really big in silver screen.The ending was quite good. Many have criticized it, but I figured it was quite fitting and good. The police work was quite sloppy up until that point and they left a lot of stuff open, so maybe it's not the end of the story.That's sadly pretty much all there was good in my opinion. I didn't like Gillian Andersons portrayal of her quite unlikable character. She just flows thru the series, very uninteresting. Charismatic maybe, but not interesting. Most of the other performers were quite dull too.I felt that the whole series was a bit feminist by purpose. Like the producers had thought \"let's make a detective series where we'll switch the (already dated) traditional male/female setup and let's make the males a lot dumber while at it\". So most of the male characters were really weak and women were mostly perfect wives and mothers (with maybe one exception), vigorous man-eaters or content lesbians. Nothing really wrong with that, it just felt a bit too intentional and it took the focus out of the actual storyline. And I didn't really get the feeling that Gillian Anderson would be quite as desirable as they made her be. I think she was really uninteresting.Then there's a lot of subplots that didn't really have much to add for the story.I was initially interested in this being set in Belfast, but in my opinion this could've happened pretty much anywhere, the location didn't really matter that much.As a word of warning, the show is quite tense and at times difficult to watch as you get to see most of the killers actions first hand. The killings and the way he spends time with the dead victims is seriously disturbing. There are a few scenes that are really difficult to watch.I may give a chance for the rumored second season, but won't waste my time on the whole series if it's the same as the first season.",

However, once Paul Spector, \"The Belfast Strangler\" was apprehended and Rose Stagg was saved, the story was done. Over.Based on its popularity the makers of \"The Fall\" decided to go for a third series which has turned out to be a huge mistake. Spector is in custody after being shot at the end of Season 2 and has suffered \"memory loss\" of all the murders. The problem with that is \"who cares?\" He made a full confession in Season 2, led them to Rose Stagg whom he'd kidnapped and stuffed in the trunk of his car and the cops have discovered a mountain of new evidence in another car he's stored in a garage. So, the only drama in this season is whether his faking his memory loss and whether he'll go to prison or a hospital for the criminally insane. Regardless of the outcome, this man is never going to walk free again.

The success of a psycho serial killing show depends on the depiction of showing the intensity of the fetish perversion of that killer. The Fall did that job meticulously. Beautiful n Gorgeous Gillian Anderson was the best thing that could happen to her role. There is an unique vibe and glitter in her presence that showcase a staggering personality, that is what called a real show !The most perfect job that the show did was not exaggerating or over- qualifying the killer, nor glorifying or idolizing his motives. A serial killer always doesn't need to be recluse. He could a loving father to his children, a loving husband to his wife. He has to deal the redundancy and mundane clich\u00e9 of the day to day life. But at the same time he could do the 'Doubling' perfectly. But when the hunter meets his perfect opponent, he could really get 'hunted' ! The devil lies in the detail, stark-gory-scary detail. And the details of this series parts it from others. You wont feel rush like the traditional USA releases, it takes time to build the story in UK production. But less dramatization and raw nature of the fetish was something 'sickening to the stomach' was present here that you won't be able to deny.

Unless I'm really misreading things, it's wrong to view Gibson as a brilliant feminist heroine. She's as much a monster as the killer, a woman who hates men and wants to destroy them.Take, first, the scene that made so many women cheer. \"Man, subject, f***s woman, object: no problem. Woman, subject, f***s man, object...\" Yes, some people hold double standards about one-night stands, but that's not why Gibson's actions and demeanor disturbed her interlocutor. No decent person in 2013 believes that a senior exec of either sex should be able to order up a one-night stand from a junior employee, which is what she did. Furthermore, no decent person doesn't feel a bit bad upon learning that a one-night-stand was married with kids. Yes, it's the married person's responsibility to be faithful but decent people still don't sleep with married people and, if they do so mistakenly, feel a bit bad about it afterward.Not only doesn't Gibson feel bad on either front, she seems to enjoy both transgressions, the first because it demeans the man more and the second because it will help break up his marriage. Indeed, she's clearly pleased to hear that she nearly destroyed the assistant commissioner's marriage. She suppresses a little smirk when she says it would have been \"unwise\" for him to have left his wife for her.Consider, also, her choice for second-in-command: not an experienced detective (because all of them seemed to be male) but a female beat cop who was only known to Gibson because she had screwed up the case.More importantly, consider how differently she reacts to the death of women and me. She moves into the police station and devotes her life to hunting down the killer of three women she's never met but cares not one bit about the death of two cops, one of them a recent sexual partner. (And think about the moving-in bit. Others say it's supposed to show devotion but I think it's just supposed to show she's crazed in her attempt to avenge womankind. There has to be a hotel within five minutes of the station. No sane person would instead choose a cot and the resulting exhaustion?)What's more, I'm not sure she's really supposed to be all that good a police officer. She does no good police work during the show. She only gets near the killer because her colleague miraculously knows someone who survived an early choking attempt, because the killer's daughter sees herself on TV and because the killer screws up spectacularly in his last attempted kill.Perhaps I'm wrong, but I think the people behind The Fall intend her to be a monster. We'll see in the next series.",

Although in Fall she plays complex women, clearly disturbed and deranged, she make same expressions as since X-files. Now she is older, and tougher. But all in all it is same old Scully. And there's goofy Cantona... enough said. Hey, that's not so bad. What really bad in this show is - screenplay. In first, I thought this was written by some really angry woman, a feminist, or lesbian perhaps. But, to my own surprise, author was man (probably he i s a man, right?). What is wrong, you may ask? Everything. Everything is wrong here. Gillian Anderson is cold, emotionally distracted and deranged woman who wants to be and acts like a man. And that's just a half of a problem. I don't mind if there has to be some \"cool\" women, but this character goes to the edge. What I want to say? Remember capt. Jane from, Star Trek? If you do, you know how really woman in charge acts. Strictly and tightly, strongly, smart and cold-blooded but still feminine. This character of Gillian is like a zombie in comparison to Jane. She has almost no natural, human feelings and emotions. But, writer Allan wants her to be manly in every way. And not only that. She is totally deranged, and proof of that is scene with her and her partner Cantona, when she's saying to him (he is crying like hysterical woman, tried to kiss her and then she broke his nose!): \"Maleness is a kind of birth defect.\" Really, Allan?? In first, I couldn't believe my own ears. Such stupidity you can hardly hear even from a mouth of the most bitterly feminists or lesbians. Author has serious issues or all of this was kind of a joke for feminists. Men in this show are, all of them, unworthy idiots. And women are in need of liberation, they are superior race who can exists without ridiculous and evil men... huh... Even now I'm laughing. OK, if we turn a blind eye, this was solid crime drama with just a few mistakes / stupidities. It could be better, and much dynamic, but for that we would need another author...",

More than half the show the police are made look like stupid monkeys by a serial killer which is not doing anything special to anticipate or outmaneuver them. It's not like the killer has an extremely elaborate plan or is playing with them; no! It's just that the police are scripted to be plain stupid! At one point they have found their main suspect and he is in close range to them, but they still let him stroll right under their noses without making the first move (and no, the clich\u00e9 of \"let's leave him make his move so he takes us closer to where he is hiding the victim\" is not even well developed to justify that dumb approach).And the other half of the series is to show Anderson's wardrobe and lust, which in the end has NOTHING to do with anything from the case; it's not even that the series is deep in character development, it's like the screenwriter thought \"hey! Let's portray Gibson like a hungry cougar that takes to bed anything/anyone that stands near her. Oh! and let's include a lesbian kiss! yeah! Homosexuality out of the nothing should raise the ratings! ::genius::\" I mean, Gillian Anderson is not even attractive enough to fit the role of a woman who is desired by everyone...A female detective who wears skirts, unbuttoned up to the cleavage silk blouses and 4 inches high heels to a crime scene on a muddy road by the country side...

The 15 year old conceited flirtatious teenager babysitter was hard to watch & the serial killer's daughter was a brat. I appreciated that there wasn't any graphic sex or nudity. I didn't finish the 3 seasons because in the middle of season two they hadn't caught him yet & started involving the babysitter. Even though she threatened him he doesn't kill her & starts being friends with her. That's unrealistic. Then when babysitter started doing crimes for him I thought that was way too over the top unrealistic. Aren't serial killers loners? Plus it's taking too long to catch him so I gave up the show.",

            "content": "''The Fall'' is a television series which radiates novelty and originality, consciously avoiding the clich\u00e9s of the conventional shows and succeeds in leaving its own mark in the genre's tv productions history. The story is completed in three seasons consisting of a total of seventeen episodes, and we are introduced in the story of Paul Spector, a bereavement counselor, and serial rapist/murderer living in present-day's Belfast. Spector is struggling to juggle his family life, being married and a father of two little kids, and his secret impulses and actions and he seems to achieve his goal until a new Inspector from England, Stella Gibson, enters the picture. Gibson is a brilliant and driven police officer who becomes obsessed with the ''Belfast Strangler'' case and follows every single lead in order to apprehend him. This is the basis of the show's plot which unfolds in a rather slow pace, as it is mainly focused in the characters of the two protagonists and its development. ''The Fall'' is, above everything else, a character-study which dares to explore the dark side of humanity, represented by Spector and the complexity of human emotions as reflected in Gibsons's behavior. Jamie Dornan gives one of the best performances in a television series in the last years, portraying a deeply flawed but nevertheless human character devoid of empathy and for whom we sometimes, as viewers, find ourselves to root for despite his depraved and callous actions. Gillian Anderson (''X-Files'') does a fine job in her role as Stella, with her blunt and detached manner but her performance is overshadowed by Dornan's impeccable acting. This is a really dark show that doesn't offer any relief to the viewer but this murkiness makes it even more compelling and fascinating and you will probably binge-watch the three seasons. I haven't' seen any other Irish television series but ''The Fall'' made me curious enough to search for more productions from this beautiful country. If you are tired with the usual crime shows, you should definitely give this one a try and you will not regret it.",

            "content": "The Fall is a slow-paced, thoughtful drama that pits a sociopathic serial killer who strangles women to death against a sociopathic detective who bludgeons viewers to death with feminist clich\u00e9s. Both actors are excellent in their roles.The series will appeal particularly to women who believe all men are fundamentally worthless scumbags, because every single male in the series is a fundamentally worthless scumbag. The men in the show range the whole gamut: street thugs, wife beaters, corrupt cops, low-IQ misogynists, serial-killer sympathizers, adulterers, rapists, weak-willed whiners. Every male character is deeply flawed, and no male character ever has an idea or makes a suggestion that is relevant or valuable to any pending investigation. There are heavy-handed implications throughout the series that all men are problematic and ultimately unnecessary.The plot is essentially the same as that of any serial-murder investigation, with the story more or less following the broad outline, pacing and atmosphere of the excellent move 'Manhunter' (1986).Both the protagonist and antagonist are written as complex characters; unfortunately, each of them has at least one dimension that is totally unbelievable. Dornan plays a family man and counselor by day and a murderer by night, leading to some interesting contrasts. But late in the series he also plays the stereotypical megalomaniac cat-and-mouse with his pursuers, and it doesn't fit his character at all. Dornan gives it his best, but the writing is a failure here.Andersen plays a bog-typical lead investigator, but with a penchant for cat-and- mouse games with all the men around her. Although her role does wonders for debunking stereotypes about women (e.g., can't be in charge, can't have one- night stands, can't be a willingly childless bachelor), she is unfortunately neither charismatic nor attractive enough to pull off all the sexy encounters with cops who look like magazine models. Although Andersen is an outstanding actor, and the script is fine, the casting just doesn't work here.There are few surprises, and the plot unfolds rather predictably. What keeps it going are the acting, the excellent music, the brooding atmosphere, and the fascination of killer, who is portrayed as sympathetic most of the time.The end of the series is an abrupt mess, with loose ends quickly tied up and a possible cliffhanger for Season 3. However, for those looking for a feminist agenda in classic crime drama, the series delivers in a big way. The women are all in charge, the men are all assholes, there are lots of incorrect and self-serving claims about the \"matriarchal\" Mosuo people of China, and if you really hate men, there's a lot here to make you feel good about yourself.6/10.

Basically a string of murders are occurring in Northern Ireland, and the Police Service are investigating, but after almost a month Detective Superintendent Stella Gibson (Gillian Anderson) of the London Metropolitan Police is called in to try and solve the case, with Jim Burns (John Lynch) as Assistant Chief Constable. Leading the investigation Stella and the local detectives must track down and stop the serial killer, Paul Spector (Jamie Dornan), who is stalking and murdering young professional women in Belfast, Stella is convinced that she is tracking the same man from a previous case. Through the series we see both Stella reviewing the investigation and doing everything she can to get close to and catch the dangerous man, and we seen see Paul living what seems an ordinary life with his wife and two children and working as a bereavement counsellor, but a psychopathic existence stalking and attacking women, it is essentially the lives of two hunters. The end of the first series saw Stella talking to Paul on the phone, he was speaking coldly and trying to convince her that she will not catch him, there will be a second series to continue the plot. Also starring Valene Kane as Rose Stagg, Sarah Beattie as Olivia Spector, Niamh McGrady as Danielle Ferrington, Bronagh Waugh as Sally Ann Spector, Siobhan McSweeney as Mary McCurdy and Ian McElhinney as Morgan Monroe. As the determined police woman Anderson is a fantastic leading actress, and as the twisted man stalking and killing innocent young professional women Dornan is a brilliant choice, the series is scripted well, and has the right amount of violence and thrills, gripping you all the way through, I cannot for the continuation, a great crime drama.

However and not being a misogynist, since I am a woman, I am quite fed up with her type of contemporary \"heroine\", usually a woman who has \"sex like men\" and who's always right.Stella looks like a femme fatale from a 40s movie, she's an icicle with \"several\" university degrees and who speaks in pretentious, indoctrinating sentences to the men around her, but in sweeter tones to women. Her one night-stand with a guy she just met is presented as her female right to objectify men... or whatever.It does not help that her antagonist is the equally icy and way creepier Paul, played by Jamie Dornan, an actor I don't find attractive even if he's an alleged chick magnet. Regardless of personal taste, his Paul is played as a cold, sarcastic, violent, withdrawn and unsympathetic character and it's impossible to imagine women attracted to him, such as his dumb, child-popping wife and the teenage babysitter.Two dispassionate main characters don't make for an engaging story, albeit the cold and wet Belfast background and some scenes add a bit of thrills to a plot that's quite predictable; at some stage they even go for that worn out cliche of the criminal and the police-person being the same...

It isn't bright & shiny, every character doesn't look like they came from Central Casting and THAT is why you should give it a chance. It's raw, and dark and if you let it - it will suck you in.

You might not like all details but that's closer to real. Let the power of your own mind and imagination and the brilliance of Gillian & Jamie transport you.I compare this to the works of Stephen King - whose written words can scare me deeper and longer than any of his movies. His books are extremely detail oriented but that's what draws you in. You feel there. His characters don't just eat dinner.

Because BBC fulfills that want with gripping, high-quality, crime dramas. The Fall is extraordinarily real, scary, compelling, and just outright excellent! Jamie Dornan delivers a performance that rivals to Ruth Wilson's, Alice Morgan, in Luther. However, Jamie is far more darker and closeted with his emotions. At times one almost feels empathy for him, and that is not right (he's a serial killer for goodness sakes!).Gillian Anderson plays the detective hunting Jamie Dornan's character. She, too, is controlling, dominant, intelligent and somewhat heartless. Although Gillian Anderson's character is aggressive and seeks respect for women, Mrs. Anderson plays the role in a way that the character doesn't come across as overbearing or a woman who has a feminist agenda.The only issues that I have with the show is: the dual storyline involving the death of a fellow police officer and the widow of one of the victim's of Jamie Dornan's character, and the absurdity of a fifteen year old always being home alone when Jamie Dornan's character comes to her house. I find it distracting at times. I'm selfish, I guess. I only want to watch the storyline involving Mr. Dornan's character and the detectives chasing him down.I highly recommend this show if you like to see how lines can get blurred when someone chooses to act on his or her fantasies that are not considered sane by most of society. It makes you ask the question: How does a person become the person that most people loathe-a murderer.",

She also came off as arrogant without anything to follow it up with because she made so many mistakes. Second, this show could have been made into four episodes, literally! I understand the character buildup but there were so many pointless scenes that went on for way too long. Thirdly, I'm not sure if this was the intention but it made British police look real inept. For example, they were tailing the killer but couldn't arrest him until some other cop checked on something somewhere else. The only thing this cop had to do was to look at a newly dead body. But instead of rushing to look at the body, she slowly strolls to where the body is, hears another cop come, strolls back down to talk to the cop in her annoying whispery voice, then slowly puts on gear, and slowly...you get the point.

Her character is a disgusting women who gives her hotel room number to a younger detective she's only met for 2 minutes and he visits because apparently she's irresistible and later on asks for another younger detective to join her team only to have sex with him too.\nThis is made worse when the female pathologist she is having an innocent drink with gets hit on by a man offering to buy her a drink, Ms Anderson's response is to thrust herself onto the female, kissing her passionately and then being rude to the innocent man, the two women begin to make their way to her hotel room only for the pathologist to have second thoughts, maybe realising if Gillians acting is anything like her lovemaking then it's going to be a overly long, boring, wall staring, whispering and overall tedious affair. This appears to be a vanity project for her as she works her way through the Belfast police force one colleague at a time as if this is supposed to portray a strong, confident and professional female, unfortunately it comes across as if her characters lines were written by a disgruntled feminist who has obtained her views from watching loose women ( ITV midday programme ). If her character were a male character this series wouldn't have seen the light of day.Bad casting throughout. Main character and wife are not on the same level. I'm writing this review whilst trying to stay interested in series three but I'm really struggling as Gillian has become so irritating I just want to skip through her scenes. Devoid of any emotion of depth she fails to keep your attention as she stares smoulderingly at inanimate objects and whispers her lines and what is it with the 3-5 second pauses before she says anything? So many English actresses could've done a much better job.Plot and any sort of sense dissipates the longer you watch, especially as I enter series 3 as I'm watching Aisling Bea, who coincidentally resembles the killers victims, is left alone with him in the hospital after the shooting, I can see no police presence, they've all just gone home.I believe the bar has been set high in recent times and this just falls short of the minimum requirements.",

But the woke agenda has infected the entire rotten thing now. It's no longer two legs bad, but ovaries good, testicles bad! The Fall had so much potential. and i really wanted to like it. There is literally not one single male character shown in, The Fall that is not flawed one way or another. Yes you would expect the serial killer to been viewed negatively. But the stereotypes for the rest of the male cast range from misogynist, drunk, lazy, inept and stupid to uncaring and violent with a few more thrown in just in case we don't get, the subtle message. The women of course are smart, sassy and professional the only time they appear flustered is because a stupid man had done something stupid and they have to pick up the pieces. I should have known from the first episode when they two police officers a man and a women go rushing off after receiving a phonecall about a dead body in a house. They arrive and the man who is built like a rugby player is told by the women to comfort the women who has found the body, he dutifully provides the gentle touch to the women while the slightly built women goes into the house alone to tackle a possible serial killer. Of course the lead character hears about this amazing women and instantly promotes her to work with her on the case, all with in earshot of her male partner who looks on with a, you go girl look of wonder. In another episode the wife of the serial killer decides to murder who two children by drugging them and drowning them, but is of course rescued by a passing women, while the cretinous male friend with her films it. It transpires that the women who attempted to murder her kids, is a victim of men and was forced to try and kill her two small children because men decided to prosecute her, against the wishes of Gillian Andersons charecter. The entire series is littered with this nonsense. I have nothing against showing women in positive lead roles, but good grief",

            "content": "'The Fall' is dark, gritty and gruesome look human nature. Many of the other reviews have focused on the 'sexuality, disturbing violence, blah, blah, blah' but the real focus should be on the masterful way the show is crafted to explore the fragile, damage and often unrelenting evil that exist in everyone- though in varying forms. I am sure if you have not watched the show, you are thinking 'what the hell does that mean' and those who have watched are like 'this chick is crazy' but allow me to attempt to explain.Gibson (Anderson) has the coldness and hardness of the woman she is meant to be, the acting is well and not something that needs an explanation. Her character is meant to be some sort of moral compass for the show, to expose, hunt, chase and capture the man responsible for the brutal deaths of women in Belfast. However, I find that she is not some beautiful woman in her mid-life that contains a moral compass- on the contraire; we learn that she is s narcissist, devious and arrogant woman. She has sex under her own terms, with who she wants, regardless of their marital status, keeps incompetence around her so she can manipulate, whether women or men, them when she needs to and secrets that wake her in the night. There is a name for people who act like this\u0085and while we are meant to root for her to catch her killer, I was left with, she is obsessive, manipulative, and cunning. Perhaps to catch a killer is that to know your enemy you are best to be just like them.Which leads me to Spector (Dornan) and he is so creepy, the indifference of his idealist life (the wife, the kids, the home the steady job) is something that eats at him every day and it is evident in the way he lives in the dark, when he is alone. His character is complex, there is no obvious 'oh, you are a crazy murderer'. The audience, I believe, is meant to see him as a man who appears to have what everyone wants, yet finds that having everything is suffocating. I get that others will see him as some ruthless killer who deserves no sympathy, but they are missing the point. There is a reason for all actions and we are meant to find the why? And Dornan does an excellent job of showing brokenness, animosity, hatred, and even moments of compassion (but not where one would expect). There are no clear excuses for him, I mean he kills women for no point (so it seems) simply because he has lost control of his own life and craves it somewhere. His outlet is the hunt, the capture, the ability to suffocate someone else.Past the violence and death emerges the fact that there is little difference between him and Gibson (Anderson) except her way of obsession is legal (and we have yet to see her physically take a life, but she does damage nonetheless).The subplots are what slow the show down. I really do not care about the rich-coke-man-boy and his daddy issues, nor the life of dirty cops. If Series Two can tie all these together, that would be helpful and surprising.Overall, this is a great export from across the pond and if you can get past the imagery of death and violence you are in for a deep investigation into evil, whether accidental or deliberate.",

Dexter maybe had a better group of characters in more number, but \"the Fall\" does a great job of developing its characters and their various shades within a short span of 17 episodes.Gillian Anderson powers through as the ice-cold Detective Superintendent Inspector Stella Gibson, relentless and ruthless in pursuit of her prey. Anderson has made a career out of playing similar women; career-oriented, tough and no-nonsense, carving a significant place for herself in this man's world. She's more of Doctor Bedelia du Maurier from Hannibal than FBI Agent Dana Scully from X-Files here, as she intimidates men, even of superior positions, as she leads the hunt for the Belfast Strangler.Jamie Dornan, a polarizing choice to play eccentric billionaire Christian Grey in '50 Shades' series, proves that he is not just another pretty model. He turns in an excellent performance as the intelligent serial killer who is a slave to his needs and desires. Unlike the usual pop culture serial killers like Hannibal and Dexter, he is not an invincible opponent who eludes the police and stays ten steps ahead of everybody. He has the fa\u00e7ade of a family man, yet he clearly loves his daughter, and has more than passable affection for his son. His choice in wife seems to have been calculated, but he is unable to entirely keep away from the normal range of human emotions. Ultimately, it is his inability to keep his twisted desires in check that starts to wreak havoc in his life, and catches the attention of Gibson.Other characters, even given less screentime, are etched out beautifully, showing the capability of the actors playing them and the strength of the writing. I wouldn't describe the other players here. It is not because ultimately they are not the main attraction of the plot. In fact, because of the strong screenplay, the moments given to side characters become crucial in the storyline. I would want the viewers to find out for themselves and enjoy the show more.Direction: 8\nScreenplay: 8.5\nActing: 8.5\nMusic: 7.5\nOverall: 8",

I love the overhead camera work and the juxtaposition of events that are occurring at different locations. Some of that direction and editing is very clever. Also the portrayal of the killer is exceptionally well done on the part of the actor, the script and the director. It's quite a unique take on the traditional way a serial killer is portrayed.Unfortunately it's let down by a couple of major issues. One is that it's TOO SLOW. Yes, I know it's trendy to say this is supposedly a good thing because it's intense and builds slowly etc but the truth is, it's not good at all. It's boring, full of irrelevancies and makes you want to skip bits. I would love to find a decent quality British murder/mystery series that wasn't excruciatingly slow and dull in between the interesting highlights. I always feel like these shows would have been better done in half the episodes with a lot of filler & sub- plots removed. Anyway, another problem is Gillian Anderson who just doesn't carry the show well. Her acting is wooden and uninspired and she seems to have only one expression - vaguely puzzled with a tinge of angst. I'm pretty sure that's how she looked all throughout the X Files series too. Some of her scenes had me almost nodding off to sleep they were so dull.Another problem is that the series is VERY DARK. Not just \"Dexter\" dark but deeply grim and creepy and disturbing. I don't mind dark but you need something to pull you along when a show is this depressing & violent. Like characters you relate to or some humor or anything that provides a little light to off-set the constant bleak darkness. This is just a lot of horrible people being horrible to each other and terrible shocking things happening to everyone, whether or not they even relate to the story being told. None of the characters are particularly likable either so it's not as if anything that happens makes you care about anyone.And finally, the finale was rubbish. The plot had been developing reasonably well until that point (it IS an interesting plot despite all the flaws) then it's as if everything fell apart. The clever bad dude started acting like a complete moron, the police didn't notice astoundingly obvious things that happened right in the police station and Gillian's character got freaky & weird with nail polish for no apparent reason. And there was absolutely no pay-off or resolution or even a hint of where this might go next. There was no cliff hanger, no answers to the main plot questions and there were a million other unresolved sub-plot issues that I'm not even sure I cared about anyway. It was all terribly disappointing and I felt like I wasted several hours for nothing. I hear there will be a season 2 but I'm not sure I can stand watching it just to see if it gets better or anything ever gets resolved. Especially when it's as unrelentingly dark as this was.",

If you sit through 5 episodes of a thriller, you are invested in the outcome, it seems to me that it is incumbent on the writers, producers/directors to not do that to your viewers. The ending made me angry, and sad at the same time. To begin with this thing is a creep/fest, it will creep you out, so how does sitting through something that is creepy make any sense? At the end the guy gets whats coming to him, there is a resolution,... except here, there are no resolutions. Watch it and judge for yourself.",

I like the slower pace and the focus on various story lines. My husband came home when I was in the middle of episode 1 and he was confused as to why we already knew who the killer is. He thought that it couldn't possibly be good since the 'mystery' was already taken away but he ended up watching the next two episodes with me. Even he got hooked. I love that we know who the killer is right away because we can see what he does leading up to the murder and try to find the signs in his life that everyone else is obviously missing (I would miss them too if I didn't already know that he's a serial killer!). To me this show exerts a different kind of terror because he seems like so many other people. He even seems respectable on the surface with a good career (as a grief counselor!) and a wife and kids.I wish more shows today were like this. I've had a hard time lately finding a show that I can really get into but I'm already hooked on this one and looking forward to the next season.On a side note other women must be more trusting than me because when we watched a scene with the nanny I told my husband that there's no way I would hire a cute 15 year old nanny and leave her alone with my husband!",

However, the second series has proved that more is not better! Gillian Anderson has become a 2 dimensional character whose USP is a silk blouse and frequent glimpses of classy bra; she can't meet a female friend for a drink without an unconvincing lesbian near-encounter; we know at some point that she will have a regrettable sexual experience with the killer; and we all want the young girl (who is displaying the normal confused experimentation with her burgeoning sexuality by trying to attract an older man) to meet a nasty end. There is no realistic portrayal of 'strong females' - instead they just play 'mean girls' who show no respect for any men they meet (the guy in the bar who comes on to GA's friend is not a creep but they take his drinks and dismiss him, although they are professional, successful women). There is no team in the police squad - only GA wafting about arrogantly with all other characters poorly drawn. The one other potentially interesting female police officer has suddenly decided to go back on the beat (and will no doubt be killed off by our serial killer at some point) following a locker room one sided conversation with GA changing, mistily, into another silk blouse while doing 'smell the fart' acting. Scott and Bailey does this so much better and more convincingly and we will now be switching off!",

Second, I used to be somewhat of a fan of X-Files and wanted to see how Gillian Anderson did it in her second series (the first after X-Files). Boy, was I disappointed...I watched three episodes and could not quite get what was the crucial, vital difference between 'The Fall' and its American 'sisters' such as 'The Closer' (based on a similar idea), for example. And finally it dawned on me: THERE IS NO LIFE IN 'THE FALL'. None whatsoever.Characters in 'The Fall' are not just 'cardboard' or 'one-dimensional'. They are plain empty, hollow, zombie, walking dead. Robots. Add to it utterly boring and highly improbable plot - and you end up with a total disaster.Gillian Anderson is just Dana Scully who quit her FBI job, changed her name, citizenship, got the job in London Metropolitan police and made a meteoric career. And got transformed into something quite alien, mechanical, robotic and totally inhuman in the process.The serial killer - whose identity we happen to know from practically the very first moments - has one disastrous flaw as well. There is no evil in him. None whatsoever. Zero. Zilch. Oh, he tries to portray himself as evil very hard. To no avail. Which makes his character totally unbelievable.Boring. Improbable. Lifeless.

While I can't say I feel quite the same love for Stella Gibson, I do have the same admiration for Anderson's acting; I imagine that Anderson puts a great deal of herself into the roles she plays; every word and action is so real that disbelief is suspended .....episode after episode. So that the fiction comes to life on the screen seemingly due to the expertise and effort of Gillian Anderson's acting prowess. It is remarkable, in my opinion. To see Gillian Anderson again play an investigative cop type role is very satisfying because (again, my opinion) while so many crime dramas seem to almost be a P.R. vehicle, Anderson plays a character (in The Fall, much like in The x-files) who has admirable skepticism and highly evolved critical thinking skills....and of course obviously the writers are to thank also for the credible dialogue and screenplay, but still.....what I'm trying to say is Anderson plays a sort of \"rogue\" cop; one who isn't interested in \"playing the game,\" or using her position to feel powerful and do harm, etc. etc. .....she actually cares about justice and the feelings of the people involved in her investigations, but at the same time, just like Scully, Stella Gibson uses logic, reasoning, etc. The Fall is superb. It is abjectly riveting. I have to admit I love the Irish accents (of many dialects!) in the show; but Anderson plays an Englishwoman for her role as Stella Gibson. She is beautiful, smart, skeptical, heartfelt, thorough, strong, brilliant~ Gibson is, just like Scully in many ways...*******SPOILER/ CHARACTER ROLE OF ANTAGONIST********** The man playing Paul Spector, Jamie Dornan, is nearly as frightening as \"Friendo\" fiend from \"No Country For Old Men,\" Javier Bardem in his role as Anton Chigurh; it's mesmerizing. The length and subtlety of the investigation into the murders committed by Spector shows Stella Gibson with remarkable humanity, remarkable intelligence and compassion, and yet superior strength of mind. A great show to binge. You'll be addicted right away.",

Easily deserving a 9.6, it was so good.The second portion of the series is a marathon of police blunders and downright unbelievable faux-pas. Just a few...Spector was the prime suspect and could have been brought in and held numerous times while they did a \"legal\" search of his residence. Instead we are offered up a clandestine search, whereby the keystone cops fall through the attic. Really?When police are investigating Spectors' possible crime site, Agent Gibson sees a vehicle (Spector inside) approach the scene, turn off its lights, back up/reverse down and then turn around. She isn't concerned one bit and he slowly drive away. Only precious minutes later does she realize something was odd.When Spector is being escorted in the country to help locate one of the victims he is handcuffed to the lightest, skinniest officer in the entire police force.Numerous times Spector is allowed to roam down the halls of the hospital and psych wards without any restraints.How has he healed so fast from critical gunshot wounds?Why is the injured Spector placed in the same hospital room as one of his victims? Great plan team!Why is he assigned a nurse who looks exactly like all his victims?During interrogations, Spector is never handcuffed although he is a multi-serial killer. Of course, he uses this \"lack of proper procedure\" to assault Gibson and her fellow officer.After this assault he is calmly taken back to the psych house, unsecured, where after a bit he promptly attacks staff.Why is a regulation pool table inside the rec room of the psych patient's hospital? Didn't it occur to anyone that pool sticks and balls can be used as weapons? Yes, they were.The list goes on....I'm starting to second guess my 7 rating now.In closing, the Producers need to issue an apology to the entire Northern Ireland Police Department for unfairly portraying them.

Many things in life are more effective when they're allowed to build slowly, even excruciatingly slowly. By S3 E6, I realized that the writers had outdone themselves, going a completely different way than I'd expected. I confess that the nature of evil, and nature vs. nurture, what can and cannot be healed, what is the limit of experience, what is love - all these questions, when framed in a serial killer/detective format, are really just extreme philosophy 101. These questions are cute in a movie like Steve Martin's Parenthood. What is the meaning of life? All fine and grand, but for some of us, life went dark early, and the answers that Friends (the series) gives us are wanting. We are not slaked. The Fall brings these questions out in stark relief, extending both black and white to their maximum contrast, and yet with an infinity of gray behind every seemly clear interpretation.",

Slo-mo scenes of Gibson taking her regular swim are totally irrelevant and add nothing to the action. How Jamie Dornan's character, Spector, manages to break into the victims homes to recce the joint before commiting the crime the next day, without neighours noticing and not even causing any damage is a bit far fetched. How he washed and dried the bedding in a night is pretty good going too. The violence is brutal and graphic also, and not from Spector but from the other storylines too. The hotel room where he unscrews the socket to hide the memory card had a lot of wire to play with, unrealistic in real life in my experience. The scenes where Gibson is having or has had sex give nothing to the story and merely waste time. Three series and six episodes in each is too many, this could have been done in half or one series.",

I I can't count how many times law enforcement/mental facilities left this guy uncuffed and under supervised and free to do what ever he wanted and/or ridiculously supervised by 1 person incapable of stopping Dornan if he chose to go violent.Each time they tried to milk that it just became more eye rolling and cringeworthy thus negating all of the serious character work, drama, and tension created by the characters.

The final is dire, little more than an extended episode of Holby City with some police procedural elements thrown in. Cliche after cliche builds and subplots are left hanging.Gillian Anderson does her best, but ultimately her character comes across as a slightly more preachy version of Prime Suspect's Jane Tennison. Somehow monumental lapses of judgement and appalling conflicts of interest are brushed under the carpet until believability is lost. I found myself wondering at times whether her character had first been written as male, with a few speeches and an awkward scene or two added when it was decided to cast Anderson.Jamie Dornan's never been the strongest of actors, but he does well with what he's given. Again cliches abound and while he does his best Hannibal impression he never quite pulls it off.If this had been condensed into a single series with the writing tightened up it would have been a great drama. As it stands, it's a cliche ridden mess after the first series. Sadly the use of a cliffhanger means just watching that one series won't give you the conclusion The Fall so desperately deserved.",

But that doesn't mean the show isn't riddle with tension and confrontation.What also adds some value to the show are the flashy camera angles and cinematography in the first few episodes, which are less common in these type of shows.But the one the two main characters, detective Stella Gibson played by Gillian Anderson, really steals the show in my opinion. Her voice and speech is spell-biding throughout, and make for a complex character all in all - seemingly cold, yet passionate but still with a practical view when it comes to romance and intercourse. Outside the portfolio of cliche detectives we see day in, day out on TV.The only reason I give it a 7, rather than 8, is due to its 3rd season.It seems the writers team changed all together or simply ran out of ideas.Without giving it a way, the first episode of season 3 seems like an episode of ER, which outweighed focus on medical issues. And throughout the rest of the season, the story is much less plausible in terms of policing and prosecution procedures.Despite the compelling characters, that stained a bit the show for me.They would be better off wrapping it on season 2, but overall worth a watch, especially season 1",

Face down, 'it's a female aged 20 - 30, that's clever, guesstimating the age of someone without seeing their face. (It was covered in mud anyway.) Let alone the fact that if people hang themselves from a tree one, they need to be able to get up to fix the rope and two, they need to stand on something.\nBut funniest of all was when they decided to place listening devices in Target One's home. Two or three big vans, scaffolding and half a dozen blokes in white coveralls go into the house in daylight. I doubt any of the neighbours would have noticed or mentioned it to them. Not exactly a covert operation. That was totally stupid. And as soon as I saw a bloke 'getting a power supply from the loft' (really?) I guessed a foot was going to go through the ceiling. BUT ALSO , how come they didn't notice his secret stash just tucked inside the loft hatch? They'd have trodden on it as they climbed in.\nStill watching S2 ep 5 it just gets worse and worse. Baby sitter goes to hotel, police move in to arrest her, knocking on the door? She's destroying evidence for Paul. 'You're under arrest' the officer say (but for what? And where was the 'and anything you do say. etc.\nBut WORSE, Paul is running (under survellance? Really. Pathetic.) and bumps into tattoo man and wheel clamper. Punch up. Police arrive. Bit of shooting. Paul is alive on the ground. Does the police office leave him there and say, hands behind your back and cuff him? No, helps him to his feet, he's still not cuffed just standing nicely beside the officer. He's a multi murderer, violent and very fit. What kind of police training do they have in Belfast. This is absolutely PATHETIC.It's all going very stupid now. Especially the baby sitter part.Up to this point I thought a well written clever drama and I enjoyed the fact it was set in Belfast.\nI could have picked a few other holes, like when he ran from his stabbing. No CCTV in Belfast. There's other stuff too, but the ease at which he strolls into the Hilton, gets into her room and lays around AND THEN HIDES, was all a bit too much.",

In the main roles, Gillian Anderson counterbalances Jamie Dornan brilliantly. You'll be pushed to find one smile from Jamie and there is a danger that if you are not of strong disposition, one can become very sombre watching this and even depressed. One or two twists in an erotic sense are surprising and at least unusual. John Lynch in his paranoid senior policeman role echoes his instability and edginess from Sliding Doors.It's dark drama and certainly not boring. Towards the end, one was worried they would run out of able bodied actors with the riots, shootings and pure violence.Glad to see Stella Gibson survives appearing as a strange cross between an iceberg and hot coffee.She was best of great cast.",

            "review_title": "Good vs Evil",
            "content": "This is one the most compelling crime shows I have seen in long time. This is a pretty realistic show that has two parallel plot lines of good and evil. On the good side is Stella Gibson a senior investigating officer tasked to investigate a murder, she's an incredibly capable officer, on the other hand she's a pretty cold character, lives alone and sleeps with her colleagues without the care if they're married or not. On the bad side is Paul Spector a serial killer targeting young professional brunette women and poses their bodies sexily, on the flip side he's a devoted family man with a wife and two children and works as a grievance councillor. The way these two characters contrast each other is perfect, the differences stand out but it's their similarities you feel; they are hunters and they are obsessive. They are rarely on screen together which doesn't matter because their obsession to learn about each other is fascinating that when they are finally on screen together it feels well earned. Gibson and Spector are like the real-life version of the yin-yang, the black and white circle that represents two sides of a whole with a dot on each side that represent that each side has a little of each other in them.The theme is established in the first bits of dialogue comes from one Paul's victims where she talks about the differences between needs and desires. Like food, water and air is what we need but love, recognition and praise is what we desire. When she's asked if sex is a need or a desire, she says \"Well, both if you're doing right\". The show essentially explores the main characters desires that they don't distinguish it from needs, especially their personal sexual desires; Stella desires to sleep with her colleagues and seeing a case to the end and Paul killing the women with the ritual he applies is his sexual desire.Gillian Anderson is excellent as Stella, very convincing as a high-powered London detective, it's very easy to forget that she's actually American. Since her character is usually stone-faced and cold, the role requires her to give a subdued performance yet she has a lot of expression in her eyes. Jamie Dornan is fantastic as Paul, very subtle and unpredictable that a lot times makes the audience feel very unease watching him. For those who watched those dreadful 50 Shades films and think he's a bad actor need to watch to this to see what real talent he is. Other stand-out cast and characters include John Lynch as Stella's self destructive superior Jim, Bronagh Waugh as Paul's unsuspecting wife Sally, Aisling Franciosi as Katie a teenage girl obsessed with Paul, Colin Morgan as Tom a young detective whom sleeps with Stella, Archie Panjabi as pathologist Tanya, Valene Kane as Rose an ex-girlfriend of Paul, Niamh McGrady as Danielle a devoted PC and more.The show is slow paced but is mesmorising and disturbing, which relies more on atmosphere and psychology than violence or gore. The violence is there and at times is very difficult to watch, it's the build up to it though that keeps you on edge. Scenes where characters are looking around a room or looking at the computer for example all take time but keep with you invested with a haunting musical score.Unlike a lot of TV series' where each season typically has a different story arc, this however has the one arc that flows from beginning to end making all three seasons feel like one long season. The ending to the series does wrap up story, however doesn't end in a particularly satisfying way, which is fitting though for the tone of the show. There may be some things that were left unresolved but as one of the closing lines say, \"That's Disney, this is the real story\".",

I just couldn't take it.Now, I read a review that said that while the first ten minutes suggested the series would be disturbing, that ultimately it doesn't delve into that end of things. Perhaps that's true. I watched about a half an hour and that creepiness was still there by that point, and I stopped so I wouldn't risk seeing the woman's death.I didn't really watch enough to have a strong feeling about how the show would turn out. It's slow-moving and has a chilly, antiseptic quality, but that could be good. But serial killers are just not something I can enjoy, so I'll pass.",

Really the whole thing could've been done in 6 shows rather than 12. The guy is a serial killer and they spend a lot of time showing him committing similar murders. We get the idea and the repetition seems like filler. Similarly, when an unlikable character is in the hospital, there are long, drawn out sequences in the operating room. It isn't suspenseful, it just feels like they dragged it out to use up time. It would've been nice to see more investigation and less slow, drawn out filler.

Its essentially the fall of morality in protagonist and also the fall of basic police standards. Its surprising to see the lack of police detectives in NI and those who are present are just happy to do it as a 9 to 5 public sector job with no urgency and focus. They dont anticipate, act or adapt to a real response to catching a killer on the loose.\nThe Show also shows off a wide variety of abusive elements including exhibitionism, fetish and pervertness not fully connecting the real transformation of abused turned abuser track.\nGillian's acting is more of a tired police supervisor who stalks young police officers and looking to appreciate her own dress and useless introspection. She acts rather slowly to everything instead of upping the ante and doesnt\nlook to be qualified at all. Also her tactical decisions look to be half baked and lack professionalism.\nI had given 3 stars to the show but upgraded it to 9 star just to appreciate the efforts of superior production values, some spellbinding performances and for its graceful handling of sexual acts.\nComing to the performances, i rate the acting of spector family Paul, Sally and Livie top notch. They are so believable and impactful.\nJamie gives us his best performance to date with his split avatar exhibiting rage, anger, remorselessness and also surprising care and agony. \nHospital scenes are realistic and brutal. At times, it is frustrating to watch the ineptness of the police crew but in sum total after watching the show, there is a satisfaction of experiencing the fall, rise and the fall of a flawed character amidst modest surroundings.",

Slow, yes, but it needs to be, if you want a shoot em up or an American style wrapped up in an episode then this isn't for you, but like a lot of BBC crime shows it spends time to draw you in and keep you there.

How many stilted dialogs and long walks down hallways and staring into the rain? Every cop meeting and dinner date is just GA pontificating. very. slowly. and. quietly. and. everyone. hanging. on. her. every. word. I like to picture that in every meeting, after her 15 minute soliloquy, they all roll their eyes and say \"Ok, let's start the meeting and make some progress.\"\n4.

Having captured the killer, there begins a slow crawl into the psychology of Spector. Many say S3 is disappointingly slow, but I'm glad I stuck with it since it has some very provocative moments and actually wraps up the story. While I initially was curious to see Anderson in a new role her constant appearance on the camera became grating at times. Her wardrobe nor expressions ever change; that cigarette-fatigued voice almost like nails on a chalk board. I kept with the show more for Dornan and Morgan (Merlin). S1 & 2 are definitely gritty and shocking; however, it's absolutely nothing like Hannibal Lector, as one review claims the producers were going for. I see no resemblance. Perhaps this is only the 2nd macabre show they've ever seen. In fact, if it had been written and directed in the US, as Silence of the Lambs was, Spector would not have been given such leniency in the psychiatric facility and none of this would have even happened. This is a man accused of horrendous acts of torture upon women and at least one male killed, yet he is free to roam around and interact with the other patients. In particular, more than one person was convinced he was faking amnesia and yet there were no armed guards present in the interview room. In the US, Spector would have not been roaming free but if he had he would have been their very first concern when the other patient started a scene. I mean, it's not the 60s; professionals are more than aware of criminals and deviants staging distractions. And don't even get me started on the lack of security or protocol in the woods looking for Rose. But all of this -the expectation that the viewer would play dumb-was a set up for the events of the show. Despite the maddening stupidity we are required to believe as human oversight, the series itself is worth the watch if you like the tension and mystery that is gripping and surprising. But be prepared to have a lot of questions, most of which can be answered by the viewer's understanding of Spector. Like why did David lie for Peter, actually going to prison in his place? Well, he may have been endebted but I'm pretty sure we're expected to read a bit more into their relationship when we consider how others have become so enamored with Peter/Paul despite that he has no feelings for them in return. And why did he kill Billie in the psyche ward? I think it was to give him relief from the meaningless life he was trapped in. Why didn't he escape rather than kill himself? I believe it's because he realized his life was worthless since he couldn't be a good father, because of his statement to the shrink. I'm glad I watched the whole series. S3 does start very slowly. But then, the series itself has already accustomed us to many drawn out moments. So, it's par for the course. This series won the Edgar Allan Poe award.",

As with the best serial killer stories, the thought behind the character development is intelligent, and very astute in its understanding of the darker side of human psychology - with clever references to existential philosophy and psychoanalytic theory. The narrative never dips in quality, or distracts itself with unnecessary deviations, and it builds into the most incredible crescendo. Ending the penultimate season you wonder where the narrative can possibly go, but the final season exceeds expectations to quite some degree. Also, it is worth mentioning that the actors do a brilliant job with a complex and sensitive subject-matter.",

Another good example of this was New Zealand's Top of the Lake with Elisabeth Moss. This one had me begging for infomercials. The Fall could have just as easily taken place in The Wax Museum. All the energy, so far, has taken place in the swimming pool! I don't know if it was the Director or the Actors or a bad sound crew, but all the whispery, sibilant dialogue has been like fingernails on a blackboard.

            "content": "There's quite a bit to admire in this series: The performances are vivid and motivations are clear; the setting itself, Belfast (in decay) adds both to discovering a great city and a perfect setting for a crime of misogyny; the cinematography, editing and direction are often interesting and appropriate.What sinks it for me is the length. Much could have been consolidated into a 6 part season. An example is a lengthy procedure in an emergency room that may be accurate in its detail (and not insignificant to the plot), but the intricate detail--for most of us--is meaningless.You won't waste your time--if you've got the time--watching a BTK serial killer wreak havoc in Belfast while the police stumble and complicate the situation due to political infighting in a competitive work force, and daunted by a killer, the likes of which they've not seen before. Gillian Anderson, as an outsider, is called into lead the investigation. She's a very self-possessed woman who quashes any trivialization of her gender. She's a great character pitted against the principal, Jamie Dornan, who objectifies women to such a degree he can render them into corpses so he can \"play\" with their bodies before he discards them. The depiction of the crimes is useful but often hard to watch and, in some cases, unnecessarily specific and cruel. Dornan does a good job slipping in and out of his dual roles as a \"straight\" family man employed as a grief counselor then as night falls, a horrific threat.There are several subplots. Belfast's attitude towards women (rigidly defined by the Catholic Church) is notorious. I'm not sure these subplots bring anymore clarity to the proceedings; although the neighborhood \"thug\" climate and anti-police/authority attitude rooted in Northern Ireland's political history and \"Troubles\" adds dimension to a city under siege, not only by a serial killer but by general policing which the public resents.Some secondary characters, notably Aisling Franciosi, a 15-year-old babysitter whose own personality traits have landed her in the perfect job: caring for the killer's children while he's off killing and torturing women. Her sharp perceptions put her miles ahead of Dornan's wife (the always superb, Bronagh Waugh), who at one point is labeled stupid and incurious, allowing her husband full rein at coming and going during all times of the night without even one follow-up question to \"Where have you been?\" A daughter of the killer (Sarah Beattie) adds a desperate humanity, illustrating that collateral damage of crime can be profound.This is a big series and a large production; so, the opportunity for gaffs and poor decisions in its creation are inevitable. But there's nothing ruinous, other than the overly-detailed depictions of the crime can border on arty pornography.There's a long scene, placed perfectly in the drama, between the two principals, who proclaim their \"philosophies\" that's really quite masterful. It's those moments that make the series worth watching and easy to overlook any stumbling. And as always, spending time watching Ms. Anderson work is welcome. She literally brings meaning to walking down a hallway or turning a doorknob and entering a room.",

I was invested enough in the 2 main characters to see it through to the end and the last 2 episodes I enjoyed. But the plot itself was pretty ridiculous and whilst I'm not in law enforcement... I find the lack of competency pretty questionable and it felt forced as to give the third season a plot. If season 2 ended differently I don't think they even needed a 3rd season.\nThe entire show is a slow burn and it is frustrating that after season 1 it goes a bit down hill. But I still found it better than most things I watch on Netflix and I have patience for slow shows.I did find some of the filming rather indulgent and without a direction that I understood... For example the numerous close ups of Gilllian Anderson's character doing next to nothing or maybe buttoning her shirt etc. I started to wonder what the intention of these shots were because whilst some gave you real emotion, many seemed more sexually or physically motivated.Regardless both leads were amazing throughout all 3 seasons.

What is the problem, are there no competent sound engineers anymore? to return to the positives, I found Gillian Anderson's beauty riveting and the elegant way she dresses provoked my (woman's) admiration. The policing seemed fine to me, at least in the early episodes, and the villain is convincing enough to provoke full attention and ample suspense. To my surprise the series went on and on past the point where it could have been wound up, and in the process the tale became rather like a soap opera. The footage of Anderson looking thoughtful and melancholy became very repetitive. The behaviour of other characters started to go over the top in terms of emotionality and irrationality. Some of them surely needed to be told to take a pill, or two! The motivation of the villain is progressively explored, but in this respect my engagement is limited. I think people who commit savage crimes although they know the difference between right and wrong should just be locked away, not have a lot of people pore over them in an effort to understand their motivation, and in the process provide them with opportunities for further violence! I watched through to the final episode, although with a sense of diminishing returns. Still superior viewing, but spoiled a bit by padding and straying over-the-top.",

This is not a topnotch crime thriller as rated by many, but a bland analysis on how not to lead a major crimes investigation. The series is an insult to police women and women in general and policing in Ireland. There are so many holes in general policing practises and procedures. The character portrayed by Anderson is shallow and detracts from what could have been a good story. The second season degrades from thriller to frustration and quickly becomes a snooze fest. Jamie Dornan's acting in the series is very good, but is not enough to elevate a series with trite plot.",

The story was gripping the acting first class ,I binge watched mainly due to wanting/ needing to know what happened next! I would have scored it a 10 but felt it was not perfect as a 4 things that happened were very questionable such as a small child waking in the middle of the night because she couldn't sleep discovering a strange man climbing the stairs to her house reacts by watching him and then calmly asking him who are you? I seriously doubt regardless of age any child who do that! More likely to scream and run and wake there parents. I also thought depicting a scene of a bright white light with a deceased persons voice calling and the opposite side darker with a living voice calling suggesting a person teetering on death was a little uneeded ,the handcuffing of a serial killer to a policeman rather than handcuffing both his hands was strange and lastly after beating up 2 officers to be returned to an open centre mixing with a lot of individuals would never happen if returned he would be confined not allowed to roam freely? So for those 4 reasons it loses a star!",

Also Spector was supposed to go to Scotland. Well Belfast is across the Irish sea from Scotland, and you can't drive or get a train there. If he went to Scotland as was suggested, he must have lied.But it kept my interest throughout, and I thought the acting was good, but the script had some continuity problems. After all one has to say ' it is fiction' or 'just a film' but the time period was set over say four months from Sarah's murder, and Olivia must have grown a foot at least. The ending, well it was not a trial and retribution series. Paul/Peter was going to win and escape Gibson's wrath, and he did. Destroying Katie, Sally and all those that he influenced and murdered. I don't know what happened to Liam? Does anyone or his mum Sally, who should not have been charged with interferring with justice. She came clean in the end, but trying to kill herself and her children, bit like Medea. But it is only a film.",

I wasn't sure if i was left hanging with a i watched this for what, but the ending sat with me. I thought back later to those moments between serial killer James Dornam and Detective Superintendent Gillian Anderson and the supporting characters who were watching their personal relationship unfold over the phone, transcripts and personal journals being read, and observing their interviews. Key words, key comments, key looks, surface as i recalled -- this is a psychological thriller. Read between the lines. The Fall title means many subjective levels as a observer, the interactions of two main characters and how justice or injustice prevails. Wish i knew of this series sooner.",

Therefore much of the story revolves around her living her life and the killer is on the loose. She gets off elsewhere while is the case is running rife! The twain have never met - not even in mind...yet. After a few episodes, there aren't many substantial leads that this so called 'SIO' has. This is drama at its best - I have to give credit where credit it due....but hurts my intelligence to watch it. While I prefer and still watch Euro crime drama a lot more to American ones - this is is overrated. Having Anderson as lead was a mistake, IMO. Daring close ups reveal the wrinkles on her face - showing experience, none of which have boiled down to the story line..more on to the bed! X-files was enough with pretend-police work. She should use her talents elsewhere instead.I had high expectations, but this one seems to deliver little less...Maybe, just maybe if she gets off more solving murders...it would turn me on!!",

Bearing in mind she already slept with her a male and a female colleague. Eventually her sexual endeavours mean nothing for the plot and you wonder why they included that. I failed to connect with her character if I'm honest, she was very cold but tried to convey empathy, which was hard to recognise as she just seemed a bit empty. She tried to show authority by acting calm but didn't turn out well.And the girl who falls for Paul, she got treated like crap and yet got obsessed with him, just didn't seem believable.And the when he goes to visit his victim to do therapy, surely she would remember him?!I've seen a lot of women liking this series and I think it's because of Jamie Dornan.

Luckily I saw this series very late, that is after watching Netflix's Mindhunter's 2 seasons, I have to say that, Mindhunter was the theory lesson and The fall practical examination. One has to appreciate the fact all elements in making of a serial killer are well crafted and presented beautifully together in a classy way, 3-4 years before Mindhunter. I have watched only the first two seasons at the time of posting this comment on The fallThis show is for binge watching at its best; it's at once compulsively watchable and intelligent, well-written and beautifully acted with compelling performances to boot. Excellent Cinematography sets the tone for this dark show. Screenplay is very engaging and authentic but is guilty of slowing the plot many times. Music is equally fine, eirre and subtle suiting the mood of The fall. Costumes, make up and production design go overboard to make The fall as authentic as possible. Editing could have been a little better to avoid such a slow burn show that tests our patience. Good acting performances from most of the actors definitely goes the distance to make the show a intriguing watch. Jamie Dornan as Paul Spector, a rumpled-handsome grief counselor, dad, and husband who has some extremely alarming extracurricular activities steals the show with some really good acting.Overall, if one is interested in serial killers, The Fall might be a blessing as it is highly accurate to the core. But one has to have tremendous patience to go through this series as it is horrendously slow at times but the eventuality of a proper spectacle in return, kept viewers like me going. The Fall is definitely a very good reward for all viewers who exhibit good amounts of patience. Should have been 9 stars but I have to take a star out for its slow burn screenplay.",

I get a kick out of her continuous wardrobe malfunctions: cleavage and material that shows her nipple impressions clearly. Not really a spoiler to identify Jamie Dornan, prior to his big break in 50 Shades, as the killer as the plot isn't who he is but how he gets caught. Lets just say he is a rather twisted and warped killer who leaves far too many clues around his house for his young daughter to have access to.

The main theme of this drama, for me at least, is the nature of obsession. What drives peoples predilections in a specific and often self destructive direction? The acting is top quality. Gillian Anderson does a great job as they tough female lead detective, whilst the killer, played by Jamie Dornan, is both charming, cold and calculating. Its an excellent series perhaps only let down a little by some of the rather inexplicable gaffs made by the highly intelligent killer. The sexual merry go round that revolves around Anderson's character also seems a little implausible at times too.Eight out of ten from me.",

It makes the killer resembles our real life but somehow his background story and the portrayal makes this character more compassionate.Some people may argue the third season is a put down of the whole series but I beg to differ. This season may be in a different genre and pace than the previous one but it is very essential to tell the background story of Paul Spector in order to explain his motives and behaviour. Also, this season creates a moral argument for the viewers whether is it worthy to spend so many resources to save an evil monster? It definitely develops a new perspective to watch this show.",

Stella Gibson is one of the most unlikable lead detectives we have seen. Gillian Anderson's wooden acting with the long pensive stretches where she just stares at someone or something doesn't help. Jamie Dornan is miscast as Paul Spector, the serial murderer. He is too perfect as a father, grief counselor, and husband. He looks like your standard issue, handsome male actor with no menace or dark side. You'd never know how cold-blooded and evil he really is. The attempt at mind games between Spector and Gibson isn't believable. There is no way this series deserves an 8.3. We give it a 5.0.

Why couldn't we have a lead detective with morals who followed protecal about no interoffice relations? This lead detective is a loose woman who has issues with men & behaviors that give her a bad reputation. Realistically this wouldn't be tolorated by her boss. She also ridiculed men & would say things to them like the thing men fear most about women is being laughed at by them. Besides her the other actors were just fine. The serial killer was fantastic! He made the show! I think the ending could have been better. It was unrealistic because a real serial killer would of made a break for it & tried to escape a psychiatric hospital once he had the chance! And he most definitely could of escaped.",

            "content": "Knowing her performance since the first appearance as Dana Scully I had high expectations for this new psychological-profile series with Ireland as background.Sadly watching it had its downsides. The depiction of actually all adults as corrupted and burned-out, emotionally abusive and selfish-hypocrites was just one too-dark streak in my opinion.The camera and lighting is crappy, reminding more of found-footage than professionals at work. Everything is dark and gloomy, dirty and derelict in its own way. Everything is actually UGLY.The great specter, the serial, is another narcissist, craven brute babbling about introversion being identical with ignoring reality, which is NOT true and neither does it make us powerful.Lolita-Sex, as specter had that teenage pseudo-p*rn girl seduced and indoctrinated, didn't free me from the impression that the aging actors just wanted to take-out their frustration about lost youth on a younger generation. For me it failed because that female teenager is such a misbehaving foolish-c*nt that i care neither about her breasts, nor about her unleashed sermon.This is no skilled new NOIR, nor is it it anything special. 'Those who kill' had at least a purposely chosen dark humor about it (in the US version) and the Danish or Swedish original was a solid crime series instead. 'True Detectives' was, at least in season one, more authentic about police investigations.I wondered before how a country being afraid of product-placement can manage to be utterly careless about using prison inmates or patients of psychiatric institutions as actors. It leaves a sickening impact to any mature audience after all.One aspect of the freaky touch is that is recurrent. People in denial actually admiring and near worshiping the serial instead of hunting him down and locking him away. The jolly and hard-working Irish I met in my real life have never made such a bad impression. But then, this is just my view and it is against the onslaught of high-voters...But to give you a hint: ANY really good series is repeated in pay-TV before it is dumped into German Free TV. 'The Fall' was not even a Free TV weekend special, but a simple working day filler. ;-)",

            "content": "I watched seasons one and two and I have really enjoyed them. My only question about the actors is Gillian Anderson. She is meant to play a strong sexually self aware woman who feels she should be able to have casual affairs in the manner she imagines men to have them but does she really have to be so uptight and cold. She may as well been riding B.O.B. for the sort of sex she was having.Otherwise I don't mind her flat affect and her painfully slow delivery of her lines, I think it is to help her keep her accent consistent, it fits with her character as a woman who figures to play the man's cop game if she manages to shred all emotional response.Jamie Dornan in the role is great, he is strange and erratic and has an appropriately off putting personality that keeps you on edge. When he does the mirroring thing with his superiors it comes off as really strange and and aggressive though he is mainly passive with other people except when he is with a victim. How he acts in season three will be interesting.Another reviewer mentioned the fact that they were filming in Belfast and they needed to show a bit more of the city and other places and I agree and it is great to see the actual streets of Belfast and hear the language and the accents. That is one of the things that intrigued me about the show because I had never seen a show like it filmed in Belfast without it being about the Troubles, though the tension does linger and the show does not shy away from that fact and lets it play out organically.I recommend anyone who is interested in police procedure and British and Irish television to give The Fall a look.",

            "review_title": "Very Well Made and a Fairly Original Cop vs Serial Killer Show",
            "content": "Gillian Anderson really led this series as the Inspector who led the task force to hunt the serial killer played by James Dornan. None of the leads were cardboard characters including Dornan who played the killer Spector. He was a devoted family man and a perceptive grief counselor who in his spare time liked breaking into women's houses, playing with their underwear then returning later to kill them. It was a smart, very psychological and trendy writing that covered all the hot button topics related to that genre and the motivation of the killer.But honestly what wore me down was the overly procedural aspect of the show where much time was spent on the minutia of modern bureaucratic police work and even medical emergency care. It gave it realism but honestly was over done. But the biggest drag was the feminist all-men- are-scum aspect to it. It blatantly made almost all the men, including her superior Inspector Burns, look brutish and incompetent. It also had one doctor openly say that women are stronger and need to take over, though he may have been jesting. But it really ended up getting all preachy in a grating SJW way. Then towards the end it started getting sloppy. The killer attacks Inspector Gibson and her young male assistant Tom Anderson, kind of a fey guy, in an interrogation room. Then the other cops just pull the killer off and then ship him back to the criminal psych center instead of at least charging him with a serious charge of assaulting police officers. Then the idiots at the psych center let him go on like the rest of the inmates, instead of isolating him, until he caused brutal finale of the series. Then there was a previous incident when while in custody, the killer took the inspector to a location where he left a kidnap victim in a car's trunk in the woods. Instead of detailing a unit or two to block off the access to the woodsy area where they had him, a car with another nutcase with a gun, who had a beef with the killer over his wife, drove in and shot the killer and Inspector Anderson not fatally. Of course, the female patrol officer and part time assistant to our intrepid inspector, since the males are so useless, finally put this idiot shooter down.The Northern Ireland Belfast setting was also interesting too. Whatever its faults, this show was a million times better than the similar in vein \"The Killing\" with its stench of a million red herrings per episode",

I need to admit that i did not make it through all 6 episodes of that one... my wife did quit after seeing the second one and i gave up after third reassured me that it all goes from one absurd to another and the story goes nowhere!What an opportunity wasted! It is clear for me that this particular story had enough potential for one series, and it should have ended right there.The producers could have followed the pattern of drafting another villain for 2nd series, copycat maybe that would be more devious and cunning then the one portrayed.instead they chose to follow up with same guy, adding just some semi-superpowers that allow him to fool the whole police force and poor Gillian that is left with just the surprise on her face...My advise for you viewer is to see the 1st series, and then drop the idea of going for the 2nd - there is just nothing there and what is even more frightening is that they seem to think 3rd one is a good idea",

            "content": "The Bitter Joy, The Stumbling Mistakes, The Retribution characterize the feel and vibe for the three seasons of the Fall respectively.It is a series, which starts slowly, phlegmatically with an intriguing atmosphere and unfolding of events, then gathers speed, but to the wrong path, until crashing with glorious sadness.My above remarks may seem strange as I rated the show a 9, but make no mistake, my unique rating all goes to the superb performances by Jamie Dornan and Aisling Franciosi, by some of the supporting cast (mainly the daughter with her shiny and believable acting) and to the active cinematography.What I did not like in the show was the script and storyline. Do you start a show on the subject just to have the serial-killer make those blunt mistakes, those pathetic choices and make him go head-on into the arms of the investigating force and then going on with his failures and bad choices?If it was the goal of the creator and writer(s) to create a dark parody depicting a serial-killer's self-destructive journey, well, he succeeded brilliantly.Also, as far as it comes to Gillian Anderson, as hard as she may try to be professional (she nearly succeeds) and put up a good acting play, she just does not do it right IMO, because of her uncharismatic presence, her too blonde hairs in comparison to their root color, her wooden acting, her constant state of mental fatigue, slow-motionness as if she bears centuries of weights on her shoulders and her self-imprisonment creatively in her very personal ivory tower.\nShe had similar problems in the X-Files, with the difference and to a lesser degree because she was then younger and a little more petulant, did not have to play practical lead roles and was almost constantly in the shadow of David Duchovny.On the soundtrack and music, nothing very specific and memorable to hint about. What wanted to be and show itself as suspenseful soundtrack moments just added to the overall depression and void.Watch it for the two actors who shine in it. Jamie Dornan and Aisling Franciosi.\nHer fate and the debilitating effects of her true undying love got to my throat and clamped it hard...Darkly recommended...",

Sorry, but if Gillian Anderson says this is her favorite role maybe it's because the camera lingers on her blank face and her ridiculous blond mane for minutes at a time while the viewer is supposed to feel... something. I was told in a writing class once that if the story has no likable characters, people may not like the story. I didn't find any characters I cared about in this series except maybe the almost pornographically portrayed victims. The frowning upon priest pedophiles, wife abusers and male sexists in various episodes is very morally instructive but I have to wonder about the show's underlying premise that women are turned on by a serial killer.",

The second season also started off well, but then things got awfully bogged down. I fully expected the story to be finished by the final episode of that season, so I felt badly cheated when it ended on a cliffhanger. Nevertheless, even after the long wait for the third season, I still found myself curious enough to see how everything worked out. Unfortunately, the third season is the weakest of all. It's excruciatingly slow in pace, with many long silent takes, supporting storylines that go nowhere, and what seemed to me (as an American) to be absurd lapses in procedure. Maybe things are different in the UK, but over here a confessed serial killer (especially one so physically formidable) would not be allowed into an interrogation room without being well restrained. (Not to mention what happened afterward at the psychiatric facility!) Now that I've seen all three seasons, I still think this is high-quality long-form TV, but for me it can't compare with such other recent thrillers as The Bridge (original Danish/Swedish version), the first season of True Detective, or the ongoing Icelandic thriller, Trapped. One final point: I notice a sharp split in these IMDb reviews about Gillian Anderson's performance. Like many others, I was somewhat annoyed by the increasing breathiness of her voice over the three seasons, but I still find her a riveting presence on screen, and her name at the top of a cast list will still be a major draw for me.",

Gillian Anderson, plays an icy yet vulnerable female police chief and Jamie Dornan is the family man who has a deadly double life. Both play their parts beautifully, never over acting or over stating anything, just delivering believable and charismatic performances in this cat and mouse tale. Because of the subject matter, it is very hard hitting and may be upsetting for some viewers of more delicate natures. You will never see a better thriller, and although I have seen comparisons to the also excellent \"Hannibal\", this is a bleaker, very British tale of the psychology of murder that would give nordic noir a run for its money - even Krister Hendriksen of Wallander fame, turns up in this as a Swedish head shrinker! Scary, adult, uncompromising and compelling drama. Although Season 3 has a slightly different tone, all seasons are stand out. The little girl who plays the killer's daughter is one of the most convincing child actors I've seen for a long time. Highly recommended.",

At the very end of the first season in the phone call between Stella and Peter, Stella bluffs in calling the caller Peter while she is not sure of his name yet, he doesn't answer to that as she rants on about what will happen to him and his family and throws the phone in the water. What bugs me is that why didn't Stella look through the database of the people questioned in relate to the murders if she thinks the killers name is Peter? And they even have a drawing of his face.. it seems very unlikely to me that no one in the huge team working on solving the murders would think to chase this. While she follows every tiny lead that she can find but not this obvious one.. it makes no sense to me and it has made the series a lot less appealing because I'm looking at them struggling to resolve this case while it could have been done a long time ago.I will still watch it till the end because the acting is quite good and I am hoping they will redeem somehow.",

The Fall seemed like an unknown series with few reviews at that moment. In a time of exposure, it's a relief to watch something you haven't formed an opinion of yet.The Fall keeps no secret. Witin moments it's clear that Jamie Dornan is a stone cold killer, and it's up to G. Anderson to catch him, but not without having her own flaws and forming some sort of a bond with the handsome killer.The contrast is amazing. Dornan is a sick psychopath, with a seemingly functional private life. While on the other side Anderson is a amazingly competent investigator, with a dysfunctional private life. And without slowing the series down, or putting to much emphasis on flash backs, you have a whole season of development. By the time season 1 ends, like in Game of Thrones, you will not be the first viewer to fall in love with the attractive, fearless and in the same time vulnerable and human character that is Jamie Dornan.Sex may not be a main item, but as Anderson and Dornan draw closer, the (sexual) tension is palpable which will make you wonder how much they feel for each other, and what will happen if they meet.With much success the series builds on character development, relations with each other, but also with supporting characters. While the hunt for victims and the killer continues without getting too slow.Without giving too much away, it will take a 2nd season before we get to the confrontation between the adversaries who may have so much in common. And that confrontation is what everything builds up to. Both are gods among men and stand above limitations, morals, laws, boundaries and feelings. That confrontation will be a let out for every moment of tension that has been building up since the 1st episode. That moment people will realize that Anderson is not Scully from X-files anymore. But also that Dornan is an amazing actor, able to steal the whole show with his penetrating soul stare.The only downside of the show is the end, which is sort of a letdown. But the biggest lesson besides having a near perfect 1st and 2nd season, is that we have a new leading star, great in all modesty, and rises above the mistake that is the earlier mentioned movie. Fun fact is that his character in FSoG3 will be more like his character in The Fall. Some people do learn.",

My mental state during the pandemic was made worse by this over-hyped show, primarily due to the ridiculously slow pace at which it moves ahead. The whole series could have been compressed into just one season, which would have perhaps made it exciting. But instead, it stretches on for no reason at all. It makes the Irish police look incompetent. They have all the evidence and live location of the killer, yet they simply fart around for 3 episodes before finally arresting him. The male protagonist is not too convincing as a serial killer. The dude has fewer expressions than David Bekham and does not really invoke the fear that a serial killer is supposed to. The writing is very average, and the transformation of some characters is unconvincing. Screenplay is extremely dull and made worse by lack of expression and the slow progress in storyline. The show tries to leverage Gillian Anderson's brand a lot, but her character too is not very well written. A unique, engaging soundtrack would have given this show a little excitement but it's also as dull as it's other aspects. Unless you have a lot of time on your hands, or getting brain-fried is your idea of a good series, I would not recommend The Fall.",

The political and sociological themes are extremely well addressed and add a fascinating element to the examination of human nature, which ultimately is what the series is about.The show is masterfully scripted, shot and the acting is on point.

I thoroughly enjoyed the slow pace and the gradual unraveling of the story line and the mysterious portrayal of the main characters psyche. I liked that it wasn't overly dramatic and that Spector, despite being an abhorrent psychopath, was shown in a strikingly human light at times - not overly vilifying his character added to the realism of the series in my opinion.\nHowever, with the conclusion of the second season and the entirety of the third, the quality of the show went downhill, with the final episode of the show being a complete and utter mess. Seeing as the series was drawn out over a long and slow 17 episodes, which could have easily been condensed into a more action-packed format, you'd hope to get a satisfying end which would justify the build up. This didn't happen. Instead, you get a conclusion which leaves you thinking whether the writers even knew where they were going with the plot until they got to the end and realised it was time to wrap up. Such a disappointing finale to what started out as a great psychological British crime drama.\nThe decent 7/10 rating is solely due to the great first and second season, the third would have received a 2/10.",

Anderson is totally in character, through every one of the intense 17 episodes, and her interpretation of Stella Gibson is that of a strong and determined woman coping with a all-male environment. A role model, indeed. Despite it first aired a decade ago, \"The Fall\" is worth watching at any time, if not even repetedly: it's well written, well acted, it has a consistently strong storyline and is void of any cheap tricks.

            "content": "This is a fine piece of filmmaking, almost like an art film. Gillian doesn't seem to have aged much since the X-Files and her performance in this is strong, as are all the others.The 'pace' and story development of this series is slow, noticeably slower than other, similar vehicles, but I liked the pace . . . it added to the vibe and feeling of the film and the way it somehow felt similar to an 'art' film. The story takes place in Belfast which is a treat for me, as an American, as it provides a window into another culture, particularly the police and social and family culture there. The 'accents' are charming (to my ear) and I had no problem understanding what the characters were saying.There was sense of REALISM to this drama that is perhaps *unprecedented* in my 55+ years of watching films. It has almost a documentary feel to it at times. And it is not predictable, like many other similar films are.Perhaps this is the actual case, but I find it difficult to believe how lax the police were in protecting themselves from the main villain of the movie (Paul). For example, when Paul was interviewed in police custody, he was not in any kind of restraints AT ALL and did what I thought *was* an easily predictable outcome \u2192 he attacked others -- more than once. Also, he was allowed a certain amount of liberty/freedom that was hard to believe would be permitted in actual life. When Paul is in the hospital, with gunshot wounds, the police are not in the room with him or right outside his door . . . they are off somewhere down the hall. One nurse even ordered the chief detective to leave Paul's room. The police did not monitor what Paul said or did while in custody at the hospital. The nurse (the only one ever seen caring for him, who seemed to be falling in love with him) even slipped him a note! What?! He could easily have killed his nurse or doctor before the police showed up. If this *is* actual practice (in real life), I hope they discard it and treat a guy like this like they did Hannibal in \"Silence of the Lambs\". They didn't take ANY chances with him . . . Belfast police took all kinds of chances with Paul, even after he severely assaulted two police persons. I found this laxity annoying in an otherwise excellent production. However, the film did educate the viewer as to how otherwise precise, and orderly and meticulous and efficient the Belfast police were/are and this was a pleasure to witness.",

The writing and pace of this thriller is extremely well done. However, I found many issues made it difficult to suspend my disbelief in the second season. First off - Gillian Anderson's aloof, whispery persona began to wear out for me. I found myself wanting to tell her to quit being such a drama queen and snap out of it. I didn't find her character as believable. Secondly, the writing seemed to weaken throughout the second half of the second season. The dots weren't connecting as well. Finally, I thought the final 2 episodes seemed, rushed, sloppy and wrought with lazy writing. (Spoiler) How did they get the video of the babysitter though the peephole? It was only an eyepiece being used. Sending an investigator alone into the forest to find the victim is ridiculously unreal. And why un-cuff our suspect (hands behind back) then cuff him again to one hand just to stand in the middle of the street. This made no sense except to set up the murderer at the end. Overall it was an enjoyable romp with a very disappointing finale.",

He's not all about looks this was very good performance.Gillian Anderson also plays her part extremely well. A London police worker who's sent in to Belfast to help solve a case. The case of course escalates and they have a serial killer that nobody can seem to slow down.BBC/Northern Ireland have done greatly well here and so it was no surprise the show won awards.The police seem a bit slow, a bit careless and at times some of the acting lacks a bit of quality and urgency. The inclusion of a 15 year old girl was a little bit desperate and in my view it didn't go well together. All in all though a brilliant overall show.",

BUT... the chapters where Spector has a near death experience and talks about it, (or should I say an X-Files type experience) blowed away all the seriousness of the series. What the hell were the producers thinking when introducing this? What is the use of wasting time to show that Spector goes to the light and fights back? Whats the value of it in the story? And in another chapter his nurse questioning him for more than 20 minutes about this as if she was some educated person in the subject? I was at the edge of my seat until these chapters made me loose my respect for the show. First thrilling and captivating, later cheesy and boring. To me, producers did this to fill up space in the plot, because they ran out of ideas and thought this would be an easy way to add up time in the end. I'd rather watch one less chapter than miserably wasting my time looking at how you could destroy a good show. Instead, you could have finished the series one season earlier when Spector was shot (btw he recovers from a major surgery in no time, just like Wolverine could have).

These things have nothing to do with fiction, they are just dumb solutions to push forward when the imagination is lacking. Still I am not really bothered by these, they are much worse and upsetting in other shows.What I cannot enjoy is lingering one subject forever without an end. It feels all their work is focused on one thing: the hope a new season will bring even more income. This just ruins an otherwise very decent show, and it ruins it for good as it becomes more obvious episode after episode.I watched the first season and first episode of the second season realizing that they classically delayed the outcome of the first season into the first episode of the second season at the expense and frustration of all viewers just to make them come back as they did not trust their work enough that viewers will come back without.I watched then few more episodes, then I checked the summaries of episodes in season 3 and as suspected the bad guy is not caught still, probably again in the hope they will get funding and more money with a new season, but that did not happen any more, and my guess is that train is gone. It will never happen.A metaphor for this show would be a sweet nightlong love making night where none of the lovers finish.If you guys think the outcome does not mater and all it matters is the journey, by all means this is a show worth seeing.

She plays this detached icy woman with all stops pulled and makes you still care for her. It's a dicey road at best to make the audience empathize with you and yet feel your aloofness and selfishness mess up other people around you. She is fab. I think Jamie Dornan is good as the sociopathic killer although I've seen him in other roles from his early years on and I can't help but feel he rides the wave as a pretty model boy who depends on his photogenic face and body for most of the time. It's obvious the cameraman was in lust with him in this one. I've never seen so many close ups of sensuous body parts in my life. It's as if the filmmaker wanted us to feel like we were making love to Jamie. I'm personally afraid of handsome people--too handsome that is. I think they are undeveloped, not necessarily their own fault. They've been fondled from birth and told by a million people how wonderful they are even if they just flushed a toilet. They feel and act 'special' but it's that quality that makes them stiff and unreal. This works as a sociopath but not so much in roles calling for human qualities. I think Jamie is most likely just like this character in real life minus (hopefully) the serial killer tendencies. It's his lack of acting ability that makes him so convincing here. He's most of the time on a runway walking in his tight little muscle defining outfits changing a lot and even enthralled in an attic with a mannequin (how Freudian).

In real life, he would have been caught before season one ended.

Then blocks everything they want to do, for no reason ever explained. It's as if the writers said, \"We need more conflict and tension. I know, let's make the police chief inexplicably annoying, whiny and difficult. And if anybody asks what his motivation is, we'll just say, \"To add more conflict and tension.\"There is no reason a violent psychopath would be left alone with a female detective in an interrogation room without constraints or a guard. And there is no reason the same violent psychopath would be left alone in an office with an eldely psychiatrist without constraints or a guard. (Really?

This one goes down in my book along with shows like \"Banshee\", \"the Good Wife\", \"Suits\", \"House of Cards\", \"The Walking Dead\" and other quality shows that don't insult the intelligence of the viewers, bringing adult-ish stories to the little screen. The fact that this is set in Belfast helps with the intrigue.I'm Happy I stumbled onto this show.",

Both cold, calculating methodical and brilliant. It is a dark series so those who might prefer more of the fluff coming out of the US will probably not care for this series. Have just watched episode 3 and am really looking forward to next weeks.

A good cast, an interesting setting and a story that's interesting from the start all help.But - it suffers from being too neat, too trite. The cop vs. the killer, quite a tired concept. And everything is far too neat.This is a person that's killing people. Plain and simple. Be offended. But they go out of their way to make the killer \"complicated\". There's nothing wrong with that, people are people. People do bad things. Realising they are multi faceted and that there is no \"100% evil\" person is an interesting concept.But they almost take it too far... just making him considerate, liking children, hating abuse, troubled past, troubled childhood (they mention the troubled childhood a lot, just so you know he has issues). He's very hot. Not saying evil people can't be hot, but it's all meant to make the viewers feel conflicted. To admire him, yet be appalled. Then on the flip side you have the cop... she's complicated too, of course.... she pursues men, that's how 21st century we are here! She wants to lure him in. Because she's that kinda girl. She even painted her nails to get him! \"Did she just give her number to a serial killer?\" remarks a character, just in case you didn't realise that they're both complicated.... and....What's that....Could she be a clever manipulator too, just like him? Good vs evil... different sides of the same coin?Yes, they were that obvious.Then there's the mirroring, the foreshadowing, the characters talking while they show you the \"other side\" at the same time.He's there while his children are singing happily, not a care in the world. Do you know who HAS got a care in the world? The woman who was almost murdered. So let's splice these scenes together, because that's clever drama!There's also the secondary characters, who come and go... setup, but not fleshed out. Because they're season two. Everything feels scheduled to within an inch of its life. It's an interesting show, good performances... but it just needs to lighten up. Blur the edges. Not making everything answerable and planned. Then it could move from good to great.",

Jamie Dornan is scary as Paul Spector but Spector fits the latest research on serial sexual predators, able to maintain a \"normal\" relationship while committing horrendous crimes. It's especially good at covering highly technical subjects (police procedure, mental health, E. R procedures, law) without being pedantic or over expository -- just professionals doing their jobs.

            "content": "\"The Fall\" follows both Paul Spector and Stella Gibson. Paul is a serial killer. He stalks his victims and then kills them, with the method of chocking them. Gibson is the detective who is put on to this case and has to stop Paul from killing another victim.The directing of the series is decent. It is comparable with the directing of the Belgian TV-show Cordon. The cinematography is very nice at times, but in episode four when Paul is fighting with someone, you can't really see what is going on due to the fast editing and shaky cam, so that was a flaw in the directing. The thing that I liked the most about the series is that they showed everything from two perspectives. Pauls and Stellas. In this way you can see the polices side, and how they try to track down the killer, but you also see the killers side and how he has his own problems. The realism of this series was fun, I love it when there is some good realism in a show.The acting of \"The fall\" was very well done. Jamie Dorman played Paul. He was the antagonist of the story who had the most screen time too, and I liked that they gave him more screen time than Gillan Anderson. Paul was a intimidating and scary person. Jamie was very convincing as Paul, and I think that he was the best casting choice they made. I loved his Irish accent. Stella Gibson was played by Gillian Anderson. She was very good as the detective. Sometimes she was a bit too cold, but I didn't really mind. Aisling Franciosi was Katie. Katie was the babysitter of Pauls kids. She was good too, so was the whole supporting cast, even the kids.The Story was original and good. You may think: 'Original? Oh heck no, it is just another crime show!' No it isn't. It is a well developed story with, as far as I know no plot holes, nor bad lines. The pilot was very good written and had me hooked for season one. So was the season finale, this episode was scary ans tense full. But the three episodes in between were just OK episodes. They were also a bit lengthy. So I think that they should have made some episodes shorter, so that my attention was kept. The characters were well developed, the only issue that I had with the characters was that they never gave Paul a motive for doing all these things to the women. Maybe in season two? haven't see that yet. They should also have gone in more dept with the characters, so you got to know them better, and maybe cared about them some more. I get that they chose to show more of Pauls side of the story, but I think that they should have showed some more about Gibson, it was the most 'boring' part of the series, but I would have like to see some more about her personally.Overall this was a fun show, but I think that they should shorten in the episodes. I is a dark, but short show, that you can definitely binge watch.",

It's also very refreshing to see a great American play the part of an English lady with such conviction that you end up doubting her American Heritage. Utterly brilliant.But, and believe me this is a reluctant but, this is a terrible abuse of a story line, it simply goes on and on and on. After getting midway through the second series, I found myself jumping through the episode to see if I were just watching a repeat of a previous episode, then using the marvel of Netflix, checking the series guide only to find that there is a third season after the same bad guy. Holy mackerel, really? Three seasons of the same story? Please don't get me wrong, I love drawn out thrillers, I even watch the walking dead (an example of 'milking the cash cow' on steroids!) but this makes war and peace seem like a Sunday afternoon supplement. A story needs a basis, twd uses survival and human behavior to extrapolate the seasons. This just skirts the conclusion, places caveats where they're not needed and frankly draws out the plot to a state of total repetitive boredom.I dislike intently the comments about never getting that 90 minutes of your life back, but this is almost days! It's tough to be critical of the star; Gillian Anderson because she is brilliant throughout but with wooden planks around you, even the best actors can only appear as statues in a gallery. Yes, I think the so called supporting actors are dreadful, and yes I compared them to wooden planks.Had this have been three stories across three seasons I would have been glued, but one central story, with little by way of sub plots or stories, it was an \"on and on and on\" for me.I gave 5 points because Gillian Anderson is great, convincing and in my opinion one of the best actresses alive. Also, she plays an English lady better than most English ladies do, coupled with the fact that it's about time it was the other way, I'm tired of English actors playing major roles as Americans and I was born in England! I also believe it's a great story, it's just too much of the one story in three seasons for me.Last words:I'd recommend you watch it, then see if you feel it could have been condensed into one season without losing anything.",

For example we see Gibson back at home in London and she just enters the house, picks up her letters, pours herself some wine and then opens the letter and puts it back down on the table. This whole scene takes 5-7 minutes of our time, and certainly does not add anything to the story let alone to the end of the show! They would have been better of at least changing the \"baddie \" in each season for example letting Katie continue to carry out Sector's work in his honour or something like that. Anything just to change the dynamic in season 2 and 3.Also there were parts that just didn't make sense.

The hospital for the criminally insane had less security than a high school and I doubt violent disturbed killers would be given access to glasses and mirrors in their rooms. Anderson looked remarkedly undamaged after having been punched savagely in the face three times and kicked in the body several times. A beating like that would have laid Mike Tyson up for several days.Still worth the watch, though the final two episodes with their many conversations of measured dialogue became a bit too slow apart from the violent scenes .",

I had only seen Gillian Anderson on the X-Files and I wasn't aware that she actually is British, so I was blown away on her transformation into a British Detective S.I.

Rather, she was more like a detective barbie brandishing her clout and credence with her status, credentials and florid sexuality. Stella is often dressed in pencil skirts, stilettos, sheer blouses, and topped with peroxide blonde hair. This makes her look less plausible, less authentic. I guess it must be fun to be able to play an older actress who can keep up with people half her age, and this is a strong focus of the story-line. Whist Stella has some gravitas, some kind of Luke- warm intrigue, I found Jamie Dornan to be a complete drip. He has no personality, no charisma, no nothing. His character in this series is not dissimilar to any other role he has played including 50 shades of gray. His expression remains the same throughout the series. He attempts to be this brooding, threatening character, yet he never quite pulls this off, he just appears as he is, a former Calvin Klein model turned generic heart throb actor.",

Having been there I can tell. They don't really say where she is from though. But a lot of other characters nail it, which really helps it stand out. The only thing about this show I didn't like is there are no twists and turns and most of the actors seem uppity. Belfast isn't really an uppity town. Even when I visited the churches there the ushers were telling me dirty jokes. That part seems missing, and almost foreign in the show. The story lays itself straight out there. WYSIWYG story telling. For that reason I give it a 7/10. It really needs more mystery. Love the scenes of Belfast though. I wish they invoked more of the history of the city. Would have been nice to have seen the peace walls and how they have an effect on the city. The bad guy is very well acted. He plays the dynamic of being normal and bad to a T.

And as some other reviews have mentioned, her whispering tone, was so grating, I felt like shaking her up. \nThe serial killer too is flat, boring, which is surprising, considering his brutality and his myriad festishes. Not once does one feel a morbid fascination towards him. Though in the end the writer does dwell into his traumatic past, I still felt unaffected.\nThe repeated incompetence of the police and then the shocking carlessness of the criminal psychiatric hospital which allowed a dangerous psychopath to move around inside freely, is beyond comprehension.",

            "content": "The Fall is not like any other television series I've ever seen, its more like one continuous movie. Each episode melds into the next, all the same characters in season one and two in seemingly every episode, rather than the more typical American format of different guest stars in each episode.\nGillian Anderson is superb as the lead investigator. Her English accent threw me at first, I know she's American but she puts on a very good impression as a Brit. She's the only American in the choice cast.\nOne scene in the second season knocked me out of my chair. Gillian Anderson's character went to the powder room leaving her female East Indian forensics partner alone in a booth at a bar. When she returned a handsome straight guy was making his moves on her partner, Anderson swooped in and tongue kissed her partner like Lesbian lovers! The guy was holding two margaritas, one for her partner and one for him. Anderson smoothly snatched the drinks from his hands, and thanked him \"keep them coming.\" The stunned Lothario responded \"but I'm not the waiter!\" To which Anderson cooly responded, \"then why are you standing there?\"\nWas it just a clever move to deflate the unwelcome advance, or are they really a Lesbian couple? There is a strong bond between the two women, how strong and deep has yet to be revealed. Absolutely delicious.\nStunning Ulster native Jamie Dornan is wonderful as the glamorous, and sexy serial killer. There's plenty of scenes of him almost completely nude.\nJamie Dornan and Gillian Anderson share the DVD cover.\nThe editing is totally different than any American program I've ever seen. The series is set in Belfast, Northern Ireland in the United Kingdom, and explores some very dark sexual themes that might unsettle some people.\nThe series is exquisitely filmed with many gorgeous scenes of Ireland as a backdrop. It is shot on location, but I would not have recognized Northern Ireland if I wasn't told that was what I was looking at.\nThe program has nothing to do with the sectarian conflicts we associate with the region.\nI am tempted to compare The Fall to Law and Order: Special Victims Unit, another program about sex crimes featuring a powerful female lead, but The Fall is so much more sophisticated, and complex that the older series pales in comparison.\nThe Fall delves much more deeply into the criminal psyche, and into the lives of all the players, including the police.",

For example, we are led to believe that Jim Burns is a survivor of the same boys' institute where Paul was abused as a young teen. If this series had been done in the US, Paul would have escaped the hospital and died in a fiery crash or a hail of bullets after a lengthy and pointless car chase.

They both make the characters come alive. Gillian plays a detective who, hit on by her male colleagues throughout her career, has to fight against the double standard for women. Jaime plays a normal guy with a wife and kids who is a serial killer. That is a stretch to believe. They hit all of the politically correct cliches: no father, abused in an orphanage, mother kills herself. Mommy and Daddy issues. But in seasons 1 and 2 Jamie pulls it off.In season three there is a big drop-off in writing (Gillian and Jaime are still doing a great job in their roles). Some of the story line is silly. Aisling Bea plays a nurse who apparently is not deterred in finding a serial killer sympathetic. Arresting and the questioning a suspected serial killer without putting the killer in handcuffs, really? Teenage girl longing to be with a serial killer even after he tells her how he sees the world, really?Gillian is supposed to play a women in a man's world, a detective. Who has slept with a man who is now her boss. The boss never got over her and tells her years later he would give up everything to be with her, really?The ending is awful. Jamie hangs himself in a psych ward. Totally contrary to the character development the writers spent building in seasons 1 and 2.",

Well acted, well cast and a great story line.I got the impression that halfway through season 2 there was a change in course. I don't know if there where changes behind the scenes, they suddenly got approval for a third season or just how it was edited. But this show that has so effectively built story lines methodically....perfecting the art of suspense....spends 3 episodes of the police identifying Spector, tracking him down, building towards capturing him, slowly, slowly, build, build - and then all of a sudden he's in custody in the most anti-climatic chase scene ever.And then halfway through the second season these really apparent plot issues start appearing. The whole facade around hinting to the press that the Jane Doe suicide victim they'd found was Rose Stag in order to 'draw the killer out' but then never even showing the viewer Spector hearing that information, let alone doing anything with that - the pointless lesbian kiss that felt like it was just put in there for the magazine pictures - and the just every aspect of the final episode, where in my opinion the show just got so unbelievably unrealistic and far-fetched it starts to affect your enjoyment. We all know that how it plays out on TV isn't the same as real life - but you can take the fantasy too far - and things like the police helicopter picking up on the photographer in the woods - but doesn't detect the car he got out of, or the man who was driving said car then get out and walk towards the scene, gun in hand....it's too much (and that's before we move on to Stella Gibson's miraculous healing powers reducing the effects of an assault where she suffered facial fractures to just a scratch in 48 hours).The third season was then too slow - you lose interest. There's not a mystery to solve or a killer to catch anymore and I don't think they did a good enough job of replacing that. Saying that the final episode, whilst equally gripping, was very exciting and entertaining and whilst it wasn't an ending I wanted, it did at least give the storyline closure.I also found something about Gillian Anderson's character a bit cold and difficult to warm too. Jamie Doran on the other hand is a fine actor.There are murmurs of it being brought back with a different story line and I'd be hugely interested in watching that and seeing how they would take the show forward on a different case.First season is a cracking watch - later episodes aren't bad....just doesn't live up to cracking expectations we had.",

The role of \"Paul Spector\" was his break-out performance, and is an astonishing tour-de-force. Spector (in one scene he pronounces it 'Spec-tor' as if he's sick and tired of listening to people mispronounce it as 'Specter') is a Jekyll and Hyde character; a patient and empathetic bereavement counsellor, a loving husband and father who dotes on his children... a cruel, sadistic sexual deviant, serial killer, and homicidal maniac.Anderson and Dornan are surrounded by an extensive supporting cast who all give committed performances in service of the story, which plays out over 3 series for a total of 17 episodes; the series is made to binge watch as seasons 1, and especially season 2, both end on huge cliff hangers.Set in the Belfast of 2012 in the aftermath of \"The Troubles,\" there's a constant background threat of violence against the police, so, uniquely for the UK, individual patrol officers on the street are armed.But this isn't an \"action\" show by any means, as I said above, this is a slow-burn of a series, with long, slow takes building tension and focusing on individual characters, taking the time to get to know Gibson, Spector, and the main supporting characters, both their interpersonal relationships and their inner lives. These scenes are punctuated by bursts of brutal and sometimes savage, especially for its time, violence, some of which is genuinely shocking, particularly during the final episode.This is one of the best \"limited series\" I've seen in years, it takes its time building the characters and the World they exist in, even the secondary characters, so they feel just as real as the environment they inhabit, and I'm sorry it took so long for me to catch up with it.Allan Cubitt, the creator and writer of the show, did say he'd like to write another story to explore DS Gibson's life and career in the aftermath of the Spector case, but said it \"isn't going to be straight away.\" Gillian Anderson said she'd be \"excited... to see what transpires in Stella's life afterwards,\" but 6yrs on from the final season I guess that hasn't worked out.",

Absolutely boring, with hardly anything new added to the mix until a few snippets in the 5th episode, and then a fizzle rather than a bang for episode 6.Such a shame, as S1 was probably a 9/10, S1 & S2 taken as a whole would probably have merited an 8/10, but taking the whole three seasons in their entirety is barely scrapes a 6/10.It's also worth adding that although, as mentioned, Anderson is amazing, some of the other cast (the daughter in particular) are wooden in the extreme. As for Dornon, I've no idea what the fascination was with him, and I'm not surprised his career has hardly been stellar beyond the tacky Fifty Shades franchise.",

            "content": "Totally overrated. The story line is the Gillian Anderson character is \"cold and steely\", Wooden and mannequin like is more appropriate. I am a fan of Anderson and really like her but she was terrible in this show. The only reasons to watch in my opinion are for the outstanding performances of Jamie Dornan as the killer and Aisling Franciosi as an obsessed teenager who desires to enter into the dark world of the Dornan character. In addition to Anderson's terrible performance and the slow and boring periods throughout this one season too long show, were back stories that were a waste of time, such as an abused wife and her punk bully husband. Another boring subplot has Anderson meeting a fellow Police Officer at a crime scene and after 5 minutes asks him would he like to have sex. I guess this was to show (as she later preaches to someone) how women can be just as horny as men. Dumb scene. Just filler as was another unnecessary character a police official named Jim Burns played terribly by John Lynch. Burns is a weak man, and a pencil pushing wimp who is madly in love with Stella, Anderson's character. Without Dornan and Franciosi's terrific performances, I'd give this dud of a show a 1 rating. Anderson sleepwalks throughout the entire series dispensing what the writers apparently believe are profound words of wisdom and genius. Her alleged \"deep insights\" are boring and a waste of time. Let's get Dornan back on the screen! He is brilliant as a tortured Sociopathic killer. He is meticulous, cunning and vulnerable. I also liked the performance of Bronagh Waugh, who played Sally Ann, the clueless yet interesting wife of the killer. She comes off as a good person, good mother and a good wife. She didn't deserve to be married to her creepy husband. She works as a neonatal nurse in a hospital and there is a scene where she sits with a mother and her dying baby that will break the heart of even the hardest of us. It is a shame such a wonderful woman wound up marrying such a monster like Paul, the killer. I gave this series a 4 rating (out of 10)like I said, mostly for the Killer and his obsessive groupie who was his family's babysitter. If you're snowed in or there is nothing, and I mean nothing else, this works only at times.",

I found Jamie Dornan in a difficult role because he should work on his behavior, looks, expressions.. the actor speaks not too much I couldn't imagine him doing crimes. His personality in the daily life was boring, hard to follow and not captive at all.I thought that he was jealous from woman having a successful life, because he works as an employee that receives instructions and appreciations from his boss.I felt his personnality as a good person more touching. Like when he rejects Katie more than once.Discovering that he was the killer so easy was disapoiting, also, why too much long to capture him? It was funny at some point.The thirth serie was a desaster. All scenes could be played in two episodes.The idea of an old crime to.shine a light on his amnesia was brilliant but that's all, the other details, the end has none sense.He was died, ok, the idea of keeping him alive is not more exciting but the show finished before telling who is The real paul spector !Gillian was exceptional.

            "content": "One thing I like about British detective series is they portray believable characters. Unlike American detectives who dress in sexy garb as if they are going out for a night on the town, the female detectives in British shows are just as gritty and appropriately dressed as the men. The characters are more complex because of their imperfections. The female cops aren't all super heroes like so many Hollywood portrayed female cops. They have wrinkles, a few gray hairs, foibles and quirks. The same can be said for their villains. Even though they do evil things, they can also exhibit a more normal and even compassionate side. All the more frightening because they could be your neighbor, co-worker, or even your spouse and you'd never suspect them.This series pits two great hunters against one another. Gillian Anderson as Stella Gibson and the very handsome Jamie Dornan as Paul Spector are a well suited match. Watching these two characters, you realize that there is very little difference between the two hunters except for their reasons for hunting and their control over their impulses. They understand each other and toy with one another towards the end of the first season and beyond. This show exhibits a greater insight into the thought processes of a killer.It can be a slow paced show but well worth the wait. Just when you start to become bored, something exciting happens to pull you into the story and keep you watching. There are plenty of twists and turns involving peripheral characters that make you wonder how it will all fit together in the end. It is better and more realistic than anything on American television because the characters and the crimes are so believable.",

Apparantly, their idea of police work is straight from a non-stop view of every Dirty Harry movie. Hence, every single female character is constantly confusing agency with displaying either delusions of grandeur or gross professional miss-conduct.

            "content": "A lot of good stuff has been written here. Therefore, in my review I will try not to repeat myself, but simply to give an idea - who should watch it, and for whom it will be a waste of time.First of all, this is not a detective at all. In the presence of all the usual attributes of the detective genre, the main thing - a big secret and an exciting disclosure of crimes - will not. Here, the perpetrator and the victims are immediately known. In terms of genre, this is more of a psychological thriller. With a strong emphasis on psychology.Secondly, there is little action here, or at least tense moments that are simply familiar to criminal productions. Relative to the total timing, they are less than 10% here.Since the drama is psychological, almost the entire plot is devoted to revealing the characters, although you do not immediately understand that this is the main goal of the creators. Moreover, both main characters - the investigator and the criminal - are real psychologists. True, by profession only a criminal.As for the investigator (Anderson), she is absolutely no cop. In the course of the plot, he does not demonstrate not only the outstanding qualities of an interrogator, but even elementary mandatory professionalism. On the contrary, he makes unacceptable, sometimes downright wrecking mistakes. But, being a psychologist by vocation, he quickly and accurately characterizes the criminal. The latter gives her pathos.The maniac criminal is the main and most controversial character here. Clever, charismatic, tragic hero, creating cruelty that is hard to explain. The main attention of the viewer is riveted to his thoughts and actions. It may seem to someone that he is not brutally brilliant enough, like all sorts of Hannibal lecturers. And in my opinion, the emphasis on simple philistine character traits gives the hero more realism, eliminating the feeling of a purely cinematic monster.Yes, and the police, of whom every second character is here, behave quite believably. Both their individual weaknesses and the general imperfection of the system are revealed. This cannot but rejoice against the backdrop of most movie plots, where the cops are mostly valiant and brilliant.Also in the series there are several interesting intermediate lines with minor characters, very well embodied. In general, the characters and characters are well written here. Everything is in its place.The ending of the second (currently last) season looks a bit ambiguous. On the one hand, all the plot directions received their denouement, on the other hand, there seems to be a hint of a possible continuation. Nevertheless, there is no feeling of incompleteness, all questions have been answered.Summarizing, we can repeat that the idea is far from a detective story. Especially in its classic British sense. Relative to the crime genre in general, there isn't much novelty or twists and turns here. Smooth, unhurried psychological drama interspersed with a thriller. Interesting, deep characters and a good cast.7 out of 10.",

I heavily rely on the IMDb community when it comes to chosing what to watch, and it completely failed me this time. The entire thing could have been rapped up in 5 or so episodes. There are so many unnecessary shots and sequences that one cannot help but believe that either the series was edited/directed by an 8 year old in that it just rambles through so many useless details of a story OR the network was just milking this thing for all its worth knowing people may continue to tune in because of the solid leads and provocative subject matter. The acting by Jamie Dornan and Gillian Anderson is very strong and the only redeeming quality that makes it any bit tolerable. This is the only reason that I didn't give it a 1 and also didn't punch a hole in my wall when it ended. The writing of the series is so horrible in so manys that it doesn't even warrant my time to list them all. The most significant two are as follows. 1) There are so many errors, inaccuracies, and mistakes in the due process/police work demonstrated that one must figure the writers take the audience to be complete morons who won't even notice. \n2) Once you painstakingly arrive at the last episodes of the series, you think that they may have something and finally pull this thing together. NOPE! It just ends in an incredibly lazy way. Lots of solo shots of characters not saying anything. This is merely an attempt to make you think that maybe you didn't get the deeper message. The messages are clear and obvious early on so like I said, it's just Lazy. How anyone could rate this garbage anything higher than a 3 is beyond me.

I didn't think I could handle 3 seasons of this.Sensing that Gillian Anderson would not have signed on to a ceaselessly violent script, I persisted.Boy was that decision rewarded!So many subjects are intimately covered with courageous attention to detail.This show nailed it.A more relevant score would be deepen the experience.",

They have relationships with one another. There is detail. There is depth.Stereotypes are broken: good guys have flaws and bad guys have redeeming qualities ... Not a 10 because at times it seemed to go a little slow, otherwise it would have been a 10!!!",

            "review_title": "The Fall is perhaps the best television series that you have never heard of ...",
            "content": "When it comes to television, The Fall is as good as a television series gets. Once I started watching, I had no intention of turning off the five hours of content that comprise season 1. Even though you may not have heard of this show, it ranks up there with American dramas such as \"House of Cards\", \"True Detective\", \"Breaking Bad\", \"Homeland\",and \"The Wire\". Despite the compelling content, the show is hardly a mainstream event. It exists well below \"the radar\". At least it will remain below the radar until the world discovers that Jamie Dornan, the star of \"Fifty Shades of Grey\", which opens February 14, 2015 costars with Gillian Anderson of \"The X Files\". Dornan is the antagonist with Anderson playing the protagonist. He delivers a five star performance as Peter Spector, a loving father, philandering husband, professional bereavement counselor whose career is spiraling towards termination, and a psychotic serial killer. He is smart,physically fit, and is prone to allowing his heart dictate actions that will challenge his brain to fix when things go haywire. He supports his practices with pearls of wisdom from the Irish bard T.S. Eliot and German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche. Anderson plays the protagonist, Detective Chief Inspector Stella Gibson of the Metropolitan Police Force who has been brought to Belfast to assist in the capture of the murderer of professional female who is the former daughter-in-law of a well-connected, corrupt member of the Belfast police board. We are forewarned that politics plays a big role in policing Belfast. The viewer must also keep in mind an adage about Northern Ireland, \"To see what it was like during Victorian times, go to Northern Ireland. The laws that govern women's sexual rights date back to 1861.\" We are not in Kansas, Dorothy. Even though Dornan is the villain and Anderson is our hero, the audience is made aware of the many personality nuances that they share . Both characters are feisty, independent, domineering, well educated, ruthless, and indefatigable in pursuit of their goals. The difference is that Spector murders his chosen victims and Gibson specializes in catching psychotic criminals. To paraphrase Anderson's character, \"Gibson is tasked with apprehending a serial killer known as \"Peter\". Gibson is the subject and Peter, the serial killer is the object. The act of apprehension expresses the verb function\". Beyond this clear directive, the storyline is blurred by both diligent and dysfunctional behaviors occurring within the corrupt, corporal environment of Belfast. We see the charms and curses of this volatile city. If police business occurs near the infamous Shankill or Falls Roads, they must employ tactics used by the allied armies in Iraq and Afghanistan. The simplest steps carried out by law enforcement require a para-military police presence in order to succeed. The supporting cast is expertly played by a mostly Irish cast. Niamh McGrady is wonderful as Constable Danielle Ferrington, who becomes DCI Gibson's personal assistant while pursuing the killer. As the two police officials get to know each other, the show injects a splash of levity, which is needed to break the dark nature of the story. The assistant commissioner of police is played by John Lynch. Lynch portrays this tortured public official who has allies himself with dark side whenever it serves his purpose. A handful of characters who display scruples manage to keep this \"house of cards\" from collapsing. The six episode, second season of \"The Fall\" will air this fall on BBC2 & Netflix.",

I'm through the first three episodes and here's some of the major goofs I've seen:Does Spector's nurse ever go home? She's taking care of him 24 hours a day!How is it that Spector does not have restraints and/or a police officer guarding him? He's been accused of some horrific crimes, but no one seems concerned about keeping an eye on him or preventing him from walking out of the hospital.I cannot conceive how anyone would put Rose Stagg in the same hospital as Spector. But, not only is she there, she's in the next room!How is it that the police are unable to apprehend Spector's little girlfriend, Katie Benedetto, despite the fact that she walks about town freely, making no effort to disguise herself or otherwise keep under cover? This is even more ridiculous after she threw acid in the face of her now-former friend.",

I could identify the multiple characters after the second time, something not normally easy for me.I thought the killer was eerily good. He led a mundane normal everyday life. You can see why there wouldn't be any focus on him right away, even though there were some tense exchanges. His wife was an awesome, almost angelic beautiful woman who was the perfect contrast.It was good to see so many fully bearded police officers, something not quite popular here in States, even though mustaches are quite common.I thought Gillian Anderson was a weak choice as detective. She was just lifeless. Not that she needed to shout or break down doors, but that she gets lost in mix. This was a four-part series at best. At certain points, it was really slow and you wanted it to get moving. Certain scenes stretched two long. The ending really was crappy.

But this series felt very down to earth, with the harsh realities shown, and it seemed to really show the viewers what magnitude of damage child sexual abuse/witnessing mother's suicide can do. Its honestly one of the most\nterrible things a child can go through, and i was so glad that the fall wasnt based on some true story. That would have quite literally broken my heart.

However it is just 17 hours so that's fine relief.Whole third and last season was downer for me. To much effort into generating sympathy for killer. Unreasonable and unrealistic plot incidents too. Sally Ann somehow can and wants to afford city's biggest lawyer for her deceitful husband. Gibson allows Spector to walk free in psych centre despite him punching her right then.

Could not have though of a better Paul Spector or Detective Gibson so round of applause for getting that spot on.In terms of storyline, I am a sucker for thrillers and this honestly had a little of everything I like in a drama. Creepiness, stalking, murder and mystery. must say this won't be one for the faint hearted, it's intense like PROPER INTENSE till the last episode.There's a part of me which makes me sad, to think I would hate the main character being a serial cold hearted killer, it made me sad, for him to fit in a world to which he was not loved to begin with, breaks my heart. It makes me reflect on real life and how you really don't know a person , with or without the sinister thoughts. Paul Spector lied about how he was treated when he was younger and it really opens so much more about the character. Worth a watch but it really does get you thinking, there was definitely a soft spot from Stella to Paul and I loved it, was never a one sided, bad guy character, I hope this makes sense!",

But I get it, they are serial killers who can't control themselves and so on, I ignored the plot holes because they seemed somehow human/real.As for the detective Gibson, as much as I love Gillian, this was such bad acting... or maybe just a bad character, too much of a superiority complex induced.Every other cop character felt like a really stupid kid.Season 3 was all about finale, Spector's story and how he became who he is.

At that point, I thought, clever, because the police can compare the handwriting with that of the letter sent to victim's father. But they didn't, surprisingly, and nobody thought about doing it which to me is a very routine detective tool.",

Every once in awhile she casually mentions her hatred of men but with the same blank expression she wears while questioning witnesses. For some reason, young cops can't wait to jump her bones even though she's twice their age. She won't even get undressed when they do, presumably so she doesn't give up the game.The guy responsible for writing and directing this mess even quotes Margaret Atwood's infamous line about women being afraid men will kill them. Well yes, serial killers are known for that, but oddly enough, this guy's wife harbors no such fear. Quite the contrary. The cop calls her stupid (she's working class, y'know) but the guy is such a milquetoast around the wife, who can blame her? He's also a lousy killer, making mistakes so stupid you assume he must have done it on purpose as a joke.From what I've read here, it only get worse later on, so try something better like Marcella or Dark on Netflix.",

This archetype of first woman. - Not to be understood as Eve. Still she remains a mystery to us. Even Paul Spector knows her more than us. I think it would be better if we knew a little more about this woman. The fact that she remains a total mystery makes it harder to feel her pain also. But still very good. \nHowever, the actor playing Paul S. is just not good. I am sorry and I don't want to be like this horrible internet people who says terrible things about people but he is not a good actor. He has simply no presence, no charisma, nothing. This kind of caracter should normally stir up something in you, take up some space. But he is just all that. Most interesting or saddest thing can be happening, the world might be hit by a meteor, you feel like he will have the same look in his eyes. His most expressive moments can only be described as the facial expressions of a guy selling metro tickets to people.

He is close enough to see the combination and remember it. In my version of the ending episode, Spector makes his way in to Larson's office after that violent altercation with Larson and gets the handgun and escape the Foley Clinic among all the turmoil. He makes his way back to the streets of Belfast, contacts Katie, and arranges to meet her. The police are anticipating his movements, though, and glimpse him on CCTV. Spector is confronted by Gibson there on the street and Spector grabs Katie from behind and takes her hostage. Katie breaks loose from Spector and Spector pulls the handgun from his back and takes aim on Gibson. Gibson shoots him in the chest and Spector falls to the pavement. As Katie cradles Spector's head in her hands he grabs her forearm to keep her close as he lays there, but Katie pulls away from him and lets his head down on the pavement. She stands up and slowly backs away. As she turns to look at Gibson, she runs toward her and into Gibson's arms, the implication being that Katie knows that she never meant anything to Spector after all, as Gibson had previously explained to her in conversation. There are still some loose ends, but at least this version offers a little more closure than the existing one.",

The atmosphere of the series is dark, gloomy, frightening and even disgusting at some points and it may put some people off. On the other hand, being real to life, this fact may be appealing to others. I think The Fall is one of the finest and well- crafted representatives of the crime/detective genre. *SPOILERS* The plot revolves around two characters: detective Stella Gibson (Gillian Anderson) and the killer and a family man, Paul Spector (Jamie Dornan). Stella is independent, strong, highly intelligent and she functions perfectly in the world of men. She lives alone and occasionally engages in carefree and short sexual relationships with (sometimes married) fellow colleagues. Paul is also witty, intelligent, strong and independent, although living a life of a perfectly ordinary family man and a father of two. The fact that he is a father makes this other, violent side of him more surprising. During the day, he is a grieving counsellor who walks his children to school, tucks them in bed and reads stories to them. At night, he puts on his hood, stalks his victims and attacks his prey. The biggest and most significant achievement of the series is the fact that it is slow-paced and very detailed. Sarah Gibson traces, examines, reexamines, observes and discusses every new clue with great attention and care. She thinks about everything and always encourages her coworkers to pay attention to subtle details. The series demonstrates that every investigation takes a lot of time and that policemen should never jump to conclusions. For example, Gibson was always apprehensive about what kind of information should be released to the press, whether she should unbutton the top button on her blouse etc. This role suits G. Anderson perfectly and every change in the tone of her voice and every frown on her face is significant. When speaking she reveals that she manages the situation with ease, despite what men may think. Paul Spector is also a very well-written character and he manages to seem frightening enough to be convincing. His slowness, coolness and calmness emphasise the sense of fear. The murder of Sarah Kay should be the textbook example of an excellent forensic practice depicted on film. Detectives in white examining the corpse of a beautiful woman lying on bed were eerily graphic, frightening and real. This may scare some viewers off but, on the other hand, this is the reason why this series stands out among all the others. The second season is also good, but there are too many subplots. The nanny of Paul's children, his wife, corrupt police chiefs, a violent local hooligan who beat his wife, Rose Stagg - these are all characters that unnecessarily slow the pace of the story. It focuses mainly on the tracing and following Paul Spector. It seems that the writers were losing the track and got lost a bit... All in all, riveting but not to everyone's taste.",

I nearly lost faith in the show during the 3rd season, but they thankfully yanked me back. I loved all the characters, actors and story line.

A major problem is that Gillian Anderson's character is not likable. Neither is Jamie Dornan's character, and you need someone to like in every show. Peripheral characters are better, but none stood out. Also, a little female nudity doesn't bother me, but the scenes of the female victim's naked body for long periods in the 2nd episode, along with a sex scene showing partial female nudity (but no male nudity), was too much. Yes, you see a tiny bit of Jamie Dornan's backside in one episode, but this show definitely caters to men. And back to Gillian Anderson, as another reviewer wrote, she needs to extend her range. If they had cut back on the nudity, and had a good, likeable main character, I would have stuck with it. The plot was interesting, but not enough.",

But wow, the third contained so many obvious errors, like the hospital scenes with no guards or restraints on him or police protection of Rose. And the cheap resolution of the whole story was so anti-climatic. What was the point of having his fellow inmate create the disturbance? He just as well could have hung himself anywhere at any time since he had so much (unbelievable) freedom. Better ending if he had escaped, and it would have been much scarier if we had seen him walking down a sunlit street somewhere following a dark haired\nwoman at the end. Or if the inmate who caused the disturbance killed him just as he was about to escape. The hanging was...meh.And what about Stella? No tiny indication of a better, happier, more fullfilling life, after this awful ordeal? She just goes back to her lonely pitiful world? Very unsatisfying. The series needed a little lightness along the way, and some hope for Stella in the end.",

This is a real world crime drama that works and the realism is abject. The story is clever enough, not entirely original but what is entirely original anyway? I'm not going to go into the plot (I'm sure you've guessed it) and that's not the stand out reason I'm writing this. It's the delivery. The lighting/direction is masterful, the plot is blood drainingly tense and the acting is superb - not just Gillian Anderson or Jamie Dornan (who are both brilliant) but the entire cast including the kids are exceptional. Well played the writer(s), director and all involved. More please :-)",

Only two directors filmed three seasons, although there are only 17 episodes.Filmed in a very original way from the point of view that I saw here a bunch of the same type of people who are looking for each other, find themselves in each other, doubt and give advice. The series is essentially about a maniac, but this is not a detective at all, here they give you the opportunity to listen to your own feelings and find a maniac in yourself.I liked the detail. Maybe even redundant. I couldn't watch The X-Files for a long time, so I can't say anything about the actress Gillian Anderson. I saw Jamie Dornan in several films, but now, most likely, I will remember.The series is really enough for something alive, it is interesting to watch and even three seasons do not bother at all.

That I found to be interesting.One thing which I have observed in some series is, there is a great deal of sexual activity--often illegal or forbidden activity--found in a series like this. There is a significant amount of interaction between the villain and a 15/16 year old girl. I realize for some people, that may be enticing; but it is there and there is a considerable amount of interaction between these two (nothing explicitly shown, of course, but there are a lot of details which are discussed--particularly by the young girl.The female lead is a strong woman who is sexually aggressive. Is that not the case for every single strong female lead where there is any sort of a sexual angle?The villain is very sick and does some very sick and violent things.

            "content": "\u0084You cannot blame gravity for falling in love,\" said Albert Einstein. However, who is to be blamed for falling in shadow and darkness? When you start watching a crime series, or a movie, you do not really want to know who is the killer straight away. The catch is to solve the case with whoever the investigator is. So why would the producers of a Northern Irish TV series decided to show us the killer in the first episode. Isn't all about solving the case? The producers of \u0084The Fall\", a TV series that premiered in mid-2013 decided that the path is the goal. When Superintendent Stella Gibson, perfectly played by Gillian Anderson (she is fluent in British English!), comes from London Metropolitan Police to Belfast to investigate serial killer case we already know the guy \u2013 we saw his face, we know his oeuvre and his means for torturing his victims. Peter Paul Spector is one of the first characters we see and from the very beginning we know \u2013 he is the perpetrator.How clear is that \u2013 the Good (Stella) will try to catch the Bad (Paul) with the help of the Ugly (Jim Burns, Stella's ex-lover and her supervising officer at the Police Service of Northern Ireland). So why would we watch it? Obviously, because it is not about the \u0084who\" but about \u0084how\", not \u0084how did he do it\", but \u0084how will she ever catch him\".The lines drawn at the beginning are deceiving. Many shades of grey come to the light soon enough to keep the viewer interested and attracted by the story. We take this fall together.Two main characters \u2013 Stella and Peter \u2013 are seemingly opposed but down this path we took together we start to seen not only that each one of them has this \u0084other\" side but also that they have so much in common. Firstly the oppositions: Stella is a woman, she is cold and distant, doesn't have a family, work is everything to her. Her aim is to keep the city clean from the evil. Paul \u2013 a man, a family man, what is more \u2013 a counselor, an empathetic and placeable psychologist. Fair enough, opposite characters in a common case. However, what kind of woman is Stella? Focused and determined, perfectionist and authoritarian. She will not miss any clues or spots. However, she has a weak point (or is it?) - she likes men, and she treats them as objects. The first man in the series she wraps around her finger falls for her despite being a father and a husband (he will pay a high price for his sins...). She uses her \u0084victim\" as a toy, and she does not like decomposing the issue into prime factors.Wait a minute...objectifies, uses the victim, well controlled and perfectionist cultivating rituals \u2013 this perfectly depicts our \u0084beloved\" Peter Paul.Moreover, there's the rub. Only (s)he who knows the dark side can follow and catch the doer. Because technically (s)he is a doer too. Just the repercussions and the \u0084against-the-law\" issue are different. Still, we all know that the law is established by men, therefore, it is limited to whatever is considered illegal by the men themselves. What is within the margin of the error goes.Stella and Peter are very similar indeed. They both cross certain lines. They are both very erotic, but each one in a different way, and voyeuristic. Because again, it is not about \u0084what\" but about \u0084how\".It takes two series for Stella to get finally to see and catch Paul (he has the advantage of knowing and observing her, and that lets him being one step ahead) and eventually (SPOILER!) despite having him at a gunpoint she fails to punish him properly. Moreover, that is how she get her punishment. Maybe if he was more focused and less disturbed by his deviation he would be more careful. However, then why would she even chase him? British crime has its history if it comes to solving criminal cases with Agatha Christie's Mrs Marple and Hercules Poirot. The latter has successfully solved the case depicted in \u0084Murder on the Orient Express\" - Poirot gives two solutions. Which one is real? Does it matter? Id does not because what is important is why would the crime be committed in the first place.In the end, it is all about understanding that we all have committed dark deeds. That we all have been falling for our darks side. Just sometimes these deeds are against the law.Read more on www.visualandwriting.com",

That's why I was unpleasantly surprised to see they decided not to wrap things up when they easily could.If you notice that season 1 had 5 episodes, and seasons 2 and 3 have 6, it makes you think that the series was originally intended as a single, 6-episode season.Dissapointedly we move to season 2 which drops the pace by 80% and is full if irrelevant scenes, close-ups, prolonged silences. Through these 6 episodes, the story gets minimal movement.And then comes season 3. You can make a drinking game out of the first episode,for every time someone says sistolic or adrenaline.

BTK Dennis Rader and Ted Bundy who Spector resembles strongly, couldn\u00b4t hide their deranged mind from their surroundings. Most important ingredient in murder is hate and it showed. They either terrorized their neighborhood or vanished when pleased. Double life is not easy. Thats why Spector is not plausible. Serial killers are abusive, haunted and hollow men who contribute nothing to their surroundings, they are simply destructive parasites. I don\u00b4t see any of it here. Disturbing side is that Jamie Dornan seems to agonize beautiful young women in his every movie and female audience love it, because he is hot. So how in earth that goes with obvious feminist agenda? I hate slasher movies about beautiful women with senseless violence with shallow motives and consequences - I thought feminist did too. And all these unnecessary erotic imagery combined with autopsy photos.

I could have found the killer (well- played by Dornan) more quickly than the Belfast police.Why? As soon as Paul Spector went to the station to say he was at the park, why didn't the detective make a connection to the fact he was in and out of foster homes? Why didn't the police talk to his wife in person to verify his alibi? Shortly thereafter they had a drawing of his face hanging throughout the station and posted in the papers. Even the blonde on the train wasn't afraid. That's just silly. Why didn't the detective who interviewed him see the striking similarities? Why didn't Sally ask where her husband's car had gone to? There are many questions.I realize the story must be dragged out to keep viewers entertained, but as soon as there were glaring goofs or oversights by the characters, I realized this series was too good to be true.

Gillian Anderson plays a calm, cool, and collected Superintendent DI who instills confidence with a splash of envy in all her police entourage as well as her audience. Jamie Dornan plays the egocentric criminal with modest arrogance, a contradiction that seems simply genuine. The story builds through character development, illuminating a common thread running between criminal and cop: the human need for achieving control. Both cop and criminal maintain low-key demeanors, making the pace of the show drag in some places, but creating an overall feeling of intensity that kept me on the edge of my seat. However, the story falters with several instances of questionable police protocol. I have never worked in a police department, but I doubt any police department would assign 10 to 20 plainclothes police to tail a suspect while, simultaneously, only 2 to 4 uniformed officers are available to respond to street crimes. Technical goofs like this make the whole story less plausible. Instead of \"Deus ex machina\", we have \"cops do dumb stuff\", allowing the author to add a new twist (or is it just stretching out the story?).

Unrealistic police procedure and behaviour had me criticising this out loud (to an audience of none, however. Boo Hoo).\nSome unlikely character developments.(i) Check out that brat! (ii) Do inspired and admirable women who work in maternity wards behave like this?\nDoes the S.I.Officer have to wear inappropriate clothing in so many scenes. She looks more like a socialite kitted out for a string of cocktail parties rather than the tragic scenario that is playing out with a steady stream of bereaved and heart -broken relatives of the victims. At least we know she's not flat-footed. Does she have any self-control in her professional relationships? Surely her reputation would proceed her if in reality she behaved like this.\nHaving said all that , the actors do a very, very good job with the material.The technical aspects of the production are of a high quality.\nAll in all, it is a compelling series,but the characterisation of the killer's wife in particular left a bad taste.

After watching a couple of episodes of The Fall, I quit watching for a week or two, and almost gave up on it completely. I eventually decided to give it another chance, and am very happy that I did. Despite the many slow moments, there is an underlying feeling of extreme suspense. The game of cat and mouse kept me wondering how it would all turn out.

The serial killer and his circumstances are presented with a chilling realism. To the outside world, a loving family man, a trusted counselor. Inside, a twisted mind. Now, serial killers are relatively rare, but you could easily liken him to a child abuser. Often times, those people similarly manage to fool everyone around them. Kids are even entrusted in their care, kids that will end up becoming their victims. There is such a sickening element in this alone that certain scenes of this series are difficult to bear.This also leads me to a word of warning for victims of abuse planning to watch this series (be it sexual, physical or mental abuse). You will likely be shaken up by the events taking place, and worst of all, there is no catharsis taking place here. The entire series so far - Season 1 & 2 - is very well made, showing realistic behaviour of both of the perpetrator and the police. And just like in real life, things go from bad to worse right under people's noses, but they realize it all too late. The viewer, helpless witness to what is happening, can only direct hateful expressions at the TV, or however you choose to deal with it. But there certainly is no happy ending in any of this. If you watch some of this before going to bed, you might be a bit worked up and have trouble falling asleep. I can only imagine that it must be worse for abuse victims watching this.So, for all its brilliance, for all its realism, it is also tough to watch at times. Please keep that in mind.Murderers, rapists, and other such people are often labeled \"monsters\" and \"inhuman\", he is called that in this series too. This, of course, is wrong. Instead of dehumanizing such people, the much more troubling realization is that they are very human in the end. If this series teaches us anything, it's that sometimes those people are living right amongst us. Ultimately, we can only counteract this with love, and watching out for any signs of people dear and near to us being in some kind of trouble, especially kids. They might experience something bad, and we must try to spot it and help them.8/10, absolutely gripping, well-made series with great attention to detail.",

            "content": "A slow, unsettling and somewhat intimate thriller that explores almost every aspect of the process of crime, physical, spiritual and mental, the stages of investigation undertaken by the police, the interference of the media and how individual officers cope with these intrusion attempts. The show is extremely detailed in its approach to the little individual stories. It will give almost every character a 3 dimensional aspect as it tries to navigate through certain philosophies covered throughout the show. This show takes and remasters certain trends from other detective media, I've noticed similarity to Death Note, Silence of the Lambs, Twin peaks etc... and it will utilize these inspirations to create very entertaining episodes and cliffhangers.Sometimes the slowness can be overbearing. Often the director will linger on a closeup or a silence for too long after the audience already understands the intention of the scene. I suppose it's done to allow us to sit with new information for a while longer and empathize with how the character feels in that moment, but the technique feels overused throughout the series.It is very good overall and feels very well read and researched by the creators. The show can flip from detective thriller, to medical drama, to legal drama at a moments notice and takes its time to explore each of those genres and vocations and the individuals that perform them. It becomes more philosophical and psychological as the episodes go on, if you want to really explore and understand a character and explore trauma, PTSD and mental health, this may be the show for you.",

            "content": "Series 1 has quite dark moments and is not a bad watch, series 2 is alright though not great and series 3 is just plain boring and pointless.I had heard good things about the series and seen a few clips which made Gillian Anderson's character seem intriguing however I was disappointed. They obviously want to make her a strong female lead and while I thought at the start she was going to be interesting to watch, I found her character underdeveloped and quite a hypocrite. She'll sleep with a subordinate yet from how she speaks about the macho police culture you'd expect her to not like a male officer treating lower ranked female officers like she does. Also there were some jarring moments when she just comes out with statements when it didn't seem to fit within the scene to what was happening - but it was a way to get across that kind of person she is. Don't get me wrong, it can be interesting to watch characters who are a mess, who you don't like or don't think are great people but it just came across as bad lazy writing and underdeveloped.I also disliked the male ranked police officer above her (forget the title, assistant something) as he was just permanently a mess and always looking nervous. I get he was somewhat of a side character but he was on enough that there could have been some development.When I first saw that there were three series I thought it would be three separate cases which I think would have been more interesting. By the end of the first series the killer isn't as scary and intriguing as you've gotten to know him more. And through the rest of the series you aren't intrigued to learn more or stay with him.There are also issues with continuing things which were revealed in previous seasons or introducing new things that just seem to be created for that series.For example, in series 1 Gillian Anderson's character records the killer on the phone and they talk for a decent amount of time. Yet in series 2 they are trying to confirm the killer is a specific person and they use a really short phone call recorded from that series, and the expert says it could be the killer but with such a short voice sample they can't be sure. What happened to the recorded call made in series 1? There's no mention of it.Also in series 3 there's one episode were they reveal the killer likes to dress in women's lingerie and they show all these photos of him that way. That was never mentioned before or since that episode and it just didn't seem to go or really add anything.",

I don't watch a lot of British shows and this one is one of the best. I suggest you watch this show.

After deducing who the killer was, Gillian Anderson's character got a telling-off from her boss and they all decided to call it a night, instead of making an arrest, allowing the killer to evade them and get rid of lots of evidence. After this, the show descended into farce. Why leave a killer, who has confessed to a series of horrific murders, unguarded and unrestrained in the same hospital ward as his victim? Why leave him alone with the psychiatrist? Why all the pontification about fine art and literature? Why all the whispering? What became of the killer's accomplice, his family or his victims? For a show that seemed intent on fostering a sense of emotional investment in the characters, it's strange that it all ended so inconclusively.I find it hard to believe that the writer of this show was also one of the writers for the excellent \"Prime Suspect\". But perhaps stretching a single murder plot over 17 hours is too much for any writer.On the plus side, Gillian Anderson is attractive, and her English accent is convincing.",

If not for subtitles, we wouldn't have understood a word she said. And while she may have lived in the UK, her accent (albeit whispered), did not sound authentic. In addition, it seems a story that could/should have concluded in one, or possibly two seasons, was dragged out to three, which made the third season especially frustrating, boring and monotonous.

Not so, however, was Gillian Anderson. I felt she overplayed the part of the female Chief Superintendent trying to outwit the serial killer.

Unfortunately Anderson stinks the whole thing into unwatchability.I don't understand how people rave about this series. 'Wooden' doesn't cover Anderson's performance. Wood has depth, character and shine. Anderson has one blank facial expression the whole show. She's more like MDF.Maybe it's supposed to suggest the deep troubled personality of her character, but it actually makes her look like a Stepford Wife. She might have heard of the concept of 'emotion' but only in the abstract. She's obviously never actually experienced one.Her voice throughout is similarly dead and monotonic. She delivers every line in the same loud whisper, without a hint of meaning, tone or timbre. All the other characters speak like real human beings. Anderson, however, sounds like she's permanently in a state of utter disconnection and boredom.She makes you want to lose the will to live. Every single line is delivered with the same flat \"dur dur dur dur dur\". It's like quietly and ponderously hitting a muffled drum for eternity.You can hear a hint of my Margaret Thatcher in the accent and delivery. Not the real person Thatcher, but the contrived, trained persona delivering a government message to the media. That same lack of empathy, conviction or giving a sh:t about whether what she's saying is true or not.I never thought much of her in the X-Files but at least Duchovny picked up half the slack as lead. Here she's left to completely ruin a potentially good series, because she's never off the screen long enough to enjoy it.I'm using this series as a litmus test for discernment and intelligence. Anyone who can bear watching Anderson for this long should save their licence fee and buy a Punch and Judy set.That's the way to do it Gilly:-(",

For two and a half series this is a gripping thriller. It's well acted - I thought Aisling Franciosi was excellent flitting from vulnerable schoolgirl to vamp and back. There may have been a few holes in the plot but people make mistakes and things don't always go to plan so obsessing about those is an over-reaction in my view. My only gripe (and the reason I scored it with 8 stars and not more) was how slow it became in the last 3 episodes and I didn't like the ending. I'd still recommend it.",

The characters are all well drawn, even some of the minor ones. I have watched many British crime dramas and am always looking for more. This one is a winner.

Many of the main characters are Irish and sometimes the accent is hard to understand but the actor who plays the serial killer is stellar in his performance and keeps you wondering how in the world he is getting by without being caught.

It only took one season for him to basically get caught, the next season was all about catching him & now the third is all about trying him in court. I feel like they should've slowed it down. Or at least started the next new season with another killer. I'm disappointed that we didn't get more time with him hunting his victims while police hunted him. This was the best part of the series and I've had to drag my feet through season 2&3.The only thing saving it (for me anyway) is the writing (for the most part). I was hoping that after he was caught that she would move onto a different killer & we would start all over again, but no. They want to drag this out.

The story line is great and very suspenseful. I enjoyed watching things from the serial killers perspective while being hunted by the police. Jamie Dornan has created a thrilling darkness with his character and that's what made me want to continue watching. I'm not sure why they made three seasons with it.

Belfast is a beautiful city that is rich in history, both tragic (Titanic and the Troubles) and inspirational (the Industrial Revolution, the recent peace and economic boom). But very few of Belfast's landmarks or neighborhoods are featured in the show, and very little of its history is reflected in the plot. The show might as well take place in any United Kingdom city and still not lose anything of value. Still, it is a small gripe and it does not take away from that fact that Belfast is becoming a place that's friendly to filmmakers and a hotbed for excellent actors.",

Everything was just too perfect.The cast is well chosen.Jamie Dornan's portrayal of Paul Spector was superb.This actor is able to express all those mixed up feeling of anger,calmness,fake sympathy,and control simply with his facial expressions and body language.He didn't need to speak.That was just outstanding performance.Actually,I started watching THE FALL for Jamie Dornan,who was newly known by me due to his role in Fifty Shades Of Grey and that was one of the greatest decisions I've ever made about watching a TV show.Jamie Dornan is an excellent actor and has potential hidden skills and talent that were waiting to be exposed.Also, Gillian's performance was great and strong,but honestly,for me,It was Jamie who created that fascination and made me so attached and influenced by this series.Great job and good luck in season 3!!",

Jamie dornan played tremendous role in the series... his accent of speaking that language... and one of the most important thing he did... The Killings .. he was so careful... he loved it... the second season was too complex it wrapped up my mind.. he did not even care when he was arrested. he was so intelligent and care full... superintendent Stella was good too she worked very hard to catch him.. he played them very well... now i am waiting for the third season.. wish it come soon... loved it very much",

            "content": "Fantastic acting - suspenseful! I would have given it a 10/10 but some places it was like - why didn't the police do this or that (kind of obvious things) For example - it was obvious that the wife beater should have been arrested and in jail after the scene where he finds and beats up his ex-wife. At that point, when he ran off - well you just knew he was going to be the one to stop Paul Spector in the end. That was the biggest let-down. So the end was no surprise. But overall - the series was excellent! The shooting of the scenes - slow pace. It was great to watch the relationships develop or should I see unravel. The writers just knew certainly know something about what dysfunctional people feel & think. And to be able to get that across to the viewers - well what a great job they did. it's oddly enough - HEALING to watch - although I can see how it might be a trigger for others. But you begin to understand why abusers become the monsters they are. Understand but of course not accept. I was hanging on to the end waiting to know Spector's story. The shots between Stella and Spector were great. The words/thoughts exchanged between the two of them. A lot of realism. Humanizing the bad person and having the audience feel empathy for him - ugh! Then you kind of find out Stella's reasons for hating men - and only Spector seemed to understand. Poor ol' Spector. You come away with the feeling the guy really tried to hold off on his madness. And just like Bonnie and Clyde or Charles Manson - there is an odd infatuated teenager who falls for Spector. A loyal disciple. The viewer keeps getting drawn into each episode. A lot of tired days at work for trying to squeeze as many shows in one night. (WWWAAAaaa - there are no more to watch) Terrific acting and terrific writing- can't wait for the third season. in the mean time -- Stella please heal thyself. You really deserve better :)",

So well written and great acting from the two main characters along with great acting from lesser actors. S2 was ok , it helped the story along but felt a bit drawn out. S3 was such a bore , spent the whole season disengaged and annoyed. They could've ended the show after 2 seasons and it would've helped the shows credibility. Overall though I would highly recommend people to watch this series if you enjoy a thriller based series.",

Gillian was also superb in her acting. The twists, the plot, the screenplay, location everything is just wonderful.

I just have not seen Ms. Anderson for a long time. Allan Cubitt has also become one of my favorite persons. What a genius! Thank you Mr. Cubitt, for taking a chance on Jamie Dornan. He has proved his metal (sp) and his talent. The series is well acted, well written and well directed. I can't say enough in its praise. May season 3 please arrive across the pond to Netflix soon!",

            "content": "Such a great TV series. I was skeptical to begin with, but was slowly drawn into the dark, exciting story line which takes place in the equally gritty yet somehow magical city of Belfast. At first glance, we could be tricked into thinking this is just another slow moving thriller, but we are not bored for the slightest millisecond. Not quite on the edge of our seats, we are held in a comfortable limbo, suspended between horror at the brutal murders of the beautiful, dark-haired Belfast victims and our interest in the role of \"Peter\" or Paul Spector, played by Belfast born Jamie Dornan. Drawn in by the psychology surrounding his motives and personality, we find ourselves inside Paul's head, as he spots his victim, stalks them, then \"lovingly\" creates his own fantasy around them through his intimate journals. Gillian Anderson is perfection in the role of Stella, an officer brought over from England to head the Murder investigation in gloomy Northern Ireland. At first we see her as an outsider, a seductress, but slowly her more human aspects are revealed. Despite her obviously elevated intelligence and detective skills in comparison to the PSNI, she remains modest and creates important human relationships with her officers, gaining their respect and trust. With \"The Fall\" we see the portrayal of a strong female who, like everyone, has flaws and is not the archetypal super-heroine we have become accustomed to, which adds to the realness of her character. Even more interesting is the strange relationship and psychological power play which develops between Stella and Paul, which is captivating and adds even more dimension to this incredible series. Looking forward to the third season.",

            "content": "I am glued to each episode! I have not finished the series yet but am on Season 3. I find some things curious. I am a fan of British police crime solvers such as the Inspector (fill in the name) series and Midsomer Mysteries. It seems the Brits have lots of constabulary to flood a crime scene with uniformed police to do searches. So who is minding the streets? (US is not much different) For heaven sake do not move to Midsomer! Average three murders per episode. The deaths per 1000 inhabitants must be very high. As for The Fall, James seems more interested in Stella's 'sugar nights' than finding out a) Where Tyler was. Was there an APB or BOLO put out for him? b) How did a reporter get to the woods plus how did he know to be there. There is a leak in the department and James seems unconcerned; c) Where is Paul getting the money for multiple destroyed phones, a motel room, and a storage unit for the stolen car? As for Stella's sex drive, everyone has a different means of dissipating stress. The most odd thing to me is the ever increasing 'Inquiries' over the course of this series. The police spend more time investigating each other than looking for criminals. Was procedure followed? Who was in charge? Why did you make this decision? I heard James and Stella talk about budget for their inquiry yet the cars I see the upper echelon driving or being driven in are expensive cars! There is where they can gain budget, sell the cars. As for the ICU experience, it seemed whether the time was night or day, the same nurse and physician were always on duty. VERY UNREAL. I believe the acting to be integral to getting hooked on this series. The acting is quite good. I am sure I could find something to complain about if I watched the series a second time but I prefer to not pick it apart acting wise.",

Dornan was excellent, very believable,and his understated acting was all the more shocking when he exploded into violence. the structure of the show was excellent, and the acting all round was excellent with two exceptions in my opinion. as others have stated here i found Gillian Anderson's performance too one dimensional, there are far better English actresses suited for this role, Surrane Jones , Lesley Sharp, or Olivia Coleman to name a few. nothing against Anderson's Anglo American nationality, but i feel she was cast with US distribution in mind. the other disappointment was lynch as Jim burns, he just didn't sell the part to me.standouts acting wise were Richard Coyle playing the hospital doctor, and the young girl playing the teenage babysitter drawn into Dornan's web.apart from the lead detective catwalk strutting around Belfast woods in heels, a laughable conceit to anyone in the UK with any sense,the writer ladled the one night stands on too heavy i think,the first one with the doomed detective and the pass at Archie Panjabi's character were enough to establish her psyche, 3 was overkill.other than these two stumbles the plot was very good, and unlike others i thought the structure of the third season was excellent, showing the collateral damage spreading out from the crimeswith intelligent writing. i would recommend this show to viewers wanting more than car chases and dumb-ed down plots. it will probably get another season , which may be one too far unless cast changes are made, andersons performance is not enough to carry it without dornans counterbalance.",

            "review_title": "An outlook on male/female relation in society",
            "content": "As mentioned in many of the comments in this section The Fall is a detective series in all its glory: it has the tough detective with a stoic demeanor - played stoically and brilliantly by Gillian Anderson - and the disturbed psychopath that is both somewhat alluring and disgusting - played disgustingly and unsuspiciously by Jamie Dornan.The series acting is quite elegant and subtle, defining and mirroring its script and storytelling style: it is a story that takes its time and slowly develops its characters and its sublayers, brewing a plot that is very shocking while it dances with the possibilities of what is real.As mentioned previously, it does not have the super fast paced style of some of the American series that we commonly see, but in exploring the possibility of mental disturbance, the series shakes hands with pure evil in ways that explosions can not do.In spite of some of its gory content, it is the very nature of Paul Spector (Jamie Dornan) that makes you question men's behaviour before women in society in general: an everyday man with a normal job, wife and kids and the insane capability for cold calculated serial murdering for the sake of an exotic and mentally rewarding hedonistic view on life. Although very artistic in its action, the murders - as with the acting and everything else - don't have an overdone quality. The series relies on the extra ordinary, but it manages to keep its feet on the ground of what is possible, avoiding some of these \"script turn-offs\" and way too larger than life happenings. The killer is smart and cunning, but not devoid of mistakes.Although the series relies heavily on its script and on the traditional chase to catch a predator, its writing and character creation juxtaposes the relationship between men and women in society, and Detective Super Intendent Stella Gibson - Gillian Anderson - works as a bulkhead to illustrate the fragility and insecurities of men in general. Her relationship with co-workers, former lovers, current lovers, other women, the serial killer, children and with herself draw a very complete portrait of some of the many hindrances faced by women and how a series of crimes has a wave-like effect that tortures, kills and traumatizes those around it. For those more attentive, it is a detective story wolven into male/female relationships cloth, full of quoting and wit towards this rhetoric.The scene in which Anderson and Dornan face each other is one of the best edited, acted and written pieces of TV cinematography I have ever seen.Needless to say, not for the weak of mind, faint of heart, impatient and right in your face action seekers. For all the others, definitely worth the time.",
