            "content": "The film is about Philomena, an Irish lady living in the UK (Judi Dench). When she was young, she had an unwed pregnancy and went to live at a Catholic program for young mothers. The goal was to get help but to keep her child. However, the good Sisters tricked her out of her son and she never saw him again. Now, decades later, she's looking to find him and enlists the help of a down and out journalist (Steve Coogan). The film features some terrific acting, a nicely written script, lovely mood music and will keep your interest from start to finish. It was nominated for various Oscars (including Best Picture).I know that some feel that \"Philomena\" is seen by some as anti- Catholic and I would certainly agree that it is, at least in part, anti-Catholic. BUT, considering what happened to the real life Philomena, how could it not be anti-Catholic?! After all, the woman was treated abominably by representatives of the church and her story is very, very sad. This doesn't mean ALL Catholics are bad-- but some of these folks certainly were pretty awful (even if the confrontation scene at the end never actually happened this way).",

            "content": "'Philomena' had so much going for it. An incredible true story, an attention-grabbing trailer that immediately made me want to see it, a talented director responsible for some good and more projects and a talented cast on board (doesn't get much better than Judi Dench).Am so glad about seeing 'Philomena'. It is one of the classic examples of films based on true stories/real events that treats its subject with respect and honesty, rather than any rose-tinting, \"Hollywood-ising\" or taking sides. It is also a classic example of a film that makes me proud to be a Brit, really like these kinds of films so never doubted that 'Philomena' would be good. It is a film that balances pathos, a little humour, insight and truth perfectly while executing the individual elements every bit as much, something that not many films do as successfully, and one that can be enjoyed by any age or gender, pretty much anybody really, without any prejudice or generalising.It is a lovely looking film, not flashy, gimmicky or over-cinematic (a good thing because it is not that kind of film) but the beautiful scenery and slick photography is effective and elegant in its simplicity without being simplistic or TV film quality. It suits the gentle tone beautifully. Stephen Frears' direction is tightly controlled and sympathetic, bringing his own personality while doing an even better job at accommodating the two leads and their chemistry together. The music is pleasant and understated, not bombastic or intrusive which considering the subject would have been the completely wrong approach. Steve Coogan's script is one of 'Philomena's biggest strengths. Of all the films seen recently, the script here is one of the cleverest and most beautifully balanced. Particularly standing out elements-wise are the heart-breaking pathos and the thought-provoking insight. Everything here feels very honest and there is even some gentle ironic humour to stop things from being too serious that brings a smile to one's face and makes one laugh.The story, an incredible story done justice, is told beautifully, having some breathing space to give depth to the characters and content while also being alert that things never become dull. It refrains from artistic license to try to appeal to younger viewers which was appreciated. There are some nicely done and genuinely surprising twists and the ending just about rang true, although there may be some viewers questioning the moral aspect. 'Philomena' excels in not taking sides or being one-sided, the characters are charming while not shown to be too perfect and nobody is vilified or painted unfavourably. In lesser hands or given the Hollywood treatment this would most likely not be the case, love biopics but they have not always had a track record at sticking to the truth.Other than the script, it's the cast that's also particularly good. The supporting cast are all strong and well-suited but it's the two leads that shine most. Their chemistry sparkles and Coogan is amusing but also very compassionate, a remarkably nuanced performance. Even better is Dench, who is simply outstanding in every sense and allows one to root for her character every step of the way and relating to her in a terrible situation.In conclusion, a beautiful film in every meaning of the word. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

            "content": "The most remarkable thing about Stephen Frears' remarkable film \"Philomena\" is just how unsentimental and just how funny it actually is. Human Interest stories, the phrase Martin Sixsmith, (played superbly here by Steve Coogan), uses to describe exactly what it is he is doing in taking on the case of Philomena Lee, usually leave me cold for the very reasons Sixsmith describes in the film. But this is no ordinary 'human interest' story but a study of goodness triumphing over evil in a very real sense for surely Philomena Lee, as portrayed here, is a truly good person and the system she found herself fighting, though hardly by choice, namely the Catholic Church in Ireland, is in this instance anyway, evil. It's a heart-wrenching story but told with a good deal of natural humour and a distinct lack of lachrymation, (though you would need to have a heart of stone or no heart at all not to be moved to tears). The director is Stephen Frears who almost takes a back seat and lets the tale tell itself. The script is by Coogan and Jeff Pope and it beautifully encapsulates the book that Sixsmith wrote about Philomena Lee's search for the son who was taken away from her by Irish nuns and sold to an American couple simply because she had given birth out of wedlock at a time when such 'sins' were considered almost unforgivable. But Philomena never displays bitterness nor does she feel hatred. It simply isn't in her nature and in the end it is she who forgives rather than feel the need to ask for forgiveness. All the performances are first-rate and in the title role Judi Dench is simply phenomenal. This could so easily have become a display of actorly histrionics but Dench underplays almost to the point of invisibility. We certainly never see Dench up there on the screen but the incredible woman she is playing. Her performance is heart-breaking but then so is the whole film. Oscars are just not good enough.",

            "content": "Martin Sixsmith (Steve Coogan) is a former press secretary who was \"resigned\" in a dispute with the transport secretary. He is bitter and a laughing stock. As a former BBC reporter, he is approached by a waitress to do a story about her mother Philomena (Judi Dench). At a young age, she had a boy out of wedlock and was sent away to the nuns. There she works for them for 4 years to pay off her debt and her son was adopted to Americans. She had kept this secret for 50 years and now she wants to search for him. Martin takes Philomena to the convent but is given the polite runaround. It's only the start of a trans-Atlantic journey into the past.The true life story is so compelling. It's been fictionalized a bit, but this is just a wonderful heartfelt story. Judi Dench is amazing. The best part of Philomena is her upbeat manner which always look for the best in everyone. It is truly incredible when she goes into the confessional. The conflict inside of her at that moment is heart breaking. The chemistry with Steve Coogan is light and emotional when it needs to be. It is a profoundly human story. Some critics may hate it for being anti-church. That is their prerogative but that would miss the profound love at its core.",

His script is excellent, consistently witty and engaging on the surface whilst spinning many more layers beneath the surface which became unconsciously stirring. Normally with these kinds of films I find the humour becomes contrived, forced or inappropriate, like the writers/director buckle under a need to impress and please the audience. You won't find those jarring moments here - Philomena is expertly judged and balanced. The story itself is fascinating, and again Coogan's script steers clear from overt sentimentality to allow the humanity to speak for itself. A gentle, funny, heartbreaking and unforgettable film. I actually much prefer it to the Kings Speech.",

In short it was brilliant. It could have been a predictable story but instead it had other dimensions and took unexpected directions with strong characters and some humour. I thought I knew an outline beforehand and was pleasantly surprised when that part was covered in the first twenty minutes. It was intriguing where the story would take us and that happened a few more times later. In addition to Philomena's journey, there was also Martin Sixsmith's journey from the beginning as just a detached journalist doing a human interest story on someone, whom he thought was beneath him, to being totally involved and offering not to publish it. To illustrate the depths of this film you can see how it attacks cruel, narrow-minded, sanctimonious Catholicism and at the same time shows how the faith gave strength to Philomena and the ability to forgive rather than to wreak vengeance. The acting was totally convincing. It is going to be a competitive year but Judy must be up for another Oscar. Just watching Steve Coogan's almost imperceptible expressions of irritation as Philomena told him the interminable plot of the book she had just been reading, was wonderful. This is definitely the best film I have seen all year. After writing this I read the interview with Martin Sixsmith on the Guardian web-site. It fills in more detail about Michael Hess (Anthony Lee) but confirms the whole truth of the story.",

            "content": "As several critics have observed, this wonderful film, just shown at TIFF, is destined to become this year's King's Speech (which began its Oscar run in Toronto too, though Philomena has already picked up accolades in Venice). Both British films have strongly emotional undercurrents leavened by wry humour, feature outstanding performances from the leads and are based on true stories.Judi Dench, as the Irish woman whose out-of-wedlock son is taken from her by Catholic nuns and sold to a rich American couple in the 1950's, has never been better. She imbues the role with a mix of wisdom (after all, as she reminds us repeatedly, she was nurse for 30 years) and naivet\u00e9 that would seem to be impossible were it not so deftly handled. While the cynical atheist portrayed by Steve Coogan rarely misses an opportunity to poke fun at her, more often than not she enjoys the last laugh.Despite the consummate acting, and Frears' slick directing, the greatest treat of the film is Steve Coogan's screenplay. Given its subject matter, the story could easily have veered into melodrama, but just when it is on the verge of doing so Coogan pulls us back from the edge. Thankfully, Coogan himself is there to convey precisely the proper blend of sarcasm and compassion.",

            "content": "\"We shall not cease from exploration, and the end of all our exploring will be to arrive where we started, and know the place for the first time.\"Philomena surpassed my expectations considering I thought it would be just another pairing of two unlikely companions on a road trip (the terrible Guilt Trip comes to mind here), but I was surprised to see how well the two main actors played off each other sharing a great chemistry on screen and how well balanced the script was, allowing me to feel completely moved by the story. First of all Philomena is based on a tragic and upsetting true story, but somehow director Stephen Frears (The Queen) manages to tell it with such grace that it feels subtle and humbling at the same time. It never feels like Frears is trying to manipulate the audience through all the sentimentality, on the contrary he treats the subject with light heartedness. A lot of credit has to be given to Steve Coogan who adapted the script along with Jeff Pope (it's actually ironic that it was written by a \"Pope\" considering how bad the Catholic Church comes off here) because it is extremely well written delivering genuine moments with an honest tearjerker. The emotional weight was handled perfectly. I would have never thought a film dealing with such a dark subject could be so inspiring and uplifting, but it was mainly because Philomena decided to respond to the cruelty and injustice very differently than we would (which would be with outrage), and chose to forgive instead. That is how they turned a sad story into an entertaining and enlightened one. Simply put Philomena is a clever film with genuine emotions.The film is based on the true story written by former BBC correspondent and political journalist, Martin Sixsmith (played in this film by Steve Coogan), The Lost Child of Philomena Lee. After a political scandal which leaves Martin without a job, he accepts to write a human interest story when he hears about Philomena (Judi Dench), a woman in her late 60's who had her son taken away when she was forced to live in a Catholic convent after getting pregnant as a young teenager in Ireland. Martin begins investigating her story which eventually leads to some surprising discoveries and a trip to America. Martin and Philomena learn several things about each other despite their differences and uncover some astonishing answers along the way. Philomena is a highly entertaining and feel good movie which reminded me a lot of Saving Mr. Banks in the way the story was told without being manipulative and looking for the easy emotions. Steve Coogan and Judi Dench also proved to be quite a powerful duo in this enjoyable film. Philomena is also extremely well balanced, mixing genuinely funny moments with dramatic ones. It also includes mystery elements and the actual procedural part of the film is what hooked me the most. I enjoyed the way in which the discoveries were being made and how they reacted to each new revelation. Philomena is a charming film that deserves the four Oscar nominations it received. The two main actors are given complex characters with a lot of depth and they deliver brilliant performances, however the secondary cast doesn't do much more than get the procedural moving. Philomena deserves to be considered amongst the best films of 2013.",

This is a real tear-jerker at points, thought provoking at many junctures and full of ironic humour. That's quite a feat and the more enjoyable for being so. I presume the timescale is roughly ten years ago so attempts at getting tech right for the period is still possible - amazing that so recent history can seem like centuries ago when we see old technology in use. I can see this film being a 'classic' long before it reaches any real age. Its the 21st century version of a 19th century Dickens tale, that it is.",

            "content": "*****May Contain Spoilers***** This heart-warming and humorous drama screened at TIFF this year and I was lucky enough to see this premiere, and this film stars Dame Judi Dench, Steve Coogan, Mare Winningham, & Michelle Fairley. \"Philomena\" comes to us from director Stephen Frears, and he has been a very successful director for a very long time with films the likes of \"The Queen\" & \"High Fidelity\" going all the way back to \"The Grifters\" & \"Dangerous Liaisons\".This tale tells of a woman in her mid to late 60's named Philomena, and she is and has been in search of her long lost son for many years. As a young teenager she got into trouble and gave birth to a baby boy out of wedlock. Now in a last chance effort for Philomena she contacts a disgraced journalist to enlist his help in finding her son. This writer is Martin Sixsmith and he is coincidently very much in need of something in his life at this moment, and together he and Philomena embark on a journey of parental heartache while tackling new frontiers within themselves.Well people I will start by saying that director Stephen Frears has picked up right where he left off with \"The Queen\". He seemed to have struggled here and there for a few years, but he is at the top of his game for the second time in the last two attempts. This filmmaker has created drama that is compelling, laugh out loud funny, and solidly entertaining all at the same time, and his direction unfolds the story in a smooth and even manner. Frears knows exactly when and where to be serious, he knows when to lighten the story, and most of all he always keeps the film interesting. There is a plot reveal in the beginning of the second act and it really could've dampened the mood and tone of \"Philomena\", but instead this director constantly takes us into fresh and enjoyable territory.The screenplay is delivered by star Steve Coogan & Jeff Pope and together they have countless television writing credits to their names, but I am totally shocked at just how fulfilling a feature film that they have crafted with \"Philomena\". These screenwriters consistently fill this film with doses of wit and charm, but those moments surround a very interesting and investigating tale. They have created a story full of rich and full characters, and these characters deliver their lines brilliantly. The spoken dialogue is out-and-out bold at times, and even some of the humorous lines had quite an edge to them. On top of all of this the movie is very touching and sincere, and you'd better bring a box of Kleenex when you see this because many were weeping all around me. People will be crying for moments both happy and sad as the tale plays out, but the entire movie will resonate with most people for a while after the end credits have stopped rolling.This takes me to the driving force of this feature, and that would be to stars Judi Dench & Steve Coogan. Dame Judi Dench delivers to us a wonderful turn on the silver screen, and her performance is quite unique because few can find the line between warm, cordial, and direct all in the same film. She very much sheds her usual hard edge in favor a lovely and humane role. She opens the audience up to a motherly love and passion for finding a child that has been long since gone, and at the same time she swears and brings a blunt truthfulness to many scenes throughout the movie.Then Steve Coogan trades in his usual straight comedic portrayal and instead gives us what I would say is his best work on the big screen to date. His work as Martin Sixsmith is a wonderful slice of drama, and his combination of serious & light humor couldn't have worked more brilliantly. Coogan must have had a real passion for this project because he serves as screenwriter and producer as well as star, and you can see that passion when you're watching the end result. He is a character that is maturing into a new spot in his life, and to me as an actor he has accomplished the exact same thing.Now together Dench & Coogan are quite a character all their own, and the brilliant banter between them was definitely the motor that drove this story. \"Philomena\" thrives on the great and constant confrontations between Martin and his older counterpart, and these two performers actually get the best acting out of each other. The more that they are together in the film the better the movie gets, and as the film plays on they both learn and grow as people because of their interaction together. Just like \"Midnight Run\" this movie doesn't work without both the ying and the yang, and would have fallen apart without cooperation.At right around 1 hour and 40 minutes \"Philomena\" was nothing short of a bright shining jewel of a film. This is one of the most moving and pleasantly constructed features that I have seen all year, and I could easily sit through this one again when it gets a wide push across the country. The two lead characters work so incredibly well together that they should consider working with each other more often. If you are a Judi Dench fan this movie is a must-see, if you are a Steve Coogan fan this is a must-see, and if you are a fan of truly great movies\u0085then this feature is for you as well. This movie is absolute perfection & that's why Nick's Reel Screen Review is a perfect 4 stars out of 4, and that's for one of the year's best in \"Philomena\".",

            "content": "Steve Coogan has said that Philomena is his reaction against cynicism - his attempt to make an honest and fundamentally sincere film. The biggest compliment that can be paid to him is that, in these goals, he has succeeded.It tells the story of Philomena Lee (Judi Dench, who is as brilliant as ever), an elderly Irish woman whose child was taken away from her 50 years ago by an austere Catholic convent. Martin Sixsmith (Coogan) is the cynical, know-it-all journalist turned government spin doctor, recently sacked, who is on the look out for a story. After a chance encounter at a party, Sixsmith reluctantly takes up the 'human interest' story of Philomena's search for her son, Anthony.The key to Philomena is the relationship between the titular character and Sixsmith. And it works. It really works, in fact. His cynicism, bordering on arrogance, is matched perfectly by her simple and completely sincere belief in common human decency. It could easily have been overly sentimental, but Judi Dench in particular does a remarkable job of keeping it grounded. There's some very dark stuff here, and it's a testament to the script that the film does not become overwhelmed by it. The Magdalene laundries were awful places, yet this story is not about revenge. I was almost cheering when, at the end, Sixsmith gives one particularly odious nun a piece of his mind. But moments later Philomena accosts him and gives me a slap on the wrist. She does not want revenge or angry confrontation. She just wants the truth. It's a remarkable act of forgiveness, and one that, like Sixsmith, I could not agree with. But then, I'm just another cynical and bitter atheist. I have to say, this film made me angry at myself for being one. And yet it also made me pleased I wasn't a Catholic. Go figure. Philomena is an incredible and heartfelt story. It's desperately sad, yet never overly sentimental. There's some genuinely funny moments, mainly emanating from the contrast between the wide-eyed and refreshing simplicity of Philomena's world view and the weary wryness of Sixsmith. If you get a chance, see it.",

            "content": "You've read the story. You may even have read the book. A few years ago former ITN reporter Martin Sixsmith took an Irish widow on a quest to find the illegitimate son she was forcibly parted from 50 years earlier. The Magdalen Sisters at the convent where she had the baby (and where he was sold on for adoption in the US) are coldly unhelpful, but Sixsmith uses his journalistic contacts to follow up the adoption. As Philomena is quick to admit, Anthony did far better in the US than he would have done in Ireland, but she longs to know that he has missed her as much as she, for all his life, has missed him. You somehow know that this story is not going to have a happy ending.Judi Dench gives a lovely low-key performance as the painfully unsophisticated, doggedly determined Irishwoman. Steve Coogan totally casts off his comic 'baggage' to play Sixsmith, the initially reluctant Sancho Panza on this seemingly hopeless quest. As in THE QUEEN and THE KING'S SPEECH, director Stephen Frears gets the mood exactly right with a careful attention to period details and the nuances of this slight but gut-wrenching story.Philomena's story is a circular one, which ends back at the convent where Anthony was born and then torn away from her. One of the nuns from 50 years ago is still alive and totally unrepentant at the callousness with which these sinful young mothers were treated (dozens of them, perhaps hundreds). Martin Sixsmith's rage in this scene comes across powerfully in the script Steve Coogan co-wrote.I don't personally believe in an afterlife but I found myself thinking that perhaps women like these heartless Fundamentalist nuns are the virgin houris with which fanatics from another faith are rewarded (in Hell, obviously: it cannot possibly be Heaven) for flying planes into skyscrapers and blowing themselves up in marketplaces. They somehow deserve each other.",

Her paths are crossed with a shrewd journalist and a voyage of discovery begins.I found very poignant that two such opposites, in terms of personalities came together. Without this combination this endeavour would have been an exercise in futility. The on screen chemistry of Dench and Coogan is superb where when required each will take the lead and the other will back off to give the space required.A tragic true story, filled with emotion and conveys the spirit of a torn mother.

            "content": "From director Stephen Frears (My Beautiful Laundrette, Dangerous Liaisons, Mrs. Henderson Presents, The Queen), I saw the trailer for this film a couple of times and it looked like something interesting, and good reviews came in, so I took a chance on it, and it paid off. Basically, having just lost his job as a Labour government adviser, Martin Sixsmith (Steve Coogan, also writing and producing) is unsure what to do next, only thinking possibly of a Russian history book, and meanwhile Philomena Lee (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Dame Judi Dench) opens up to her daughter Jane (Poppy Shakespeare's Anna Maxwell Martin) about giving birth in Ireland fifty years ago and being forced to give her son up for adoption. Martin meets the daughter at a party, he is initially uninterested in human interest stories, but he needs work and an editor wants a story, so he meets Philomena, and with her they start to investigate what has happened to her son. Through flashback we see that Young Philomena (Black Mirror's Sophie Kennedy Clark) at the convent in Roscrea, she gave birth to son Anthony, she was forced to sign away her parental rights, she cared for her son until the age of three, working arduous hours in the laundry room, her best friend had daughter Mary and the children became best friends, as they were inseparable a couple adopted them both, Philomena broke drown in tears seeing her son taken away. Martin and Philomena start by visiting the convent, the nuns are polite and welcome them, but they have no information as to the whereabouts of her son or those who adopted him, the records were burned five years ago in an \"accidental\" fire, but drowning their sources in a pub they are told by a young man of rumours that children were sold to adoptive parents, mostly from the United States. They have come to a dead end in Ireland, but Martin has numerous contacts, and one of his specialities is the United States, of of his contacts may be able to help, searching passports and other records he finds evidence that Doc and Marge Hess were the couple that adopted Anthony, renaming him Michael Hess. They follow some clues based on what they have found so far, on the internet Martin finds out that Michael worked as a high-ranking official for the Reagan administration, he was also a closeted homosexual due to the Republican Party being homophobic, but he and Philomena are devastated to know that he died of AIDS nine years ago. Philomena chooses to stay in America to find those who knew him, finding Mary (Mare Winningham) who was adopted with him, she explains that their mother loved them, but their adoptive father and brothers showed no love, and she tells them the name of his close boyfriend, but she didn't tell the old woman whether or not he knew about his Irish heritage or tried to find his mother. They find the house of Michael's partner, Martin knocks on the door but it is closed on him, he agrees to talk to Philomena, and they watch a home video of their time together, and in the footage it is revealed that while Michael was dying he did try to find his mother in Ireland at the convent, and it was his wish to be buried in his birthplace. The story ends where it began, Sister Hildegarde (Barbara Jefford) who formerly ran the convent, still alive, explains that what happened was punishment for the sin of fornication, Martin gets angry but Philomena forgives her, and they find Anthony-Michael's grave to read his final words to his mother, Martin says he cannot find it in himself to tell the story, but Philomena says it is a story that needs to be told. Also starring Michelle Fairley as Sally Mitchell, Ruth McCabe as Mother Barbara, Simone Lahbib as Kate Sixsmith and Sugar Rush's Sara Stewart as Michael's colleague. Dench gives a wonderfully eccentric, lovably friendly and of course emotionally poignant performance, and Coogan proves himself a great serious actor, as well as bringing his usual irritable character humour, as an unlikely double act they both excel. This being based on a true story, from the book The Lost Child of Philomena Lee by the real Martin Sixsmith, it is really easy to settle into, you follow the journey and all the ups and downs, it makes you laugh at the right moments, but more than anything it is really emotional and makes you tearful, especially towards the conclusion, a great must see drama. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Motion Picture of the Year, Best Music, Original Score for Alexandre Desplat, and Best Writing, Adapted Screenplay for Steve Coogan and Jeff Pope, it won the BAFTA for Best Adapted Screenplay, and it was nominated for the Alexander Korda Award for Best British Film, and Best Film, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Drama, and Best Screenplay. Dame Judi Dench was number 1 on The 50 Greatest British Actresses, she was number 1 on Britain's Finest Actresses, and she was number 8 on The World's Greatest Actor. Very good!",

Aided (or should that be abetted) by Martin Sixsmith (Steve Coogan) she begins her journey in England, travels to Ireland and the United States and returns to the convent where her son was originally given away. Stephen Frears' film has its serious points to make about the strictures of the Catholic Church, especially in days gone by, when its dedication to religion rode roughshod over people's feelings. There is a climactic scene involving an elderly nun (Barbara Jefford) that sums up this viewpoint. However the quest narrative is enlivened by two delightful central performances: Dench is alternately humorous, naive and highly moving as Philomena, while Coogan gives quite simply the best characterization I have ever seen from him during his career. He has always had the makings of a good serious actor; this film vindicates that promise. On the other hand the script has a fair share of good jokes at the British and American people's collective expense. Definitely worth watching,",

            "content": "Although Philomena is inspired by true events and not necessarily all true, truth aplenty is present throughout when the story spins outward from the restrictive world of repressive Catholicism, particularly as it relates to sexuality.British and elderly, Philomena (Judi Dench) searches for her middle-aged son, Anthony, who was taken from her at the convent when he was a child and given to a wealthy couple. The nuns had no compunctions about separating mother and child because that separation was God's will, the justifiable punishment for the sins of the flesh.This film is a simple story about a mother who hires a journalist, Martin Sixsmith (Steve Coogan), to find her son. It's an odd couple, she a quiet former nurse, who mostly sees the world as benign and full of good will. He, however, is a cynic, from years of reporting on corruption and losing a job as the PM's spokesperson. The virtue of the film is that while the plot moves apace to find Anthony, the two principals remain steadfastly themselves, although the search has brought out important parts of their personalities. Dench as always gives an Oscar worthy performance. Comic Coogan is a surprisingly effective dramatic actor.Because I was the product of Catholic education through the 8th grade with the Sisters of St. Joseph, I can attest to the profound effect the nuns had on our perception of sexuality. Specifically, when a nun stood me up in 6th grade to declaim me as a \"dirty thing\" for holding a girl's hand, even the \"Joy of Sex\" subsequently couldn't mitigate the hang-ups the nuns' attitudes toward sex engendered in me. The stern, damaging attitudes and actions of the nuns in this film ring true.Philomena is about anyone's journey to find a child and ultimately the self. How the sojourner responds, either despairingly or hopefully, is the reality that this film hits spot on. Love is all you need.",

            "content": "Stephen Frears' most recent project PHILOMENA is nominated for four Oscars including BEST PICTURE and BEST LEADING ACTRESS for Dame Judi Dench (her 7th nomination, only if she could have been active on big screen from the outset of her career, she would give Meryl Streep a good run for her money of her 18 acting nominations record, now the task falls upon her fellow thespians Kate Winslet or Cate Blanchett, both garner 6 so far). As mush as I adore Blanchett, the exasperating case is, Dench should have won over her this year, Blanchett in BLUE JASMINE (2013, 6/10) is astutely an easier kindred spirit for the academy members to relate with, but in this film, Judi Dench personifies the title role, an ordinary Irish retiree who has a tear-jerking back-story which she has withheld for half a century, with a pitch-perfect tonality, she imbues an omnipresent empathy to the role, her perseverance in the route to seeking her long lost son is intermingled with her optimistic nature and hearty philosophy of life, at the climax of the film, she is ineffable when addressing a sounding \"I forgive you!\"or spurning an indomitable \"I didn't abandon my son!\". But what's refining the film is that it is not simply Pilomena's story, Steve Coogan's ex-spin doctor Martin Sixsmith is a weighty protagonist as well, who counterbalances the film with his skeptical, cynical, inquisitive constitution of an atheistic journalist, it is a terrific and almost under-appreciated performance from the notable comedian, who is also billed as the co- screenwriter, which is Oscar-nominated as well. During their journey, the subtle interplay between them are beguilingly sincere, Martin evolves from an observer to an interloper in the heightened confrontation scenes near the coda, he bespeaks our rational psyche towards the sensitive issue, he cannot forgive those nuns who traded kids to American patrons and separated them from their unwed mothers, as most of the viewers, it is not a condemnation to the religion per se, it is common indignation towards the vile individuals' perpetration under the aegis of purported God's ordeal, as a personal rite of passage, Philomena's forgiveness is beneficent and pathos-evoking, but as a social miasma, this act of sacrilege cannot be tolerated and it is sheerly irrelevant of religions. It is a substantially brilliant script as well, far more than a soppy human interest story as it seems to be, it covers many major facets of our contemporary world, such as homosexuality, politics, religious scandals, different world views and self-redemption, at the same time, it teems with jocular segues within, Martin and Pilomena's proxy son-and-mother bond is beautifully embodied with an ingenious set piece of betraying one's true emotion under the pretence of a white lie. I cannot enumerate how great this film is since it is just my cup of tea, nearly perfect, the only thing bugs me is the fact that Philomena firmly assume her son is gay, which seems over- contrived to justify her coolness over the supposed hot potato, another exploitation of stereotyped gay-image, which is not cool at all.",

            "content": "Sometimes, all one needs is an immersing story to satisfy their film-needs and, on that particular note, Philomena delivers in various aspects. Here is a story that could've easily lost its characters in a shuffle had it focused too much on serendipity, Catholicism, themes of faith, and, of course, the plot itself. But this doesn't happen, as actors Judi Dench and Steve Coogan create charming chemistry and writers Coogan and Jeff Pope perfectly balance the story's needs as well as the character's personalities in order to create a warm, effective little drama that has so far shown itself to be 2013's awards underdog.The story immediately depicts the lives of two different people. Martin Sixsmith (Steve Coogan) is a journalist, fired from his job at BBC, and is contemplating ditching another formal job opportunity in order to begin writing a book on Russian history. Sixsmith eventually becomes attached to writing a human interest story on an elderly woman named Philomena Lee (Judi Dench), who had a baby out of wedlock as a teenager at a convent in Roscrea, Ireland and was forced to sign away her parental rights to the child as directed by the nuns. Until age three, Philomena got to see him and on a regular basis and raise him, before he was cruelly taken away by the nuns of the convent who left Philomena sobbing uncontrollably out in the gardens.Fifty years later, even as she nears her late-eighties, still feels incomplete and devastated that she lost a piece of herself and has no idea where to start the search. When Sixsmith interviews Philomena, despite his hatred for human interest stories and his non-believing stance on religion, he becomes invested in her story as well, and the two eventually set off to Roscrea to see if they can find the adoption papers showing what happened to her son before embarking on a cross-country adventure to reconnect with him once more.Ultimately, the main glue of the film aside from the performances is the chemistry that Coogan and Dench ignite when on screen together. They give off a mother/son kind of vibe, with Coogan trying to be the realist in many occasions, with Dench sometimes being silly and a bit gullible. However, make no mistake, Dench's Philomena is not stupid, but simply older and often finds Sixsmith's lack of religion and refusal to answer whether or not he believes in god to be quite incorrigible, especially in one great scene when the two debate religion.Dench gives a strong performance as a clearly-troubled lead who was deeply affected by her son's forced-adoption and is trying to hold on to the hopes that he turned out to be a good person with a good family and still has some respect and love for his birthmother. Coogan, as well, gives a solid performance as an everyman-journalist with a delightfully humorous but often pragmatic view on the world, whose character also serves as Philomena's silent critic at times. \"She told four people today they were 'one in a million;' what are the odds?,\" Sixsmith tells his publicist on the phone.Philomena is crafted with sensitivity as well as with the mindset to establish awareness about the tragic fact that many mothers were robbed of their children as only teenagers and criminally mistreated by a gang of nuns who acted as prison guards rather than holy-women. Never falling in the trap of becoming a messy, overly-dramatized work and never becoming a tired strand of emotionally mawkish moments (a misstep that could've crippled everything), Philomena develops the same simple likable personality of its protagonist.Starring: Judi Dench and Steve Coogan.

It would be good, and I would want to listen, but coming from the mind of this third party, this Martin Sixsmith, I wouldn't be able to leave my chair.I was captivated in hearing how this Irish Catholic little girl (okay, teen) commits the ultimate (not really) sin of sex and nine months later trades her child's life for a life of church work and repentance. When the story turns into ex-communicated (sorta) journalist who aids her (now a senior) plight to find her missing boy that was horribly sold to an American family, I couldn't take my eyes or ears away.Steve Coogan (the reporter) has always been on my radar for a good time at the cinema. He's hilarious, deep and charming even when down. He takes on the same motions as I do when we both realize our audience doesn't fit our sense of humor. He was a joy to watch and kept me engrossed.Dame Judi Dench (the title character that I cannot spell without copying/pasting) was wonderful, as always. I loved the layers she displayed when needed, her spunk that was sporadic and desired and her trueness to the life of the woman she was portraying. She never ceased to amaze me and made me smile.

In essence, the Irish church ran homes for women who were pregnant with out-of-wedlock babies. These homes were essentially prisons. After giving birth, the women were forced to \"work off their debt\" with five years of hard labor. The children were often adopted by U.S. couples, and the mothers were forbidden to establish contact with them.In this excellent, moving film, Judi Dench plays Philomena, a woman who survived the Magdalene experience, and has been trying to locate the son taken away from her and sent to the U.S.Steve Coogan plays Martin Sixsmith, a cynical journalist who connects with Philomena, and sets out to help her find her son, and to help himself find a really powerful story.Coogan does a fine job, as does Sophie Kennedy Clark as the Young Philomena. However, as expected, the acting honors go to Judi Dench. Dench is surely one of our greatest female actors. She manages to make Philomena into a real multifaceted person, rather than just a scarred and victimized woman.We saw this film in Rochester's excellent Little Theatre. However, I think it will work well on the small screen. In whatever format you see it, be prepared for some harrowing scenes of young Philomena's life in the Magdalene home.

This is in some ways a simple film. An elderly woman recalls her life in a convent school where she has her out-of-wedlock son sold to a rich American by the nuns. She is reluctantly approached by a depressed, down-and-out reporter to do a human interest story. He is not too keen on doing this but becomes more and more involved as her tale unfolds. What drives this wonderful movie is the subtleties of great acting. These people are portrayed as true, fragile human beings. They laugh; they cry; they hide feelings. Philomela keeps her faith despite being victimized by a system that did despicable things to these unfortunate teenage girls, including near-slave labor. The story is a quest to find the child she lost fifty years previously, including a trip to Washington, D. C., where significant facts are revealed to her and her biographer. Things eventually come full circle. This is one of the finest movies I've seen and certainly an Oscar candidate.",

            "content": "Philonema is a condition of narcissism that is epitomizing the social network community in where people post an overwhelming amount of selfies and egoistic messages that makes them \"Phil\" of themselves; hence the term Philonema. I am kidding of course, but sad to say this is happening. \"Philonema\" is really an endearing movie based on an incredible true story about an elder Irish lady named Philonema Lee and her quest to find the son that she unwillingly left for adoption some 50 years ago. Philonema as a teen was a student in an Irish boarding catholic school. When Philonema got pregnant from a sexual encounter with a male teen she met at a fair, you can pretty much \"Phil\" in the blanks on how the nuns at the boarding school responded. Move 50 years later, Philonema teams up with journalist Martin Sixsmith in trying to reconnect with her son. Sixsmith is a former BBC reporter and government correspondent who unfortunately got into a spin doctor-like scandal which left him unemployed. Sixsmith, at first, decides not to help Philomena, but then has a change of heart; due to the fact that it presents him an opportunity to write a human interest story for a British news publication on Philonema's mission. Acclaimed British Director Stephen Frears takes no fear in depicting all the elements of Philonema's tale; including the film's controversial religious undertones. Steve Coogan and Ed Pope's screenplay did a phenomenal \"Philonema\" writing job in adopting I mean adapting Sixsmith's book \"The Lost Child of Philonema Lee\" into a formidable screenplay. And then there is Judi, Judi, Judi. Madame Dench marveled in her astonishing starring performance as Philonema. Coogan not only co-wrote the screenplay, but also was extremely sound in his performance as Sixsmith. \"Philonmena\" was filled enough with positive elements for you to adopt it in your movie viewing schedule. **** Good",

            "content": "Let me start this review by writing that I was not familiar with Steve Coogan at all before last year. I never heard of Alan Partridge. Then I got to watch \"The Look of Love\" and became instantly curious. After watching Philomena, I think I can safely say that nobody else rose this high during the last year on my popularity scale for 2013. It's been a great year for him: a new Partridge film and also he was in one of the biggest commercial hits of the year: Despicable Me 2.However, back to Philomena: Coogan (who also wrote the movie and got his first Academy Award nomination) here is the co-lead to Judi Dench's character named in the title. Stephen Frears directed Helen Mirren to Oscar glory before and without Cate Blanchett in contention, he probably would have managed the same for Judi Dench here. It is certainly my new favorite from Frears. There are many subplots here. The one that did not touch me as much as I hoped it would was the homosexual part. Still I thought the watching the part with the old video connected to Pete Olsson made up for it as we see two people confronted again with a loss that happened a long time ago.When we find out her son is dead, it is extremely moving, also how Coogan's character sees it first. Another part I really liked is the completely different approach the two lead characters give the monastery: Coogan all confrontational (although he is not the one who lost somebody), Dench all calm and reserved showing that despite what happened, she still is a very religious person. Very well-acted and much, much better than when she would have acted the way he did.If there is a criticism, one scene seemed a bit odd to me, namely when they saw Coogan's character with her son on an old photo. How much is the likelihood of that? Anyway, if it actually happened in reality (as the film is based on the real Philomena Lee), I said nothing. These are just minor criticisms though. \"Philomena\" is one of the best and most moving films of 2013 with two outstanding performances and I urge everybody to see it. You will not regret it. I really liked the scene in which she runs out of the church being conflicted with who she is and what she does believe in. Of course, her tight connection with the church also helps her deal with the loss of her son (again), even if it already happened many years ago. She knows, thanks to her faith, that he is probably in a better place right now.Another major highlight are the flashback scenes to young Philomena. Frequently, these are very difficult to exercise with credibility, but here it works all so well, maybe also because of the old camera they used. They really gave me the chills and a lump in the throat. Another great strength of the film is that it is not 100% serious and you will find Coogan's typical humor here and there and still it never feels forced, instead puts a smile on your lips, which is always a good thing with films like these to keep them from becoming too depressing. The scene with Dench's character on the balcony is a bit of a tough one for me. I did not like it that much when seeing it first and it seemed like a bit of unnecessary drama, but thinking about it again and considering that she may have never had the intention to jump, I get to appreciate it more and more. I will have to see this one again for a final verdict.Let me close this review by writing that I liked the small insight we got into the world of journalism and how Coogan's character is extremely under the pressure to come up with a scandalous article. The biggest scandal, however, would be, if you miss out on that wonderful movie.",

            "content": "A bittersweet tale of a mother's search for a loved one from her past forms the core of Philomena, a real life semibiography of atonement and forgiveness amid ignorance and the passage of time. As directed by Stephen Frears (The Queen, My Beautiful Laundrette) from a screenplay by Steve Coogan and Jeff Pope from Martin Sixsmith's book, \"The Lost Child of Philomena Lee\", it features impressive acting and an affecting story.Martin Sixsmith (Steve Coogan) is an unemployed news writer in Britain who is searching for direction in his life. At the same time, an elderly woman, Philomena Lee (Judi Dench), prays in church and commemorates an anniversary of the pain and loss of her illegitimate son. She recalls the distant memories of working at an abbey in Ireland and being forced to give her young boy for adoption. Her plight makes its way to Sixsmith who at first is not interested in human interest stories, but Philomena's anguish kindles a curiosity within Sixsmith and eventually grows into a crusade that has the support of a publisher. Stymied by false leads and lost records, Philomena's desperate search for her adult son leads to a revelation and the truth despite the dogmatic doctrines of a holy institution.Simultaneously a love story of a mother for her child and an investigative mystery, this is essentially a two person play, in which Philomena and Martin are contrasts in personality and background-she has a na\u00efvety about her while he is a born cynic. That she must experience a full spectrum of emotions during her journey from shame to anticipation to despondency contrasts with Martin's determination, anger, and frustration.As expected, Dench (Skyfall, Notes on a Scandal) excels in the sensitive role of an older woman anxious to reconnect with her son. She even gets the nuances and behavior of a woman who has had a sheltered, broken life and lacks the sophistication and social graces of normalcy. This detail is nice texture to her character. Like the sole photograph she has of her son, she clings to memories and hopes of redemption. Coogan is quite convincing as the determined reporter, quite a contrast to his comedic roots in British television and film.There is liberal use of flashbacks to show Philomena's life as a teenage girl. Sometimes dredging old memories can cause great pain not only for Philomena, but for other people who hold clues to her son's whereabouts. What become of him? What kind of relationships and profession did he have in life? And perhaps, most importantly, did he ever wonder about his birth mother? The film shows how life can be a series of events punctuated by remarkable links and coincidences particularly in one revelatory moment that serves as a remarkable thread that binds the principals together. Some antiquated themes recall the stigma of being an unmarried mother and the practice of adopting illegitimate children through the church. In some ways this film is the flip side to The Cider House Rules.It calls into question how much an institution like the Catholic Church may or may not have been complicit in the knowledge or whereabouts of her son. It seems too obvious to place responsibility and condemn the Catholic Church, the very foundation of faith, and its nuns as villains. In fact you wish you could learn much more about the motives and thinking of the older nuns and countless other nameless victims that passed through the abbey; Philomena is but one story. What about Philomena's life beyond the abbey? We see that she also has a grown daughter, and yet we don't have those details.After all that has transpired, the detective work, and globetrotting from Europe to the United States, there is only the love between a mother and her son. In the end, a mother's hope and a reporter's quest become a heartfelt search for the truth, a truth born of love that transcends time.",

Judi Dench is an automatic 5 stars (sorry my prejudice) and gave us a believable performance of a woman who is coming to terms with her actions and faith. There is some religious discussion, but mostly on the role of the Catholic Church and how it conducted its business.

            "content": "The story of the Magdalene laundries is not exactly a chapter of Irish history that anyone wants to hang on a wall. For more than 200 years, the Magdalene laundries were an asylum engineered to incarcerate young girls who were either promiscuous or prostitutes or the victims of rape. It was little more than a sweatshop in which the girls were forced into hard labor \u2013 usually doing laundry - for a certain term and were regarded like inmates. These asylums were sanctioned by the Catholic Church, operated by nuns and privately funded by the government. Many girls were guilty of nothing. Some were pregnant and had children and were only allowed to see their children for an hour a day. Even still, a child could be adopted and sent away without the mother's knowledge or consent. You should know that this is not a story out of The Dark Ages. In fact, the very last of the Magdalene Laundries closed its doors in 1996.Don't panic, though. Stephen Frear's film Philomena is not an expose of the Magdalene laundries. That story has already been told in Peter Mullan's hard-bitten 2003 drama The Magdalene Sisters. They do, however, serve as a backdrop to the story of one person whose life was affected, for better and for worse, by her time locked away behind the walls of the laundries.Philomena tells the story of Philomena Lee, an Irish catholic woman who spent most of her life regretting one fateful event that never left her heart. A half century ago Philomena made a mistake, the consequences of which have haunted her ever since. Back in 1951, she was a teenager. She went to a carnival. She met a boy. Things got serious. Nine months later she was living in Sean Ross Abbey in Roscrea where she gave birth to a son she named Anthony. Later, she was forced to stand by helplessly as her son was adopted by an American couple. Philomena, a devout Catholic, believed that her separation from her son was penance for her sin. Yet, it is something that she has never come to terms with. Half a century later, her sad eyes are a window into painful memories and regret.Philomena, played in a lovely performance by Judi Dench, wants to know what ever happened to her son, and finds herself in the company of an out-of-work BBC reporter named Martin Sixsmith (Steve Coogan, who co-wrote the film) who, at first, sees the old girl's story as a sellable human interest piece. Anyone with eyes can see that she is much more than just a sound bite. She's warm-hearted, a bit na\u00efve, with a stubborn resolve, yet she's not a standard crabby old bat. She's a cozy soul with a twee Irish accent and too often the perpetrator of TMI.At first, Martin is purely professional, but as the deep wounds of Philomena's story unearth, he finds himself taking it personally. He is at odds with her passionate faith, because he himself is a newly-minted atheist. He labels himself confidently, but we sense that he hasn't completely rid himself of all doubts. The two are not on equal ground. Martin's mind is a flurry of intellectual cynicism. He's a college-educated journalist who seems to have a quip, an aside, and an answer for just about everything. Philomena, meanwhile, is earnest and straightforward. She sees the world in terms that are purely black and white.The search for Philomena's son becomes an awakening for both she and Martin. Travelling from rural Ireland to England and to American, the two dig up bits and pieces about Anthony, some of which are a relief, others are painful. What she finds will not be revealed here, except to say that it is not what we expect. Little by little, bit by bit, information about her son comes to light; yet, all Philomena really wants to know is if he ever wondered about her.What is interesting about Philomena is that this is not a hard, maudlin melodrama. Frears allows a good deal of humor, especially in regards to Philomena's awakening to the rude shocks of the modern world. She's surprisingly calm, especially in her attitude about the sexual encounter that produced her son.Judi Dench, whose presence in a film is welcomed no matter what she's doing, gives one of her best performances as a woman whose eyes betray a weary heart. Through the years, her missing child has never left her mind or her heart, yet the experience hasn't destroyed her spirit. She is a woman devoted to God, un-embittered by her experience that keeps her mind on the task and won't allow herself to be pushed into outbursts of emotion.The outbursts are reserved for her travelling companion. Martin reacts more or less the way we would. He's outraged by what he learns about Philomena's experience. He's a man who has slipped away from God in the cold of a brutal world (remember, he's a journalist) and he can't understand her unbending faith. You expect a film that is emotional, but you don't expect one that brings in questions of faith and the meaning of God. During one roadside rant about the meaning of God, he asks her if she really believes all that she claims, and he is stunned by her straightforward, \"Yes.\" Philomena is a very moving film. It is touching when it needs to be, humorous when it's appropriate and comes to an ending that never feels like a manipulation. If there is one weakness it is probably that it leaves several questions unanswered. Those are difficult to discuss without spoilers, but you walk out in deep discussions over some of the issues it raises. This is a beautiful film about the chasms of time, the measure of lingering heartache and the manner in which old wound are dealt with.***1/2 (of four)",

Two people united in their efforts to solve a mystery can have vastly different reactions to the same situations. Such personality and attitudinal differences are the real core of this story ... even more than the true life inspired story of a quest to reunite a mother and child after 50 years.Peter Mullan's startling 2002 film The Magdalene Sisters provided us a look into the dark side of Ireland convents in the 1950's. Here, director Stephen Frears brings us the very personal story of Philomena Lee - one of the unwed teenagers sent to the convent to deliver her baby and work off her debt to the nuns and church, after signing away all access to her child. It's a heart-breaking story of the times, of the church, and of a singular woman. Philomena struggles with guilt and regret over 50 years until her daughter arranges a meeting with journalist Martin Sixsmith. This begins their journey to uncover the truth and find Philomena's son.Dame Judi Dench plays Philomena and Steve Coogan (also co-writer and producer) plays Martin, resulting in a very \"odd couple\" road trip and personality test. Dench is remarkable is her role as the simple woman who reads romance novels, gets excited about salad bars, is thrilled with mints on her pillow, and has lived a lifetime with a hole in her heart created by having her young son ripped from her world. Coogan is effectively restrained as the snooty Brit journalist who thinks human interest stories are a waste of time. She has maintained her religious faith and faith in people, while he has long ago given up on God and flaunts his cynicism in most every situation.Some will view the movie as anti-Catholic ... it is difficult to defend the painful childbirth, isolated mothers, selling of children and lack of assistance in reconciling the parties. Others will view this as a victory of faith over intellect. It's the world-weary journalist with the $5.00 words who ends up learning a life lesson. It can be a reminder that life is going to throw some difficult situations your way. It's your attitude and approach that will determine how you deal with it ... and how much emotional pain follows. This is another entry into gray cinema that will generate much debate a discussion ... a sure sign of success for a movie! www.MovieReviewsFromTheDark.wordpress.com",

            "content": "Philomena, is a film that proves the old saying true, that sometimes true is stranger than fiction and also in this case this true story is better than a lot of original screenplays of this, or other years. As many of my readers know from my other reviews, I am a big Steve Coogan fan as The Trip, was my favourite film of 2011 along with David Fincher's The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, and I have basically been a fan of Coogan's since I saw him in 2002's 24 Hour Party People. I was intrigued when I heard that he adapted a screenplay based on a true story and that he was starring in it as well. The film went even beyond my highest expectations and I have to say that I loved every minute of this film. First of all, the characters. Philomena herself and the wonderful performance by Judi Dench, is one of the film's strong driving factors. She plays a woman, who is in some ways maybe a little simple, but there is so much more to her as we see as the film moves along. This is an intelligent woman who may like things low key and simple, but she has the faith of a child and along the way she has learned something that others have not, mainly acceptance and forgiveness of others, no matter what people may, or may have not done to you. She is a pragmatic and optimistic person and her joy just radiates off the screen and put me into a good mood watching her. A woman of good moral values and also a beautiful woman inside who his driven by her faith and her positive attitude. Steve Coogan's character, journalist Martin Sixsmith, is a character we have seen Coogan play before. One with a superior attitude and a huge ego, but again Coogan plays this type of role to perfection here and just as with Judi Dench's character, Philomena, there is a lot more to Coogan's Martin, than what we see at first glance. Here is a man who from the beginning is only helping Philomena, for the sake of a job, or career, that may, or may not be there, but as he gets to know her and the facts start to unravel in their search, we see that Martin, puts aside his own beliefs and attitudes and you can see how he starts to admire and have respect for both Philomena, as a person, but also the qualities, characteristics and the things that make her who she is and the contagious optimism and good positive attitude she brings along most of the time. Martin's character does not seem to have any faith, but we can see that later on that he respects Philomena for hers. The story to the film as I mentioned earlier, is based on fact and I found myself absolutely loving these two characters and the events that lead up to the film's finale, moved me on several different levels. The film has times where you laugh out loud with joy and happiness, but there are also times where we are deeply moved and touched inside by what we have seen and the things these two characters have learned about themselves, each other and the past, while on this journey together. It's overall a feel good film and I left feeling good about what I had just seen and it gave me things to think about and contemplate after the film was over. I appreciated director Stephen Frears' choosing to not give the film a huge budget and making everything seem more low key and earthy. I feel that had he gone the Hollywood route and glamorized the film more, the whole thing would have felt manipulative and I do not think the same emotions, or connection we make to the characters would have been there. So kudos to you Mr. Frears for doing the film right. The film boasts terrific lead performances from both Dench and Coogan, and Coogan's screenplay and Frears' direction are all top notch as well. As we get closer to the end of this year, I am finding it harder and harder to make a \"best of\" films list of 2013 because we are getting a lot of really good films as of late and there are still some that I need to see. As it stands however, Philomena, would be in my top 10 list of best films of the year, if I were to create such a list and in my mind it could easily sweep all Oscar categories next year and I would be perfectly content with that. A masterful, moving and a sheer joy of a film. I absolutely loved it. A masterpiece.",

With the help of a BBC reporter, Dench travels to Washington DC where the truth is revealed, and all is not happy once she finds out.While the novel tells the story mostly through the son's eyes, this is told through Philomena's, obviously to focus on the wonderful Dench. It's not a story of the evils of the church, but one woman's determination to reach out to her greatest love, an adorable little boy who went far in life, but not without a price.The way this story is told in other hands would be a lifetime movie, but with Dench, it is a personal story, a character study, a tale of redemption and finality, and obviously, a lesson in what great acting is all about. Dench is pretty much the whole film, glowing even under the most tragic of circumstances. One should not see the negativity about the church here, just one aspect of a huge organization that has a history of both good and evil.",

In a smart and nuanced portrayal of a London high society castoff opposite the peerless Judy Dench, his understated performance allows the audience to feel rather than just observe his character's emotions. And emotions aplenty there are. The story follows the true story of an Irish nurse's breaking of a fifty-year silence about an unwed pregnancy and it horrific aftermath as it twists across the sea to Washington DC and its suburbs and back. Ironically, Coogan's editor (after a life in the halls of power, his character is reduced to writing this presumably puff piece) berates him to define the woman's story in terms of \"goodies\" and \"baddies\" while the film itself allows no such simplicity. It may be perceived as a deserved attack on the Irish Catholic Church but it does not really play out that way with Dench's nurse absolution of the convent that either took her in or imprisoned her depending on your point of view. The beauty of the film precisely results from it allowing you have that point of view. It may be a terrible date movie but its a great movie to discuss afterwards and that discussion will be both heated and satisfying. In short, mature audiences will thorough enjoy this British import and should see it in the theaters as an inducement for more thoughtful intelligent fair and less \"Grown-ups 2\".",

We both were moved by this true story of an elderly woman named Philomena (Judi Dench) who attempts to find her son who was taken away from her for adoption by the abbey she stayed at as a teen and the reporter Martin Sixsmith's (Steve Coogan) helping her in doing so. It takes them from England to Ireland where the abbey is and then to Washington D.C. I'll stop there and just say there's many touching moments as well as a few intense ones concerning Sixsmith's confrontation with one of the elderly nuns, among others. There's also some humorous ones. While the film, through Sixsmith, does criticize some of the tenets of the Catholic faith, Philomena's continuing faith balances some of that. Since Mom and me are of that religion, we didn't take it personally. So on that note, I highly recommend Philomena.",

The movie chronicles the story of Philomena's quest in search of her long lost son which travels all the way across the ocean to different countries. And again this incredible story ended in the hands of a great director. The director Stephen Fears just put some magic spell on the story and it became a soulful movie with the fine support from his cast and crew.The movie was just like I wanted. From each level of the story, it surprised with the beautiful turning points. It was a single movie, but I felt I saw part by part, chapter after another with detailed information. 'Philomena' is phenomenal movie of the year. The depth of emotions can be felt through our heart, very touching story. An inspiring movie for other mothers who are still looking for their lost children. One should never lose his 'hope', it can be used as a powerful weapon to discover what had you lost.I had seen plenty of nature documentaries about a mother and love towards her kids. It might be a polar bear from Arctic or a penguin from Antarctic they all fight for their little ones and ready to give her own life when it matters. In this movie Philomena's (Judi Dench) child was taken away from her under some tough circumstances. She kept it secret in her sealed lip but never stopped to look for him. She waited for 50 year-long, finally with the help of a former BBC journalist, Martin Sixsmith (Steve Coogan), she succeeds to follow the tracks. Whether the mother and son unite or not is the movie's end.As far I know the best ever performance by Steve Coogan. This movie definitely will boost his confidence for his future project and also will help his professional graph go upwards. Never doubted the James Bond lady (M), Judi Dench as Philomena. Her experience came to very useful to shape up this movie well. Never could have been this much exciting the movie without these two along with the director. Hope they all join hands together for another project in the near future.9.5/10",

As a \"Magdalene Laundry\" unmarried teen mother in 1960s Ireland, the nuns who provided room and board (and hard work for sinful young girls) sold her small son into adoption in the US, and Sixsmith joins her in her quest to find him.This film is gripping stuff - while one accepts that there is some dramatic license, the overall thrust of the narrative is true, and the heartlessness with which these young mothers were treated (for there are too many similar accounts to believe that this sort of thing did not happen) is gut-wrenching. The story goes in some unexpected directions, and the two key characters, played with brilliance by both Dench and Coogan, have an uncomfortable chemistry: neither is wholly likable, but both are very human and easy to identify with, and their growing relationship is one of the strengths of the film.Kudos also to Coogan for co-scripting and co-producing. I have long admired his facility for creating characters, but without actually liking any of them, and he has successfully established a career in movies without setting the world alight. So it is really good to see him not only deliver a performance of maturity and sympathy which owes nothing to his career so far, but also to have such a strong hand in creating this film.This is an excellent film.",

The thing that made this film work was the chemistry between Dench & Coogan ho played there roles extremely well. You can't help getting caught up with the emotional storyline which is touching in a comedic way. After finding out that this was a true story, I couldn't believe that the nuns were so cruel towards the little girls. Anyway, the the movie well put together by the director and it very well written. I wasn't expecting that much from this film, which was what made me enjoy it even more. I just fine that people give this small independent movie a chance. Enjoyable!Round-Up: Steve Coogan is more popular in the comedy world, which was why I thought that it was a weird choice to cast him in this role, but after watching it, I could see why he was there first choice. I much prefer him in serious roles because he still adds a touch of wit which worked well in this film. Judi Dench just can't do any wrong. The older she gets, the better she gets, and I don't think that this film would have worked without her. She has a sweet but firm way to acting and with such a deep storyline, her style worked extremely well. I'm sure that the real life Philomena can't complain about the way that her life has been portrayed. Budget: $12million Worldwide Gross: $100millionI recommend this movie to people who are into there deep drama's/comedies about a lady who is looking for her son with a journalist who wants to tell her story. 7/10",

            "content": "The film is not something spectacular, quite the opposite, it is quiet, almost homey. Dench and Coogan make a fantastic pair and their acting and the well done dialogues are what make the movie great. After all, the rest is just them moving around and talking, seldom only to one another. But I think that this was a good decision to take. It is not about loud emotions or vigorously reacting to something so despicable, it's about coming to terms with what happened and overcoming pain.The plot itself is based on a true story. This old lady is looking for the son that was taken from her when she was young. She kept the entire thing hidden because she felt that it was her fault, as a sinner, to get pregnant and that she deserved everything she got. Of course, that's what the nuns that sold her child and kept her as a slave told her. This is not the only film that I saw portraying that period in time where rich couples, mostly American, came to Ireland to buy children while local organizations, mostly religious and political groups, made good money out of it.Bottom line: a quietly powerful film, very well acted, with some nice dialogues in the script. It is a drama and some parts to lag a little bit, even if they are meant to show us more about the characters. I've heard criticism about the anti-Catholic bias of the film. Given the storyline, I would have found it difficult for it not to be. Also, the AIDS thing is real, as are all the characters and names in the film, it's not a movie gimmick.

            "review_title": "Human Interest",
            "content": "\"Philomena\" is based on a book written by the British journalist Martin Sixsmith, detailing a story which he investigated. As the film opens, Sixsmith has just lost his job as an adviser to the Blair government and taken on a freelance assignment to write a \"human interest\" story about an elderly Irish lady, Philomena Lee. (Sixsmith normally dislikes this type of journalism, but has been forced to accept the assignment through dire financial circumstances). Some fifty years earlier she gave birth to an illegitimate son and was forced to give him up for adoption. Sixsmith meets Philomena, and the two begin the search for her missing son Anthony who, it turns out, was adopted by an American couple and taken to the United States. In the event Sixsmith and Philomena do discover the truth about Anthony, but this is one of those films that raise more questions than answers. We are left wanting to know more about all the main characters because there are at least three potentially fascinating stories that are told only in part. The first is that of Philomena who became pregnant as a teenager, was abandoned by her family (as happened to many girls in a similar situation in the ultra-conservative Irish Republic of the fifties) and forced to enter one of the notorious \"Magdalene Laundries\" run by the Catholic Church. These laundries, which were the subject of another recent film, were officially homes for \"fallen women\", but in fact were more like prisons whose inmates were treated as virtual slave labour. (The Church made handsome profits from their work). The second story left partially untold is that of Anthony, or Michael as he is renamed by his adopted parents. He grows up to be a brilliant lawyer and Republican Party activist, becoming a high-ranking White House official in the Reagan and Bush senior administrations. He was also gay, but is forced to keep his sexuality hidden because, in Republican circles at least, America in the eighties could in some ways be as morally conservative as the Ireland in which his mother grew up. The third story is that of Sixsmith himself; we are told that he is a lapsed Catholic but never really learn just why he has turned against his former religion with such vehemence. At the end of the film Sixsmith is unable to forgive the nuns for the way in which they have treated Philomena, although she, who despite her experiences still considers herself a believing Catholic, is quite prepared to forgive them. (I did, however, find myself wondering whether Philomena's forgiveness was in fact a subtle form of revenge. For a self-righteous, dyed-in-the wool bigot like Sister Hildegarde, being publicly forgiven by a woman she regards as an immoral sinner is probably a worse insult than any amount of invective could have been). That all these potential avenues were not explored in full was probably due to the need to keep the running time within reasonable limits. The resulting film could well have ended up as dull and bland as some tabloid \"human interest\" story. That is does not is down to two very accomplished performances. It comes as no surprise to find myself writing about a great performance from Judi Dench. She is, after all, one of the leading lights of the British acting profession and has been superb in a number of films over the last couple of decades, including \"Mrs Brown\", \"Iris\", \"Ladies in Lavender\" and \"Notes on a Scandal\", as well as bringing a new interpretation to the character of \"M\" in the Bond series. Stephen Frears also directed Dench in \"Mrs Henderson Presents\", one of her less successful recent ventures. One of the reasons why I disliked that film was its emotional dishonesty; we are supposed to admire Laura Henderson as a feisty old lady, but for all her skill as an actress Dench never succeeds in making her likable or making her seem anything but a harridan. She was much more successful playing Barbara in \"Notes on a Scandal\", another selfish old harridan but not one the film-makers want us to like. \"Philomena\" by contrast, shows us another side to her talents, that of playing a genuinely sympathetic character, although in this case one who possesses great reserves of inner strength. What did come as a surprise was to find myself writing about a great performance from Steve Coogan, at least in a serious drama, if only because he has for so long been associated with comedy, especially with his \"Alan Partridge\" character. \"Philomena\" seems to have been a labour of love for Coogan, because he not only stars in the film but also acted as producer and co-wrote the script. Frears can be an inconsistent director- \"Mrs Henderson\" is not the only weak film on his CV- but at his best, as in \"The Queen\" or \"Dirty Pretty Things\", he is capable of telling a human story with insight and sensitivity, and \"Philomena\" is another one to add to this list. 7/10 A goof. We are informed that Jane Russell adopted a child from the Roscrea convent and that she was only allowed to do so because she was a wealthy Catholic. Russell and her first husband Bob Waterfield did indeed adopt a son from Ireland, but from Northern Ireland rather than from the Republic. Moreover Russell was well known for her evangelical Protestant beliefs and was never a Catholic.",

            "content": "Right at the beginning of this review I have to tell that Philomena is a beautiful and a heartwarming movie. And it's based on true events that will make you adore the things you already have today. You will feel like hugging the main characters (Especially the old woman Philomena played by wonderful Judy Dench) and thank them for being who they are and for what they did and finding solace on a rough place of life lived with difficulty. And if you want to stop reading this review right this moment and decides to watch Philomena I will not mind at all.Philomena is a main character of this movie. She is an orphan who has spent her life at a convent from a very young age where she has taken a sacred vow of silence following her unexpected pregnancy. Forced to go through rough labor to pay for her sins she gets to see her child only an hour a day until one day the convent decides to give away the child for adoption. Shattered and traumatized for life Philomena lives keeping this a secret for 50 years. And finally she decides that someone should know. Her emotional journey of finding her 50 year old lost son is accompanied by a freelance writer Marin Sixsmith (Steve Coogen) who has his own life difficulties to overcome. (I hope I have not given away too much of the plot)Philomena is based on 2009 investigative book by BBC correspondent Martin Sixsmith. It's directed by Stephen Frears the man behind the acclaimed Queen (2006) and it is a British production. I must say that Philomena caught me by surprise. I knew little about the plot when I started watching and it was surprising to witness how interesting it's becoming every minute. And further realizing that they are true to life raised my interest furthermore. Judy and Steve are fantastic in their roles and for a moment Philomena becomes a mystery and the next it becomes a deep heart melting drama. This has the power of storytelling and telling it beautifully from start to end. The key to success of Philomena is its emotional value no doubt.There is something so very sweet about Philomena. She is so calm and amazingly empathetic towards the people who have made her suffer a lifetime. And it's so dramatic to witness her keeping all that pain in her heart and still manages to keep the faith to what she believes in. She symbolizes the motherhood in such a powerful way and more than that she reminds us to be grateful for the joys of life and people we come across even how insignificant they may seem. Maybe that's the great lesson that Philomena teaches us.",

            "content": "Every year I go on a quest to try and see as many of the Best Picture Oscar nominees as I can. I knew literally nothing about Philomena outside of a standee I had seen at the theatre and who was in it. Sometimes I love walking blindly into a movie. I have discovered so many great films that way and this was no exception. Since releasing my top ten films of 2013 list I have came across two films that probably deserve to be on that list and Philomena is officially one. It has been two days since I've seen it and I'm still thinking about it. As another reviewer said it is a subtle film, far from in your face that sinks in slowly and completely wins you over much like our two main characters. Whether it is based on a true story or not has nothing to do with it, this is a beautifully shot, wonderful story and the characters are just completely brilliant especially Philomena herself. You will fall in love with everything about this. It almost moved me to tears, it made me smile and while I initially felt like the ending let me down just a little, the more I thought about, the more I understood how perfect it was and how much it made me smile...even 48 hours later.I will start with Oscar nominated Judi Dench. This isn't Meryl Streep's performance in August: Osage County where it's over the top dramatic and in your face (nothing wrong with that...just pointing out its a very different role.) At first Dench seems almost plain and you wonder what the big deal is about this old lady named Philomena. And then within a half hour...maybe minutes...you will completely fall in love with this woman who loves life, has faith stronger than anything else in the world, adores people and treats others like gold. Watching her worm her way into the heart of this hard-headed news reporter is mesmerizing and Dench deserves her nomination completely. Steve Coogan who also co-wrote the screenplay is just absolutely perfect as the brash, angry, emotionally closeted former BBC anchor who was disgraced and is disenchanted with people and the world. His performance is also subtle and watching his character unfold and change is brilliance. I feel like he may have deserved a nomination too if there hadn't been so many truly excellent performances this year. I'm not saying he wasn't great, he was but he wasn't quite at the same level of Dench. Regardless the two of them together are simply epic. This is chemistry that must be seen to be believed. Their interactions and dialogue right up to the closing scene is beautiful. Sophie Kennedy Clark is also very, very good in a small role as young Philomena. I even think you see a little of Dench in her look which helps to add to the authenticity of the story. Barbara Jefford, Peter Hermann and Sean Mahon deserve mention for their much smaller but vital roles to the story. They absolutely all stand out in their respective parts.I am learning more and more with film that the director can make or break a film. Philomena I am convinced required someone who knew how to tug at heart strings, use the beautiful scenery behind these characters and let these terrific characters unfold at their proper pace and tell this really moving story. Stephen Frears has been around for a very long time and while I haven't seen a lot of his work, he clearly has a ton of experience and talent behind his directorial work. This film might not appeal the same to everyone. I have really been in place where I'm enjoying films with a lot of hidden depth. You can watch a movie like this and just enjoy the story and be done with it. Or its the type of movie where you can look at the underlying message about faith, forgiveness, family and finding yourself. This is a must see and while I don't think it'll be bestowed any Oscar's due to the heavyweights it is up against, I assure you this is well deserving of its critical acclaim. It will absolutely be in my collection!! 9/10",

Now that a writer comes in the scene, Philomena accepts going to the USA in order to find any clue of where her son might be nowadays. Philomena gives the impression of being an alienated and ingenuous person-- and in fact she might be--, but her decisions throughout the story are very rational, surprising the spectator all the time. The photography directing is beautiful, remembering me of 2010's \"The Ghost Writer\"; even the stories are, somehow, similar. The acting convinced me as being professional in the airport scene, in which both Coogan and Dench had to be VERY careful to not look at the camera. The peak of the story happens at Pete's home, and I'm not giving any spoilers about it. The lecturing that the writer does to the sister is a great moment in a great movie.

Frears has found success throughout his career in particular with his last true life tale The Queen but here injects not a huge amount of imagination into a tale that could of involved through not only the present but with flashbacks and well-constructed present scenes. Another element of the film that could of potentially been improved upon is the performance of Steve Coogan who far too often in front of camera seems to be playing a slightly different version from his real life self not an actual embodied performance and his turn as disgraced former journalist Martin Sixsmith is again proof that his range is arguably fairly limited. While the film here fails in these mentioned areas it also excels in two very important ones that in its script and the portrayal of Philomena by Dench.While Coogan miscalculated his appearance in the film he absolutely nailed the script of Philomena with his writing partner Jeff Pope. There are many touching and at times very witty moments in the film and banter between Coogan and Dench is frequently smile on the face joyous. The rich script by Coogan and Pope is fantastically played by Dench who instills Philomena with an air of grace, humour and love and in any other year there is a high chance that a well-deserved Oscar would of gone her way. In many ways Dench is the reason to watch the film and it is well and truly hers overshadowing even the true life story at the centre of this tale.Philomena is a highly inoffensive drama that highlights an oft hidden and extremely interesting time in the Catholic Churches' history. With more flair behind camera, a stronger supporting turn to go along with Dench's role for the ages and with more emotional investment for the audience to grab onto Philomena would have been a downright classic but as it stands it lives solely off an acting great at the top of her game.3 paperback romance novels out of 5 For more movie reviews and opinions check out - www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com",

And while its all quite accurate (at least from my perspective), the movie has really shown some guts in being so forthright with its views, and it should be commended for this.'Philomena' is based on the true story of a woman who had her young son taken away from her almost 50 years ago when she was living in a convent, after she teams up with a journalist to try and track down her son. Judi Dench has received an Oscar nomination for her performance. She played the role well, but it was probably more the story than her performance that brought out emotions in me. There can be absolutely no doubt however that she is a fine actress. Steve Coogan plays the journalist (and also co-wrote the screenplay). He impressed me immensely. His usually hilarious humour took a backseat for the most part and he showed another string to his bow with a memorable performance.The movie itself it very well made. It has us sad at times, it has us laughing at times and as previously mentioned it can make us a tad angry at the injustices this world can possess. It poses some challenging questions at times, like whether or not there is a god, and handles them delicately while still making some great points.

            "content": "Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK) Rating: 4.3/5 starsBased on the 2009 investigative book, \"The Lost Child of Philomena Lee\" by BBC correspondent Martin Sixsmith, \"Philomena\", the film, focuses on the efforts of the titular character (Dench) to reunite with the son she was forced to abandon decades ago. Being a mother to a boy conceived out of wedlock, \u2013 something her Irish-Catholic community including her own family looked upon with sheer contempt \u2013 she was subjected to inhuman acts in the name of repentance before God by a group of Catholic nuns, and eventually had to stoically watch in submission while her son was given away for adoption in the United States. In following church doctrine, she was forced to sign a contract that wouldn't allow for any sort of inquiry into the son's whereabouts. After starting a family years later in England, for the most part she moved on with her life, until the flaming desire to see her son again couldn't be subdued no longer. In her twilight years and with nothing more to lose, she finally confides her secret with her daughter. Her daughter has a chance encounter with a BBC reporter, Sixsmith (Coogan), which leads to Lee teaming up with Sixsmith to discover her long-lost son.\"Philomena\", based on a real case, is a powerful and heartfelt drama with a sledgehammer emotional punch and a stellar performance from Judi Dench, along with an intelligently judged supporting contribution from Steve Coogan. Yet the film's apparent simplicity and force come to us flavored with subtle nuances and subtexts, left there by the people who brought this story to the public.At its center is a tough-minded, elderly Irish woman, Philomena Lee (Dench), and her struggle to find out what happened to the baby boy taken away from her in the 1950s. As a teenage unmarried mother, she had been forced to put up her child for adoption, while working in one of the Irish Republic's penitential \"Magdalene Laundries\", which survived until the 1980s. These cottage industries of shame and self-hate were run by nuns and priests who had a nasty secret of their own: they discreetly accepted substantial sums of money from America's childless Catholic couples. It was a baby-farm business model that ran on cruelty and hypocrisy. But the film is also about a former media apparatchik's personal need for a redemptive act of goodness after being mired in the shabby and inglorious world of political spin. And at a level below that, the film could also be about a reporter working through his own strong feelings about what he feels to be two malign institutions \u2013 the Church and the concept of religion.Coogan is the producer and co-writer of Philomena, and he plays Martin Sixsmith, the former BBC correspondent turned New Labour political adviser who, in 2002, was ousted from his job in an unedifying row over smear allegations and a leaked email. (The film is adapted from Sixsmith's own book.) Unhappily returning to work as a freelance journalist, he chances across the extraordinary story of Philomena, played by Dench with such effortless poise, cerebral comic charm and heart-tugging potency. Sixsmith takes Philomena to America on a mission to track down her lost son. Coogan's Sixsmith is shown initially deriding as a \"human interest\" story: mid-market newspaper slush. Yet he takes it on and they make the oddest of couples. Martin is the high-flyer who has risen in the amoral world of politics and the media. Philomena is the working-class woman who holds on to one clear moral fact: what the church did to her was wrong, but she doesn't want revenge, only the truth.The story of Philomena's teenage self \u2013 she is played as a young woman by Sophie Kennedy Clark \u2013 is grueling. An agony and lump-in-the-throat desolation can be felt when seeing the teenage mums having their babies taken away from them. And all of it sanctified in the name of Mary Magdalene, who received from Christ a compassion that is nowhere visible now.What Sixsmith and Philomena discover in the US is gripping. Dame Judi Dench shows how Philomena is scared, but has reserves of humor and courage that Sixsmith, for all his sophistication, can't match. There is a touch of Crocodile Dundee in Philomena's wide-eyed presence in the big city, of course, but it is great stuff from Dench. At 78, the British actress, has become an international treasure, able to play steely, formidable characters with as much ease as cozier, more grandmotherly roles. All those qualities are amply evident in \"Philomena\". Dench delivers one of her most recessive, stark, and arresting performances yet as the soft-spoken, slightly frumpy Philomena Lee, who sets off on a search for her now-middle-aged son and debates the tenets of her faith with Martin Sixsmith, the skeptical journalist chronicling her journey. British comic actor Steve Coogan plays the ink-stained scribe with a tone-perfect mix of acerbity and tenderness. Coogan keeps everything pretty low key, except for his raging and remarkable outburst towards the climax, when he finally comes to terms with the staggering amount of atrocities Philomena has suffered at the hands of the pseudo keepers of faith and their skewed morality. Coogan's role is written to be well- restrained and he underplays it really well. The dramatic and moral focus of the story is entrusted with Dench. Director Stephen Frears guides this arrangement with a sure hand.At its core, \"Philomena\" is a clever, wrenching, profound story that underscores the tenacity of faith in the face of unfathomable cruelty. The result is a moving and exhilarating film, and the strange chemistry between Dench and Coogan ferments into a full-proof, riveting, and soul stirring emotional drama. As Coogan's character, Martin Sixsmith, shrewdly notes, \"Evil may be good story-wise, but virtue, at its most tested and tempered, is even better.\"",

            "content": "In Irish History, the Catholic Church had been responsible for destroying many young women's lives, by shaming them for having children out of wedlock and sentencing them to labour camps. Philomena Lee is one of them.Martin Sixsmith (Steven Coogan) is a former BBC correspondence in Russia and America and recently lost his job as a Government spin-doctor. Jobless and with little in his book on Russian History, Martin stumbles on the case of Philomena, a religious Irish woman who reveals she had a child as a teenager and was taken away to be adopted by an American family. Taking on the story Martin and Philomena go to Ireland and Washington D.C. to find Philomena's son.Philomena is an actor's movie, a showcase for top performances. Dench is excellent in the title role, giving a grounded, believable performance of a woman with modest tastes who is excited by the prospects of luxuries and gets the balance right between the dramatic and the lighter. Dench works well with Coogan, as he has some funny lines, but also shows a more serious, passionate side as he seeks justice for Philomena.Philomena is centred the relationship between Philomena and Martin and their differences. These differences manifest in a number ways, one being culturally as Philomena is a kind hearted woman, while Martin is a well educated snob, with an awkward sense of humour. Philomena is a religious woman and Martin is an atheist, leading the pair to clash over their ideologies, their views of God and how could someone be religious and forgiving after what happened to Philomena. Martin grows from someone seeking a good story to someone who wants to do the right thing, growing as a character.With religion clashing between both Philomena and Martin Philomena also looks at the institution of the Catholic Church. While there are some decent people within the Church and the personalities of people leading the church have changed, the Catholic Church as an organisation have covered-up many things that they have done and not are willing to face up to their liability and guilt. Yet, Philomena does showcase the difference between personal faith and organised corruption.The Queen's Stephen Frears directed Philomena and though he has a hit and miss record, he directs Philomena with competence. Frears is able to use a number of approaches, doing a mini remake of The Magdalene Sister with Sophie Kennedy Clark did an excellent job playing the young Philomena and hopefully has a long career ahead of her. Frears was able to blend the drama and comedy, bringing out wit of Coogan and Jeff Pope's script whilst keep the dramatic tone. Frears has some visual flourishes with film footage of Anthony growing up in America and brief look of gravestones of girls in the abbey.Philomena is a superbly acted movie, that Dench should be nominated for a number of awards. It is a movie a lot to say about personal relationships, the rights of a woman and a mother, faith and institutional failings and corruption.",

            "content": "Summary sez all, but I guess I gotta flesh it in a bit.I'm reminded of the stage play, \"How I Learned to Drive\", a story about childhood sexual abuse. I remember getting ready to make the drive downtown to see the show and thinking, how in the heck are they going to tell this story and make it work? In a sense, Philomena has some of the same hurdles; an unspeakable circumstance, people who want to find out the truth, people looking for a redemptive angle and the seemingly impossible upstream swim that implies.Another beautiful aspect of the flick is the story-within-the-story; that it's about Philomena's backstory... and yet also about the present day, and a sort of triumvirate: The Journalist, the Catholic order that acts under an assumption of divine fiat, and (between them, sort of), Philomena. So we get two craftily aimed firehoses of narrative in one film; an embarrassment of storytelling riches!Now, I'm giving this flick a '10', overriding my usual resistance to giving more than a '9' to any flick that lacks in any department. And, sitting here typing this, I'm not exactly sure what's lacking. There's a lingering reservation on some point of technique or other. Perhaps a lackluster edit, here or there. But this story is too important. The masterful writing for character, the direction of those characters, and the quality of the writing that blasts away the fog and reveals the hard reality, means that I have to override these nit-picky reservations and concur with other thoughtful consumers of film that Philomena is a rare burst of light that illuminates the moral landscape in a timely way. Timely, not because it shows a contemporary moral lapse, but because grand moral lapses of the past have a way of reverberating through all time, including our own; and this one does.Bravo, and looking forward to more wonderful expositions on these kinds of mere human interest stories.",

            "content": "Adapted by Steve Coogan and Jeff Pope from Martin Sixsmith's 2009 book, The Lost Child of Philomena Lee, Stephen Frears' Philomena is the story of an Irish woman who teams up with a British journalist to look for the son she was forced to give up fifty years earlier. It is both a comic \"buddy\" road trip and a stinging commentary on the practices of the Roman Catholic Church in Ireland in the 1950s, though the impact of its message about the inhumane effects of religious dogma is undercut by its feel-good banality. The fact that it hangs together as well as it does is due to the superb work of Judi Dench as Philomena Lee, the mother seeking the truth about her son and Steve Coogan as Martin Sixsmith, a cynical ex-BBC journalist looking for a \"human interest\" story to restart his flagging career.As a teenager, Philomena (Sophie Kennedy Clark) had an affair with a young man whom she had met briefly at a county fair. Pregnant and rejected by her family, she is sent to a church-run home for unmarried pregnant women in Roscrea, County Limerick in Ireland. Here she gives birth to a son, Andrew, under the judgmental eyes of nuns who attribute her pain in childbirth to God's wrath for her promiscuity. The young Philomena, working long hours at the convent in what amounted to slave labor, is allowed to spend only one hour a day with her son. Sadly, when the boy is three-years-old, he is \"sold\" under his mother's watchful eyes to an American couple who make a large donation to the church, a practice supported by the Irish government.On Andrew's birthday fifty years later, Philomena reveals the story to her daughter Jane (Anna Maxwell Martin), telling her that she knows nothing about what has happened to him but thinks about him every day. Philomena, however, is introduced at a party to a journalist who had just been fired from his job and who reluctantly and with much sneering agrees to pursue Philomena's \"human interest\" story which he pitches to a magazine editor. As Martin and Philomena attempt to track down Anthony's whereabouts, a search that will bring them to Washington, D.C., the film becomes less about the investigation than about the interactions of the unlikely duo.The two do have a certain amount of charm together, but the film unfortunately turns the sincere and devoutly religious Philomena into an unsophisticated middlebrow bumpkin who relates in excruciating detail the plot of a romance novel she is reading, loves movies such as Big Momma's House, and who, on visiting the Lincoln Memorial declares \"Look at him up there in his big chair!\" Though the film exploits her naivety for laughs, she wins the day in the purity department when contrasted with Martin, the snarky, cynical Oxford graduate who calls the nuns the \"Sisters of Little Mercy,\" and uses warped humor to assert his antagonism to all religion.Philomena's story is basically a simple one of faith and love and the willingness to overlook and forgive the wrongs done to her. Unfortunately, it receives an over-sentimentalized and maudlin treatment at the hands of Frears that negates the film's enlightened message about the true substance of faith \u2013 love, charity, and compassion. Though we are told from the outset that the film has been \"inspired\" by real events, the caption should have read \"uninspired\" and \"by-the-numbers.\"",

            "content": "Stephen Frears seems to be the champion of the above-average middle-ground cinema. At the very least, he's consistent, Philomena is my fifth 7/10 from him (only disappointing me once with My Beautiful Laundrette, 6/10, and surprising me once with High Fidelity, 8/10). But it's a good film to add to the pile anyway. Philomena is lovely and simple. Perhaps too simple to be anything more than mildly satisfying. It hinges on Judi Dench's terrific performance. She's created a thoroughly charming character and through her acceptance and determination one we can't resist to follow. Although I haven't watched Alan Partridge, I've always been a fan of Steve Coogan from The Parole Officer. While here he's better as a writer than an actor, his performance is good too despite some off-moments. The script diligently follows the script- help books and efficiently lays out the plot in that moment-to-moment guide. But this restrain isn't a distraction, in fact it's admirable in its economy. The only thing that holds back the script is the dramatic appeal of the material, but it makes great use by taking an indisputable injustice into a detective story with an unlikely pairing. However, while it makes great use of its limitations, it doesn't feel ambitious in scale. Instead, it feels like it's prepackaged to be adapted to the stage in some form or another. It would benefit the story greatly as the film suffers from poor editing. Shots are left noticeably too short or too long among distracting continuity errors and it affects the pacing severely. Although, I must admit, the key moments are in Dench's heartbreaking-or-making closeups. It has a theme in its design of bouncing around binary oppositions. The cinematography is simple and minimal, focusing on contrasting shades of blue and orange. The oppositions are most apparent with the pairing of Coogan and Dench and the past with the present. It deliberately serves little meat but it chews it with confidence. However, as a relevation-driven film, it does take a little bit out of the experience to know anything beforehand. I loved how it has self-aware ideas on storytelling, whenever the film hits a lull, it re-evaluates itself and decides what kind of step it needs to take next. With an only-sometimes preachy religious argument, the film's dignity is in its fascinating climactic note. A film more worth watching than I expected.7/10",

            "content": "Philomena is undoubtedly a film and a story that pulls at our heartstrings. (Do hearts have strings? Seems I'm falling back into old fashioned rhetoric.) It's the story of great injustice, cruelty, that was doled out to young girls of 50+ years ago who had the misfortune in society's eyes to become pregnant out of wedlock. It's easy enough to say that this attitude is a byproduct of the Irish Catholic Church, but that would be like saying that antisemitism was German. It would be a misreading of both history and the facts. Thus, although the nuns and priests who were complicit here are not given a pass (you should have heard the quiet condemnatory outbursts from my fellow audience members) this is not a story of the Catholic Church vs. the more caring world, but rather a look back in time to a series of widely played events whose ramifications still echo today.This is the story of one woman, Philomena, as portrayed in her old age by Judi Dench. She is a stoical, quiet, but yet lighthearted woman who has an undercurrent of great sadness. We begin the story with her finally telling her daughter about the son she had at age 18 who was taken from her and adopted away. She had never spent a day in the ensuing 47 years without thinking of him and at last admits that she desperately needs to seek him out, \"I just want to know that he was loved.\" We follow along on her journey, driven along by her daughter catching the attention of a journalist, Martin Sixsmith, who is at loose ends and rather reluctantly agrees to help her in her search using all the considerable skills of a long professional career. This is a true story in that there really is a Philomena Lee, whose son, Anthony, was taken from her at age three by the same nuns who had been sheltering them, and using her for free labor. And there really is a Martin Sixsmith, the journalist who helped her. The story takes some flights of fancy, playing with the facts as I understand from interviews with Philomena Lee herself, to keep it watchable, but the underlying story elements are correct and the emotions are authentic.But what makes this film so very watchable are the performances. Judi Dench once again proves that she is one the finest working actors of our age. Her performance is absolutely exquisite. I found myself almost holding my breath in a few of the emotion laden closeups of her face. Steve Coogan, as Sixsmith, is also very, very good. And very much worth mentioning is Sophie Kennedy Clark who plays Philomena as a young woman. But as I frequently find with a film which contains such stellar leading actors, the supporting actors also all do a very fine job. I even like the glorified extras who played the hotel staff.Much effort has been made to assure that this film is entertaining. It has humor, twists and turns, and real drama. I don't think anyone will be leaving the theater with a happy little gait. However, I think I can promise you will be profoundly moved as well as thoroughly entertained.",

            "content": "Judi Dench is \"Philomena\" in this 2013 film also starring Steve Coogan.This is based on a the true story of an Irish woman who wants to find the son that was taken from her some 50 years earlier.Her daughter tells journalist Martin Sixsmith some of her story, and he agrees to help her.This is a harrowing story of what the Catholic nuns in Ireland did to unmarried pregnant woman, especially because it's true. Philomena's family disowned her and she lives in a convent run by nuns, who make the girls work at various jobs, such as in the laundry and in the kitchen in order to pay their keep. Their children are kept from them; they're only allowed to see them a little bit each day. The children are then sold for big bucks to wannabee parents, usually wealthy Americans. Unless the girls have money to buy their way out, they have to stay in the home for three years.Though the nuns refuse to help in any way, Sixsmith uses some contacts and eventually their quest leads them to Washington, D.C.With Judi Dench as the star, you can assume this is a wonderfully acted film, and it is, with Dench playing a woman who has, as Sixsmith put it, lived on a steady diet of romantic novels. She's not sophisticated or particularly worldly, and despite her heartbreak, she's not a bitter or unkind woman. But she won't rest until she knows what happened to her little boy, whom she adored. It's a powerful story of love and determination. And the humor in the script is beautifully mined by both Dench and Coogan. Coogan is wonderful as a man who didn't want to take on the story and does, then is stuck with a woman who wants to watch \"Big Momma's House\" instead of sightseeing in D.C., and who insists on telling him the plot of books she's just read. But he can't help but care about her.There are excellent performances by one of my favorites, Mare Winningham, and Sophie Kennedy Clark, who plays Philomena as a young girl. It's a class act all the way, framed by Stephen Frears' fine direction and Coogan's script, which he wrote with Jeff Pope.I saw this at a film festival and the real Philomena spoke. She said she was overwhelmed at the thought of Judi Dench playing her and happy with how the film came out.A beautiful movie with lots of heart.",

            "content": "\"Retired\" from the Government due to his supposed part in a scandal, Martin Sixsmith is out of work when he is approached by a waitress at a party and told of a lady who is looking for her son many, many decades after she was forced to give him up for adoption by the Catholic nuns when she got pregnant as a teen. With not much else on his plate and support from an editor looking for a human interest story, Martin agrees to cover the woman's story, which then turns into working with her to try and turn a piece into a full story with a good ending.When I read about this story I presumed that the film would play out like it was a professional version of a Hallmark channel weepy \u2013 lots of sentimental music to tell you when to cry, big showy performances and the like. Fortunately the film appears to have judged the tone very well throughout and it plays out in a much more responsible way than I expected. Part of this is the way the film is structured so we come into it with Sixsmith and stay with him throughout. This provides a good frame to the film but also means we are able to observe Philomena from the side and also reduce the need for the viewer to be directly aligned with her views but rather with those of Sixsmith, which I think is more how most viewers will feel. The writing does allow for the emotional impact to be felt; yes there are thematic simplifications in here but generally this is a true story and the film allows the pain to be shown. It does have moments where the viewer is nudged towards emotion and can be slightly sentimental, but mostly the film is led by the two characters to hold back from this \u2013 it is not a weepy and Philomena herself is conflicted and charmingly simple (for want of a better word). This somehow makes it more impacting and I liked the lack of showboating and flamboyance.The two performances are a big part of this; Dench underplays nicely and has a good sense of her character. At times she does seem to be more about the quirks rather than being a real person, but I think this is more reflective of the type of person rather than a weakness in the performance. Coogan is engagingly impatient and I liked that the film never lets him totally warm to Philomena in the way that he may have done had it been more of a \"regular\" telling of this story. The supporting cast are solid but really these two are the whole film.Philomena is moving as a true story and the writing does a very good job of making it into a film that flows and moves. Delivery of this is responsible so that it is engaging and moving but doesn't really resort to sentimentality to push the viewer somewhere \u2013 and the odd touches of this are totally forgivable and understandable.",

It didn't win those, but the nominations are a testament to how good it is.Judi Dench is Philomena, who as an Irish teenager back in 1950 or so had one wild night at a fair, fooled around, and became pregnant. As it seems was common back then in strict Irish families, she was sent away to a convent to have her baby and work, an outcast from her own community.A different actress plays the teenage Philomena and in flashbacks we see that her young son was given up for adoption without her permission or knowledge, she didn't even get the chance to tell him goodbye. Only much later in the movie do we find out the relevant details of this.The movie could have been another \"crucify the Catholic Church for its wrongs in orphanages\" but it doesn't really go there. The wrongs are obvious to us today, but the story here keeps its focus on Philomena's attempts to find out what happened to her son, with the help of a journalist.That journalist is Steve Coogan, who actually co-wrote the screenplay, as Martin Sixsmith, a real person who had been active in government journalism both in England and in Washington D.C. To Philomena he seems like a nice man helping with her search. But he is being paid by a magazine to flesh out the story, for him it is an opportunity to regain some positive recognition after just being unmercifully \"sacked.\" It really is a well-written and well-acted movie, and both Dench and Coogan are great in their roles. Can we believe Dench turns 80 later in 2014? The cinematography is also excellent, filmed in England, Ireland, and the areas surrounding Washington, D.C.SPOILERS: When the two of them visited to old convent to see what they could find the nuns and staff were not cooperative, and they claim adoption records had burned some years back, although the paper Philomena signed all those years ago giving up her rights was still easily found. They finally found out it was a practice to \"sell\" adoptions to US couples for $1000 to $2000, and that is where her son went. They changed his name, but an internet search turned him up with his birth day and location. Unfortunately he had died young a few years earlier, he had been a successful lawyer working in Washington, and had never forgotten his Irish roots. He was a homosexual, died of AIDS in his 40s, and was sent back to Ireland for burial, in that same convent graveyard where he started out. Philomena was able to visit his grave and achieve some sort of closure.",

This was one of those dramas that was capable of making you smile at the innocence of Philomena one moment, chuckle happily at the interaction between Philomena and Martin another moment, and then make you cry like you lost the family dog over the heartache Philomena goes through on her journey to get the truth the next moment.\"Philomena\" is just one of those strong films that is set in place by realistic and convincing emotional turmoil and excellent acting. It's one of those movies that you just don't watch but you experience the story and sympathize with those involve. You become emotional invested and that makes the film so much more than an adaptation of a true story and ends up making the film very personal and deep.Hello there!

More particularly, Philomena (played by Judy Dench) is forced to give up her son for adoption by the Catholic Church in Ireland. About 50 years later she enlists the help of a journalist, Martin Sixsmith (played by Steve Coogan) to tell her story and help find her son. The journey takes them down some unexpected paths.Very sensitive in the telling, especially as Philomena comes to terms with the path her son's life took, and how she was excluded from his life.Not overly profound - the story is more about the journey than the destination. The folksiness of Philomena's character wears a bit thin after a while, but, thankfully, the writer and director tone down the folksiness towards the end.It is Coogan's character and performance that keep the movie moving along - he is cynical yet humorous and gets the funniest lines. He represents the average person's reaction to the heinous deeds of the Catholic Church. Not brilliant, but a good story that is never dull.",

It also has the advantage of being closely based on a true story involving some fairly prominent political figures. While it may not have the heavily dramatic twists and turns that many desire, there is well-earned surprise and revelation here. Judi Dench is her usual great in the lead role, and Steven Coogan is also most convincing as Martin Sixsmith, a tabloid journalist who discovers that silly human interest stories for \"weak-minded\" people can involve matters that any intelligent person should care about. Outstanding acting by many of the supporting cast as well, a wonderfully rich script, and expert cinematography that gives us some stunning views of rural Ireland.There is an interesting mesh of somber, often disturbing back-story of Philomena's adolescence and pregnancy in an Irish orphanage during the 1950s and more upbeat yet moving front-story of her search for the son she hasn't seen in 50 years. The storyline is amazingly well-put-together: Even the apparently irrelevant comic asides relate to the plot in a meaningful way.Note: I agree with another reviewer who stated that the cover photo for this film is VERY misleading as to PHILOMENA's atmosphere and general content.",

            "content": "A world-weary political journalist (Steve Coogan) picks up the story of a woman's search for her son, who was taken away from her decades ago after she became pregnant and was forced to live in a convent.The film is nominated in four categories at the 2014 Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Actress. While it seems more than fair to give a nomination to Judi Dench for her portrayal of Philomena Lee, I strongly suspect she will not win it. There is a little range of humor, kindness and confusion in her character, but nothing that tries to really stretch the talent of an actress like Dench.The Best Adapted Screenplay category seems to be where this film has the best chance of winning, if it takes home any statuettes at all. While I have not read the source material, I think they succeeded in turning this (mostly) true story into a compelling drama that is steadily paced and enjoyable to watch. Rather than a drab documentary, they succeeded in telling a tale, sticking (mostly) to the facts and having viewers appreciate what they saw. Steve Coogan deserves this award.As for Best Picture, the film is out of its league. Like \"Nebraska\", it is a charming story about an older person and has a great sense of wits about it. Both films are worth watching again and again. But \"best picture\" does not mean \"most enjoyable\" or even \"the film that will go on to become a classic\", even if that is what it should mean. And \"Philomena\" never seems to take movies anywhere they have never been before. (Not that this stopped duds like \"Argo\" and \"The Hurt Locker\" from winning in recent years.) Kelly Torrance of the Washington Times found that the film \"ultimately feels false\", with the filmmakers succumbing to the temptation to focus on the \"lessons\" the story holds at the expense of the human story itself. This is something that bothered me, as well. Without giving too much away, the facts of the story are bent the most when it becomes convenient to raise the issues of kindness, Christian forgiveness and doing what is right.While it is certainly not wrong to pontificate in a film about morality, the issue gets messy when it is falsely injected into a true story. A complete fiction can make such moves, but injecting motives and emotions into characters (Philomena and Martin) that do not reflect reality... that just seems improper. Maybe there was no moral to the story? Maybe it was just something that happened.Others have condemned the film as anti-Catholic (and further said this is something the Weinstein Company has a habit of promoting). That is a fine line, and one I am not sure I agree with. While the institution presented here is shown quite negatively, it is just how the place was. Is it \"anti\" something to just tell the truth? And to say the film is anti-Catholic ignores Philomena herself, a God-loving Catholic who has tried to do right. At no point is she ever seen in a negative light.But anyway... as far as the Academy Awards go, expect no Best Picture or Best Actress. A Best Adapted Screenplay is warranted, but would come as a small surprise to me when up aqainst \"12 Years a Slave\". (How \"Before Midnight\" ended up in the category is a complete mystery, though.)",

But the thing is she wouldn't have allowed it had she known about it or even had the power to decide. And here is where a person like Philomena rises above it all. She does not show hate towards the nuns that took her child away because she understands their position. In the end though her mother instinct is always present and she can't help but feel incomplete. With the chance to make things right Philomena sets out on a journey to not only find her son but also complete herself.Judi Dench is up to the task as she plays the emotions of this Irish woman to near perfection. You could really feel she tackled the character with great concern and it payed off in the end. Steve Coogan looks really confortamble in this role as he plays his usual comical nature in some scenes and also showcases some more serious tones in more grounded scenes. Stephen Frears (Dangerous Liasons,The Queen) directs this screenplay, written by Coogan himself, and ultimately does a nice job in which the actors shine the most. Also worth referencing is the decent cinematography and gentle soundtrack that compliment the film well.Rating 7/10",

One can note the different values of a different era; one can also note the strangeness of the institution of a convent, and the effect that might have on a human being; one might still not completely understand how such things can come to pass. The film explores the issue through a mostly true story, with Steve Coogan playing mostly straight as ex-BBC journalist Martin Sixsmith who investigated the story (can be really have been so socially inept, however?) and Judie Dench playing somewhat (but not only) for laughs as an Irish woman stripped of her child. Another insight into human cruelty is provided in the background: the Reagan administration's attitude to the A.I.D.S. crisis of the 1980s. Overall, the film is a typically workmanlike effort from Stephen Frears, not especially subtle but with real moments of humour and insight. But it's hard to regret the passing of the age that it depicts.",

The movie struck a few chords in me as this film strikes up a riveting tale. It's a small movie that relies on very few big-name actors, but everyone struck the right tune in their performances. The film does have some things to say about the Catholic Church and corruption within, so that was an interesting theme to see develop. This film has a big heart and the film is just really an old-fashioned, feel-good story.Stephen Frear's film is about a woman named Philomena Lee who tries to find her long-lost son after being forced to give him up to adoption while growing up under the care of nuns. She recruits the help of a washed-up journalist named Martin Sixsmith who decides to use this case as a human interest story. But as the search continues on, this case means more to Martin than he ever thought it would.The film doesn't rely on an abundance of stars. Just two names will do, and these names certainly did well. Judi Dench was absolutely amazing and she hit all the right marks in her role. Her emotion was genuine, and unlike many of her films, Dench shows her soft underbelly to her on screen hardness. Steve Coogan is the rightful companion of Dench in this movie. He also delivers a heartfelt performance and the film shows Coogan does have a dramatic taste to combat his usual comedic talent.Overall, Philomena is a fantastic movie based around its characters and larger-than-life story. The ending is excellent and quite emotional. It's nice to see a film where the Irish are not given a bad rep, unless you count those Irish nuns. But the film is based off true events, which makes the film even more meaningful. Some of the home video footage was actually real footage of Philomena's son, so that was quite something. Overall, this is a fantastic movie. I rate this film 9/10.",

Normally I find Steve Coogan obnoxious and an acting joke but in this vehicle I found I could actually watch him without a sick bag on hand though I do draw the line at two out of the three people who have written here and, clearly fully paid-up sycophants, give him full credit for the screenplay which makes it appear that Jeff Pope was just there to hold Coogan's coat and look cute when, if the truth were known, Coogan, who also produced, probably got a token credit in the way Irving Mills got a co-composer credit on Duke Ellington songs in return for publishing them. No matter, we still have the film and it's well worth having if only for its exposure of the evil nuns who ruined hundreds of lives with their Draconian rules in the nineteen-fifties and continued to lie blatantly even fifty years later, in fact I'm almost ready to overlook Coogan's obnoxious public life up to now in return for his heartfelt \"f***ing Catholics\", as succinct a description as I've heard. Incredibly the real Philomena is still alive and remains so brainwashed by Rome that she actually publicly forgave the nun mostly responsible for ruining her life, a nun, moreover, who shows not a scintilla of remorse.

The humour is kind of a long those lines. You don't realize that the movie is funny until a joke has just been said and you've been given a moment to digest the punch line. The movie really is very funny.Martin Sixsmith has just been fired due to poor communications within the Labour Party. He's been asked to do a human interest story, and he proceeds to tell this poor woman, in no uncertain terms, exactly how he feels about human interest stories. As I don't want to do the dialogue injustice by improperly paraphrasing, let's just say that he feels about human interest stories the same way I do \u2013 their only value is to make the audience cry for 15 minutes and then is completely forgotten in a sea of worthlessness.Since \"Philomena\" is a human interest story, I couldn't wait to see how they juxtaposed that they were telling the very type of story that they hate. This works on a few levels. For starters, the story that they set out to tell is solved half-way through the movie. Sure, it's a sad story but it is told so humorously due to the differences between Martin, the writer, and Philomena (Judi Dench), the heroine. Philomena was raised by Catholic nuns and when she got pregnant as a teenager, her son was taken away from her. She wants to find her son and get some closure. Martin, who refers to the Catholic nuns as the evil nuns, has no problem telling this story because he wants to expose an ugly history to the Catholic Church. \"Philomena\" is elevated to that of a brilliant film because it makes an otherwise sad story funny, it juxtaposes the Atheist Martin with the Catholic Philomena and tells a story that they're both happy with \u2013 the evil nuns are evil but their beliefs are still allowed to be their beliefs.

            "content": "Philomena is the kind of film you really need to see first before you judge its quality instead of relying on your detraction from the seemingly unexciting trailers. Judi Dench plays a sorrowful mother who's looking for a son that was taken away from her decades ago due to her loyalty to nunnery and now- as the opportunity presents itself- she asks for the help of a cynical reporter (one that doesn't possess the slightest idea of his future pursuits), who's played by the wonderful Steve Coogan, to aid her in finally locating her dear son. In essence, it's the brilliant chemistry between the two that solidifies the remarkable quality of the picture. There's no doubt that the film is a dramatic piece, filled with heartbreaking thematic material and doleful moments, but it also intelligently employs hilarious humor that'll undoubtedly crack you up even if you're still saddened by the prior scene's gloom. I've said it before and I'll say it again: Steve Coogan is a terrific comedic actor who incessantly retains a high level of likability and charm no matter how mean-spirited of a character he portrays. His addition to the narrative provides genuine amusement and truly invests the audience into the unraveling of its mysterious and intriguing plot. Judi Dench delivers a fine performance as well, and in union, their incredibly strong personalities ultimately drive the entertaining nature of the movie. By the end, you can't help but feel dejected because you're practically saying goodbye to two individuals you've been properly acquainted with, and that's an obvious strength of the screenplay- coupled with splendid acting- which boasts clever and authentic dialogue and rids any superfluous content in order to sustain its engrossing pace. Even though this isn't the cinematic experience to flaunt its technical accomplishments and awe-inspiring visuals, it instead carries that element of warmth and pleasure that's far more precious than either of the above, in my honest opinion. Clearly, it's not appropriate to compare a thrilling and bombastic adventure to a heartwarming and endearing one, but I seriously felt a kind of contentment and delight from embarking on this compulsive adventure along with the film's completely antithetical characters. To offer a little more explanation, I'll mention my arrant fondness for the film, Elf (2003), despite the fact that Philomena is considerably more somber. The convivial atmosphere, enchanting characters, and sheer fun of these personal stories are frankly some of my greatest viewings. Again, the film's dramatic tone may thwart my point from reaching some readers, but I'm essentially attempting to say that the ride was absolutely worth it through its wonderful ambiance. Furthermore, surprisingly, moviegoers should expect several twists and turns along the way, resisting a predictable structure that a typical drama from Hollywood frequently features. Look, overt sentimentality is quite prominent in these types of films, but the appeal of this one really stems from its candidness- when we're considering some of the more honest and fascinating conversations about religion, loyalty to one's work, etc. - and consequently, there's no hint of (manipulative) mawkishness to be found. Some god-fearing people are criticizing the film for its relentlessly negative depiction of some religious conventions in Catholicism (could be applicable to many religions for that matter), but I'd simply like to counter the argument by requesting a defensive position that could prove the film's utterly false in its claims. Exactly so, it's another example that proves Philomena doesn't shamelessly attempt to cater to the majority; there will be some pretty good points and jokes throughout its duration, regarding the validity of religion and whatnot, opposed by some fair points on the other side of the spectrum. With all that being said, Philomena shouldn't be missed since it's apparently flawless (I haven't discovered anything detrimental to the film yet), and Steve Coogan and Judi Dench will surely win you over by the time the credits roll.",

If baby or mother died then this would be gods will, both then buried unceremoniously within the institutions grounds.As if this was not sufficient suffering, the offspring were on occasion sold to rich Americans, without the mothers consent or knowledge. The institutions were known as Magdalene Laundries (or asylums) and existing in Ireland unbelievably until 1996, catering for the loosely defined \"fallen women\".The institutions originally formed to help Prostitutes find alternative work, over the years became an easy referral for any girl deemed to have acted inappropriately, including rape. At which point effectively she would disappear, on occasion for decades. Destined to be treated almost as a prisoner, invariably subjected to both physical, mental and sexual abuse, all the while under the auspices of the Catholic Church. This regretfully is fact and well documented, indeed recently formally apologised for by the Irish government in 2013.Back to the story, Philomena is searching for her lost son detailed in \"aged movie stock\" recollections within the film. Sixsmith becomes involved and following information received, widens their search to America. As the Nun's attest, if only those helpful documents providing further information had not been destroyed in \"the fire\".Sixsmith and Philomena are complete opposites and the delight is witnessing their road trip and differing attitudes to people and situations. Both in a way suited to the modern world, yet so different. One assuming a basic good in people and the other, not so much.Whether they find her son is largely not the focus of the story and despite the above commentary the story is not designed as a searing indictment of the system. Watch Peter Mullan's \"The Magdalene Sisters\" for that. This however plays as a drama with many touching and comedic moments to enjoy.Dench of course is as good as ever, likely to garner an Oscar nomination at least. Coogan continues to surprise with a nuanced performance which unequivocally shows he really can act. This is most definitely not Alan Partridge in a suit.Stephen Frears direction is direct and sympathetic, neither skirting over facts nor bluntly hammering them home. The direction benefits from a skillful screenplay from Coogan, adding yet another talent to his growing resume.There is much to enjoy here and the film is more uplifting than downbeat. The story looks for and discovers rays of sunshine in this dark tale and whatever the outcome, leaves audiences with not only something to think about but a sense that maybe real goodness can conquer all. Beliefs and how decisions reverberate through the decades, forgiveness and hate, all wrapped within a palatable story that most can relate to.Of course, if you are of Irish descent and have a Catholic upbringing then your view may differ and the hill may just be too hard to climb up or down. As Philomena says \"I have tied myself up in knots deciding which is the bigger sin, having a baby or lying about the fact\".Summary Like Philomena, this is a film that manages to find the goodness in dark places and will leave you outraged yet smiling and uplifted within the short running time.A highly recommended drama, intertwined with a mismatched road buddy movie that generates comedy from believable interactions, ultimately going some way to restoring our faith in the human condition.",

            "content": "'PHILOMENA': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Funnyman Steve Coogan tries his hand at drama with this tale of a journalist doing a story on a mother searching for her son, after being forced to give him up for adoption (at a convent in Ireland 50 years earlier). Coogan co-wrote the script (with Jeff Pope) and stars in the movie with Judi Dench. Stephen Frears (who's previously directed such critically acclaimed hits as 'HIGH FIDELITY', 'THE GRIFTERS', 'THE QUEEN' and 'DANGEROUS LIAISONS') directed the film. It has received almost universal critical acclaim and is sure to be up for at least a few major awards (and already has been nominated for some). I found it to be interesting and well acted. It's definitely dark and depressing but so is life at times. It's a good movie but probably not one you should watch if you're looking for a good fun time.The film is based on the book 'The Lost Child of Philomena' by Martin Sixsmith. In the movie Coogan plays Sixsmith at a time in his life when he had just been fired from his job, as a government adviser for the Labour Party. He was wanting to take up running, or write a book on Russian history, when he heard of a woman, Philomena (Dench), who had been searching for her son for 50 years (after giving him up for adoption at a convent in Ireland). Despite not liking 'human interest' pieces Martin decides to do a story on the woman because he needs work (and an editor he knows likes the idea of it and pays for it's financing). So he sets out with Philomena to find out what happened to her son. What they uncover is shocking and extremely depressing. The film doesn't appear to have very nice things to say about the Catholic church, or nuns who work in Catholic convents, but as with any movie the characters in it don't represent all those like them. I'm sure events like those in the film have happened (frequently) and people of religion (especially those that are really devout) can be very abusive but there are definitely good nuns and other people of religion as well. Like I said the movie is extremely sad and disturbing but it's also funny and uplifting too. Coogan and Dench are great in the film (and have perfect chemistry together) and Coogan's script is smart and well written. Frears is also always impressive as a filmmaker. The movie is maybe not quite as good as some of the praise it's been getting but it is a good film.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDElhat3XPM",

            "content": "The problem I have with a lot of trailers these days is that the movie tends to get given away in those measly three minutes. Not as much fun taking a trip to the cinema when you already know how it's going to end. Granted, most films these days are predictable anyway, but some level of mystery is always nice. Annoyingly, there's very little mystery in the trailer of Philomena; the entire movie is summed up with three simple words: human interest story.Let's be fair, though. When you've got Stephen Frears, Judi Dench and Coogan working on the same film together, it would be ridiculous to expect anything else. Philomena is an out-and-out human interest story, seeped in sentimentality and designed purely to tug at the heartstrings and send the audience home with a smile on their face and a tear in their eye. And, for the most part, it's relatively successful.It's difficult not to be moved by the story of Philomena Lee (Dench), the middle-aged woman searching for the son taken away from her because she was pregnant out of wedlock. It's an emotional story, requiring the sort of emotional performance that someone like Judi Dench is brilliant at giving. She doesn't disappoint, either, obviously. Able to move between melancholy and humour seamlessly, Dench is a joy to watch. Her comic timing has always been impeccable, and she gets ample opportunity to showcase that here.But there's a slight problem \u2013 everyone else in the film is just a little bit too boring. Coogan's the main disappointment. I really like him, and think that he's still under-appreciated as a serious actor. Philomena, though, isn't his greatest showcase. It's not that he's bad in it, because he's not; he's actually quite good. It's the character of journalist Martin Sixsmith which lets him down \u2013 Coogan does the best he can, but it's so utterly one-dimensional. The character doesn't really change much over the course of the film, beyond evolving from 'caring a little bit' to 'caring quite a bit'. Hardly the stuff of scripting genius.The writing as a whole is pretty average and, funnily enough, Coogan was responsible for that too. It has its moments (the jokes are good, as you'd expect from a Coogan script), but it relies on overdone clich\u00e9 and sentiment instead of trying something new. Again, it's not awful. It's just...okay. I didn't find myself emotionally engaged enough, though it does pick up in the final third. The climax of the movie is genuinely moving, and the sweet little twist at the end was just good enough to leave me satisfied.Philomena is, by and large, a good film. A great story, a fantastic central performance, and an ending which does bring that smile and that tear. I only wish that the rest of the film was more emotionally engaging, and the rest of the cast better-developed. Jim Loach's Oranges And Sunshine explores very similar themes, and is a far better watch, in my opinion. But, hey, it doesn't have Alan Partridge and M in that.",

            "content": "Philomena (2013) is a touching film about loss, search, and fulfillment. Judi Dench and Steve Coogan both give great performances, and it is one of the best films of the year. Based on a true story (always a dangerous thing), Philomena tells the story of a mother searching for a son she gave up for adoption when she was a teenager. Her journey starts in Ireland, goes through America, and then returns to her exact starting place. And though we end up where we began it is all about the journey, and the lessons along the way. The script is tight and the direction excellent. There are two main issues I have with the film overall. The first of these seems to be a common theme in the 2013 crop of Best Picture Nominees. There is simply too much black and white in the story. The nuns and the Catholic Church come off as supremely evil through most of the story. At the end, I just wanted to hear Sister Hildegarde give a compassionate answer instead of spouting religious zealotry. It would have instantly made the film more real, complex, ambiguous, and thought provoking.My second issue is that there were some pacing issues in the story, IMHO. Some important story points were incredibly rushed (finding Philomena's son took a 30 second Google search and a few phone calls). While I strongly believe in efficient storytelling, Philomena could have afforded to takes its time a bit more. Overall, though, highly recommended viewing. It probably won't win Best Picture, but in a weak 2013 crop of nominees, it should be talked about more.",

            "content": "The film is set in early 2000s Ireland and is \"inspired by\" the story of Philomena Lee and her search for her son, Anthony, to whom she gave birth at age 18.In the movie, Martin Sexsmith (Steve Coogan) is a former journalist and government advisor who is fired from his position after a somewhat murky scandal in the government department for which he worked. He inadvertently meets the daughter of Philomena Lee (Judi Dench) at a party and agrees to write her story. Philomena became pregnant as a na\u00efve teenager and was dispatched to the Sean Ross Abbey, a convent in Roscrea, where she gives birth to Anthony.She then had to pay off her \"debt\" by working there for four years. She got to see Anthony one hour a day, but suddenly he was taken away for adoption. She was unable to say goodbye and was not told where he had gone. She tried to learn later about her son, but the nuns pled lack of information.Martin helps Philomena in her search. Their relationship is quite unusual as she is a highly devout Catholic, a faith that Sexsmith has long abandoned. Philomena likes romance novels. Martin is a jaded, cynical academic. Their conversations often appear to go past each other.They learn by happenstance that babies from the convent are typically sold for $1,000 to Americans for adoption. The convent claims all records were lost in the \"big fire,\" which turned out to be their own burning of records. Martin and Philomena go to the U. S., where they eventually learn that Anthony was adopted by a Hess family and raised as Michael A. Hess. He was very successful and worked as a lawyer for the George H. W. Bush and Ronald Reagan administrations. However, he was also gay at a time when this was not acceptable in the Republican party. He died of AIDS at age 38. They also learn that Anthony/Michael had tried to find his mother and traveled to the Sean Ross Abbey, but the nuns had claimed not to be able to locate Philomena. Anthony/Michael was buried on the grounds of the Abbey.This film is very moving. Judi Dench is excellent as Philomena, playing her as simple and na\u00efve on one level but worldly-wise on another, e.g., she has no difficulty with the fact that her son was gay. It's really her movie. Steve Coogan is a good counter-weight to her.It's a good story, but significant portions of it aren't true. Philomena never went to the U. S. searching for her son; all the work there was done by Sexsmith. She was a nurse for many years and was not nearly as much of a simpleton as portrayed in the movie. She learned, eventually, directly from the nuns that her son had died. Martin Sexsmith was a much-published author on Russian history before he ever undertook the Philomena project. Sister Hildegard, the film's main villain, had died years before the time the movie was set.",

            "content": "PHILOMENA Young Philomena Lee goes to the carnival one night, meets a young man, commits an indiscretion with said young man that will produce issue some nine months later. A devout Catholic, Philomena turns to her church for help and a local convent accepts her. However the nuns do not regard Philomena's pregnancy as an indiscretion, they regard it as a sin, and Philomena must do pertinence in the form of slavery to the abbey and her child must be given up for an adoption brokered by the nuns. These horrific events are vividly portrayed in the movie's prologue. With a single cut the film moves forward 50 years, and the now the retired Philomena, still with a picture of her 3 year old son close at hand, resolves to find out what happened to him.By fortuitous happenstance she meets Martin a journalist,looking to give his career a jolt with a human interest story that has some sensational aspects. Martin is a smug, well \u2013educated, snob, who had been humiliatingly fired from a prestigious government position (unjustly it seems) and now has to find a job. Martin clearly condescends to the sweet, provincial,and na\u00efve Philomena looking at her as only another rung of his career ladder, but as the inevitable road trip ensues, Martin grows (as is necessary in any road trip movie)to respect and admire Philomena's determination, honesty, and spiritual purity. Although Martin is the character that needs to grow, Philomena also progresses from a woman who has been stripped of all dignity, not to mention her child, to a woman, thanks in no small part to Martin, who comes to believe that at least to some extent, she can control events. In short she becomes empowered. Judy Dench is a DBE that is Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire. Sounds impressive doesn't it? It is. They don't give that to just anybody, not without a long history of accomplishment and Dame Judy certainly has that. With honors and awards that are literally too numerous to mention you don't need this poor reviewer to tell you what a great actor she is. You just need to go see it, and her craftsmanship and artistry will speak for itself. Steve Coogan is a man of many talents which includes being the co-writer of this script, for which he has just received an Academy Award Nomination. He has some work to do standing toe to toe with Dench, as well as turning Martin from upper crust intellectual snot into becoming what is essentially Philomena's avenging angel. .The ultimate tribute to these two actors is that it is their performance that sells this movie because the story, the actual quest for the long lost son, which is certainly compelling subject matter, seems to me a bit forced. Plot points, reversal and denouement all occur exactly on cue. The script seems focused on accomplishing these academic points rather than letting the story unfold organically. It is a case of advancing the form at the expense of the substance. It is also unnecessarily political, not oppressively so, but it's there, you can't miss it. It all seemed a little film studentish to me. It's been said many times in many places, it's not the destination it's the journey, and because of Dench and Coogan this is a journey worth taking. Director Stephen Frears came out of a film movement known as the British New Wave of the late 1950's and early 60's. This new wave used a cinematic social realism to depict an oppressive and claustrophobic trap the British working class found itself in (according to the filmmakers) and suggested that the only escape was a complete rejection of middle class standards and morality. It was extremely class conscious and exceedingly grim. If you ever want a couple of hours of unbroken depression, check out a little number called \"This Sporting Life\". (Not directed by Frears) Frears punctuated or perhaps killed this movement with \"My Beautiful Launderette (1985)in which he maintained the social realism, but added a touch of humor,thus entertaining an audience while profoundly commenting on racism,and social attitudes toward homosexuality. I bring this up now because Frears still uses the element of social realism in Philomena, but instead of the dark pessimism of the early New Wave, he suggests that perhaps the upper middle class Martin and the decidedly working class Philomena can form common cause in exposing the world's ills, and maybe just maybe, do something about them. After all this time Frears appears to have become an optimist. This movie has received criticism as an Anti-Catholic screed, and I can see where that argument can be made.This movie is pretty hard on the Church, but the record shows that it is the Church's own actions that have brought on this public scrutiny and public rebuke. The body of the Church will endure and survive these current slings and arrows that it has brought onto itself, but the spirit of the Church with its core beliefs of forgiveness and redemption seem to be in good hands with characters like Philomena.",

It made my eyes water on numerous occasions because the sensitive subject matter is presented and handled so beautifully. There are many scenes that a tear is more than a thousand words. For example, the confession scene is almost speechless but it conveys so much that's unsaid. It shows that a mother's love laterally knows no boundaries, and is forever unconditional. Philomena's reaction to hearing about her son's life life was in some ways unexpected. but that also shows that a mother just knows. The same goes for when she sees a photo of her son four the first time, she just knows. There are so many of these \"a mother knows\" moments that enhances Philomena's bonding with her son and with the viewers. I'm deeply touched by the story, and I think the acting is brilliant too.

            "content": "\"The thing is, I didn't even know I had a clitoris, Martin.\" In 2002, humiliated BBC Correspondent Martin Sixsmith (Coogan) hears about the story of an elderly Irish woman named Philomena Lee (Dench). As a mature girl living in 1950s Ireland, she conceived a child named Anthony but he was cruelly taken away from her and placed into adoption by the nuns of her convent.Fifty years on, she has vowed to track down her son and seeks Martin's help in trying to find him. Seeing the chance of a potential headline-making story, Martin agrees to help and accompanies Philomena back to her former convent but they both learn that previous records of the adopted children were destroyed. However the pair later find out about Anthony's possible whereabouts and descend to America not knowing whether he is alive or not with Philomena desperate for a reconciliation.Delightfully adapted from Martin Sixsmith's acclaimed novel The Lost Child of Philomena Lee (2009), director Stephen Frears and writer Steve Coogan set the tone for this triumphant film with a strong mixture of comedy and tragedy throughout its 110 minute running time. Straight from the outset, the laughs are brought out in the opening scene where Coogan's Martin gives awkward answers about his health and career prospects to a concerned doctor. Humiliated by his own government, this is a man who has become so desperate to avoid the media limelight that he is prepared to write books on Russian history.In stark contrast, we have poor and weary Philomena looking sad and regretful as she reflects on her troubled past. The moments of trauma are captured effectively by the grainy use of camera-work to showcase 1950s Ireland as we witness the tough and traumatic experience that she had to go through in watching her child be taken from her. Ultimately It takes around fifteen minutes for our two leads to meet on screen (at a Harvester pub of all places!), but once that happens, both actors are able to hit it off from the word 'go'.What makes the film most successful is the fantastic central relationship between the two leads as Dench and Coogan's on-screen relationship brings about plenty of witty yet touching dialogue. While Philomena is more of a warm-hearted individual, Martin displays cynicism and a bit of arrogance that won't come as a surprise to those who show a dislike to journalists! But as the film progresses, we get to see a stronger bond developed between the duo particularly when they get to Washington DC.This segment of the film produces several moments of complete hysteria from some of the cracking lines of dialogue from Coogan's script but also instances of utter devastation as the whereabouts of Anthony are finally revealed in heartbreaking manner. Fortunately those raw scenes are eventually cut down by flashes of comedy that completely bamboozles the audiences but enables us to appreciate the dramedy factor of this film. Even when the 'reveal' takes place, the story doesn't finish there as Philomena and Martin continue their quest to uncover more information about what Anthony has achieved throughout his life with Super 8 footage used to capture the realistic feel.In what is set to be a competitive year for Oscar-worthy performances, Judi Dench truly shines in her touching role as Philomena as she brings endearing warmth to a character who suffers pain throughout but also displays moments of comedy gold through her well-tinkered Irish accent. Following on from his recent success with Alan Partridge: Alpha Papa, Coogan continues to use perfect comic-timing to his advantage but also decides to go down the more endearing road of making us root for Martin particularly in the post-America scenes. Other cast members are somewhat sidelined by the two excellent leads though Anna Maxwell Martin is able to display subtlety with her role as Philomena's concerned daughter. Plaudits should also go to renowned composer Alexandre Desplat as he creates a haunting and sombre score that showcases the tone of the film.What does bring Philomena down a touch is its controversial ridicule of religious authority particularly towards the Catholic Church. While it may lack the shocking depiction that Peter Mullan captured in his gritty film, The Magdalene Sisters (2002), a more crowd-pleasing offering like this one is likely to cause offense as the nun characters are presented as vastly cruel and unsympathetic in both past and present sequences.The media are also presented as a little too harsh as Michelle Fairley (Game of Thrones' Catelyn Stark) bears the brunt as an news-hungry editor who lacks a conscience when interrogating Martin to get more out of Philomena's story.Nuns won't appreciate it much but Stephen Frears' wonderful film evokes the perfect blend of hilarious charm and harsh devastation in Britain's latest cinematic triumph with Dench and Coogan a pure delight to watch together. If Oscar doesn't reward it, then hopefully BAFTA will!",

Judi Dench takes the lead and manages to be innocent and mature, sturdy and open-minded, caring and strong, na\u00efve and intuitive. She plays the title character, an older woman who wants to find out what happened to her baby son she gave up for adoption decades ago.Journalist Steve Coogan (who also co-wrote the film!) helps her navigate her journey. He's incredibly cynical and doesn't hold human nature in high regard, but as he gets to know his traveling companion, he realizes she might be the only person in the world who hasn't let life beat her down. If this is your first movie of his, he'll make such an impression, you'll come to call him \"the Philomena guy\" as my mom does. He radiates anger and pain, and you can't help but hope Judi Dench will just give him a hug and help him feel better.She doesn't, though. This isn't a feel-good movie. No one will feel better, and in fact, as the movie continues, you and the character will feel a lot worse. This is a very heavy movie that sheds a very unflattering light on the Catholic-run orphanage that created all the trouble. But if you can handle it, you'll be rewarded by one of Judi Dench's best performances. And you'll certainly want to give your kids an extra kiss goodnight.",

PHILOMENA proves that the problem with this War against Reason is that it is NOT self-contained in isolated spartan cloisters totally separate from the real world. Instead, it has been allowed to buy the backing of most U.N. member nations through the Machiavellian manipulation of immense wealth gained via millenniums of extortion from the superstitious majority.

            "content": "Director Stephen Frears' new film, Philomena, is based on a true story. The film follows Judi Dench as Philomena Lee, an old Irish Catholic woman who had to give up her son for adoption 50 years ago. Philomena and her daughter enlist the aid of a disgraced reporter, portrayed by Steve Coogan, to help her track her lost son down. The remarkable thing about Frears' direction is that he never lays it on too thick with syrupy sentiment, which does serve the story well and keeps it from being a Lifetime Channel Original Movie, however the film's script is heavy handed in other areas. The emotional beats work and feel authentic, but it's the script's negative view of the Catholic church, and religion in general, that is so one-sided. While we often get Philomena sticking up for her religion when bashed by Coogan's character, the film has clearly chosen the side it's on, which is not fair to the other half of the population that will see this film, who are religious. All in all, this is a film with remarkable performances from Coogan, and especially Dame Judi Dench in a role that is sure to get her Oscar recognition. Dench makes you feel Philomena's pain, while still having a sunny outlook on life that is infectious and leads to some surprisingly cheeky humor at times that will have you nearly falling out of your seat laughing. If the film just wasn't so one-sided on particular issues, perhaps it might have rated higher with me, but alas no.I give Philomena a 7 out of 10!",

            "content": "I saw another reviewer mention that this film is 2013's \"The King's Speech\", and I think that's spot on. I cannot for the love of god understand why either of these films have received the amount of critical acclaim they have. They are both so contrived that it's amazing to me so many people just eat up this kind of fluff. The substance of this film essentially boils down to: Wacky old lady has her son taken away from her as a child. Now laugh and cry at the appropriate moments!The best things I can say are that it has some genuinely funny moments, although the humor is pretty hit-or-miss. And it should be commended for taking one or two interesting turns where it could have relied on clich\u00e9s (I didn't expect to learn the fate of Philomena's (Judi Dench) late son about midway through the film). However, the film as a whole is pretty formulaic and seems unsure of any larger point it would like to make. For example, the nuns are so clearly constructed as one-dimensional villains with something to hide, but then we're supposed to forgive them, even though they're unrepentant? Philomena and Martin (Steve Coogan) discuss God and religion quite a bit. Philomena starts off full of faith, then at one point rushes out of confession in an act seemingly of disavowal, and then later castigates Martin for his atheistic views and his (justified) anger at the nuns. These conflicting messages really don't help a film already on pretty shaky ground plot-wise. The search itself seems to have consisted of a 5-minute Google search and a few emails, which does no favors for a film that strives so obviously to be a hard-hitting, emotionally deep chronicle \"inspired by true events.\" Several elements of the plot feel half-baked, tacked on, and barely thought out at all. For instance, the odd framing device of the Martin's firing (what was that about?) and his new \"human interest piece\" contribute nothing to the film. That goes double for the strange flashbacks of Philomena's son Anthony that are interspersed arbitrarily throughout the film. They are made to look like home videos, which creates an awkward effect. Even weirder, we later find out that these are seemingly shots taken from a 1-minute home-video montage of Anthony's entire life. Through watching this video, we learn **SURPRISE!** he's been back to Ireland searching for his mother after all! (Never mind that his sister and former colleague have directly contradicted that idea a few scenes before.) It just doesn't work on any level except to be transparently tear-jerking and crowd-pleasing. And that's a fair summary of the film as a whole. Dench is sometimes funny (although her character is a walking clich\u00e9 as a wacky old lady with a heart of gold), and she cries well, but there is no context within her performance. Instead, she comes off as a manufactured prop that is meant to be lovable, hilarious, and empathetic, and that's it. Considering she's based on a real person, there's a stunning lack of specificity or even just creative detail. It's a crowd-pleasing but negligible performance.Coogan fares much better. Martin's religious cynicism is earnest and refreshing, but not demeaning, in a movie suffocated by religious imagery and overtones. He also carefully blends his fondness for Philomena that develops with his frequent annoyance and frustration with a sheltered, irrational older woman with whom he doesn't have a lot in common. It's complex and empathetic work in a role that could have been one-dimensional.The always-fantastic Mare Winningham is a standout in the supporting cast. With only one short scene, her performance adds much-needed mystery and complexity to the proceedings. She conveys deep emotional scars from her upbringing that raise interesting questions about Anthony's life, as well as her own. If the entire movie was transfused with the subtlety and depth in Winningham's performance, I imagine I would have liked it a lot more. When she left the screen I couldn't help but want to know more about her.All in all, it's a pretty jumbled film that seems to exist solely to give Judi Dench a late-career Oscar. Nothing special at all, and the critical reception it's received is quite baffling. If Dench does indeed win Best Actress next year, I'm sure it will go down as one of the lesser wins in the category's history.",

The injustice of lost years, guilt, sin, and manipulation angers viewers as they follow Philomena and Martin along the journey.Judi Dench proves again she is worthy of the Academy Award for best actress. She is truly deserving of a win though I do not believe she will be victorious over the more blaring and conspicuous performances from the other actresses nominated this year. She is sweet as the titled Philomena with a constant undercurrent of sadness with a nuanced portrayal of a slight nature arguably caused by the emotional turmoil of experiencing her son being purloined as a teen.I am equally glad they recognized and nominated Alexandre Desplat for his original score for the film. It is understated and complementary; adding to the tone of the scenes instead of doing what most music does in films \u2013 forcing emotion that isn't created organically.Philomena is reminiscent of movies from 50 years ago where story and acting were most highly regarded parts of a film.

She became victim to the lifelong pain and unresolved guilt caused by getting pregnant in Ireland when she was young, and being dumped on the local convent nuns by her father during the 50's. Lacking the courage and resources to escape and avoid the adoption of her young son to wealthy Americans, she matures and develops curiosity about how her son fared, and whether he ever thought of her. That seems to be the driving force in her quest to engage the journalist in helping her find him in America. For me, the movie contrasts the conflict of strong beliefs: the institutional Catholic belief about sin and atonement in the 50's; Philomena's regret that she was not strong enough to hold on to her son at any cost; and the cynical journalist's blame game and anger that life isn't fair (i.e., an Oxford graduate shouldn't be unemployed and depressed.) I liked that the movie let that conflict just hang out there, but believe it would have been a better movie if there had been more time spent exploring the underbellies of conflicting beliefs, and less time spent on running old flashback footage of her son.",

            "content": "An adult, brilliant and compassionate film with a first rate script without a romance in sight. What treasures films for grown-ups are and this is one of the very best.Dame Judi Dench, Steve Coogan (who also wrote and produced), Mare Winningham, & Michelle Fairley feature and the whole is directed by Stephen Frears, whose previous successes were \"The Queen\" & \"High Fidelity\" & \"The Grifters\" & \"Dangerous Liaisons\" amongst others.The true story is of an old woman called Philomena, who is searching for her long lost son for most of her life. As a teenager she got pregnant and gave birth to a baby boy out of wedlock. Her father abandoned her to the nuns in her \"disgrace\" and they in turn sold her baby to an American couple. A very frequent practise in those days. Her daughter puts her in touch with a down on his luck journalist by the name of Martin Sixsmith, to see if he could help her in locating her son.And therein begins their adventure together. He's an intellectual atheist of some renown, she is still a fervent Irish catholic and a reader of simplistic romances. The film plays the two of them off beautifully. They have much to learn from each other and the story plays with this and is packed with surprises at each turn.There is nothing mawkish or overly sentimental about the script or the direction. No 2 X 4s and certainly no Hollywoodizing of the drama. Frears has a sensitive hand and pulls back when maudlin sentimentality would be the easier, softer way.While there is the odd slippage of Judi's accent, I was able to overlook it because of her brilliance in depicting Philomena who is not as na\u00efve as she appears and continually shocks her co-star with her practical approach to the twists in the story he is nervous to share with her.The wit and charm of this confluence of actors, script and direction makes for one of the best movies of 2013. Funny and sad in turn (bring the tissues) it lingers long after I left the theatre. And do wait for the credits to roll as the real-life people on whom the movie is based are featured.Do not miss.

            "content": "At the heart of Stephen Frears' \"Philomena\", despite all the reference to a human interest story, it was really about forgiveness, redemption, and more importantly, a closure that perhaps each one of us are hoping to find at the end, rather than searching for revenge. Inspired by a true event, Philomena started as a road trip story between with the odd couple between an elderly Irish lady, Philomena Lee and a cynical ex-govt. spin doctor, Martin Sixsmith. The journey they took together in search for the missing son of Philomena, however, has a lasting impact on both of them.The story began with Sixsmith's (Steve Coogan) sacking from his job as a govt. spin doctor and ever wonder about what would be his next move (apart from writing \"boring\" Russian history book), it was also the time when he came across with Philomena's daughter Jane (Anna Maxwell Martin) who just discovered that her mother had a secret for 50 yrs. In spite of his own prejudice over \"human interest story\" in which he branded for weak minded people, he nonetheless accept this work as a journalist from his editor. After meeting with Philomena, Sixsmith began his journey with her, first to visit the convent in which Philomena spent 4 years during her teenage years for having a premartial pregnancy. Her son, Anthony Lee, was taken away from her at a very young age. While Sixsmith was very much willing to help Philomena to find his son whereabout, his ignorance of this seemingly naive old lady(who is a lifetime reader's digest and romantic novel follower, as Sixsmith describe to his wife on the phone) soon changed as he has began just how she was, in fact, an open-minded, intelligent and in many occasions, a very brave and compassionate woman. Judi Dench has given yet another compelling performance as Philomena in which she brought out the character's nativity to her underlying strong character amazingly at ease, as witnessed in the breakfast scene between chatting with the chef in one minute while receiving the bad news of her son the next. She also gave her character the internal struggle between obeying the catholic faith, if not blindly during her young days, and somewhat a very liberal mind as evidence by her acceptance of her son's sexuality to her own desire towards love and sex itself. However, it was the great display of compassion that Philomena did toward herself against her own demon of guilt and against the convent and sisters themselves; has been so brilliantly carried out by Dame Dench. Coogan's role as Sixsmith has been exceptionally with as a cynical intellectual, with the unusual reserved on the satire comedy and replace it with more serious, if not a more subtle performance.Coogan's effort of on this balanced script (with Jeff Pope, based on the book by Sixsmith himself) was certainly not to be overlooked as the story could easily turn into a clich\u00e9d melodrama or biased attack to the catholic church (although I believe Frears has made his point on the church's responsibility in selling children very clear). Instead, it was almost as if a soul searching journey for both protagonists with countless funny moments (through the well structured and often witty dialogues) as well as moments of heartbreak and reconciliation at the story finale. Indeed, towards the final 10-15min. of the film, audience had joined the characters for a \"full circle\" journey in with the same fulfilling and courage of facing the truth, which is indeed a very satisfying experience.",

Leave it to Judi Dench to do justice to this role of the tormented mother ( Philomena) suffering the pangs of being away from her infant son for 50 years. Hers is an award winning performance. She displays great control of her emotions and is willing to go to any lengths to meet her son. This movie was on my watch list for quite some time. Released in 2013, and nominated for many awards including Oscar best picture, it is a moving and thought provoking true story of an Irish mother's search for her toddler son taken away from her. Philomena in her 70s seeks the help of a journalist Martin to meet her son after 50 years with hardly any clues to start with. As she travels to USA to find her son, she tells her journalist friend Martin ( Steve Coogan) not to publish the story since it's too private. Director Stephen Frears takes the audience on a moving journey and keeps the narrative interesting with a twist now and then. I think it is a case of story telling at its best. The ending is surely a cathartic moment and most unexpected too. Some viewers may find references to the Catholic churches a little unorthodox , specially the church's attitude towards unwed mothers but the drama created is riveting, specially when Philomena is shown as God fearing while her journalist companion Martin is an agonist and atheist who feels the church has done wrong in keeping the mother- son away from each other. The movie is reminiscent of the movie \"Lion\" on a similar subject.

She is basically good in everything so it should come as no surprise, but this is a different role for her. And I thought she played well off of Steve Coogan. The two share very different viewpoints on life, which to me helped this movie from becoming too much of an anti-Catholicism movie.I have to say the trailers are a tad deceiving, because I was led on to believe this was more of an uplifting story rather than a lighter version of 'Changeling'. There are many similarities to Angelina Jolie's character in that and Judi Dench's Philomena, but the one big difference is that Philomena is a forgiving person. She knows that she was basically cheated out of being able to raise her own son. I would have liked to hear more about her current family and how she was able to overcome the initial fear of having other kids.The writing is perfect and really makes you think about it after its over, which is exactly what a film should do.

What starts off as a simple human interest piece becomes so much more. This movie will make you angry. I start off with that because no review I have seen starts with that statement. The unnecessary hardship that this sweet woman goes through because of how others feel about her situation will make you feel things that you don't think you ever could. The most amazing thing about her though is even though she is constantly facing disappointment and heartache she doesn't let it affect her. Martin is the voice of most people in the way that he becomes frustrated and angry to the point of almost saying and doing things he can't take back but you understand why. Philomena represents the kind of person we all want to be. The movie itself was good, a little slow moving but by the end you will be glad you stuck with it and watched it. That is if you still have a screen to watch it on, depending on what you find to throw. Overall, a good movie that will make you angry. Really shows why pushing your fundamentalist principals on others is never a good thing and only ends up contradicting what religion is supposed to be about. I give this a B+.",

Eventually, they trace him to America where he worked for President Reagan and Bush, while harbouring a shameful secret that subsequently cost him his life.Based on the book by Martin Sixsmith, Philomena is a reluctant odd-couple road movie that finds humour in its tragic circumstances, and humanity in its leads contrasting religious views.

On their journey, Martin (Coogan) begins to open up his eyes, becoming friends with her in the process. Despite all the buzz surrounding it, I had no expectations for this movie. I went in with an open mind. After I was done with it, I could see why this movie was so well-liked. I wouldn't call it Oscar worthy, but it's certainly a really good film that moved me. It's genuine with some well-timed humor in times that called for it. One thing this movie made me realize is why I frown upon religion these days. These nuns are so pretentious, making the convent seem like a prison. Despite his bitter attitude, I was easily able to sympathize with Coogan's attitude towards religion. The story is very solid, but it's the two leads that really make this movie. They make the journey memorable. Judi Dench is absolutely wonderful as Philomena. I never knew that woman who talks so much could be so likable. Her views on things angered me at times, but I understood it in a way. Her chemistry with Coogan is great as well. Steve Coogan is just as good. His sarcastic personality had me in stitches a lot of the time. People may be mixed on his character, I thought it was excellent. His rant on Sister Hildegarde is memorable. Credit to Barbara Jefford for playing one of the most unlikable nuns I have ever seen. This is a nice little movie. It's easy to see why it is so beloved. It's a really enjoyable film that knows how to please! See it.8/10",

How can someone have no backbone??? How can you not want to avenge what has been done to you? While i can agree on the subject of being a bystander in your life and let events take its course this story is in no way about that. That young boys' life and that of the lead lady was clearly influenced by the people at the monastery, what they did was in no way Christian and it should have consequences.

Dench is once again on top of the game, giving a subtle but powerful performance. Philomena's story begins with flashbacks of how mother and child are separated when the boy is adopted by an American couple in the most unbelievable of circumstances. As a good Catholic, Philomena believes it's impossible to question the institution's choices, and she moves on with her life. Eventually, she marries, has more children, but she is never able to forget her little boy.Eventually she contacts a journalist who is going through a rough period in his professional career, and before you can say, life is certainly more complex than fiction, they are on a journey to locate Anthony. The search proves successful and heartbreaking, and this is just when the plot becomes almost unbelievable; yet it's all based on a true story.Philomena travels to Washington and tries to track those people who might tell her about her son's life between the time she lost him and the present. She discovers amazing facts about him, and it's her reactions that are at the core of the film. Here is a decent woman who understands how life works, tries to reconcile her beliefs with other people's, learns to compromise and see that the best way out of dilemma is not to hold grudges because it will drain you from the ability to see what life can give you.The film shows a mother's interaction with photographs, films, and the testimony of people who knew the trajectory of her son's life. What is devastating is the revelation that threatens to shatter many people's faith in what someone take for granted. Here is where the movie shows the complexity of the situation. Is this one woman's crusade, maybe the result of misplaced assumptions, or just a selfish retaliation for not being able to achieve what others can? \"Philomena\" is entertaining, sweet, lovely, poignant, and well written. The most pleasant surprise is Coogan's reporter. He begins as pragmatic and cynical and discovers what is missing in his life while experience life through someone else's experiences. He finally gets to see how regular people live and their perspectives about the same issues. His life changes, and so do the lives of others he meets.",

            "content": "Steve Coogan, for all his comedic popularity in his native UK, has always struggled when it came to the movies. The recent Alan Partridge movie aside, his credits consist mainly of sub-par comedies such as The Parole Officer (2001), or indie oddities for Michael Winterbottom like the excellent 24 Hour Party People (2002) and the disappointing A Cock and Bull Story (2005), none of which really show the full talent of the man. His performance opposite Judi Dench in Philomena will no doubt bring him the success he really deserves. He also co-writes an Oscar- nominated screenplay with Jeff Pope, which helps elevate Philomena from being your usual hankie-demanding movie-of-the-week, to a well-rounded, deeply sad film about two people who are brought impeccably to life by the actors.Martin Sixsmith (Coogan), recently sacked as a Labour government adviser, is looking for a new direction in his life. A book about Russian history seems the logical way to go, but after a chance encounter with Jane (Anna Maxwell Martin), who tells Martin an intriguing story about her mother Philomena (Dench) and her quest to find her long lost son, he sees not a story of redemption, but a way to simply keep himself busy with a simple 'human interest' story. He travels with Philomena to Sean Ross Abbey in Ireland, where she was left abandoned by her parents and soon found herself pregnant. She was permitted to see her son for only an hour a week, until he was taken away by adoptive parents to America.On the surface, this is a mismatched-buddy comedy with an emotional thread running through its centre, but Philomena is much more than your average tale of redemption. Normally with these kinds of films, the lead characters are at each other's throats for the entire movie, only to learn from one another and see things in a new light. There is no such emotional manipulation here. Martin is posh, cynical and sarcastic. Philomena is naive, warm, and enjoys Mills & Boon novels. They end the film the way they start, and it's their conflicting attitudes to the events that unfold that form the film's main strength. On one hand, the film seems angry and unforgiving, and on the other, it shows us the power of forgiveness.Not to say the film isn't funny, it just goes about it in a much subtler way. Martin's first-time experiences amongst the working-class provides most of the funnier lines (\"I've never been to a Harvester before,\"), and the dialogue between these polar opposites as they find themselves in close-quarters in the hotel, feels unforced. If you don't know this alarming true-life tale, then it's best to stay in the dark until you either see the film or read Martin Sixsmith's book, as what is uncovered is truly shocking. It doesn't have a rousing score or any long-speeches - director Stephen Frears keeps things simple - but the film is all the more effective for it.

            "content": "That's a film from our time and our continent, from Ireland for sure but it could be from many other places in this world. The Celtic harp is the key to the story.Like all testimonies of some past horror, after seeing it, after being told about it, no one can really say anything coherent about the drama they have just witnessed.Did that girl who had been entrusted to a nunnery for her education and had fallen into some carnal attraction deserve the severe punishment of dying in labor because the nuns did not provide her with any medical help, or deserve the punishment of seeing her own child be adopted away for a big sum of money from some rich Americans, or deserve the revenge of these nuns who refuse fifty years later to give her any indication about her son, and even lie to this mother in her old age and her lifelong repentance?If it were only one girl, we would say there was something wrong with her, but when there were always a dozen of girls in the same situation practically permanently in that nunnery, you can wonder what was wrong with this institution that could not educate these girls into some prudence and care about what they did. There sure was something wrong since they did not inform the girls of the danger of having sex on the wild side of the moon, and they did not provide the girls with any protection, of course not we are Catholic and we are in 1952, in other words in the Middle Ages, and we have to keep in mind the Catholic church, in spite of its recently promoted Pope, still advocates some hostility against any protection at all, and of course against abortion, which should never have to be performed if all precautions had been taken before, provided the teenagers were informed about these dangers and these protections.Was that cultivated ignorance a way to keep a dozen of adoptable children in constant availability for the parents who were ready to provide the nunnery with a wealthy income? Was that nunnery a nursery of orphans to be sold to the highest bidders?We have to keep in mind that contraception was liberated only twenty or thirty years after World War II in many western countries, and is still not common in many countries today, even when the law has made it legal. A shortage is so easily organized in this market economy. So is it the fault of Ireland who was thinking of many other problems including a civil war and did not even thought of women's rights? Is it the fault of the nuns who were totally engulfed in an ideology that made sex a sin and carnal desire a crime? Is it the fault of the Catholic church that was and still is in many ways tied up in some medieval beliefs? And is this Catholic church the only culprit in this world on that crime against humanity that uses sex to crush people down and keep them in some kind of mental slavery? Are other religions and fundamentalist ethics better on that subject?We are confronted to a drama that happened in one situation but similar dramas happened in many other situations, orphanages or simple homelessness and neglect, and are still happening, including the abduction of millions of children every year, sold by their parents on not, ending up in global prostitution, which seems to be so profitable in the countries where it is economically accounted for and financially registered. Who is responsible if not the human mind that seems to just start being able today in wider and wider zones in the world to understand that individual freedom is the condition to individual success and that common success cannot be reached in any society when individuals are not free enough to excel.That's what this film made me sad about: history is going so slow at times. And yet I am not that sad after all because history seems to be going slightly faster in the present period than it used to go before 1945. And yet has the world changed really? And will it really ever reach a proper general and global level of acceptability?Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",

Steve is absolutely brilliant and has done a magnificent job in the screenplay and production.

As a parent I cannot begin to feel the pain some have suffered through this disgraceful practice.

            "content": "Judi Dench plays the title character in this wonderful film which is based on the true story of a woman that goes in search of the son who was taken away from her nearly 50 years ago. Philomena ends up pregnant in her teens and once her child is born she is forced to work in a convent for four years as punishment for her actions. Steve Coogan plays Martin Sixsmith who ends up being sacked as a Labour Party journalist. Initially, he plans to spend his time writing a novel on Russian History, but later takes an interest in Philomena's search for her lost son. Sixsmith takes on the assignment as a human interest story and accompanies Philomena to both Ireland and America in order to help her track down her long lost son.Philomena is probably one of the most moving films that I've ever seen. This is mainly down to the script which gives a lot of back story on Philomena (her brief relationship which resulted in her pregnancy, her time in the convent), these things really helped to make an emotional connection and made me really care for her character. The tight script is also helped by Judi Dench's wonderful performance, she managed to be about 10 maybe 20% bonkers, but then maybe 80-90% charming and sweet. I honestly don't know how anyone wouldn't find her character sweet and lovely. Her chemistry with Coogan was excellent and bizarrely they almost had a sort of 'married couple' syndrome. They would laugh together, argue together, I also noticed at times that they seemed to be on a completely different wave length to one another which meant that were occasionally some very funny exchanges between the two of them. I was unsure about Coogan as I hadn't seen him in a dramatic role before so I wasn't sure how he'd fare, but I was pleasantly surprised by how good he was. In all honesty, Judi Dench definitely put in the stronger performance, but Coogan did manage to hold his own - both Coogan and Dench worked really well together.There are some other revelations along the way, but I don't want to reveal anything further and just feel that you should watch the film yourself. For the most part, it is moving and emotional, but it is also quite hard hitting (particularly in one scene towards the end). Another really big strength in this film is character development; every single person who is fundamental to the story is developed so well and this is what is critical in allowing your audience to invest in the story - it's something that is overlooked far too often in films, but not in this little gem of a film.If you haven't seen Philomena then I strongly suggest that you sit down and watch it as it really is a beautiful piece of cinema.",

Being someone that goes to and believes fully in Jesus and Christianity, it upsets me greatly to see the brokenness and how dark it can get. Movies like this and Spotlight are so important to shine light on the darkness and to challenge and change the parts of church, especially the Catholic Church (which I think statistically are often more to blame - e.g. catholic priests, although the American Evangelical Church has a lot to answer for too).The movie contrasts the two responses so well between rage and forgiveness. Judi Dench plays a strong and compelling lead character, with her own quirks - her over sharing of book details and missing quite obvious jokes made a for a lighter touch to this sad reality. It was full of such raw emotion when her child had been stripped from her and the continuing revelation of her son life. I was engaged throughout the whole movie and was also really interested in Steve Coogan's character, who reminded me of many cynical and upset people that accuse church (often quite justified) of their wrong doing and are unable to then form a relationship with God, who I would argue is against those movements within the church too - what kind of God would support sexual abuse, and stealing children from their mothers. This movie therefore clearly points the blame at the old traditional religious movements.Great movie and worth a watch.",

            "content": "This is another movie about the Magdalena Laundries, an infamous Catholic institution that, shockingly, existed in Ireland until 1996. The idea was not just that poor unwed mothers gave up their children to these nuns (who then arranged adoptions), but also resided and worked there under strict and abusive conditions\u0085to atone for their sins and pay off their debts. These places are remnants of an earlier time when people had different notions about religion and sexuality, freedom and charity. These brutal institutions did not attract the best and most loving people to work there.Please don't read this review any further if you have not yet seen the movie...We follow Martin Sixsmith (Steve Coogan) as he assists Philomena Lee (Judi Dench), a former inmate, to discover what happened to her child. In her case, it seems the nuns not only \"sold\" the child to an American couple, but actively discouraged the attempts by both her and her son to find each other. An interesting and moving twist is that the boy grew up to become a prominent Republican who happened to be gay and died of AIDS before Philomena could meet him. She only gets to know her son from his longtime partner. Did her son remember Ireland? Think about her? The heart of this movie is the remarkable character of Philomena Lee, as she attempts to find out what happened to her son and to get closure. We see her contrasted against the sophisticated, worldly, doubting Sixsmith. This movie is about the dialogue between Lee and Sixsmith, their relationship being a reflection and personification of Europe's attempt to move away from its religious heritage. It's hugely important that Lee simply accepts that her son was gay and died of AIDS. It's not an issue for her at all. She's a nurse; she's seen it all. I found this very moving. This particular movie is set in Roman Catholic Ireland, but similar movies have been made in other countries and with other denominations. See \"King of Devil's Island\", for example. This is not about Ireland or Catholicism. I think movies like this are really about Europe's assertion of its modern secular values. Much of America is still too hopelessly religious and divided to have this debate about secularism in public, but I have to tell you that I saw this movie in Florida, and the theatre was filled with Americans (mostly older couples) who quite obviously were enjoying the film. Fortunately both Dench and Coogan played their roles with subtlety and restraint. No melodrama here, which is remarkable given the topic. Coogan is the surprise here. When someone like Coogan takes on a dramatic role like this, the comedic background can sometimes add so much to the character. That's what's happened in this film.Like Sixsmith, I couldn't forgive; but I'm not sure at all that Philomena's approach is not the better one. Religious life is filled with hateful people like Sister Hildegard, and those who protect and tolerate her. We are reminded, however, that it is not all Sister Hildegard; we also have the truly Christ-like faith of people like Philomena. She is not angry. Anger is perhaps not the way either. What happened to her was wrong, and these institutions were most certainly evil, but ironically who can say that things did not work out for the best for Philomena and her son?As we move into a secular future, maybe the lesson from the past is not always to do what is right, but what is best. And we shouldn't be so judgmental and righteous ourselves. Because then do we not ourselves become just like Sister Hildegard?",

            "content": "With this and Nebraska, I will have seen every Oscar nominee for Best performance in a lead or supporting role and, to me, the lead actress category is between Amy Adams and Judi Dench at the moment. For, with Philomena, Judi Dench really does assert herself amongst the other actresses, who may have a higher profile, in terms of recognition over this season, but one thing the others lacked was an emotional complexity. Which leads me to talking about the film.Characters & StoryPhilomena (Judi Dench) is a woman who has lived a long life. She is a retired nurse, didn't have much in the way of a family when a child, but now has a daughter, and perhaps other children, in her homeland of Ireland. One thing though has alluded her in this life however, and that is her oldest son Anthony (Sean Mahon). But one man, whose life has hit a rough patch, named Martin (Steve Coogan), decides to take on her story and with this, we venture with Philomena and Martin as they search for the child sold off by the nuns who housed a young Philomena (Sophie Kennedy Clark), and made her pay for the sin of sex before wedlock by taking perhaps the one thing she loved most at the time.PraiseIn the film, multiple times you will likely find yourself crying for the combination of Dench and Clark make it so Philomena becomes a fully developed entity. For, like with Saving Mr. Banks, flashbacks are used to help further develop the character, though flashbacks are used much more sparsely in Philomena. But, it must be noted that Clark does compliment Dench well enough so when every twist and turn pops up, and we think maybe she may find Anthony, or maybe things are a lost cause, you are mixed between seeing Dench's tears in the modern era, thinking of the boy she lost, and Clark's tears when Anthony was first ripped away.And the story itself, which is based on true events, is well modeled for screen. It allows such complexity for Martin you can never be sure if he is passionate about getting back to work, after a BBC scandal, or if he truly feels for Philomena who treats him with such kindness, despite his rather brash attitude and consistent criticism of religion. Which also was something with a rather interesting take. Irish Catholic nuns, last I heard, have often been depicted in the news for less than favorable things, but perhaps this takes the cake. But, I'm not noting the nuns' depiction for the sake of highlighting the nuns in the film and their cold hearts, but more so Philomena's faith during the whole endeavor. For, despite how she is called a sinner and the nuns paint all her sorrow as a means of punishment, she still maintains her faith in the church and doesn't bear hatred to the nuns, even after they circumvented her few chances to maybe have seen Anthony earlier in life.CriticismBut, amongst all this praise, honestly, isn't much in the way of criticism. I mean, as an American, there were times when I didn't understand a line or two because the accents threw me off. But, outside of that, which could be fixed with subtitles, there isn't anything wrong. The film has a good time length, with emotional highs, and lows which bring you to tears, and the occasional twist which can make you think either a happy ending is possible, or perhaps the most miserable ending in existence will be seen.Overall: Worth SeeingMaking for an overall film which is really worth a good cry. Dench reminds the world that life and human complexity don't end once a person enters their twilight years. People, especially when they are older, are still capable of long held secrets, indecision which can rock the nerves, and stories which aren't aimed at them playing supporting roles, often of a comic variety as of late. And really, of all the Oscar nominated actresses for Best Performance in a lead role, only Amy Adams really is competing, in my opinion, and her chance of winning will be more based on her film work than American Hustle performance. So, since Emma Thompson isn't in the running, if Judi Dench loses, I would only assume it is due to Hollywood politics.",

            "content": "What is so accomplished about this British film is that it manages to tell a heart-rending (and true) story with so much understated humour through two such contrasting but utterly believable characters. Philomena Lee is an Irish woman who was forced to give up her baby son, who was borne out of wedlock in her repressive homeland, but she never forgot him for a day and almost half a century later endeavoured to find Anthony against the wishes of the nuns who sold him to a childless couple. The quest was originally recorded in a book by the British journalist Martin Sixsmith.Here Philomena is played by Judi Dench, an actress who, like a fine mature wine, just gets better with age, managing to convey so much with just a tearful look. Sixsmith is portrayed by Steve Coogan who gives his best acting performance to date as someone who is so unlike Philomena - strikingly intelligent against her lack of education, profoundly agnostic in contrast to her continued piety, depressed and angry while she is optimistic and forgiving. It is such a joy to see challenging roles written for an older woman and someone who has been considered mainly a comedian.Coogan also co-wrote and co-produced this sensitive work which was directed by Stephen Frears whose more recent films have included \"The Queen\" and \"Tamara Drewe\". Do they find Philomena's son? As so often, the journey is as important as the destination which in fact brings her full circle.",

            "content": "This film is recommended.Philomena is a crowd-pleasing dramedy, nothing more. It's the kind of movie, depending on one's emotional make-up, where one will either: a) embrace the film and hug it to death; b) admire its sentimental story and strong characters; or c) punch it squarely between the eyes and send it flying. (I am in the middle category for the majority of this film, but could choose to be in the former category, mainly due to Judy Dench's poignant performance. More on that later in this review.) Solidly directed by Stephen Frears and written by Steve Coogan, who also stars in the film, Philomena has an important story to tell, but too many manipulative and maudlin moments almost sink this road movie in the process. Yet the film surprisingly works its magic due to a screenplay that personalizes an obscene scandal within the Roman Catholic Church that occurred in the sixties. (For those unaware of this issue: The Magdalene Asylums housed \"fallen\" unwed teenage girls who became pregnant and then worked at this nunnery under terrible work conditions. The sisters would then force these girls to give up their newborns and sign away their rights while their children were adopted by well-to-do families who paid the Church for their parenthood.) Philomena is just one of the many victims. Still a devout Catholic, Philomena clings to her memory of her son and is ready to admit her \"guilt\" in order to begin her search for her missing child. She meets Martin Sixsmith (Coogan, giving fine support), a lapse Catholic and rather hardened fellow. As Martin writes her story, his cynical ways contrast with the saintly Philomena. Their travels to locate Michael, her adopted son, are the basis for the film. (It is based on Sixsmith's novel which tells the true story of this journey.)The problem with the film is that the title character is just shy of a simpleton and too innocent and too pure a soul to be believe. Her latent cuteness about new experiences she discovers on her trip to America is more cloying rather than charming, and not that credible either. Were it not for the perfect casting of Dame Dench in the lead role, Philomena would be a minor disappointment. Instead, her extraordinary portrayal of a woman coming undone elevates this film to a whole new level of interest. Her acting is so controlled and expressive. It is in her quieter moments, in scenes lacking any dialog, where this remarkable actress excels. (Observe her confessional scene alone and dare not to be moved.) This is a master class in acting greatness. Philomena is, by nature, a conventional tear jerker, but it is Ms. Dench who supplies the emotional core and she is the real force of nature and reason to see this film.

He gave it up to become a government spin doctor when new Labour got elected in the 1997 landslide.After he left government, Sixsmith went into writing an human interest stories. Once such story he investigated was the forced adoptions of babies born outside of wedlock in Ireland.Philomena Lee played by Judi Dench is a person with essential goodness. She keeps a quiet dignity in a cruel cynical world full of weary journalists and uncompassionate nuns. Martin Sixsmith (Steve Coogan) reluctantly helps Philomena track down her boy who was sold to wealthy Americans. For years the Abbey in the Irish Republic stonewalled Philomena when she enquired about her son. They fed her lies and all the records were deliberately burnt.Martin and Philomena go to the USA to find out her son had become a big shot lawyer to Republican presidents but had a secret which he needed to hide. There is even one occasion where Sixsmith realises that he once met her son in a press briefing.Coogan as he usually does when he plays a real life person like he did with journalist and pop impresario Tony Wilson, he portrays Sixsmith as a bit of a prat. A little angry and self absorbed. The more magisterial role is by Dench. Philomena may not be bright but she likes to see the best in people. Always kind and considerate.Philomena is a sweet middlebrow tale. It is not as dramatic as it wants to be, it is essentially a search for a missing person which eventually comes full circle. Sixsmith saves his anger for the Catholic Church. Philomena Lee opts for forgiveness.",

            "content": "The story is just as the plot summary tells you, yet the twists is quite of a roller coaster even for a drama. The lead male character, Martin, was just fired from his work in BBC News. He met a girl that offered him a \"human interest\" story about an old mother looking for her long lost boy. Although he first accepted the work reluctantly, Martin then accompanied Philomena the mother in searching for her son, all the way to America. They found him, but with some major twists. And along the way Martin, who is quite ignorant to other things other than his interests, gradually change into someone more caring. But at the end, Martin was taught the greatest lesson in dealing with heartaches and mistakes, that is to forgive.The movie is a dramatization of a true story, though it's not hyperbolic in its depictions. The movie even put in some cheesy laughable moments. Yet the story is just like, to my point of view, Paulo Coelho's \"The Alchemist\" novel meets the female version of the biblical Job. It also depicts the sad truth of the real world that even among God-fearing men there are those who don't live as how God said to live, and yet they still strongly believe that they are doing God's work.Indirectly, most of the duration, through the character Martin, the movie kind of challenge the viewers' believe in God by depicting saddening story and adding it with Martin's straight to the point comments and cynicism. Yet the character Philomena at all times shows the contrary to Martin in looking at all things positively and being always ready to forgive.The music score is not so good. I even thought that some of the scores are maybe recycled from other dramas, especially in the sad moments. Yet The acting of both Judy Dench and Steve Coogan was great for the movie that it takes me away. Personally, I watched this and \"Delivery Man\" after I watched some action movies like \"Non-Stop\", \"Pompeii\", and \"300:Rise of An Empire\"; thus the dramas and comedies in both the former movies refresh my soul and thinking again.Personally, this movie is good. I recommend you to go and see it. The combination of a good story, a great screenplay, the challenging twists, and the remarkable final conflict is just excellent. It's a 7 out of 10 score from me.",

            "content": "As it unfolds, this film makes you feel angry, sad, depressed and finally uplifted \u2013 it also leaves you amazed that such things could happen in relatively modern times. This is a true story about Irish woman, Philomena Lee, played by Judi Dench, who as a single mother in the 1950's agreed to the adoption of her son in return for help during the pregnancy and birth by an order of Roman Catholic nuns. Three decades later, journalist, Martin Sixsmith (Steve Coogan), who had recently lost his job with the BBC, helps her find out what became of her son. The journey takes them from Ireland to America, for a surprising and emotional outcome.Judy Dench's performance as Philomena is beyond a performance really; she is the character from the very beginning. No wonder Cate Blanchett praised her when she was accepting her Academy Award for best actress in \"Blue Jasmine\".Although this film could have been pretty heavy going, director Steven Frears gives it a light touch. Sixsmith is self-deprecating, cynical and witty, and although he and Philomena are chalk and cheese, their relationship grows into a warm one.Much of the film plays out as a search \u2013 sort of a cross between \"Who Do You Think You Are?\" and \"Without a Trace\". It is compelling and holds your attention from start to finish as the two unlikely allies complete their journey. The Catholic Church comes in for a fair amount of bashing these days, but as it does not proclaim a fatw\u0101 against its critics, it is often an easy target. However, I don't think that is the case here \u2013 if the events happened, they happened. Although licence was apparently taken in places, the key elements of the story are based on fact.Worth a mention is Alexandre Desplat's score with its gentle waltz rhythms \u2013 you hardly notice it. That's because it melds so seamlessly with the drama \u2013 he caught the tempo of the film perfectly.Near the end, Martin Sixsmith quotes a line from T.S. Elliott, which poignantly sums up the story, \"We shall not cease from exploration, and the end of all our exploring will be to arrive where we started and know the place for the first time.\"",

She earned her keep by working 24/7 and could only see her son, Anthony, one hour a day. Anthony was eventually sold to an American couple. Now, 50-years later Philomena wants to find out what happened to her son. Journalist Martin Sixsmith (Steve Coogan) helps her in this quest. There is a lot going on in here: Philomena's unshaken faith, criticism against the Catholic Church, a kind of detective story putting clues together that may lead to what happened to Anthony, some humor between Philomena and Martin who is really down on Catholicism and is no longer a believer, an acceptance of homosexuality and most important: the forgiveness factor fostered throughout by Philomena. I honestly didn't think this would be as good as it turned out to be. The acting performances of Dench and Coogan made this good and sometimes the dialogues were spot on. There were some good lines in the beginning that kept me keeping on.Also, when they go to America, Philomena talks to a Mexican food server at an upscale hotel and says that she had never been to Mexico and sure it is lovely, apart from all the kidnappings. We get the impression that Philomena isn't all that isolated from world affairs although there are times she is clueless. Philomena is overly impressed with the size of the food portions Americans give out and is afraid that her son may be obese because of it. Martin is the one who keeps her focused. About half way through Philomena finds out what happened to Anthony and we ask: Is this over? Not a chance. There are more things to discover and off we go and glad of it. From time to time, we do see her son, Anthony, in flashbacks. This is a good movie, but nominated for Best Picture? Hmmm\u0085\u0085 However Judi Dench was nominated for Best Actress should have gotten it. Didn't happen. Well, at least Bond, James Bond has a very competent boss (she's M in the Bond stories).

There's an odd couple's comedy vibe about two totally different characters tracking down leads and ending up in the United States. Coogan's Sixsmith is a delightful and perfect foil to Philomena/Judy Dench. He's annoyed at first by her ramblings as they travel on their quest and also surprised and frustrated she isn't angry about how the way she was treated. However, he comes to realize that there is great strength in her quiet determination, as the spectators understand. A story of heartbreak told in the form of a moving road trip, Philomena allows Judi Dench to prove once again that she is a cinematic treasure, a genius.",

I would have probably not watched it if it were only for a Best Actress nomination for Ms. Dench. But because of its frequent citations during awards season particularly the nomination for an Oscar for Best Picture, this became a must-see film for me.\"Philomena\" is the true-to-life story of one Philomena Lee. As a young girl, she was impregnated by her boyfriend. She was banished to live with the Catholic nuns, who eventually remove her child from her after she gave birth to him. For years since then, she has been searching for her missing son whom she named Anthony.Fast forward to the 1980s, ex-journalist Martin Sixsmith was sacked from his position in government due to a political scandal. To ease himself back into writing, he reluctantly accepts a human interest piece, Philomena's search for her son.Their quest for Anthony brings them from Ireland to Washington DC. The story would unexpectedly tackle various loaded and controversial topics en route to its dramatic climax and conclusion.This film by Stephen Frears is basically a film by two actors: Dame Judi Dench as Philomena Lee and Stephen Coogan as Martin Sixsmith, who acted off each other very well. The way the film showed the progress of their search and its eventual outcome was very riveting and very touching.I have to admit that while she was very very good, I felt Dame Judi did not really disappear into her role. She is acting like she was in other films I have seen her in, particularly \"Marigold Hotel.\" I think she did not have to stretch too much acting muscle here.I am not very familiar with Coogan's work before, but he was very good here as the disgraced politician who is desperately trying to get his life back on track. His atheism clashes with Philomena's Catholicism. This conflict was very well-written and acted out.If there was any discomfort in watching this film, it would be a perceived anti-Catholic sentiment that was running through the story. The worst of this was the scene where an old nun was raving about her celibacy and condemning the girls' sins of the flesh. It was probably more \"acceptable\" in a theatrical production like \"Doubt\". But in a drama based on real life like \"Philomena,\" a hell-and-brimstone scene like that felt extreme.",

But then again, I'm not a kind old lady who thinks life is too short to hold a grudge.I am of course, referring to Philomena, the scatterbrained but lovable heroine played by Judi Dench. She's nice to everyone, loves romantic fiction novels and doesn't understand sarcasm one jot. Something tells me we wouldn't get on.

Martin is persuaded to search a mystery in Philomena's past that has haunted her from her teenage years. Martin sees the adventure as an opportunity to peddle a great story and rebound from his dismissal as a BBC broadcaster. Philomena and Martin are in many ways, polar opposites but the chemistry between them allows both to grow beyond their own comfort zones. They develop a partnership that uncovers the full range of the untold story in Philomena's past. The repartee is witty and pointed as the two travel from Ireland to America and back.

            "content": "Based on a true story, 'Philomena' (on TV, 26 02 16) mixes documentary realism, a mystery story and comedy with consummate success. At its heart is the striking contrast between the journalist Martin Sixsmith (Steve Coogan), portrayed as a cynical 'hack' and atheist, and Philomena Lee (Judi Dench), a devout Catholic, seemingly simple yet thoroughly clear-headed.The story looks back to 1952, when Philomena's father sent her to a convent as punishment for having a child out of wedlock. It portrays Ireland at that time far more harshly than 'Brooklyn' (also set in 1952). The nuns subject Philomena and other girls to a shockingly Spartan regime reminiscent of pre-Revolutionary French convents in Diderot's novel 'La religieuse' (filmed most recently in 2013). Worse still, they have no compunction in selling the girls' babies. It's sobering to think that their appallingly misguided practices could have taken place in such relatively recent times.Sister Hildegarde (Barbara Jefford), superior of the convent in 1952, embodies one of three variations on the theme of Catholicism. She is an unyielding fundamentalist, for whom sexual relations are 'carnal incontinence'. At the opposite extreme, Martin Sixsmith is a lapsed Catholic who bitterly detests the Church. Philomena, by contrast with both those characters, not only keeps her faith but practises it \u2013 heroically so in one case. So the story is essentially fair to the Catholic Church.By the time of the main action, 2002, Sister Hildegarde is very old and frail. Mother Barbara (Ruth McCabe), her successor at the time, is completely different: quite young, dressed in an unobtrusive habit and caring in her manner. It's also striking that one of the nuns (played by Wunmi Mosaku) is black.Sixsmith has temporarily abandoned his specialist field of Russian history for investigative journalism. In that role, he's accountable to his editor, who is really no more humane than Sister Hildegarde. When he tells her on the phone that Philomena is 'in bits' over her long-lost son's fate in the USA, she crows with delight.His investigation makes the film partly a mystery story. Its outcome is a great surprise, linking Ireland and the USA well after 1952.Judi Dench is thoroughly convincing as a talkative, warm-hearted and sometimes slightly embarrassing Irish woman. One of her most endearing traits is the way she repeats the name Martin in her conversations with him. Like her, Steve Coogan achieves some very subtle changes of attitude, mood and pace. There's just one touch, I think, of Alan Partridge when Sixsmith makes an awkwardly suggestive quip to Mother Barbara on seeing photos of Jane Russell and Jayne Mansfield.This film struck me as profoundly moving and I felt the tears welling up more than once. Yet another fine piece of work from Stephen Frears, and full credit to Steve Coogan and Jeff Pope for the screenplay.",

            "content": "It is not often that a film comes along with a perfect balance of humor and drama, but \"Philomena\" does just that. It's the true story of an Irish woman whose little boy was sold by nuns to rich Americans, and her attempt to find him 50+ years later.Judi Dench is her usual brilliant self, and the film is surprisingly beautiful to watch due to the spectacular fall color of Ireland and some beautiful scenery in the Washington DC area as well.When Philomena goes to America she is the ultimate curious visitor. She goes up to a Mexican worker in a restaurant and says something like \"Oh you're from Mexico!? How marvelous! In Britain we don't have Mexicans. We have Indians instead!\" And she manages to say things like this with such clear absence of malice that you can't help but love her. She is a bit of a British Edith Bunker, which is the source of a lot of humor, and like Edith she has a heart of gold with no guise whatsoever.The story is a true one, so there is no need to hammer out any message. The true story just speaks for itself, and it rings very true.I think I could watch this film 100 times and never tire of it. It is that brilliantly made. People of any age would love this film. Even kids. There are some adult jokes, but it's never vulgar so I would let any age see it.This movie reminded me of another great film about nun-run homes for Irish girls who had babies: \"The Magdalene Sisters.\" These films reveal a system which is thankfully gone now, but it is important that we know about them.I think this is a great feel-good film. And if it doesn't win a slew of Oscars I will be shocked. A GREAT film.",

            "content": "This BBC film has everything I would want for a great movie. Martin Sixsmith's book is powerfully told. The screenplay is outstanding. The Direction by Stephen Frears is done at an excellent pace. Judi Dench and Steve Coogan make a power team as Philomena and Martin Sixsmith. The supporting cast is fine, but this film belongs too these main characters. Story is about a young teenager (Philomena played by Sophie Kennedy Clark) who has an erotic encounter with a young man, becomes pregnant and is taken in by a convent where she delivers a baby boy. The nuns, in 1952, were in the business of delivering single underage teenage girls babies and then selling them for adoption to rich folks (mostly Americans) in Scotland. The location settings for this in Northern Ireland, the UK, and the US make for many great settings as beckoned for the story. Baed upon a true story, Philomena, 50 years after having her baby, wants to find him after the nuns sold her little boy away from her over 50 years prior. Sixsmith, a former BBC reporter who has been fired, gets involved to try and help find Philomena's son. This takes them from Rocrea in Scotland, to the United States. While watching the first half of the movie, the viewer feels like she will, and there will be a happy ending.Then, she finds out her son is dead, and why. Actually Michael Sixsmith leads her to find out where her son is. Rocrea nunnery in Scotland is no help and is actually the ultimate road block to Philomena finding out where her son was and who he was sold too.The emotion of the story is raised by the process, very old fashioned, balanced against the group of folks wanting to learn who he really was. It is a story we can not put down and at slightly over 90 minutes does not let the viewer escape without touching moments in the film. It is all quite adorable really.",

            "content": "Philomena is an interesting but odd little film that probably is more noteworthy for the controversy it engendered rather than for the efficacy of its narrative. It's based on the novel, The Lost Child of Philomena Lee by journalist Martin Sixsmith, a BBC correspondent turned Labour government adviser turned civil service worker, who became embroiled in a political scandal and was forced to resign (according to Wikipedia, the government later had to issue an apology and pay compensation). The screenplay was written by Steven Coogan who plays Sixsmith in the film. Coogan grafted a good part of his own personality on to Sixsmith who notably is Protestant with Coogan now portraying him as a lapsed Catholic, which is basically how Coogan views himself.Coogan is very harsh on the Catholic church and the director of Philomena, Stephen Frears, basically admitted on Charlie Rose, that Coogan wrote his own autobiography into it. Frears took issue with Bill Donohue, President of the Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights, in his article \"Debunking \"Philomena\", who claimed, \"A half century ago an Irish woman gave birth to a son out-of-wedlock and gave him up for adoption.\" Frears argued that Philomena's child was actually \"taken and sold.\" Donohue correctly maintains that the child wasn't \"taken\", as it was Philomena's father who brought his daughter to the abbey after Philomena's mother died when she was very young and he could not take care of her.Donohue takes exceptional issue with the charge that the Catholic Church took the children and \"sold them to the highest bidder.\" Coogan/Sixsmith imply that the nuns at the convent conspired to destroy the records through an act of arson (recall the scene in the pub where Sixsmith takes the word of villagers who believe the 'rumors'). According to Donohue, a fire did actually destroy most of the records as reported in the NY Times at the time\u2014but all the rumors about the nuns actually destroying the records, was never substantiated (but the filmmakers act as if this is a fact). Donohue also takes issue with Judi Dench who has been quoted as saying that Philomena was \"forced\" to give up her child. Donohue points out, however, that Dench forgets the scene in the film where Philomena acknowledges that she signed a legal agreement that she was relinquishing full claim to her child and handing it over to the nuns. And notably Philomena did this, not when she was a teenager, but when she was 22 years old!Nonetheless, one cannot ignore Philomena's feelings of bitterness toward the nuns which she expresses throughout the film. The actual giving up of the child (indeed if that's the way it happened), was an example of great insensitivity on the part of the nuns in charge and could have been handled in a much better way. At the same time, Donohue can't understand why Philomena would complain about her grudge work in the laundry for four years. He writes: \"The fact is that the nuns did what they could for the girls in their care, when no one else would accept them.\" He points out that the government was in no position in 1952 to care for the children. If there's anyone to blame here, it would be Philomena's family and Irish society in general\u2014in 1952 Ireland, a baby born out-of-wedlock, was simply not accepted. Donohue adds that if the nuns were that 'evil', why did they help Philomena obtain a job after she left the convent?According to Donohue, Sixsmith asserted that both Philomena and her son separately visited the abbey in 1977 looking for each other but the nuns have no record of that visit. Even more startling is the fact that Philomena and Sixsmith never went to the United States to search for her son\u2014this was completely invented out of whole cloth by Coogan.The bulk of 'Philomena' concerns the search for Philomena's son, Anthony (adopted name Michael), who Sixsmith (Coogan) discovers was a senior official in the Reagan and Bush administrations, was gay and died of AIDS, eight years earlier. After Philomena learns the shattering news, she and Sixsmith both decide to try and learn more about Michael and they end up speaking with his sister and ex-lover, who is initially hostile to communicating but warms up after Philomena directly approaches him.Is Donohue correct in asserting that 'Philomena' is one big Catholic bash? Not completely as the dialectic between the two principals makes it clear that Philomena is completely forgiving toward the nuns whereas Sixsmith/Coogan casts them as evil incarnate. In fact, Sixsmith/Coogan come off as self-righteous prigs who refuse to listen to Philomena's message of forgiveness. When Sixsmith damns the nuns when it's revealed they never told Philomena of Michael's visit to the abbey, Philomena points out they couldn't have known since he was visiting them as 'Michael' and not using his birth name of 'Anthony'.Nonetheless, Sixsmith is still enraged since there is at least one nun there, the ailing Sister Hildegarde, who would have known about Michael's visit and could have told Philomena later on. The problem is (and Donohue is completely correct about this), the real Sister Hildegarde died in 1995, and Sixsmith didn't start helping Philomena find her son until 2004. So the entire scene where an 'evil' Hildegarde blasts Philomena for her wayward ways is completely made up and never happened. Thus, the most significant dramatic moment in the film should be classified as wholly manipulative.I'm not an apologist for the Catholic Church especially in light of its history of pedophile priests. Nonetheless, in the case of this film, it's clear that the film's scenarists have unfairly stacked the deck against the nuns who cared for Philomena. The film still is worth watching particularly for Judi Dench's great performance as Philomena, the chronicle of her quest to find her son and the fascinating controversy the film has engendered.",

And that is because although it is a somewhat interesting concept and well put together movie, it doesn't have anything special about it. I almost feel indifferent towards it. On a technical level, this film really has nothing wrong with it. But that is a very easy thing for a film to do when it stays within very finite bounds to tell a simple story in such a short run time. PHILOMENA doesn't take any extra time to add narrative that may make the story a tad more interesting. It's sole focus is the development of a mother's love, nothing else. And I'm not saying that this is a bad thing, but PHILOMENA had room to add more substance to it. As I said, there are many strengths to the film, specifically in the screenplay that works extremely well with the little amount it has to work with. Judi Dench also gave one of the best performances of the year with her heartbreak, showing what it really is to be a loving mother. That's great and all, but they really needed to add more to make it more effective and memorable. I really hate to say it but although PHILOMENA is a fine movie, it will not be remembered for anything in particular. And this really is a shame since the little yet very strong substance it does have to offer is phenomenal. GRADE: 80 / B-",

A film you won't believe actually grossed $100 million worldwide, it's about Philomena Lee, a woman who was sent away to an abbey for 4 years after becoming pregnant out of wedlock. Her child was taken from her. Decades later, a journalist helps her to track down her son. You haven't actually seen the film if you watch the trailer or read the blurb, as this goes on directions you wouldn't expect. It's just another tear jerking drama like Dallas Buyers Club was and isn't entirely true to the real life events so it won't stick in the memory particularly, but this drama is actually worth seeing. It's mostly faithful to true events. The scenes which are artistic license, such as the confrontation between Steve Coogan's character and an elderly nun who used to run the covenant are actually powerful and enhance the story. The nuns sometimes feel like two dimensional antagonists, but the 2 main characters are well developed.Judi Dench is as flawless as ever and she deserved the nomination for best actress. Steve Coogan, who also wrote the film, is an actor I haven't seen much of but he's fabulous as well. Stephen Frears is clearly a director who knows what he's doing, and as with The Queen he fills a fairly simple drama story with great filmmaking, strong performances and good cinematography. The script is the core of the film and it's very moving and there's a sense of mystery and unpredictability, and the tear jerking moments feel real and necessary. It's a very interesting storyline in general and the fact that it's true makes it even more fascinating and disturbing. It's a sobering drama with a real sense of humanity. Philomena is nothing ground breaking and won't be as remembered as other films from 2013 but it's genuinely fine filmmaking. Don't let the rather weak poster fool you. Definitely worth seeing.8/10",

And it has plenty of wry humor with the occasional laugh out loud moments to keep it from being too heavy.I guess first I'll say this \u2013 don't look anything up before hand. I tend to watch movies with my laptop open and going, especially if they are based on a true story/history. Since this is based on a true story, I was googling all kinds of things, which of course gave me a little too much information too soon.OK, quick synopsis. \"Philomena\" was one of the girls incarcerated in the Magdalene laundries. This is a part of the story you can google without anything from the movie being ruined. These laundries were run by nuns for decades, in both Ireland and Australia, and apparently there was a similar situation run by the Catholic church in Spain. Girls and women who were considered sinful, wayward, etc. were sent to these nunneries for supposed education and rehabilitation. Instead, they were used for slave labor. Some were girls who had grown up as wards of the state, some were sent there because of petty crimes or because of running away, and some were sent there by their parents after they became pregnant. The situations were horrific, girl's babies were taken from them and sold to adoptive parents, girls and babies died in terrible labor circumstances, the girls were not educated, not fed well, and were treated like criminals. Some were kept there for years, well into adulthood.The movie is rated PG-13 for two F words and two Irish versions of the F word (fecking). There are the occasional comments that are a bit outr\u00e9, but overall it's quite a clean movie despite the subject.Philomena ends up working with a down-on-his-luck journalist to try and find the son that was taken from her when she was locked in the Magdalene laundries. The movie is the story of her search and the relationship between her and the journalist. As usual, Judi Dench is spectacular. If I hadn't have seen her act in so many other movies, it would have seemed like she was just being who I would think she was in real life, a somewhat befuddled older woman with a sad story. She nails the hilarious comments and perspective of an older lady, with the added Irish perspective as well, which can be quite amusing when she is commenting on something American from the Irish perspective.The humor is wry and very well done. Steve Coogan plays the journalist and also co-wrote the story. He is excellent in the role and the combination of his and Judi Dench's talents is truly wonderful. In addition to the story itself, there are some beautiful human learning moments.",

I soon realized I was the youngest member of the audience, but if being a senior citizen is what it takes to have enjoyed Judi Dench's buzzed about film, then label me for having a receding hairline.Director, Steven Fears, is the biggest liability to his film, the acting and screenplay compensate for his misdirecting. He makes Philomena feel smaller than what the talent around him deserve. The gloomy cinematography doesn't help his cause, but the film wasn't going to sink just because the director hit a few missteps.I assumed by the trailers and word-of-mouth that the film would be as light as a feather. Yes, it has Dench's warm one-liners and the sardonic comments from Coogan, but it's more challenging than the surface of that specific dialogue. Fears hits us over the head with traumatic moments to yank sentiment from our hearts. This is a compliment and an insult.The film's leads build the acting as the strongest aspect of Philomena. Dame Judi Dench stars as the title character, a naively cute performance that balances on adorable old-school line readings and spiraling drama. It's a lovely portrayal that deserves the award-loving Dench usually acquires. Steve Coogan is saturated in sarcasm in his gem of another performance.Philomena unyieldingly criticizes the Catholic church. They take our society's point of view and contrast it with traditional beliefs. Sure, Philomena won't change the minds of dead-certain Catholics, but it could spread light to open-minded individuals. Philomena, herself, abandons those beliefs. The moral of Philomena's actions: you can still act as a good person without clinging to Catholic judgments.I love the journey Philomena offers and the truth it reveals. The well structured script offers a nice turn of events and solidifies the film as well-rounded. Though it questions the facts of religion, the spirit of mother and child is stashed in Philomena's aura. Mary and Jesus. Philomena and Anthony. Philomena and Martin. Compact and sweet, Philomena should definitely be seen for the real-life story that could strike your curiosity.Rating: 7Grade: B",

The story follows the single teenager, Philomena who ends up pregnant and in an Irish workhouse convent. Later while there, her two year old son is taken from her and sold to a rich American couple. Forty-eight years later, her daughter accidentally finds out about her unknown brother. She then arranges for her mother to be taken by Martin from the UK to the US to find her long lost son. While there Philomena watches TV, reads trash novels and patronises local ethnic groups. Martin on the other hand, talks to people, investigates news articles, and tries to look for her son. Having completed their quest, they return to Philomena's home in Ireland to confront her past. There, she challenges Martin about his morals by demonstrating to him she prefers liars and unpunished 'religious forgiveness' of unrepentant criminals to the truth and law enforced justice for victims.

'Philomena' is perhaps a turning point in Coogan's career, having spent much of his time on the silver screen in self-admittedly poor films popping up alongside snorty-snorty friends in bit-part roles in Hollywood crap. While comedy is indeed an element in the film, 'Philomena' is potentially the start of a maturing for Coogan, as he moves towards making the films he'd probably like to make, rather than end up in. 'Based on true events', lead, Judi Dench, plays Philomena, an elderly Irish women living in London who, on the day that would be his fiftieth birthday, wants to locate her son, taken from her and adopted while she was in a convent in her teenage years. Having no luck herself, a chance encounter with journalist Martin Sixsmith (Coogan) leads him to help her in her search; his career having taken a backward step. As with any one-on-one film, the pair a opposites: Philomena a devout Catholic, believing in the good in people; Martin a cynical atheist, with little belief in anything. Seeing the story as a possible career boost, he uses his contacts to fund the search and publish the story, inevitably learning more about life than a simple 'human interest' story.For Dench, it was probably always inevitable that the reviews would be strong and the award nominations would follow. Though for Coogan, the reception was a little less obvious, writing and acting in a much more serious role. In terms of acting, despite the odd slightly cringe-worthy moment, he does a good job playing a job role he so loathes, while the writing - alongside Jeff Pope - is strong, finding a good balance between sentimentality and comedy in adapting Sixsmith's book. 'Philomena' will add another strong performance to Dench's long list of roles, while 2013 has been a big year in terms of Coogan's career, possibly putting Partridge to bed with a film and moving into more serious acting roles in 'The Look of Love' and now 'Philomena' and it will be interesting to see which direction it moves next, though it seems clear he would like more critical acclaim than laughs from now. That said, intentional or not, one comes away feeling more entertained than heartbroken by the film's conclusion. www.politic1983.blogspot.com",

            "content": "\"I would not have gone seen this film if it was not for Steve Coogan's (known for playing the cantankerous old git, Alan Partridge) role in this film as actor, producer, and screenwriter. Despite his comic leanings, he is made together a respectable but not brilliant dramedy about a woman who is trying to find her adopted son on a self-discovery journey across Ireland and America. Philomena, inspired by true events (cannot always be trusted), takes much of its pride and well-crafted skills with Judi Dench's performance as the title person where her banter, fears, and witty dialogue keep the film going on. The film's multinational locale is a plus point for the film but I will admit it does utilise very little on the American side and more on the Irish side but this is consistent with the framework of how events turned out (so to speak) and where Philomena Lee's child was adopted. The mannerisms and humour were very intriguing adding in Alan Partridge (a-ha!), I mean Coogan, to play Martin Sixsmith was a better idea than I could expect but Dench steals the show here. The most important parts of the film are their screen presences and that is what kept me on the seat and how witty the story was even in its dramatic confinements where the film takes us to deep, heavy issues like Catholic order of nuns, prayer, sin, and birth of a newborn (which are viewed with a critical lens but not a vilified one here) and loneliness which all accumulate the mood for this film and much of what is going on is explanatory and felt like a basic puzzle altogether in one. The political angles of the film (with its mockery of spin doctors, the press, religion, Republican party/GOP, ethnic stereotyping, and homosexuality) could put off some people but I felt it was natural (especially in how the dialogue is used in the film) and well-done on the part of Coogan to have a bit of a Chris Morris type of tongue-in- cheek without exactly being as nasty or vicious as Morris. The criticisms are apparent and it mostly has due in part with the short length (for a film with such two enjoyable actors, 95 minutes is not enough) and slightly uneven reliance on drama over humour has rendered the film a bit basic, sentimental, or televisual but at least, with all due respect, was not as frustrating or annoying as Stephen Frears' (the director here) other work, The Queen. If you are ever in the mood for something wrapped and boxed up in a bow on TV or want to feel connected with your grandmother (which the film was advertised and marketed toward the geriatric or elderly), why not pop on Philomena on the DVD or Blu-ray. It has enough tearful moments, points to discuss about family and loss, and satirical edge/humour to call for 'mild entertainment' at home. A film with a similar approach but with more comedy (about a generation-gap journey by road) called The Guilt Trip, with Seth Rogen and Barbra Streisand, is recommended too.\"",

I think the film was very well done since it shows the great lengths a mother would GI through to find her son and her selfless dedication. I personally hot the impression that there was a mother and don't type relationship between Philomena and Martin which was rather touching. The film foes have some heartbreaking moments particularly when Philomena finds out her son died before she had the chance to reunite with him. Overall it is one of Judi denchs best films",

            "content": "The mystery of a woman searching for her lost child of 50 years; an overly polite old lady and a disgraced former journalist on an intercontinental journey; an uncovered scandal in the Catholic Church \u2014 \"Philomena\" has it all, and that's before you count Dame Judi Dench.Based on \"The Lost Child of Philomena Lee\" by Martin Sixsmith, the story follows Sixsmith's journey with Lee to find her son, Anthony, who was taken from her and put up for adoption in the 1950s by the nuns who took her in (and countless other young mothers with unplanned pregnancies whose families shunned them).Steve Coogan stars as Sixsmith, the journalist who lost his job as communications director for Britain's Department for Transport as a result of a leaked email scandal. Encouraged to write a human interest piece as a bit of a rebound for his writing career, he learns of Philomena's story from her daughter (Anna Maxwell Martin). Intrigued enough, Martin and Philomena revisit her old convent and travel to America in hopes they can track Anthony down.Their journey contains both inspiration and anger, suspense and poignance, humor and heartbreak. It's one of those perfect stories and Coogan and co-writer Jeff Pope capture it with an equaling compelling script that balances the wide range of tones and emotions, transitioning through them with elegance.Yet \"Philomena\" has plenty to say that's not on the page. The team of Dench and director Stephen Frears (\"The Queen\") prove as formidable as you'd imagine. Mostly it's Frears giving way to Dench's masterful performance, but he shows expert judgment in when to lean on his ace. Few can quietly contemplate on screen like Dench, pulling us into her character's thoughts and allowing us to settle easily into Philomena's worldview. This woman has been haunted every day by the child that was taken from her more than 50 years ago, and we get to not only follow her as she discovers the truth, but watch as she reckons with that information. How she processes the complex emotions that pour out of this story compared to how Martin processes them compared to how we as viewers process them is a significant piece of what resonates so fiercely about \"Philomena.\"As often as Frears has cause to focus in on Dench's watery blue eyes, however, there's a healthy dose of comedy, no doubt thanks to Coogan's involvement. It all serves to give us a complete portrait of Philomena. She's principled but not angry, lost but devout, polite but foul-mouthed, easily pleased by simple things but not naive. Dench conveys them all in her performance, and it's as compelling to watch her go toe to toe with Coogan as it is to see how she'll handle the story's biggest moments.The story is so effortlessly good that it would be hard to mess it up, but the use of flashbacks in the beginning and also fake home video footage throughout slide us even deeper into Philomena's shoes. The combination of technique, writing and performance creates instantaneous investment in the story that lasts through the film's final moment. In fact, the film's only faults can be ascribed to not going deep enough into each of the story's many facets. More time could easily have been devoted to Martin's backstory, or the implications of these convents selling off children. Yet there's a certain beauty in limiting the scope of the film to this concrete stretch of time in which Martin and Philomena meet each other and set off searching for answers. \"Philomena\" could've easily lost its identity wandering into the many potential rabbit holes that emerge as the puzzle comes together piece by piece. Instead, the film focuses on an emotional, empathy-building, thought-provoking 98 minutes that stand testament to the powerful and invaluable role of stories.~Steven CThanks for reading!

            "content": "I think that Philomena is in many ways comparable to Vertigo, the classic 1957 Hitchcock movie. Let's see in what they are different. Vertigo is fictional. Its character, Scottie, is a middle age weary, depressed man while Philomena is a real senior citizen who is some kind of an idealist person. I found a similarity in the sense that both characters are victims of tragedies that have hurt them tremendously and marked out their life. Both tragedies were committed by evildoers not by natural disasters. Scottie and Philomena are characters involved in searches looking for answers that may heal their scars. Both characters are complemented by another person in their search. They founded their partners by chance. Unlikely Philomena, Scottie's partnership is dark and mysterious. Phil's partnership is unambiguous although non symmetrical. Martin would be professionally helpful to her but his heart is not fully into this pursuit. He is wounded after a setback related to his job as a high roller political journalist and at this point he is cynical and pessimistic. Both movies are emotionally complicated stories involving a travel to the past and in both cases it was resolved with subtlety, ability and talent. Philomena is actually a road movie since many of the leads are quite far apart. This implies a close interacting between Phil and Martin even more intense when we add the chasing of leads which entails new emotional brinks due to the hopes, doubts and uncertainty involved. Of course I am not going to get into details but there are few finding and leads that enhances the story. Movies which are inquisitive and go into obscure paths, to the heart of a tragedy, into places where individuals have been gravely injured are very hard to realize. When the backbone of a story is the theft of a toddler by catholic nuns is very hard to create art while holding anger, fury and sentimentality. Evildoers holding positions of power are common material for movies but you need a special vision to make them entertaining. Stephen Frears counted with an apt cast and crew. The adapted script is excellent. If you are familiar at all with Judi Dench's work, you can predict the quality of any of her roles but this time Dame Judi fleshed out Philomena with a tenderness that expresses a unique, real human being. Another outstanding performance.Steve Coogan very aptly expressed the nature of his character and the evolution from quiet cynicism to open, sincere anger. Stephen Frears implemented and balanced the golden elements available for this film. He creates an atmosphere that expresses the points of view of Philomena and builds a sequence of images and dialog that keep us our attention intact. As a director he took the job of master storyteller and excels at it.",

We're none of those things; we just didn't feel that Coogan and Cope's pedestrian script does justice to the real Philomena's astounding story.

Dame Judi does what she can with an underwritten part (the way she utters the word \"bicurious\" makes up for a lot); good work by Sophie Kennedy Clark in the small role of the teenage Philomena. The curse of the \"based on a true story\" movie seems to be at work here\u2014if you thought that \"The King's Speech,\" \"Argo\" and \"Captain Phillips\" were just okay, and not really deserving of all the praise that was heaped on them, then you may feel the same about this one.",

            "content": "Former BBC reporter Martin Sixsmith published an article on how Philomena Lee, a woman searching for her son who was born out of the wedlock and adopted by an American couple. The heart wrenching tale leaves many women, like Lee, who get themselves pregnant before getting married, seeking their child who has been adopted by families from American. It was not too long before Stephen Frears and Steve Coogan decided to bring the article up onto the screen, sharing with the world on one of the dark open secret, in a light and comical manner. Entitled Philomena, it is a no-brainier for audience to know the story revolves the protagonist, Philomena Lee, marvelously portrayed by Judi Dench. Coogen, taking the role of both the producer and playing the role of Martin Sixsmith himself, develops an on screen chemistry with Dench. Set in 2002, the story revolves around Philomena seeking for her son, Anthony Lee, who was adopted by an American family in 1955. Shamed by her family members for getting pregnant before marriage at the age of 18, Philomena was send to a Roman Catholic Convent in Roscrea as a form of punishment to repent for her sins. Working in the laundry room for years, she was shocked and upset that Anthony was adopted by a childless American couple in return for a fee for the church's operation. Having signed an agreement between the church and her, Philomena is not to approach Anthony in any way. At the same time, Martin 'resigned' from BBC due to bringing shame and getting weary from reporting war stories. Deciding to take a different approach in his career, Martin assists Philomena in the journey to look for Anthony, who is now named Michael. Frears takes a different approach in presenting the story of how Lee goes on the journey to seek her long lost son. While being realistic and serious at times, the light hearted approach softens any possible tension that could have broke out. This can be seen from her excitement by babbling cheerfully to Martin on the novel she read during their way to America. It is a great difference to Philomena's despair to look for Anthony/Michael after the church claims that the details of Anthony's adopted parents were destroyed in a fire years ago, which almost eliminates Philomena's hope of seeing Anthony/Michael. Philomena also had her fair share of getting worried for not able to identify Anthony/Michael due to the history and culture of America. This is another pointer that was highlighted by Frears to show the despair and possible disappointment should Philomena unable to recognize Anthony/Michael. 'What if he died in the Vietnam War? Or lose a leg? Or getting obese?' Philomena was sharing her concern with Martin at a food truck on the street. 'Why obese?' Ask by the curious Martin. 'The size of the portion!' exclaims Philomena. Behind the exchange of these funny lines, it not only shows how the history and culture has changed the people, but also the possible chances of Philomena acknowledging her long lost child who was taken away from her for the past half a century. Such references can be seen in Mrs Henderson Presents, Frear's 2005 production with Dench. Both films are witty, funny, and at the same time, tell us how time and environment can change everything a person hopes for. In summary, Philomena not only gives hope, but also about forgiveness and most importantly, treasuring everything that one have. At the running time of 98 minutes, it make us think how the separation from the child makes the mother want to see them at any cost.",

The back story is told well - with reels from the man's young life. Her search for her son takes her to America and interactions between Philomena and Martin Sixsmith are so fun to watch - very smart writing. I so liked the fact that the writing allowed for the feelings to be played out and not glamorized. The discussions of religion between the Catholic Philomena and the atheist writer are interesting to watch. With few clues to start with, and with lies from the convent, the story is pieced together and comes full circle. What happened to these young women was horrible and so wrong. I hope all those still searching find their son or daughter.",

Although I only had seen Dench in James Bond movies, I knew that she was of the great actors of her time based on her reputation. After seeing this movie, it is clear that she has the ability to completely immerse herself into a soft-spoken, old lady and yet steal every scene. The movie was both sweet and touching with very funny scenes, while also dabbling in some more serious themes of faith (as a positive or negative force) and forgiveness. Dench portrayed Philomena as a very believable sweet, innocent lady from the little things like how she would constantly show fascination at little things like planning to watch Big Momma's House on a hotel TV. Coogan is also good in his role as a journalist who is trying to get his life back on track. A couple of funny exchanges by him reminded me of the Alan Partridge movie I had recently watched. However, make no mistake that Judi Dench's Philomena is what makes the movie what it is. As a viewer she draws you into the emotional roller-coaster that she rides throughout the movie. Her funnier moments of making such innocent genuine conversation with everyone she meets, and child-like observations was very endearing. While her struggles were very wrenching.",

Around 2004, Lee worked with journalist Martin Sixsmith (played by Steve Coogan) to help find her son who was forced into adoption almost fifty years before.I believe that a movie-going year feels incomplete until I've seen at least one film with Judi Dench in it. \"Philomena\" not only fills this quota; it provides one of Dench's best performances. It also happens to be one of the best films of 2013.The acting is praiseworthy enough but an even greater strength is the story written by Coogan and Jeff Pope based on Sixsmith's book. There are so many shocking and fascinating twists in the search that the film proves, yet again, that truth is stranger than fiction.It is easy to compare \"Philomena\" with \"The Magdalene Sisters\" (2002) as both films expose the extreme injustices of some Irish convents against teenage girls in the last century. Both films are well made but \"Magdalene\" leaves the viewer with an unresolved rage by the end. \"Philomena\" certainly raises just rage as well but its main impact is the compassion one feels for the main characters particularly in debates about rage vs. forgiveness in a shocking finale.All the great elements of this film were placed together by the great master Stephen Frears whose best works include \"My Beautiful Launderette\", \"Dangerous Liaisons\", \"The Grifters\", \"The Queen\", and now, \"Philomena\".",

He takes a true and sad story charges it with a punch that will hit most of its viewers really hard.The story is simple. Philomena decides to tell that she had a son, and that she would like to find him. Her daughter meets fallen from grace journalist Martin Sixsmith, who becomes interested in the story. And Philomena and Martin go on a search that will bring a dark truth to light.Frears does a great job on not making this story a show against the Catholic church. He and Coogan and Pope adapting Sixmith's story, do a great job in making this the story of Philomena, of a woman who was robed of her son, and with this, of a part of herself. And Judi Dench is more than amazing as the main character. She is subtle, touching and says so much without having to make a speech or say something deep that even for her high standards, is a revelation. Her Philomena is a woman full of flaws that some people, when meeting, would look from over their shoulders, but then learn to respect her views and her believes. Coogan, as the posh Sixmith, does a great job (even if once or twice it seems he is going into comedic mode) too of showing the \"educated\" man that can't understand some of Philomena's decisions but that ends caring more about her than about the story. As said, this could be a little bit cheesy but Frears, the actors and the script don't let it become so.This is a great movie, touching, subtle and powerful. Totally worth checking out.",

The story itself is maddeningly awful and Coogan and Judi Dench do a brilliant job of conveying the depth of emotion that such a chain of events could incur. The relationship between the two is beautifully portrayed without ever indulging in soppiness or melodrama. And for anyone wanting to know what comedy really is, look no further than this. Coogan delivers the most delicate dose of Alan Partridge without overcooking it, playing perfectly off Dench's charming innocence. One of the best films of the decade.",

The main element of this film is to raise a big flag and alert us to the dark past of these institutions but at the same time leaving us to judge whether anything was wrongfully done or was it all done as necessity of the circumstances of that time.

If they hadn't insisted this was biographical I would have given the film a higher rating because it was well produced and acted. It just seems so implausible. Also, the 1980's in America were a roaring good time. Everyone, including democrats were bigoted about gay people back then. I had a close friend die of AIDS in 1981 and everyone was freaked out about it. So they misrepresented that detail so I'm sure the rest of the story was overly dramatized.",

With so much evidence like Philomena and day by day revelations in the news media about pedophile priests, its truly a wonder the Catholic Church hasn't been designated an organized criminal enterprise by the FBI.

An interesting part of the film is that most people will feel outrage at what the representatives of the Catholic Church did in this film, and that feeling is expressed by Steve Coogan as Martin Sixsmith, the journalist uncovering the awful actions committed in the past and present. Yet the title character does not share this outrage, at least in the fashion that you would expect from a film like this, and what most film goers would feel. She feels mostly grief and loss, and she correctly states at one point that it is her right to feel what she feels because these things were done to her, and not to Mr. Sixsmith or anyone else (well, besides the many other women who had their children stolen from them). Although I knew what to expect on some level because I was aware of what the film was about, there were some turns that actually surprised, and although I know this was based on a true life story, I think the way the script and Mr. Frears handled their discovery was very effective and made you really feel Philomena's pain. My only criticism is that there were a few things that felt like they were either ignored by the script or left on the cutting room floor, such as there being no mention of where her son's adoptive parents were, and why the sister had no curiosity about her origins. There's enough there to draw some conclusions, but it does seem a little strange that these questions would either never come up or never be answered by an investigative journalist.Philomena is a film worthy of its nominations by the Academy Awards. I'm not sure it will win anything, but it's definitely worth a viewing- Aaron Widera",

            "content": "Since the beginning of recorded history, religion has been a force for great good and terrible evil. Both the good and the evil have arisen alternately from the doctrine of particular religions and from interpretations, personalities and motivations of its followers. Often times, people who honestly believe they are doing their god's good work, carry out that work in such a way that the effects of their efforts can only be seen as evil. Such is the case in the historical drama \"Philomena\" (PG-13, 1:38).Dame Judi Dench was nominated for an Oscar and a Golden Globe for her role as the title character, an Irish woman who embarks on a journey to find her long-lost son. As a poor teenager, Philomena became pregnant. As they did with many girls in the same predicament, the local convent delivered her baby and allowed the two of them to live there in exchange for Philomena working in the convent's laundry. When the boy turned three, the convent gave him up for adoption \u2013 without Philomena's consent.She spends most of her life privately wondering what became of her son and inquiring at the convent had gotten her nowhere. On what was her son's 50th birthday, Philomena reveals her secret to her daughter, who puts her in touch with journalist Martin Sixsmith (Steve Coogan, who also co-wrote the film's script, which earned Golden Globe and Oscar nominations for Best Screenplay). Sixsmith decides to write a human interest article about Philomena. He ends up writing a book. Sixsmith's book and this film adaptation tell the true story of Philomena's quest and his help in resolving her very personal saga.\"Philomena\" is both interesting and entertaining. The film is equal parts human drama, mystery, buddy comedy and discussion about religion and morality, as it pertains to this little-known chapter of Catholic Church history. In short, finding out what happened to Philomena's son is only part of the story. It's also about what she does with the information she learns, and how it affects others. Director Stephen Frears gives us a small, but deep and compelling story that's well-paced and well-told. For his efforts (and those of the other filmmakers and actors), in addition to its Best Actress and Best Screenplay nominations, the movie also received both Golden Globe and Oscar nominations for Best Picture \u2013 I'd say, with good reason, as I give this film an \"A-\".",

            "content": "Philomena, yet another highly acclaimed 2013 movie that I'm barely getting around to seeing and yet more evidence that my first impressions need to be stripped of credibility. Steve Coogan, plays Martin Sixsmith, a former British government adviser who is approached to do a story on a sweet old Irish lady, who wants nothing more than to reunite with her son, Anthony. He agrees to cover her journey and the two go out on a search slash investigation to find out where, after 50 years, her son could be. The story is a surprisingly gripping drama, that at times disturbed me and had me fighting back a few tears. It's some pretty heavy stuff. There are these scenes where Philomena is describing her younger years to Sixsmith, and they are really intense. Philomena was a teenage mother, frowned upon by her peers at the convent, forced into what pretty much looked like slave labor, and helplessly watches her son being given up for adoption by evil nuns. That last part may have been a bit much but that's literally what happens. This first act was really well done, the dark and dramatic beat down you get meshes beautifully with the more comedic side of the rest of the movie. That's also thanks to the terrific performances of Steve Coogan and Judi Dench. The musical score was really enjoyable and fit the movie well. The cinematography was beautiful, the scenes taking place in Ireland were stand out and absolutely shined on Blu-ray. My biggest gripe with the movie may just be one of the biggest themes of the movie, and that's the religious themes. Maybe it's just because I'm as far from religious as possible, anytime it's brought up in a movie it kind of puts me off. I will say the creepiness of the nuns struck a note with me and made them seem all the more evil. Again, it's just a spec of dust on this highly enjoyable film. It's a bit harsh at times but it's a well made movie with some great acting in it. There are times where it gives off the feeling of almost a mystery and also some suspense. There are these twists that are thrown in as Philomena and Sixsmith get deeper into the investigation and you just get hooked. I highly recommend a watch, it surprised me.",

            "content": "In the opening scenes of \"Philomena\", the audience witnesses a sweet old lady by the same name narrate to a well-wisher that she just got a hip replacement in a glorious Irish accent. At first glance, Philomena appears to be a normal old lady but she has kept a rather large secret buried within her for most of her life. She is seen lighting a Catholic candle at a church for an undisclosed person. Through a series of clever flashbacks, it is revealed that the person Philomena is lighting a candle for is her son. Philomena, like many na\u00efve young girls, got pregnant by accident as a teenager in the 50's. Her son was taken from her by the nunnery in which she resided and he was sent to America. All she had left to remember him by was a picture taken as a toddler. She couldn't help but long to see her son and wonder if he ever thought of his birthplace of Ireland.Martin Sixsmith then enters the picture. Martin is an arrogant writer who had somehow managed to quickly rise through the ranks of politics and is dismissed just as fast. Seeking to get his mind of his political career, Martin seeks out a story and ends up encountering Philomena and agreeing to help her find her long lost son. He goes back with Philomena to the nunnery she was raised in. As the main characters observe the ages on the tombstones, they can't help but notice that the majority of the graves were for young women, some as young as 14. They all died in childbirth.\"'Philomena\" will easily be remembered as one of the most powerful films of 2013. The movie is a clever presentation of the complex nature between religion and class as well as social pressure. Martin attempts to confront the nun responsible for taking away Philomena's son. This same woman refused to provide proper medical care to pregnant girls to punish them for their perceived sin. She also intentionally separated countless other families and loved ones and did everything in her power to keep these people apart during her lifetime. While the old religious lady versus the young atheist is clich\u00e9, in this movie it is tastefully done. Martin fights the nun and the system that takes children away from their mothers the only way a writer knows how: through writing.One must give credit to the acting performances of the two leads Judi Dench of James Bond royalty and Steve Coogan in the film. The remarkable chemistry between the two leads in the film helps the narrative progress in an entertaining manner without detracting from the raw power of the story. But suffice it to say, the twist at the end will leave you stunned. Philomena is a thoughtful and provocative film that is based on a true story. In 2009, the real-life Martin Sixsmith published \"The Lost Child of Philomena Lee\" in 2009. Thousands more adopted Irish children and their 'shamed' mothers are still trying to find each other. Philomena Lee today lives in the south of England with her other children and grandchildren. The film \"Philomena\" is about the old woman and Martin's quest to find her lost son.",

He thinks that he wants to do Russian history, but ends up helping an elderly Irish woman locate her son, who was taken from her when she was living in a convent after having become pregnant in her early teens. This is a gentle film, with tender moments, a fair amount of snark coming from the male lead, and a few interesting sub-themes. The son turns out to have been a homosexual who succumbed to AIDS, and he had sought his mother in Ireland before dying but was told by the convent where he had been born that there was no information about his mother available. She was told the same about her son, and even that all of the documents were lost in a huge fire\u2014save the one where she signed away the right to inquire about precisely this matter!

That said, it did, as this subject always does, make me question the value of the catholic church, especially in Ireland. No wonder the words Irish and guilt are so often used as one.Barbara Jefford as Sister Hildegarde, was excellent in one of the films final scenes - truly believable; sad, but believable...

It's also the tale of a journalist who assists her in finding her long lost son taken from her when he was a young child. The journalist is portrayed very well by Steve Coogan who is also a co-writer. It's a short and somewhat simple film that is well told, well written and well acted, however, I am now a little surprised at that Oscar nomination for best picture.

I can smell an Oscar on its way to the actress. The plot of the film very simple but so powerful to the point that I cried meself to sleep last night. Simply put, the story tells of a woman who by the way is actually a true story, is looking for her son which was forcibly given up for adoption. The woman herself was in the Magdalen Laundries. In those days it was shunned or frowned upon to have sex out of wedlock and therefore the Sisters, gave children away to couples who wanted children. Philomena's child was given up. Throughout the film, it was found that the son was gay and died of AIds. and he served or at least was a member of the Ronald Reagan Administration, which we the audience were very impressed.The Irish Govt and Irish Religious ORders were recently this year under fire for compensation for the treatment the women received while in the Laundries. I felt so sorry for them. We all did. Steve Coogan's character Martin a journalist was most impressive. Now am not a fan of his character of Alan PArtridge, prob never will, but the film portrayed a different side to him. Philomena went over to America where the Couple had taken him to, and found out that he was buried back in ROscrea where the Magdalene Laundries were. ONe of the Sisters involved in the whole ordeal was Sr. Hildeberg(something like that). In that she even went as far as, Martin(Coogan) questioning her, not knowing the hardship Philomena went through, Sr. Hildeberg just replied \"God will judge me\". and in a fit of rage he replies \"If Jesus was here, he'd kick you right out of that wheelchair. \".

Supposedly it is based on a true story but it probably took a lot of liberties with the story to sell messages that never were in the original story. And the foul language used too frequently in the movie probably never happened in real life because it is completely out of character. The movie is not PG-13. It should have been rated as \"R\".I am not a Catholic and I have a lot of issues with the Catholic church but this movie is a vicious and undeserved attack on the Church. It really takes things out of context. That the Church took in unwed pregnant mothers, helped deliver the babies, raised the children and put them up for adoption is very commendable and charitable. That they charged adopting parents a $1000 was justifiable. Charity doesn't come free.But the main point of the movie was to condemn the Nuns for refusing to help the mother find her child after it was adopted. There is a good reason for that and in many countries and states, that is the law. Once the mother gives up her child for adoption, the adopting agency is forbidden from disclosing any information about the whereabouts of the adopted child. There is a very good reason for that. It provides stability both for the adopted child and the adoptive parents. But primarily it is for the benefit of the child.That also explains why the mothers while in the convent were only allowed to visit their child for an hour a day. While it provided an opportunity for the mothers to see their children, it did not allow enough time for the children to become bonded to their mothers which would have complicated their adoptions. It was a wise move.Having said that the nuns could have treated the mothers much better. It was not Christian of the nuns to condemn the mothers because they had engaged in extramarital sex. It would have been much better if the nuns had followed Jesus' example and teachings. Jesus loved and forgave sinners telling them o and sin no more.\" Had the nuns did that, they would have really helped the women.But as much as I have admired Judi Dench as an actress, it is a shame she took on this role and it doesn't speak well of her.",

            "content": "Philomena is a film that snuck up on me completely. It was a film I had wanted to see badly when it came out in 2013, but I sadly missed the chance to see it in cinema. After Philomena left cinemas, I had forgotten about it until my wonderful monthly viewing planner came to be. Yet another reason I am glad I began to organize a monthly viewing schedule; I'm given a second chance to see films that I have wanted to see but missed. Philomena, starring Judi Dench and Steve Coogan, tells the story of a woman who was forced to give up her child she had out of wedlock, and her search to find him 50 years later. Directed by Stephen Frears, Philomena is a human story delving into relationships in the most genuine way. On the anniversary of the birth of the child that was taken from her, Philomena (Judi Dench) feels ready to face her experience and seek out the son she has thought about daily for the last 50 years. Martin Sixsmith (Steve Coogan) is a shamed journalist dismissed from the Labour party unsure of how to get work or what to do next. When Philomena's daughter meets Martin by chance, she gives him a brief overview of her mother's story hoping to entice him to help. Martin, despite being currently unemployed, wants to stay away from human interest stories, but eventually reluctantly comes around to tell Philomena's story. Philomena tells Martin about her life, becoming pregnant out of wedlock then being sent to a Catholic Convent to deliver her baby. The convent would take care of the children and allow the young mothers to avoid medical costs and provide them with an outlet of childcare. What the mothers didn't know, however, was that the children would also be taken from them and given to adoptive parents. Once this happened to Philomena, she was heartbroken, never forgetting her son Anthony. With the help of Martin, Philomena is ready to track down her son, which quickly takes her from her home in Ireland to America. I may be in the minority here, but I always get pretty excited to see the glowing W of the Weinstein logo. I almost always fall for films distributed by the brothers and typically enjoy their output so seeing that beloved W before the opening credits was a good indication that I would enjoy Philomena. My favorite film technique, when it is well-used, are flashbacks. Philomena employs such meaningful and seamless use of flashbacks that the story is incredibly enhanced. The driving force behind Philomena is the human relationships we see develop throughout the film. The relationship you expect isn't even the one that takes precedence, as you become much more invested in Philomena and Martin than the search for Philomena's son. Stephen Frears does a beautiful job of showing the reality of people from very different lifestyles pushed together for a story, and the ups and downs they encounter together. Philomena wants to experience the search for her son with Martin alone, telling her daughter to stay home. It seems odd initially to see a stranger endure such a personal journey with Philomena until you realize that even though Philomena is searching for her own child, he was taken and thusly is a stranger to her. It is so beautiful to see the gradual strengthening of the relationship between Martin and Philomena, who at first are only tolerable of each other, eventually, becoming dear friends. The personal journey of a woman desperate to know if her stolen son ever thinks of her, Philomena is a raw, genuine film to be seen by all.",

            "content": "I like Steve Coogan, I've seen his TV shows and a film or two, and he is a brilliant and erudite comic. You can just tell from from the interviews he gives, that he is a very intelligent guy and he more than holds his own with any of the unctuous show hosts he has to deal with.It's kind of sad that he has to trot himself out to promote the movie because it puts him in a bit of a personality straightjacket. I can see why he signed on for this project though, it's a story that seems to validate his stance against the idiots in authority in the UK class and church system, but I prefer him acting in his stronger suit, which is parody. There's some great flashes of humour where he loses his temper but for the most part this is a plodding movie that would have been better presented as a documentary. If you'd cast him as Crocodile Dundee trying to find his OWN lost child then you'd have a scenario that allows Coogan to show his real talents.As it is it's not a bad show, wots-her-face Dench is very good as Philomena but then again she could be the only person in the movie and still carry it off. But make no mistake, Coogan has screen presence, he is handsome enough to carry off a Paul Newman or Cary Grant type of role, he just has to get the right script and a director who can tease greatness out of him. This one, though, isn't the defining moment, he hasn't shot himself in the foot but it ain't gonna get directors screaming down the phone to sign him up. I'm sure his time will come and if a script like Sideways or Barney's Version should come up, then he's your man. Of course no one has to worry about the marvellous Ms Dench,(and I mean that)she's already on every director's speed dial. I think most people will enjoy the way the movie unfolds but leave your watch at home. Cheers",

Well, 'Philomena,' of course.The \"inspired by true events\" film takes us from London to Ireland to Washington and back as Dench's titular character drags along Coogan's disgraced former BBC journalist-turned author Martin Sixsmith in search of the son who was taken from her 50 years ago. As you'd expect, there's a mix of emotions throughout 'Philomena,' with a fair amount of light-hearted moments despite the general sense of uncertainty and fear of the unknown.Despite the plot's focus on a mother's search for her son, the relationship between Dench's and Coogan's characters is the heart and soul of the film. The ups and downs, the twists and turns, the big decisions (deciding whether to watch 'Big Momma' House' in a hotel room or visit the Lincoln Memorial) - all of these elements add up to paint a complete picture about human bonds that can be developed from human interest stories. The themes of faith (and lack thereof), remembrance and one's sense of home are carried throughout, and give 'Philomena' a sense of meaning.It's not surprising 'Philomena' was honored with a best picture nomination (in addition to Dench's acting nomination), but it is surprising that a little engine that could like this could make a big impact on viewers of all ages, from all backgrounds",

While her acting is always good, unfortunately she plays one of three characters in just about every film. This portrayal is easily a combination of her roles in \"Shipping News,\" and \"Notes On A Scandal.\"Without giving anything away, the story deals with Catholicism, unmarried girls getting pregnant, and too much authority by those in religious positions. At 98 minutes, the film moves pretty swiftly and doesn't lull at any time. Moments of humor are interjected throughout which provides a break from the serious nature of the film.

The journalist who helps her search for the boy is disillusioned, a hater of euphemism and an atheist. The engaging contrast of sensibilities is superbly portrayed by Dench as Philomena Lee and Coogan as the journalist Martin Sixsmith. Their investigation reveals a punitive self-serving cover-up by the Church.

            "content": "Those who assert that this film is anti-Catholic seem not to try to understand what was at stake!In the fifties, an unwanted pregnancy was in most cases an absolute catastrophe. There was abortion, a traumatic and - if performed in clandestinity - potentially life-threatening experience. For those who gave birth but - for one reason or another - had no means of support, a convent was a refuge; and for the convent it was a sacred mission to provide an alternative to abortion. Quite separately from its religious nature, the mission of the convent was quite the same as that of an adoption agency.According to the prevailing views of the times, adoption was a viable and humane solution: for the children who would be raised in a well-to-do family with prospects of a better life; for the mothers who would pursue their life unburdened by a child out of wedlock; for the convent who would be able to finance hosting the girls and their children (for up to several years) with the proceeds of adoption fees. But such an explicit justification of the role of the convent is totally absent of Stephen Frears' film.The role of an adoption agency is fraught with moral dilemmas. The wishes of the stakeholders: the child (and the family he may later start), the biological mother (and her family), the adoptive parents (and their families) may be conflicting and may vary over the elapsing decades.Now (in 2022) the conventional wisdom may be that adopted persons have a 'right' to know their origin; but this is by no means morally and juridically obvious. In France, for example, there is a procedure of ''childbirth under X'' (i.e. Under Jane Doe identity) which is irrevocable after a two months retraction period: the mother cannot access future information about her child and the child - in the future - won't have access to information about his or her biological mother. This is certainly quite painful for adoptees, but it may well be the lesser evil.Of course, perceptions of what is morally right do vary over time, and laws are also subject to variations. But these variations create a conundrum for adoption agencies: what if the laws and practices presently enacted are in conflict with the solemn pledges made by the various stakeholding parties at the time of adoption?The nuns of the convent at Roscrea have decided on a radical solution to this conundrum: they have burned their archives! This is a debatable but defensible decision, in line with the respect of their past commitments.Sephen Frears is respectful of the various attitudes which can occur on this sensitive subject. I do not think his movie condemns the convent; but the Martin Sixsmith character definitely does!___ .",

            "content": "Hess's birth mother was Philomena Lee. Lee became pregnant at age 18 at a local carnival by a man named John who worked for the post office. She was then sent to the Sean Ross Abbey, a place for unwed mothers, in Roscrea in Ireland. After she gave birth to Hess, she was able to be with her child until she was 22 and he was three while living in the Abbey. As was common practice in Ireland at the time, the church sold him to a Catholic family in the United States. Lee did not know where her son was sent by the nuns when she left the Abbey after being forced into signing the adoption papers. Hess grew up in the Midwest and was raised in a Catholic family. He graduated from the University of Notre Dame in 1974 and earned a law degree at George Washington University. He made three visits to Ireland to try to find his mother but was unsuccessful in persuading the sisters to divulge any information. He requested that his ashes be buried at the convent where he was born in the hope that his mother would eventually be able to find his grave. Hess never learned who his mother was. In the 2000s, journalist Martin Sixsmith, working with Lee, discovered that Hess was Lee's son. My whole body is still shaking from the anger I feel after watching this film. So typical of a cult like the catholic church to have lied and stolen and profited from selling this lady's child. He did not publicly acknowledge his homosexuality, particularly in his professional life. He died from complications of AIDS, although this was not mentioned at the memorial service held for him. Hess's partner for the last 15 years of his life was Steve Dahllof. Dahllof credited the book The Lost Child of Philomena Lee with \"about a three out of 10, in terms of accuracy\", while the movie Philomena, \"in accuracy of spirit, is 10 out of 10. A must C film.",

A hardened journalist (Steve Coogan) reluctantly joins her quest, won over by her sincerity and by the prospect of acquiring a gripping 'human interest' story. The film is superbly paced and avoids sentimentality. It uses humour but in a subtle manner so that its role in heightening the tragic elements of the plot by contrast is not overbearing. And visually it is highly watchable.Although the story of the horrors inflicted on single mothers by the Catholic Church has been told before, Judi Dench's superb performance (10++) elevates this production to a special plane. It is worth seeing this movie just to be able to see her in action in a part that does justice to her talents. Coogan is also good here (I was less impressed by his efforts in 'What Maisie Knew') though he wobbles just a little in places - but for that I would have scored the movie a 10.Sophie Kennedy Clark must also be mentioned for her totally convincing portrayal of the young Philomena. The scene in which she labours to deliver her child is literally breathtaking.Of its kind, this is top quality cinema.

To begin with, it's just a job for an out-of-work journalist who has lived the high life and is seething over his unjust fall from grace.

(Maybe Bette Davis in NOW VOYAGER or Charlize Theron in MONSTER.)Oddly the American public may still know her best only for M.

            "content": "Director Stephen Frears' latest film deals with some very touchy subject matter, which you wouldn't know when looking at the film's bright yellow poster. Glancing at the poster, one wouldn't immediately guess Philomena deals with an old mother's decade long search for her son who was forcefully adopted while she was a teen, living in an abbey in Ireland. And yet, it's the poster that conveys to the audience what this film is really about. But I'll get to that in a moment.The film is structured in a way that we begin in the present, when Philomena is old, meets down-on-his-luck journalist Martin Sixsmith, who then start their search for her son. We also see some flashbacks to when Philomena's child was taken from her, but the film doesn't deal in Memento-esque time structures nor does it need to. It almost feels like a road trip, following one clue after the other, giving us more context and information each time and all the while Philomena and Martin's relationship develops. Apparently, the entire search for Philomena's son lasted years and years, but a film adaptation obviously doesn't have the time for that, so several facts and events have to be compressed (a necessary tactic in film). This does occasionally make the search feel too short and easy as the next clue is never far away. Claims about a film adaptation applying changes to the source material are as old as the film industry itself and one can usually say these accusations are irrelevant if the film stays true to the spirit of the original work. Now, I haven't read the book so I can't comment on that, but because the film in the end focuses on the developing relationship between Philomena and Martin and thus symbolically between 'all' believers and atheists, I believe the film rises above such criticisms\u0085which brings us to the film's touchy subject matter.Now, on the surface, Philomena deals with a mother's search for her long-lost son. However, because the child was forcefully adopted while the mother was staying at an abbey in Ireland, the film immediately signifies way more than simply a search for the son. Depending on the viewer's dispositions on religion and so forth, red flags might be popping up all over the place. When a film like Philomena starts to inherently deal with issues of atheism and religion, it will probably be in its best interest to present both sides of the debates in an honest and fair way, so as to not scare away half its audience. This is what Francis Ford Coppola did when he wrote the script for Patton. It showed general Patton as a religious man, a passionate and insightful general, but did not shy away from the flaws in his character, such as when he slapped a crying soldier. Not only did this ensure a more nuanced portrayal of Patton, it also ensured that both the, shall we say, Republican crowd and the anti-war crowd would have scenes to emotionally latch onto. In Philomena's case, this automatically becomes much trickier since the Catholics are already on the 'losing' side, so to speak. If the film has anything resembling a villain, it's the Sister who had Philomena's child adopted. It's therefore very easy to accuse the film of anti-Catholicism as has been done by, for example, the New York Post, who slammed it as being \"another hateful and boring attack on Catholics.\" However, I feel the film still emphasizes the good side through Philomena's (Catholic) nature, her ability to see the good in everything, to forgive the nurse for taking her son away from her and lead a generally positive and happy life despite everything that she's experienced.The real strength of the film thus lies in its characters as played by the ever-so-magnificent Judi Dench and (the film's co-writer and co-producer) Steve Coogan and how their relationship develops as seen on the previously mentioned poster. This relationship is, in the end, the film's real focus and answer to the questions of religion and atheism it inherently raises. A film attempting to deal with matters of religion is automatically getting in over its head. A film cannot possibly effectively deal and encompass the various facets of religion and atheism and the endless debates surrounding them. This is why the relationship between Philomena and Martin is so crucial to the film's success, because it represents the possibility of a 'believer' and an atheist becoming friends without letting their personal beliefs and ways of life getting in the way. Thankfully, the film isn't too sugary here. Martin doesn't become a devout Catholic by the film's end nor is there a sappy scene where he explicitly admits that 'well gosh, there must be something good about Catholicism after all.' Philomena's forgiving of the nurse who took her son is contrasted by Martin admitting he could not were he in Philomena's shoes. What I mean to say is that in the end their beliefs do not hinder their relationship nor should they. This reflects (the real) Philomena Lee's claims that Philomena is ultimately a 'good' film (or rather a film about 'good'), despite claims that the film is anti-Republican and anti-Catholic. Responses such as those from the New York Post mirror the risk a film like Philomena carries, though the film makes the wise decision to rise above such endless debates on religion and atheism, focusing instead on Philomena herself and her bond with Martin thus presenting a coming together of sorts between people of a religious nature and atheists.",

A thoroughly interesting story presented with a fantastic conjunction of ideal emotional depth and notable comedy presence provides a brilliant balance of different genres. Despite how negative Steve Coogan's character Martin Sixsmith describes human interest stories; this film is incredibly captivating. As each character goes through their own revelation, we as the audience find them as fascinating and astonishing as if we were experiencing them. Wonderful acting from both lead actors supported by a emphatically harrowing story softened with sophisticated comedy.",

It is an excellent film that addresses a very difficult and sensitive subject without becoming either maudlin or hurling shards of righteousness at its audience. Moreover, there are enough twists and surprises to keep everything moving at a nice pace. For his part, Coogan delivers just the right balance of British elitism and understated wit. He was the exact foil required to compliment Dench's simple, straightforward portrayal of an uncomplicated lady with a very complicated story to tell. As the story progressed, the supporting roles were kept to little more than a series of brief cameos. This created a clean and crisp canvas on which Coogan and Dench give the audience two compelling, outstanding performances I loved this movie.",

These two actors play off each other with equal parts tension and grace. This is Stephen Frear's best film since \"The Grifters;\" very often the film could slide perilously into the maudlin, but he manages to steer the film clear from soggy sentiment and keep the emotion earned. And the film manages to keep its continuous revelations surprising and believable with the well wrought screenplay (with Coogan as one of the co-writers.)Special praise for Robbie Ryan's subtle camera-work.

            "content": "\"Philomena\", inspired by true events is a sincere and harrowing tale, which follows a woman's search for her long lost son, who was taken away from her decades ago after she became pregnant and forced to live in a convent.Every day for 50 years Philomena Lee, a quiet softly spoken dear old lady relives the memories of her first child with much anguish and discomfort.Judi Dench plays Philomena, and although we are used to seeing her in more commanding regal roles or as James Bonds no-nonsense boss 'M', don't be fooled, this is her most complex role to date and her performance is nothing short of sensational and worthy of an Academy award.The film begins with a series of flashbacks, interlaced with close ups of Dench's aging facial features. Each wrinkle adjusts slowly each time Philomena relives an emotion, It's through these scenes that we get a glimpse of Philomena's pain and it is as strong now as it was all those years ago.In the flashbacks, Sophie Kennedy-Clark plays the heavily pregnant young Philomena who is abandoned by her family at Sean Ross Abbey. The nuns are obstructive and damn right mean \"you are the cause of your shame. You and your own indecency\" lectures mother superior, before reluctantly admitting Philomena into their care. Furthermore they refuse any pain relief when Philomena goes into a labour \"The pain is her penance, It will help absolve her of her sin\".Worse yet \u2013 the convent sells the children to wealthy Americans looking to adopt, and after four years of being forced to work in the convent laundry Philomena is helpless as she watches her Anthony being removed from the convent by an American couple.After 50 years of keeping quiet about Anthony, the anniversary of his birth causes Philomena to speak up and share her story. \"I'd like to know what he thought of me\", explains Philomena to reporter Martin Sixsmith \"I've thought about him every day.\" Martin Sixsmith is played Steve Coogan (who also co-wrote the screenplay), He is a well educated former political journalist. Who initially believes human-interest stories are for \"vulnerable, weak-minded, ignorant people\". Nevertheless Sixsmith at his own crossroads can't ignore the potential in this story and invests in the operation of tracking down Philomena's boy.Coogan and Dench's on-screen chemistry is undeniably charming, Coogan is a well known British funny-man, last seen in one of this years best comedies 'Alan Partridge: Alpha Papa' but in this role he takes a comedic backseat to Dench who provides most of the best chuckles and Coogan gives the film the thoughtful and serious balance that is needed.The 'road trip' Philomena and Martin take is full of amusing exchanges with Philomena having a healthy frankness when it comes to discussing sexuality and her constant marveling at the first class lifestyle she's experiencing. It is Martin who has to keep Philomena motivated with the task at hand when she gets side-tracked by the possibility of renting something called \"Big Momma's House\" from the comfort of their hotel room.As with most journeys, you need to come a full circle to get the perspective you're looking for and Martin (And the film itself) does just that. After traveling to the United States we return back to Ireland to the Sean Ross Abbey and it is here where we find our answers.Director Stephen Frears (The Queen) manages to make this sedate tale of a woman searching for her son thought provoking and sensitive but it also takes a cynical glance towards the institutions of journalism, politics and religion. We are reminded once again before the end credits that it is a true story and a remarkable one at that. As Philomena would say this film is \"One in a million\".",

Looking back into time, it seems that when the Roman Catholic Church intended on doing good, they in fact were doing what appears to be the opposite of that, within the eyes of the person which whom the deed was intended to benefit. This movie was a great easy story to follow, but the underlying message appears to be a contemporary one. To me, the underlying message rests in the human soul and what one needs to do in order to survive. Looking back on life from a standpoint of stability and safety, onto a time when ones life was rough and troubled often seems to provide the individual with answers and it is the self stigma or the self judgement which often persecutes the individual far more than societal judgements. This movie presents a cut and dry story of redemption. It was sequenced in a simplified beauty and that is what makes this movie special. I wonder if the filmmaker was Roman Catholic, and I wonder if he himself was adopted, as this is really the story of the filmmaker.",

            "content": "On the whole, I enjoy British films, particularly when set in Scotland and Ireland. This one stars Judy Densch in a role she plays all-too-well and all-too-often which is the main problem I have with her. To me, she is a one-dimensional actress - good - but one-dimensional.The story here has her constantly repenting her life-changing impulse to engage in a one-night stand as a teenager and a a result, became pregnant. Shunned by her parents (father), she is shunted off to a convent/work house run by stereotypical, sexually frustrated, sadistic nuns who work the girls to the bone and then sell their babies off to Americans. To their \"credit\" the sisters allow the girls one hour a day to be with their children, though why allowing this bonding is beyond me. Densch's character's child is eventually adopted out at age three and thus begins her self-flagellation.Advance 50 years and she decides to find her lost child and through a friend enlists the help of out-of-work of an out-of-work journalist who originally feels such an assignment beneath him but comes around soon enough and off they go.A visit to the convent gets them nowhere; the nuns clam up about the whole sordid affair and even try the old all the records were lost in a fire routine. Destroyed is more like it, since it comes out they burned them on purpose - all except for the documents wherein the girls gave up any claim to their children! And then, a miracle! The reporter, whilst doing some internet research, locates a photograph of the missing boy taken ON THE VERY DAY of his arrival in America, along with the names of the adoptive parents and the fact that he has just been adopted FROM IRELAND! Talk about luck. Of course, we are never told who this family was that was so prominent that newsmen would be waiting at the airport to chronicle this event.Moving right along, further web research reveals that the boy, once grown, entered politics and became influential in national politics, particularly as part of Ronald Reagan's inner circle. And (hint) that he is homosexual and that he has since died. Densch then meets an acquaintance of her late son's who confirms that he was homosexual at which time Densch loses the film for me. Nonplussed at this revelation, she instead reveals that she ALWAYS knew he was homosexual because he had been such a \"sensitive\" child. It is at this point, that I believe it is time to read between the lines.Given what we now know of the pederastic proclivities of the Roman clergy, I am certain Philomena suspected if not was positive that her son had been abused (and his adopted sister too). Her character displays all of the characteristics of Catholics who know what's going on but can't bring themselves to deal with it. We later learn that he son had a dicey relationship with his adoptive parents as well and that he either learned that he was adopted from Ireland at age 3 or had recall of being there. It is also assumed that he remained Catholic his entire life and thus was further indoctrinated into homosexuality. Thus, his mother's comment that she \"knew\" he was homosexual from infancy needs to be taken into context. Instead, in my view, it was presented as some sort of evidence that \"a mother always knows\" or that children are indeed \"born that way.\" The ending is indeed incredible. This is not a bad picture just for my money preachy n the wrong way. One odd note was the appearance of Mare Winningham in a cameo as the adult adopted sister. Her character too seemed to insinuate that abuse had taken place for her as well, and that finally, the adoptive parents had rejected them both if not at least the boy.",

It has the ring of truth about it and is played to perfection by all concerned. The tragic story has resonance for many people who are still living with the consequences of the Magdalen Sisters' treatment of unmarried mothers, and these people need to find healing. I hope that this film, with its sensitive approach will help them.Having seen much of the UK TV programme \"Long Lost Family\" where many adopted children find their mothers, and vice versa, I know that this is a real issue for those who were forced to part from their children during times when attitudes were less tolerant.

I am not a huge fan of Steve Coogan, as while conceding that he is a talented writer and comic actor, I have always felt that most of his performances are merely 're-runs' of his first and finest creation \u2013 the infamous Alan Partridge. Everything that Coogan has done since those early days of Alan Partridge to my mind he was still Alan Partridge, and the joke has long since grown somewhat tired. It seems that few, if any critics and reviewers were willing to admit this, maybe for fear of somehow appearing to be un-cool\u0085.Then Philomena came along. Coogan not only co-wrote this brilliantly funny and poignant screenplay, but also provided the performance of his life. If this had been released in a year when there were not so many outstanding candidates for the best actor Oscar, then I am sure he would have been in with a shout. On the face of it, the story seems a bit grim \u2013 and indeed it is. But the screenplay and superlative acting ensures that the movie rises above what might have been just another depressing attack on the scandals of the Catholic church, to the level of something that is a lot more heartening and entertaining. It is the true story of an elderly Irish woman who tries to trace her son who she was forced to give up for adoption by catholic nuns back in the 1950's, when she conceived and delivered out of wedlock. She herself was forced to live at the convent and work in the convent laundry until she became a legal adult. Helping her in this task is Martin Sixsmith, (Coogan), a one-time BBC reporter who became a spin-doctor for the first Labour government before being made a scapegoat and dismissed in disgrace.A disillusioned and cynical Sixsmith somewhat reluctantly takes on the project to help Philomena track down her baby and write the story for an even more hard-bitten magazine editor. The unlikely couple travel to Ireland and then to the USA, and finally back to Ireland in their efforts to track down Philomena's long lost son. The interaction between the 'odd couple' is magical. It is humorous, sad and ultimately enriching as two people from very different worlds and backgrounds join together on a journey of discovery.This is in a world which contains a cruel, narrow-minded and self- righteous church that still functions with impunity, and a world in which someone like Philomena has so much strength from her simple, catholic faith that she seeks no vengeance for what happened to her, and to thousands like her. She simply wants to find her son. Predictably, Sixsmith rails against the terrible injustices. From the opening credits, you never doubt for one second that you are watching real people behaving in real situations and you become totally immersed in their fascinating quest. The film's 98 minutes flash by.Philomena was nominated for Best Picture, Best Actress and Best Screenplay and Best Music, but of course- it didn't win any of them.

Plot: The main character Philomena Lee is banished by her family to the Abbey for committing premarital sex and having a child out of wedlock. In other words stated, I read an account that her family and the nuns started the chain of events that led to Philomena's grueling three year existence at the abbey and the tragic eventual separation between her and her son Anthony Lee (aka Michael Hess-adopted name).Sean Ross Abbey thwarted attempts from Philomena and Michael Hess to find each other during the years. I have read that Michael Hess visited the Abbey on several occasions before he died. There were a very few fleeting scenes in reference to Anthony Lee (aka Michael Hess)sexual orientation and a very few crude sexual remarks which was not necessary in this movie that underlines the infinite bond between mother and child despite time and distance. Instead, the writers and producers could have includes scenes where Michael Hess actually visited the Sean Ross Abbey and talked to key Abbey figures like Sister Hildegarde McNulty who deliberately withheld information from him etc. With his wealth and very powerful political connections, I felt that Michael would have found his mother in a nanosecond than talk to these untruthful persons. Mr. Sixsmith, the BBC reporter, was able to find information on Michael Hess in one week through his connections in Washington D.C. even though he only knew Michael Hess original birth name, birthday, and birthplace! I read that Sister Hildegarde McNulty actually helped former Sean Ross Abbey tenants reunite with their children who were given up for adoption in America. Why did she make an exception with Philomena and Michael? As a result, the Abbey probably never envisioned that their callous mistake of withholding this information from Philomena and Michael would catch up with them and exposed them to the world via a popular book and an award winning movie!

Philomena became a disgrace to her widowed father and was sent away to live with the nuns in their convent. She became a virtually slave in the laundry room with her best friend. Her best friend had a baby girl named Mary and Mary and Anthony were the best of friends. One day, a rich couple came and took Mary but Anthony did not want her to leave.

Michael aka Anthony was buried in the cemetery on the convent grounds along with other young mothers and their infants who died during childbirth.

Maybe the faults I perceive are embedded in the reality of the story of Philomena Lee and Martin Sixsmith and visible only because of the film's unswerving devotion to fact. If true, would that make them not faults? Martin (Steve Coogan) has been sacked, unfairly as he believes, by the BBC and is looking for a doorway back into journalism. Philomena's (Judi Dench) search for her son, born to her 50 years ago in an Irish abbey and taken from her by the sisters, may be his device. The movie is Martin's story - it's based on his book - and he is the POV character; we are never in doubt as to his motives and probable actions, but hers often catch us and Martin off guard, seeming to bubble up from places not visible to us, sometimes more sophisticated and knowledgeable than we expect. We associate Dench with regal characters possessed of boundless determination; in that regard, she is somewhat cast against type here.Martin is actually portrayed as a rather irritating character, a snobbish anti-religious type who is openly disdainful of Philomena's common tastes, her stubborn faith, and her unwillingness to buy into the crusaders-vs.-villains narrative that he needs for his big story. He is also afraid that Philomena doesn't have the requisite zeal and outrage to go on to the end, whereas he must have the big emotional finish, one way or another, to satisfy the editor who is funding this road trip.The film becomes a sort of buddy road-trip movie in which both Martin and Philomena need to contribute their respective talents - sometimes his connections, his detective skills, and his shameless foot-in-the-door manner work best; sometimes her simple genuineness works better.The story moves quickly and contains (presumably as in real life) some satisfying developments, so what am I griping about? Well, part of it has to do with what I see as sort of a mismatch in depth between the cruel history that is exposed and the ongoing plot issues like whether Martin is going to lighten up and stop seething with impatient disdain whenever Philomena orders common fare in a restaurant. I wondered whether Coogan was drawing too much on his experience in comedy, as in \"The Trip\" for example, his other road trip work. I at least also felt the lack of an account of why the perpetrators and cover- uppers acted as they did. Of course maybe Martin never got one,So anyway I didn't come away with any desire to see it again ever, or any zeal about spreading the word about it. But I don't regret seeing it.",

            "content": "I apologize, first off, to the writers, directors, producers and cast of this move because I have never handed out a 10.Dame Judi Dench performed at an Academy Award winning level and then some. The heartbreak, the joy, the faith in God and Church that she had was well presented in this movie.The movie is yet another indictment on the practices of the Roman Catholic Church. Ms. Dench plays the part of an unwed mother from the days when such individuals were treated with hate and hidden away from the public. She is sent to a convent where she is forced to perform slave labor at the hands of cruel nuns. Even worse, when her child is born, she is allowed to be with him for a year or so before new adoptive parents come forward and take him away. A reluctant journalist is assigned the task of investigating a lead and finds himself totally immersed in the circle of deceit and the business of selling children. When his publisher is ready to pull all support for his story, he charges on through to the end. Yes, Philomena does eventually find her son and finds out what had happened to him. But, in the end, he is an AIDS victim who died. He had been a member of the national political community in the United States and even an adviser to President Reagan. After his death, his partner returns his body to be buried in the cemetery of the orphanage- home for unwed mothers from whence he came per his request. To the end, no one in the Church, not even the now decrepit old nun who abused Philomena herself is willing to help. Only her perseverance with the help of her journalist friend brings her to her sons graveside. Mystery solved.Amazingly, throughout the entire film and throughout her life, Philomena keeps her faith in God and the Roman Catholic Church. A very strong faith indeed.A must see film.",

            "content": "PHILOMENA directed by Stephen Frears is a fact-based film, which on the surface might seem like a sentimental \"human interest\" tale, but the impact of one woman's heartrending story and the ramifications on society and its outdated laws and customs loom much larger. Martin Sixsmith (played with a certain cynicism and dashing aplomb by Steve Coogan,) a recently unemployed BBC journalist searching around for a book topic to keep him occupied as well as warding off incipient depression, serendipitously meets the daughter of Philomena Lee who urges him to write about her mother's secret/ silent preoccupation with finding the son that was monstrously wrested from her 50 years earlier. Sixsmith reluctantly agrees and his life is inexorably transformed when he meets Philomena (Phil) Lee, beautifully played by Judi Dench, a wonderful actor able to convey with convincing authenticity a steadfast woman of deep, devotional faith, who at the same time revels in a childlike delight and humor. The two begin a journey into a harrowing past that eventually reveals the present.This is a movie about connections and aberrations; the ineffable bond between mother and child; the clash of cultures, religious beliefs, and individual moral convictions all played out against the background of a devious and powerful system that fosters abuse and corruption, and piously believes in the \"truth\" of their mission.Philomena conceived a son 50 years earlier when she met a handsome lad at a Carnival during a moment of youthful abandon and joy; the teenage Philomena (Sophie Kennedy Clark) is both innocent and seductive, becoming pregnant at 18 years of age - a shameful act in 1952 - whereby she is sent to live in a \"home for unwed mothers\" run by the nuns of the Sacred Heart Convent in Roscrea, Ireland. In this establishment we witness the cruel, manipulation of the adolescent inhabitants who are forced by the rigid, sanctimonious nuns to near servitude, signing away their rights to their offspring - with the \"reward\" of being able to spend one hour a day in physical contact with them. When the children become toddlers they are then \"sold off\" to rich Catholic American tourists. The mothers are agonizingly kept ignorant of their whereabouts. And that is the history of a painful era in Ireland between 1945-1960's in which thousands of infants were placed in homes as \"forced adoptions.\"The conflict between the Church's teachings and the doctrinaire callousness of the nun's brutality is starkly drawn, as is Philomena's own essential humanity and her ability to forgive, when contrasted with Martin Sixsmith's more pragmatic investigative instincts, and his often sardonic wry approach to the idea of theological dogma; nevertheless they make a good team. The \"road trip\" that the two of them undertake to find Philomena's son, and the disclosures that are unearthed, creates an irrevocably poignant bridge between individuals of different class, education, beliefs and temperaments. PHILOMENA addresses issues that I was unaware of; concerns that need to be brought into the glare of light, so that all of us can see with greater clarity, in the hope that the exploitation of women in the name of spiritual \"chastity\" is forever eliminated.",

            "content": "There are not many films these days that bring you to tears by their sheer emotional force as \"Philomena.\" This remarkable film, inspired by a true story, is about an elderly Irish woman of faith who goes searching for the long lost son taken from her 47 years earlier by Catholic nuns at the abbey where she found shelter. It's basically a two-hander with the excellent Steve Coogan (who co-authored the wonderful script) providing an effective thematic counterpoint to Dame Judi's phenomenal acting as Philomena Lee. The amazing thing about this powerful and beautiful film is the way the story is told without becoming maudlin or overly sentimental. In fact, the characters and situations as the plot takes its various turns, are truly wry and funny in a very refreshing way. All of the humor can be attributed to the marvelous screenplay and acting of the stars. Stephen Frears' insightful direction is sheer perfection. I can't say enough praise about Ms. Dench. Without the slightest hint of histrionics or showiness, the sublime Judi Dench gives a performance of such honest and heartfelt emotion that she glows from within. She's subtle and yet shattering. She deserves every award and, not the least of all, the Oscar. If you are not genuinely moved to tears by the story and the exquisite performance by Ms. Dench, you must be made of stone. In the wrong hands, this could be so melodramatic and manipulative. But thanks to Steve Coogan and Jeff Pope's intelligent script, that's not what this movie has on its mind. Go see \"Philomena\" if you want to see a film that will move and surprise you with a rare honesty and integrity.",

            "content": "Where the book has completely different focus, movie is tailored all around its star Judi Dench - a strange re-thinking of the subject, almost like making Dr.Watson main character in movie version of Sherlock Holmes. The elderly veteran (Philomena from the title) is an old Irish lady in search of the son that nuns took away from her long time ago, when she was still one of the infamous laundresses. Movie is basically a odd -couple journey to Washington with Dench being sweet, old fashioned grandmother and journalist (Steve Coogan) acting as director's alter ego, educated, worldly and cynical. Their interaction - not the horrifying, true life story - slowly takes over the movie, with Dench easily stealing our hearts with her good-natured naivety, simpleness and clinging to religion, while journalist watches her with cool detachment of superiority that he thinks his privileged and moneyed status has. While story does pull at viewer's heartstrings and we can't forget this is a true-life story, it does feel a bit condescending and patronizing at moments - it suggests that deep inside, dear old Dench is true heroine and people around her cold-hearted merchants ready to sell her story for a sake of sensationalistic success and profit. As good as Dench is (and she does excellent job of being dowdy sweetheart) her character is too darn meek and forgiving as contrary to cold-hearted Coogan who is at the end filled with righteous anger about injustice of it all. Nuns at the convent have of course not given any reasons or explanations why they behaved they way they did and director is not even interested in showing them as human - though some will accept this point without questioning, personally I find it too black-and- white and one-sided. We came in 21st century not only with decision to close those convents but with enough courage to ask the questions and hear some answers. Stephen Frears manipulates sentiments without giving clerics any voice, except right to be bad guys filled with venom. From the bottom of my atheist heart, I feel this is all wrong, nothing in this world is black and white.",

This distinctive scene gives us a glimpse of the kind of contrasting characters that we are going to see in the rest of the movie. The movie 'Philomena' preaches the nobleness of compassion, redemption and forgiveness through two juxtaposing characters that have different ideologies and principles. Philomena conceives a baby which is considered as a sin by the Convent where she is an inmate. The nuns let her son to be adopted by an American Family. Almost 50 years later, Philomena set out to find her long lost son. It is a story about a mother's quest to find his son with a help of a Journalist. Judi Dench as Philomena brings out the emotions of a mourning mother. Her character stays strong even after the movie ends. Steven Coogan is the typical journo with idealistic notions. While Philomena wants to atone for his lost son, Martin wants to publish this story to get some credit as a journalist. This personal interest from both the ends drives the duo for the long journey. What seemed to have begun with a personal interest, slowly melts on the way and at the end they both care each other for their interest. The duo complements this warm story with fine acting. The editing that was crisp till Philomena finds the destiny of her son, but loose tracks towards the end. So we are bestowed with the dragging feeling. The scenes where Philomena recollects her son were showed in a homemade video mode. It is quite distinctive and adds poignancy to the flashbacks. Though Philomena character is shown as soft-hearted, at the end when she forgives everything just like that is too hard to convince me. The movie is more about a human who possess supreme noble qualities. Thus being said, in the final scene when we should be so stunned and bowled over by the protagonist for her virtuousness, we get the feeling, Is that all?For more reviews: vanijay.wordpress.com",

Fifty years later, on the birthday of a son she didn't plan to have, but didn't want to lose, her grief and upset leads to a series of events in which an unknowing daughter's chance meeting with journalist, Martin Sixsmith, leads to a potential story and an unlikely friendship in a quest to find the woman's long-lost son. The Philomena of the film's title is played by superbly Judi Dench, who brings not only a quiet charm, but genuine humour, compassion and understanding to a wholly realised character. More cynical, and embittered, is the journalist, played by Steve Coogan, who produced the film and wrote its first-class screenplay. At first, their relationship is built entirely on necessity and a mutual understanding, but with this comes trust and empathy as they undertake a more subtle equivalent of a road movie, as Philomena and Sixsmith put together the pieces of a puzzle they hope will lead to her son. With a narrative that never faulters, and truly excellent performances, Philomena doesn't offer easy answers or pat resolutions, whilst the central characters are both intelligent and hugely endearing. Their exchanges proving enlightening, very compelling and often funny, despite the serious nature of the narrative and genuine issues being discussed. Especially those pertaining to the culture of slave labour, abuse and adoption at the hands of the Catholic nuns during the 1950s. This is dealt with without clich\u00e9 or creating caricature, simply telling a fascinating story well.",

Judi Dench is a believable older woman who has always wondered for the last fifty years what had happened to her son who was adopted (sold) from the convent by a couple for 1000 pounds. I became very tearful at one point unexpectedly.For Philomena,the ending was not what she had hoped for.However the story is still written by the journalist accompanying her,with her permission. This is a true story based on a newspaper article.

            "content": "\"Philomena\" is the story of a woman who wishes to discover something of the son that she has not seen in fifty years.Some have charged that \"Philomena\" is an anti-Catholic picture. I can appreciate how certain persons, who are admiring of the Catholic Church, would wish to defend its reputation. On the other hand, in my view, the identification of either an institutional or personal evil is an opportunity for reflection and, if possible, reconciliation. The raising of defenses is not a credible response.What I found interesting about \"Philomena\" was the contrast between its two chief characters. Martin Sixsmith, who assists Philomena in the search for her son, is baffled by the need Philomena feels to confess her sins. Full of indignation, Sixsmith tells Philomena that it is the Church which should be confessing its sins: \"Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned,\" he mocks. \"I incarcerated a load of young women against their will, used them for slave labour, and then sold their babies to the highest bidder.\"It becomes apparent, though, that however passive and deferential Philomena might seem, she possesses something that Sixsmith does not. It is Philomena who has struggled and who has chosen to forgive those who have caused her hurt and this confuses Sixsmith. Against deficits he perceives in Philomena, it seems one of his own actually emerges through his experience of Philomena. Though burdened by a sad past, it is Philomena who has the ability to find peace through forgiveness. Burdened also, as a result of his own public disgrace, it is not apparent that Sixsmith recognizes how forgiveness and peace intertwine.This is my first reaction that I have submitted to IMDb.",

Because it has so many twists and turns that will completely surprise you, I won't spoil the outcome. (Tissues may be required.) The story begins with Philomena's encounter with a young man at a fair, with whom she has sex. As a result of her encounter, she becomes pregnant. Her family sends her away to Sean Ross Abbey in Ireland, where she gives birth at a convent that houses young girls who are pregnant out of wedlock.During her time there, Philomena endures the harshness of working seven days a week and the constant condemnation of the nuns for her sexual indiscretion. Eventually, her young son and another baby girl are adopted by a family. For 50 years, she has kept the secret of what happened to her, even though she eventually married and had other children. In her mind, it was a sin to have given birth out of wedlock and a sin to have kept it secret for 50 years. She can't decide which is the worse of the two.A journalist, Martin Sixsmith, decides to do a human interest story about Philomena's experience and search for her son. Her own attempts to find out what happened to him have been unfruitful, but with his journalist connections he is able to help her discover his whereabouts. They continue their search in Washington, D.C. It is here, that the story begins to surprise and shock its audience, but it culminates in a discovery you don't see coming.The movie is filled with themes, mostly around faith, guilt, regrets, unconditional love, and the ability to forgive the cruelty of the sisters' actions. Unfortunately, Philomena is a woman driven by guilt of sins past and those present, which have been placed upon her by the church. Martin is a man who doesn't believe in God or understands the reasoning of the Catholic faith, and he often clashes with her beliefs.The true story is also a very sad commentary of the practices of this particular Catholic abbey regarding their own lack of compassion and secrets. From 1930 to 1970 they housed pregnant, unwed mothers, buried the ones who died in childbirth from poor care, sold babies, and continued to make the girls pay for their transgressions with heartless treatment and hard work. In the end, it was a story that had to be told.Judi Dench is wonderful, of course. She was nominated for best actress multiple times for this movie, and the winner of multiple awards. Steve Coogan humorously portrayed the journalist, along with his cynicism over religion and the church. At times, you chuckled over some of his comments and the sparring between Philomena and himself.All in all, it's quite a good movie.",

Well, I guess the Oscars could only come up with 8 solid nominees for best picture and thought throwing a bone to a British movie would make the Academy seem so much more sophisticated. Luckily the English Meryl Streep just happened to have a new movie out in 2013, and like her American counterpart the Academy just can't help itself with automatic nominations for just about anything either of those two do on screen. Judi Dench was solid, just like she is in almost everything she does. But that's my problem, her acting just felt way too familiar. I want to see an actor stretch a bit before getting an automatic nomination.Philomena is a decent movie, but should have been much better. The movie suffered by only dipping a toe into the disturbing history of the Catholic Church shaming unwed mothers and selling their babies.

The problem is it's nowhere near a good example. In the end she decides that the story of her life should be published which obviously is the only right choice, but the sole fact of doubting it wrong. Just the same as we would not want any pedophilia case to be covered, we would not want the same to happen with practices from this movie that involved conscious murder by negligence (at childbirth and others), human trafficking, virtually slavery, covering up all of these, which relates not only to the past, but also to the present part of the film's storyline. For every such incident that will successfully get covered, another one will be enabled somewhere else. Just the same as the recent exposing of sexual harassment leads to less incidence of it in the future.\nAlso, let's remember it's far from only about Philomena. She has no right to make a decision about tens of women and children only by herself. She's only one of many. What happened there is a wide practice regarding multiple individuals, including many who cannot make a decision for themselves (about potential forgiveness), because their dead and even if all would, it's still a matter of state interest, because it's about the TRUTH and PREVENTION.",

On the surface, it seems a manipulative film aiming to pull at your heartstrings - but although there are definitely moments of sentimentality - it is also an enjoyable comedic and dramatic ride into the telling of personal and true story of Philomena Lee.The plot line is only fundamental to the charm of the film; the pacing is good and never seems to be over-dramatic. Philomena's humour and its heart is the most captivating aspect, and there are some funny moments that had me laughing (to the point that people started staring at me). The screenplay gives both Judi Dench and Steve Coogan the opportunities to exhibit their talents not necessarily in words, but also in expressions. Coogan gives a fantastic dramatic performance, and Dench - dramatically is excellent, but comedically - gives this film some real heart. The awkward juxtaposition of their characters, between an Irish Catholic woman and a cynical atheist man, has this odd chemistry that wrings out how such different people can coexist on such contrasting beliefs on the world. You relate on some levels with Coogan's character, but on the other hand - you also understand Dench's character's optimism.Alexandre Desplat's score in film is just excellent, nothing to be critically acclaimed - but it pulsates in the right moments of emotional heartfelt and even in shots of a car traveling down the countryside. The memory flashbacks are probably the main problem I had with the film - they are the most over-sentimental part of the film... with the constant replaying of scenes, which eventually feels manipulatively used to create some sniffles in the audience. Nevertheless, the film pulls out of these bait memories through the chemistry between Coogan and Dench's characters.Philomena is a pleasant surprise - with its comical moments and emotional heart -- both Coogan and Dench's performances make this film an easy delight to watch.",

It's that good (and infectiously catchy).So, the characters in this movie were an...interesting group to watch. The nuns...were just cruel and evil. Why....just why are you going to be so mean? One thing I really enjoyed was that the movie had these great argument pieces between the two leads, mainly due to religious differences. It showed that nobody was right in the argument. That was wonderful! There was also, at first, nobody to blame in the present for Philomena's heartache of losing her son. It was just the two leads looking for answers, each with different goals in mind (the man wanting to write a book about her by any means, since he's unemployed). That was great since it wasn't a clique good vs evil story. However, the film quickly took a 180 degree turn as it turns out, there was someone to blame! (THOSE NUNS!!!). Now it's a clique good vs evil story!SPOILER ALERT!Okay, so Philomena's son tries to find his real mom, but the nun tells him that Philomena abandoned him as a child (LIES!). And Philomena later forgives the nun anyways! (which is a shame since I really wanted to see her absolutely lose it). Man did that makes me feel furious!There was the problem of Philomena's indecisive nature in the film. \"I want the book published.\" (4 minutes later) \"Nevermind, I don't want the book published.\"\"I want to go!\" (2 minutes later) \"I really want to stay!\"That got a little annoying.

By this point of view, just high-technical movies or just romantic movies or so may gain a good score like 7 but not more as the are not perfect and one aspect affects the value of the entire movie.But, in Philomena all the factors are equivalently and harmonically helping the flow of the story. The story is inspired by a true story and based on a book, but really well adapted for motion picture and very beautifully accented on the points and facts that either the writer or the director needed to declare. Mixed with the magical touch of Judi Dench and all the cast and a great editing which makes you follow every second of the movie just like you are watching a super-action movie like Mission Impossible, the finale surprises you that much that you just feel like a nice orgasm!! All the movie, besides being interested in the main story about Philomena and her son, you just want to follow the battle between religion and blasphemy and what a glorious result! Humanity wins, the old, not-well-educated, victimized, must-be-angry, catholic woman who has recently found serious doubts in her beliefs; after all proves that is a good human being and succeeds the evil(!) nuns and Incredulous reporter and makes all of them feel ashamed and shocked by her wise, well-thought and not-emotional forgiveness.Philomena is surely one of the best movies of 2013 and one of the shiny diamonds of the British Cinema treasure.",

I agree that they could have allowed us to stay in the moments a bit longer and feel the emotion a bit more. However, it was overall very well done and the fact that Philomena shared her forgiveness with the nuns is a testament to Catholics everywhere. The rest of us are still mad.",

I am not quite sure these two events are unrelated! There are very many reasons that the world would be a better place without the medieval, life-stealing stupidity of following the stone-age thinking brewed up in our brutal past and Philomena's story is yet another strong argument that Belief with a capitol B is so much more trouble than it's worth.I mean, really, who apart from Stone-Age grunting pseudo-ape men in a violent and misogynistic past could dream up such errant nonsense that having sex outside an invisible friend sponsored liaison is a Sin? A big fat Sin, as well, more dreadful and morally harmful, if the nasty nuns are to be believed, than almost anything. The Sin of being an unmarried mother in Ireland in 1951 was seen as so very bad it was used to justify all manner of abhorrent treatment. Philomena and other girls in this situation were effectively incarcerated - a supposedly benevolent act - in return for allowing them to have their sinful babies, keeping mother and babies hidden away from society until the children could be adopted. The vicious bullies who did this, sisters of Christ, justified their pernicious nastiness, like so many other despicable acts in the history of humans, through reference to the Good Book. And this grievous crime is the plot driver for this gentle and thoughtful adventure in redemption. Cynical, grizzled journalist Martin Sixsmith, ignominiously sacked by New Labour as the besieged minister Stephen Byers tries to save his own hide, decides tell Philomena's human interest story some fifty years after her baby was taken to America by adoptive parents. Martin and Philomena go on the trail of her son and very soon it becomes clear that the Catholic Church's appalling behaviour did not stop at the selling of babies to Americans. Steve Coogan gives a brilliantly unstated performance as Sixsmith, a character fizzing with his own anger and bitterness, far more it turns out that the much more traumatically treated Philomena. Judi Dench delivers a down-to-earth believability in Philomena that never has you questioning her character's working class Irish heritage. Sixsmith's intellectualism is no match for the simple power of a mother robbed of her son and when the time comes it is he who is not able to forgive the authorities for treating her so badly.A powerful argument for humanity over dogma, for hope and redemption over bitterness and anger. In the end Philomena's capacity to forgive, drawn as it is from the simplicity of her still unquestioned faith, despite the horror dished out to her by the church, is more than a match for Sixsmith's supercillious, often arrogant zeal. Whilst she learns the fate of her son, the cynical journalist, far to clever for his own good, is humbled by her quiet nobility to doing the right thing by her.**** (Four Stars)",

And the part of the Republican Party anti-gay politics is so true. I was really enthralled by the story and the strong performances by the entire cast. The Church really needs to come clean with all its appalling practices of the past and actually beg its constituents for forgiveness. Some of whom, like Philomena, will probably grant it.",

Nonetheless, the heroic efforts of mother and son to find each other is wonderfully chronicled with sincerity and humor giving this film an unforgettable poignancy.The cast is superb starting with Judy Dench. She brings depth to every role I have seen her in. She really makes you believe she is indeed that character she is playing. Steve Coogan is surprising good. His transition from comedian to actor is very successful. It reminds me of the chemistry Judy Dench had with Billy Connolly in Mrs. Brown. The rest of the actors were all well cast and Stephen Frears' direction was subtle and masterful. I highly recommend this film.",

            "content": "\"What if he was a drug addict Martin, or\u0085 what if he was obese? I watched this documentary that said a lot of Americans are huge \u2013 what if that's happened to him?\" The quote above is one of many questions that Philomena Lee (Judi Dench) wants to be answered from her long-lost son, Anthony. After 50 years, the Irish middle-aged woman decides to tell everybody, including her daughter, that she has another son whom she doesn't even know where his whereabouts.First I just want to say that any movie that highlight the connection between a mother and her children always has the potential to be a sweet tear-jerker. Because I believe that every mother have a magical connection with their children, for they have held the babies in their stomachs for nine months and give birth, even deal with the pain that I can't even imagine.Anyway, Philomena is one of these mother-children films, and I can say that it is a good one. And Judi Dench, who plays the role of Philomena, has successfully portrayed her as a lovely, gentle and religious mother by her amazing acting skills.The story itself tells about the search of Philomena's son, Anthony, with the help from a retired journalist, Martin Sixsmith. I always love any story which has journalist as the main character because I'm a journalist and I think it's an awesome job and many great films are inspired by journalist stories.The calamity of Philomena starts when she was a teenage and becomes pregnant out-of-wedlock. In Ireland, unmarried sex is a sin and she must spend some years working in a convent as her punishment. Most of the nuns are cruel and Philomena has only one hour to visit her son. One day, a young couple from America come to the convent and the head nun who is meretricious, Sister Hildegarde, sold Anthony. Philomena is so shocked and screams painfully because her son is taken away in front of her eyes and she can do nothing.Steve Coogan did a good job in this film (he also co-write the screenplay), portraying a former journalist who still has rebellious and critical thinking. The interesting part for me is how Martin, an atheist and cynic, changed after spending some times with the religious and kindhearted old woman.However, my heart breaks when Philomena finds that Anthony is already dead years ago. I really want to hug Judi Dench, or Philomena that time. She's been dealing with the pain and shame for 50 years because she is a religious and devoted old lady. And after she gets the courage, the truth is really poignant and makes me cried.And who deserves the most blame? It's the wicked nun! I think Sister Hildegarde has done a very big crime: separates a mother from her son and hides the truth, even after Anthony finally tries to find his real mother and asks Hildegarde himself. How come a servant of God does such things? I thought that Philomena would be so angry about this. But I was stunned that she could forgive the unforgivable. Watching this movie took me where I did not expect to go. For me, who is lucky enough to get raised by a lovely mother, this movie is a great reminder to be grateful and cherish every moment I have with my mom. Thanks Judi Dench, for depicting Philomena perfectly.",

What an amazing lifetime of work from this incredible woman (I first saw her at Stratford, playing Desdemona). No doubt terrible wrongs were done by \"The Church\" in its day but I find myself concerned with the acceptance of \"all things catholic/organized church is bad\" a little hard to take (watch the short lived Single Handed series for more on church abuse) They were of their era, and how quickly we forget social mores -- you truly cannot judge without knowing the social environment of the times. I'm definitely not religious, and in fact hold organized religion at fault for so much of the world's ills but movies really need to find an even hand in representing social mores and truth.Long may Dame Judi reign!I believe the movie achieved its goals of telling a real story, tastefully and well. And I loved the sub-plot of Steve Coogan: in a number of ways this was the icing on the cake.

Philomena defines by her sincerity, her hope and her earnest faith in god. She consistently practices love and forgiveness. On the other side, Sixsmith becomes an educated atheist which resents, even hates church. They both trying to unfold the truth confronting with judging self righteous nuns. The balanced weight of each forces makes the story more real, no one is absolutely correct, still each of them has a golden moment in the movie. \"Do you believe in God?\" she asks him. He replies, \"I've always thought that was a difficult question to give a simple answer to.\" Then he lobs the question back at her. \"Do you?\" he says. Her reply? \"Yes.\" When she quotes Jesus words from John 20:29, \"Blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed,\" he spits, \"Hooray for blind faith and ignorance.\" Philomena's crowning moment of grace involves her telling the cruel and heartlessly legalistic (and still unrepentant) nun who misused her all those years ago, \"I want you to know, I forgive you.\" Sixsmith is predictably aghast and asks how she could do that so easily. Philomena replies, \"Who said it was easy?\" Then she proclaims, \"But I don't want to hate people. I don't want to be like you.\" Another scary comment in the movie is the one nun says \"Jesus is my judge not one like you\", that was a shocking moment for me, when you see what a solid following of the religion can do to the people, make them self righteous. Ir was a great movie, underrated, and worthy to be talked about much more. It has a lot of brilliant scenes.",

But the nuns and priests who ran the laundries were keeping a secret that was far more shameful than illegitimacy even in 1950s Ireland: taking money from American Catholic couples for the babies of the unmarried mothers. They were running baby farms.\n\nThe desolation of the young Philomena (played superbly by Sophie Kennedy Clark) and the other girls forced to work seven days a week in Dickensian conditions in the laundry is gut-wrenching. And Judi Dench as the older Philomena has the remarkable ability to evoke an extraordinary depth of emotion just by staring into the middle distance.\n\nSteve Coogan, who co-wrote and produced the film, may have reprised the character since, but here he leaves his comedic turn as Alan Partridge firmly behind playing Martin Sixsmith, the former New Labour political advisor who was sacked over smear allegations and a leaked email, from whose book the film was adapted. Returning to work as a freelance journalist, Sixsmith happens upon Philomena's story, and takes her to America to search for her missing child.\n\nHaving sex out of wedlock is still considered a mortal sin by the Catholic church, but the mental and physical cruelty metered out by the nuns in the Magdalene laundries, and the selling of the girls' babies as their penance was reprehensible; a shame that will rightly haunt the church until the last mother has been reunited with (or at least discovers what happened to) their child.\n\nThe pain inflicted of the young unmarried girls \u2013 one who died in childbirth and was buried in the grounds was just 14 years old \u2013 is unfathomable and unforgivable. However, despite the seriousness of the subject matter and the depth of emotion is evokes, there's a lightness of touch to the script that never once resorts to being mawkish.\n\n\nSTREAM OR SKIP IT Rating: \ud83d\ude01 Outstanding. Adapted from Martin Sixsmith's book, The Lost Child of Philomena Lee, the BAFTA winner of Best Adapted Screenplay is a definite must-see.",

That really comes down to Philomena herself.  Not just how wonderfully she is played by Judi Dench, but how great the real life character is.  Despite all that has happened to her, she keeps her faith and optimism, and that is truly the spirit of the film.  Also, she's just a godamn delight of a human being and truly funny.

This film is a prime example of the genre as it succeeds due to a winning screenplay and two complex, nuanced performers that are sure to move audiences. While I have never considered Stephen Frears to be a \u2018great' director he knew to keep this film fairly short and let the actors do all the work.\n\nJournalist Martin Sixsmith, Steve Coogan, has been unceremoniously ousted from the BBC and feels depressed as he is not sure which career to pursue. He eventually decides to write a human interest story about Philomena Lee, Judi Dench, who became pregnant at a young age and was forced into a nunnery by her family where she gave birth to her child, Anthony. She was forced to do labor for free in order to get out and her son was given to an American family to be adopted against her will. The nuns stonewall all of Lee's attempts to find out about her son and the two later learn that they burnt all documentation of the adoption. Fortunately Sixsmith has contacts in the United States that help them track down her son. Sadly all is not what it seems but a close relationship does form between Sixsmith and Lee that helps both of them to grow as people.\n\nDench is stellar in the leading role as she blends the quirks of a cute old lady with the emotional depths of some of her more serious roles in A Room with a View (1985) and Iris (2001). All of this adds up to emotional devastation for the audience as we feel an intense rush of sympathy for this lovely older woman who has faced so much in her life and yet is willing to forgive those responsible for her suffering. She is matched by Coogan who, while he has the less emotional role, embodies his character perfectly with his typical biting wit and an unexpected touch of sadness. Together they are utterly charming as Dench recounts the plots of ludicrous romance novels to him while he remains politely disinterested before finally giving over to her deceptively strong will.\n\nThe film is also able to target an incredibly scary issue as uneducated young women find themselves pregnant with no support system and have all of their options removed in favor of being exploited by a tyrannical religious organization. Yes, the nuns can seem a bit broad strokes at times but the justifications they present are those that real figures responsible for similar problems have provided and the self righteousness with which they speak makes them almost pitiable as they are unaware of how cruel they are. Contrary to what some believe the film is not anti-religion as the main character retains her religious principles by being forgiving of others for their \u2018sins' and the villains are condemned not because they are religious but because they took a child away from his vulnerable mother and then used her for their purposes. You feel angry that this happened at the end of the film but also uplifted as while Lee lived a tragic life she remained friendly to those around her and has not lost her ability to forgive.\n\nThe film's screenplay should have won the Best Adapted Screenplay Academy Award because it's witty, warm and capable of dealing with serious issues at once. 12 Years a Slave (2013), the Best Picture and Best Adapted Screenplay winner, was a film that I had significant issues with in terms of it's writing and I think it's \u2018weighty' themes may have helped it more than it deserved.

The whole affair is a subtle and deep study of the human nature, of its ugly and evil and beautiful sides.

If the script is a let down, then Stephen Frears saves it brilliantly through its amazing execution skills that doesn't fail to impress the audience. Judi Dench stands alone on performance in here as she is the core strength and the highlight of the feature despite of Steve Coogan's decent act.

            "content": "SCOTT: (Dr. Scott Allison, Professor of Psychology, University of Richmond) Greg, we just saw Philomena, yet another movie this year that is  inspired by a true events. \n\nGREG: (Greg Smith, Founder of Agile Writers of Richmond, VA) It seems as though Judi Dench can portray almost anyone. Lets recap.\n\nSCOTT: We meet an elderly Irish woman named Philomena (Judi Dench), who had a son while she was a young teen. Her family was so ashamed that they sent her to a Catholic convent where she worked seven days a week and was only allowed to see her son one hour a day. One day the convent gave her son to adoptive parents without allowing Philomena to say goodbye to him. Fifty years have passed since this painful day, and now Philomena wants to find out what happened to her son.\n\nGREG: The trail leads to America where Philomena and investigative reporter Martin (Steve Coogan) fly to find the adult son. Philomena has been thinking about him for 50 years and is worried that he might be homeless, or sick, or God forbid, obese. What happens next is an amusing fish out of water story as Martin and Phil traverse America in search of her long lost son.\n\nSCOTT: Greg, Philomena is a charming story that chronicles two different hero journeys. First, there is the tale of a woman searching for a big chunk of her missing past. She s looking to recover this missing quality and we, the audience, derive great satisfaction seeing her handle both triumph and setback as her story unfolds. But there is an equally interesting story of a journalist, Martin, who is also looking to recover from a serious blow to his career. He believes that pursuing Philomena s  human interest story  is the means to restoring his professional dignity but he discovers that the story carries more personal weight than he ever could have imagined.  Both of these hero journeys contain enough surprises and intrigue to keep us keenly interested throughout the movie s 98 minute running time.\n\nGREG: True enough, Scott. Martin is a confirmed atheist, having rejected the Catholic church. He is a constant contrast to Philomena s steadfast faith. Despite all the nuns did to her and the pain they caused by taking her son from her, she never wavers in the power of her beliefs. There are a couple of missteps in an otherwise fine screenplay. One involves Mare Winningham who gets star credit for a single scene where she plays the grown sister to Philomena s lost son. The scene adds little to the movie and the sister seems to have lost interest in her  brother  and her Irish roots. It s a bit confusing.\n\nSCOTT: At first, we have trouble taking the character of Philomena very seriously. She initially comes across as na ve and ditsy. But as her story unfolds, we begin to appreciate some hidden heft to her character. She ends up showing more maturity and grace in the face of adversity than we could have imagined. And we see her embodying Christian ideals far better than the Catholic nuns who mistreated her for years. Her hero journey is a delight to watch, and it is captured nicely in Martin s recitation of a T.S. Elliot quote about finally coming home but seeing home in a fresh new way. Martin s hero journey is less settled but no less interesting. He believes that his atheistic perspective gives him greater clarity but the movie suggests that this clarity comes with a price. There is much food for thought about how Martin s life will be changed by this experience.\n\nGREG: Scott, Philomena is a non-traditional buddy story.  I was captivated from the start. Dame Judi Dench does not disappoint. She has created a complex character full of life, and whimsy yet still wise. I enjoyed this movie and give it 4 out of 5 Reels. The two-handed hero s journey intertwined these characters and gave those with and without faith an opportunity to look at the world through the other s eyes. I give our heroes 4 out of 5 Heroes. Movie:   Hero: \n\nSCOTT: Greg, I agree with you that Philomena offers a unique dual-hero journey that compels its audience to think deeply about issues of faith, ethics, family, and conscience. There is a rare wisdom in this movie that moved me and challenged me to re-think my perspectives on religion, secularism, and life in general. Like you, I award this movie 4 out of 5 Reels. But I m going to bump up the hero rating to 5 out of 5.  Philomena s hero journey is wonderful to behold. She is no doubt forever changed by her experience and we can see a lovely transformation of understanding, compassion, and wisdom in her character. Juxtaposed with this is the more uncertain hero s journey of Martin, who is affected in profound ways by the journey but one gets the feeling that unlike Philomena, Martin has a lot more processing to do to truly appreciate what has happened to him, and to them both. These two very different hero journeys, and how they are intertwined, impressed me greatly.  Hence the full 5 out of 5 hero rating. Movie:  Hero:",

I wanted to go back to this movie because I remember going across this only for the fact that Steve Coogan co-wrote this movie, and the only film that I've seen besides this that he wrote was Alan Partridge: Alpha Papa, and I had a great time with that film. So with this film, I enjoyed it even more. Judi Dench and Steve Coogan are fantastic in this as it's interesting to see them work together, I like how restraint Steve Coogan can be when dealing with Judi Dench's character at some points of what she says. The writing by Steve Coogan and Jeff Pope is well-written that understand how to make the mystery interesting with some effective drama, while also putting humor that came mostly from Judi Dench's character that are really funny. The chemistry between the two leads is really good that they really want to know where the son is, and when they know the news about Philomena's son, they both show a way that makes them emotionally, but in totally different ways. At times I didn't even know whether the footages that it has are real or not because the quality of them felt genuine that I wasn't quite sure about its legitimacy. Philomena is a fantastic film that I was glad it was recognized.",

            "content": "In a quest to face her past and find her lost son, Philomena continues to believe in God. A true story that allows the clash between beliefs, classes and morals. The movie Philomena (2013) directed by Stephan Frears, starring Judi Dench and Steve Coogan, tells us the story of Philomena Lee, an Irish old lady who was strained to work in the Magdalene asylum due to pregnancy out of wedlock by the catholic church in 1952. Then, Lee was forced to put her son, Anthony, into adoption. She encounters an unemployed journalist, Martin Sixsmith, who agrees to help her find her son and then publish her story. After fifty years, what do they expect to find? The purpose of the journey to uncover the hearts of the mothers similar to Philomena, who suffered to \"atone their sins\" with the loss of their children. The director Stephan Fears presentation that evoked the emotions of the viewer in addition to the acting abilities of Dench and Coogan have illuminated the story of a mother and child in an emotionally magnificent way. Despite the difference in origin and time, the viewers are put in a situation to question the beliefs of modernism. \n\u00a0Before looking at the form of the film, one would look at the context of the film. The story exposed a form of oppression against teenage mothers with excuses of following the will of the bible. However, this oppression has provided for churches an income to stay by putting children for adoption for a certain price. Nowadays, this treatment has faded to the ground due to the lack in God's existence in people. Strangely even after leaving the church for many years, the protagonist (Philomena) continued to treat the nuns in the catholic church of Sean Ross Abby well, which showed great devote to the God and Jesus. Judi Dench's portrayal of this honest and religiously devote woman was superb, with elements of good emotional expression and tone.\u00a0 On the other hand, the character of Martin opposed that of Philomena. He believed that what the church did was unforgiveable and needs to be address. This character presented the audience's emotions from now then regarding the church's actions towards Philomena and her son. The film did not present complex cinematic techniques the simplicity of the techniques mimicked the subtle air surrounding the film as a whole.\nFor Philomena, the significance was both in the words being spoken, since the film was dialogue-heavy, and in facial expression in particular the focus seemed to be on the expression of the eyes. This meant that throughout the film there were a lot of close-ups focusing on the character's face and body within the shot. these techniques were very simple, moreover, the intent was very obvious: watch this person's face. This is because a person's face will tell us a lot more about what the characters thinking and feeling than what can be said during the dialogue. Another thing to appreciate in the presentation of the film is the static look of the movie. there were lots of moments where the audience is staring at a car driving down the road or people walking along. Nothing too complicated.\nA great example of this is when the movie portrayed the oppression and the prejudice that occurred in the catholic church. the cinematography was nothing too extraordinary; the scene was taken with polished angles and the lighting was dimmed. This set the gloomy atmosphere that the film was portraying. This style of cinematography was done to try to mimic reality in order to capture the emotions of the audience. In addition, the film was not told chronologically, it was edited using flashbacks and the home videos to represent what has happened in the past. the film was color-corrected to present the struggles and emotions through less-saturation.\nPhilomena goes for some gags, but at the center of the movie lies a powerful drama. While the film has a sentimental feel that according to the words of Sixsmith 'weak-minded, vulnerable ignorant people\" it also builds into a striking and surprising contemplation on the dilemma of religious belief.",

These 'fallen women' were forced into convents which were run like work houses in order for them 'to cleanse their sins'. Many were in their early teens and most never saw their children again after adoption. This film concerns the search by one such mother,Philomena, who along with a journalist sets out to find the son she hasn't seen in nearly 50 years.\rJudi Dench plays the title character and her performance is a class act. She gives an effortlessly briliiant and believable portrayal of this tortured, but hopeful woman. She is an actress to whom her art just seems to come naturally and she is again at the top of her game. Steve Coogan is also very good as the journalist and he can take another bow for co-authoring the richly textured screenplay. Whilst the writing tackles serious issues it still manages to tap into some wonderful humour in the midst of this desperately sad situation. The film, though, is certainly never mawkish, but it is at times genuinely affecting. In fact, the only thing that comes out bad here is the light shining on the Catholic Church.",

The male v female roles are well worn but well played here, and the Judy Dench character stays true to form, and the male character, so initially smug and self-assured, comes to learn something from the \"less intelligent, religious, faith-based\" character that reminded me of the great comedies of the 40's and 50's (e.g., Hepburn & Tracey; Grant & Hepburn, etc) except here there is no romance, just life and character.

The movie chronicles the story of Philomena's quest in search of her long lost son which travels all the way across the ocean to different countries. And again this incredible story ended in the hands of a great director. The director Stephen Fears just put some magic spell on the story and it became a soulful movie with the fine support from his cast and crew.\r The movie was just like I wanted. From each level of the story, it surprised with the beautiful turning points. It was a single movie, but I felt I saw part by part, chapter after another with detailed information. 'Philomena' is phenomenal movie of the year. The depth of emotions can be felt through our heart, very touching story. An inspiring movie for other mothers who are still looking for their lost children. One should never lose his 'hope', it can be used as a powerful weapon to discover what had you lost.\r I had seen plenty of nature documentaries about a mother and love towards her kids. It might be a polar bear from Arctic or a penguin from Antarctic they all fight for their little ones and ready to give her own life when it matters. In this movie Philomena's (Judi Dench) child was taken away from her under some tough circumstances. She kept it secret in her sealed lip but never stopped to look for him. She waited for 50 year-long, finally with the help of a former BBC journalist, Martin Sixsmith (Steve Coogan), she succeeds to follow the tracks. Whether the mother and son unite or not is the movie's end.\r As far I know the best ever performance by Steve Coogan. This movie definitely will boost his confidence for his future project and also will help his professional graph go upwards. Never doubted the James Bond lady (M), Judi Dench as Philomena. Her experience came to very useful to shape up this movie well. Never could have been this much exciting the movie without these two along with the director. Hope they all join hands together for another project in the near future.\r 9.5/10",

As parents of a young child ourselves, my wife and I (both writers) were moved by the story of the out of work London political journalist who becomes intrigued by the story of an aging Irish mother looking for her long-lost child...given up for adoption? sold to the highest bidder? It's all based on a true story, which makes the conclusion that much more heart-rending. The story reminded me of a parallel reality in which for decades, Israeli doctors and hospitals acquired babies and young children by the most nefarious means to provide to wealthy American Jewish families who couldn't produce children of their own. While this film is often dark, there is plenty of levity as well, and we both left the theatre thought-provoked, entertained and satisfied at an hour and a half well-spent. Indeed, when I got home I wanted to Tweet Steve Coogan, whom I had only known as a comedic actor, to congratulate him on his choice of role and his work as the film's producer (turns out while he has an account, Coogan is not yet active). Kudos are due to director Stephen Frears, who has long been in the small coterie of my favorite indie filmmakers, especially since his films \"The Hit,\" \"My Beautiful Laundrette\" and \"Sammy and Rosie Get Laid.\"",

As a result, the nuns at her church took her child away and sold him, along with many others, to adoptive parents. Now on a quest to find her son with journalist Martin Sixsmith (Steve Coogan), Philomena is a truly affirmative, moving, and well-constructed true story.\r Often times true stories can slack a bit in terms of pace and interest, simply because you can see the way in which the director is constrained and forced to stay to the story. Philomena certainly does not showcase any of this. Instead, director Stephen Frears ably handles this true story that is interesting in its own right, but he does a great job wringing the drama and emotion out of this. As a result, Philomena is not just a film that tells a story of a mother looking for her son. Instead, it is a universal tale of journey and discovery for both Philomena and Sixsmith and a film that has a heart. There is a heart and soul to this film as it passionately tells this tale of injustice.\r With truly brilliant performances from Judi Dench and Steve Coogan, Philomena further convinces me that I need to see more of Steve Coogan. I have only seen him sporadically, but that is clearly not enough. Together, they have terrific chemistry and they work together to find Philomena's son and find out what happened to him after 50 years. Dench plays Philomena with incredible class and majesty, as is to be expected for a woman with such dignity and prowess. The scene in which Philomena forgives Sister Hildegard for all of her sins against Philomena is incredibly powerful. The way in which she can forgive someone who wronged her so much is something that we all could learn from. Dench plays the scene to perfection with incredible emotion, yet with equal strength.\r The film does a great job not just making me fight back tears, but also dramatically. As the duo try to uncover the mystery, the film is packed to the brim with drama, furthered by the hurdles they must overcome in order to discover the truth. Though cliched in spots in this regard, Frears does a good job executing the cliches and still manages to make it damn near thrilling as they sort through the evidence and find her son. Above all, however, the film is truly emotional, particularly the ending and when Martin discovers the truth about Philomena's son. Frears does a terrific job capturing these moments, while his two leads do a great job capturing the power of those moments and their significance.\r Though it may be written off as Oscar bait by some, Philomena is a terrifically well-executed film that is emotional, powerful, and truly dramatic. Telling a deeply compelling real life story, Philomena does its protagonists justice with a film that captures the essence of both of their journeys into the past and into themselves. As a whole, Philomena is a moving film blessed with great acting, directing, and strong dramatic writing.",

That wonderful hybrid of quality drama, subtle, well-balanced acting and a sprinkling of welcome humor. Not to mention it all hung together around a meaningful and interesting subject matter.\rBased on the true story of Philomena Lee, an elderly Irish woman who became pregnant as a teenager and had her child taken away from her by the Catholic Church and sold for adoption it truly is not just a fine piece of work from a idiosyncratic director but an example to all about how to make dramatic cinema. Its also a a high watermark in terms of its tear jerkiness. very seldom do you see a sentimental film full of appropriate humor and a lack of tacked on manipulated mawkishness.

My only concern would be the glaring convenience that pops up half way through but Frears keeps things so tightly wound that you feel completely tolerant of it straight away.\rThe movie has received some rare bashings by some critics who argue its intentions regarding its take on the Catholic religion.

In my opinion, this is by far one of the best film nominated for an Oscar during the 86th Academy Awards. The movie centers on an ex-BBC political journalist, who was recently unemployed and plans to move ahead, and finds the story of Philomena Lee, who is searching for her long lost son, who had been taken from her decades ago, when she became pregnant and was forced into a convent. Together they uncover clues about her son. Judi Dench, as Philomena and Steve Coogan, as Sixsmith the political journalist truly makes the perfect duo for this film, both presenting their characters in a form which truly blew the audience's mind away.

Steven Coogan and Jeff Pope's adaptation from Martin Sixsmith's book may be short and edited nicely but isn't smart or effective as the writers think. If the script is a let down, then Stephen Frears saves it brilliantly through its amazing execution skills that doesn't fail to impress the audience. Judi Dench stands alone on performance in here as she is the core strength and the highlight of the feature despite of Steve Coogan's decent act.

            "content": "This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.\n        \nIts hard not to feel sorry for Philomena, her ordeal being well portrayed - the scenes set in the nuns home are quite harsh and chilling. She comes across as someone with a real passion and determination, quite a steely person, although she clearly hides a lot of emotions which do come to the fore at times. Knowing this is based on a true story certainly gives it more impact, thats for sure. It could also be said that in some regards she's quite simplistic and even somewhat like a kid when in the US, gleefully pointing out to a rather uninterested Martin about the bewildering choice of breakfasts available at their hotel for one and apparently being so impressed with the service provided by hotel and restaurant staff that she labels them one in a million, to which straight talking Martin points out that statistically thats very unlikely. Their two quite different characters, both no nonsense in their own ways but both with their own questions and angles on the whole story, which makes for interesting viewing. There's also an element of comedy present, which comes as a form of light relief given how heavy the subject matter is, all things considered. Comedy is delivered through some witty exchanges of dialogue. The plot runs at a good pace throughout, it certainly doesn't lag and as the story starts to be told,the turn of events are quite surprising and makes you more and more intrigued about where it'll all end. I found myself wondering which person I agreed with, or related to more somehow, Philomena or Martin, in different ways. They certainly have their spats and both have very clear stances on the morality behind what happened, where blame lies and so on. The movie features flashbacks to when Philomena had her chance encounter (at a funfair of all places) that led to conception in the 1950s, as well as obviously the scenes of her in the work house, realising her son was being taken away but also, moreso perhaps, are the old film reels shown of Antony growing up - its a bit tantalising as it made me question things, presumably what went through Philomena's mind at the time, when we couldn't really get answers to them, although to be fair I was keen on the ending, which I thought was quite touching and poignant. The musical score was also quite spooky and poignant. There are some confrontational scenes between Philomena and Martin and their different takes on what happened but also between Martin and the authorities and the nuns at the old nuns retreat. This is definitely a movie to have tissues at the ready for but as well as it being a bit of a weepy, it did make me think about what happened and I'd say that the theme of forgiveness is a very strong one present. I liked that at the end, a series of statements is shown across the screen which explains what happened afterwards, whats become of both Philomena and Martin.More generally its about religion and the influence that it had on people, how controlling those seen in authority were and so on. I felt that this movie was well made in terms of the two main characters being both rather quirky, the dialogue is good and the plot moved at a decent pace, although it doesn't have a big screen feel to it, it could well be (or have been) an afternoon TV movie or similar, it definitely character driven more than relying on fancy camerawork or special effects, there's no need for any of that. I found Judi Dench's acting in this movie to be pretty top notch really - her emotions are clear to see, her frustration, determination, joy and so on are very well portrayed and indeed I'd say that her performance outshines Coogans, although he also gives a pretty good performance as well and the two of them do seem to gel quite well on screen. I'd also like to add that Sophie Kennedy Clark (who portrays Philomena as a teenager, when she gave birth and worked at the convent/work house) also gives a very good, emotive. performanceSome plot elements seemed a little convenient, such as how Martin managed to get ahold of clippings that identified Antony - I'd have liked to have seen a bit more of an explanation in terms of how certain things were tracked down, rather than just the end outcomes as they were shown but obviously this is based on a true story, so convenient or not it does come from real life. I might have liked to have known a bit more about Martins background too, although enough was shown to make it clear that both main characters have self perhaps self doubts and have had tough times. I suppose it was better to tell such a hard hitting, important story of our times in a somewhat concise and 'to the point' way, rather than potentially losing viewers in a maybe unnecessary long winded version of the story, if it may have become too dark and depressing. Maybe it packs more of a punch, so to speak, in conveying such a story in all of an hour and forty minutes, which is a pretty short running time.",
