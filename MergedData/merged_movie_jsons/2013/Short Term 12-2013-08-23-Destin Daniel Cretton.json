            "content": "\"You are not their friend, and you are not their therapist,\" Jack (Frantz Turner) to Grace (Brie Larson)You can be forgiven if you think Short Term 12 is a documentary, so close it seems to the reality of a foster-care facility, so natural its acting in almost every character. If you see any films this month, makes sure this is one of themFirst time helmer Destin Cretton, with two years' experience in a similar care-giving facility (The title refers to the 12 or so group homes for teens in the county), has masterfully relayed the love and sorrow inherent in a place where virtually everyone is displaced from a parent, or abused, even the staff.The story belongs to Grace (Brie Larson), a caring giver who influences for good many of her charges, not easy cases any one of them. Part of the reason she is so successful is that she knows from abuse by her father, who is in prison for his offenses. She finds a younger Doppelganger of sorts in defiant teen Jadyn (Kaitlyn Dever), whose traumas at the hands of her father are ongoing and call for identifying with Grace's experiences and strong remedy. Watch for an Oscar nomination if this indie is seen by enough of us.To parallel the challenges of the home, Grace's home with fellow staffer, boyfriend Mason is both loving and stressful because she struggles with becoming pregnant and reconciling her tortured past with her father, who is ready to be released form prison. Mason is the ideal caregiver, loving and competent with the teenagers and her.Although many moments could be melancholic or downright tear-jerking in other hands, Cretton doesn't allow excessive sorrow to rule; rather, the sadness is mitigated by the small triumphs. Hey, that's just like real life. This little indie will cure you of any longing for summer blockbusters and their half-billion-dollar entanglements. Short Term 12's situations are enough satisfying drama for ten Lone Rangers.",

            "content": "Incredibly natural in its approach, wonderfully balanced from start to finish & further solidified by a convincing ensemble performances, Short Term 12 tells the story of Grace, a very caring & capable supervisor at a foster-care facility for at-risk teenagers. There are three story lines that emerge from this film; one is about Marcus, a quiet kid who's about to turn eighteen but doesn't want to leave the facility, the second plot line is about Jayden, a troubled teenage girl who's the latest member of the club. And the final & main plot line is about Grace herself, whose past returns to haunt her after meeting Jayden with whom she shares a connection plus the unexpected surprise she discovers that can have a major impact on her future, thus leaving her utterly confused with everything about her life.The entire cast has given a brilliant performance, but it's Brie Larson who impresses the most as Grace and the film manages to portray her toughness & fragility evocatively. The locations are very lifelike, the entire film has a very calm & relaxed atmosphere for which the shooting location is responsible for, editing is finely done & it is smartly written & directed. On an overall scale, Short Term 12 is one of those dramas that are heartwarming & heartbreaking at the same time that will have you go through every emotion you're capable of and dares to deal with issues most people or families aren't very comfortable viewing or discussing about.",

            "content": "Real heroes do not always end up with glory and parades. Heroism is sometimes reflected in small scale actions that no one ever hears about but occur every day in schools, hospitals, or wherever there are people who need compassion. Werner Erhard defines true heroism as \"the kind which ends up in the truth, in what works, in what is honest and real being brought out and made available to others.\" This kind of authenticity is front and center in Destin Cretton's Short Term 12, the story of troubled teens living in a short-term group home who are the recipients of empathy from counselors only a few years older who may have faced similar situations in their life.Winner of the audience award at the L.A. Film Festival and South by Southwest as well as the narrative feature prize, it is funny and sad with a wide range of emotions in-between. Coming from the director's own experience of working in a similar environment for two years, the film is permeated with an air of authenticity and it is rare that a film has such uniformly natural performances. Grace (Brie Larson) is the staff supervisor at the home known only as Short Term 12, a designation reflecting the fact that the residents are supposed to be there for no more than a year, although many have been there longer. The longer they stay, however, the more traumatic it is for them to leave.These are not \"bad\" kids though some may have had run-ins with the law. They are, more often than not, victims of parental abuse or neglect whose continuing to live at home would put them at risk. Most of the children are scared and have a lot of hidden anger but Cretton does not present them in a way that solicits our pity. They are who they are and we relate to them as fellow human beings. As Grace tells Nate (Rami Maledk), a new worker at the home, \"We're not their parents or their therapists. We're just here to create a safe environment.\" These words seem to be lost on Nate, however, who, when introduced to the residents, says \"I've always wanted to work with underprivileged kids,\" an insulting designation to which 17-year-old Marcus (Keith Stanfield) takes umbrage. Marcus, who is going to be discharged when he reaches 18, ready or not, elicits a stumbling apology from Nate who realizes his mistake.Grace's boyfriend, Mason (John Gallagher), begins the film with a story about an embarrassing incident with a young runaway. The story, which is gross and off-putting, is interrupted by bells going off as a scrawny young boy, Sammy (Alex Calloway), a frequent runaway, makes a beeline for the gate but is intercepted before he can make it outside the property. Jayden, in an impeccable performance by Kaitlyn Dever, is a new arrival who has made previous suicide attempts. Expecting her father to take her home soon, she is surly and uncommunicative and is only able to communicate with Grace by means of a heartbreaking children's story she wrote about a shark and an octopus, a story with a hidden meaning that that Grace pick ups on.Marcus, in another moving scene, sings a deeply felt rap song he created for Mason about \"a life not knowing what a normal life's like.\" Although the children play a huge role in the film, the main focus is on Grace and how her work affects her life. We find out at the beginning that she is pregnant and has scheduled an appointment to have an abortion, but she is conflicted. She knows that Mason loves her and would be a good father but she has seen neglectful parents or worse in her own life and at the home and her built-up anger expresses itself in a memorable scene.Short Term 12 could have become another film that sets out to inspire us through contrivance and manipulation. Under Cretton's direction, however, if there are tears to be shed, every one of them is earned. Though it (most likely) will not be remembered when awards are handed out at the end of the year, unlike many films with huge budgets and greater hype, it will remain with you after the others are long forgotten. Short Term 12 may just be the best film of the year.",

            "content": "At its core, Short Term 12 is a film about kids looking after kids. That youthful always-learning energy gives it a warmth and sincerity that's extremely endearing and a joy to watch these vulnerable and intriguing characters. It's about outcasts fitting in together and finding their place making it relatable for whenever you've felt alone and brings in a welcoming sense of community. It's Brie Larson's protagonist Grace who heads the entire ensemble on her shoulders. She gives a heartfelt performance, tough on the outside, swirling chaos on the inside, and she's able to get that on screen and develop it in every scene. In the way she is written, she shows the value of a nurturing character and how that can get the audience's sympathy regardless of any negative behaviour. The screenplay is terrific, juggling its arcs very efficiently and delivering comedy and drama in equal doses.It can get too comical or sentimental at times but its overall maturity cancels it out. With its hand-held photography, it has a raw aesthetic that cuts through potential contrivances and predictability and gives it an involving sense of authenticity. The majority of the scenes are long and dialogue driven, often reflecting on short sharp outbursts or telling stories within the story be it an anecdote, rap or children's story read aloud. It provides an ideal pace and length it to feel brisk yet able to breathe and feel like a fulfilling 90 minutes. It's a film about catharsis and connection after deep repression, and the fact it's about young people makes the tragedies hurt more and the sense of hope more touching. It does have a bad habit of using the clich\u00e9 of misplaced anger a bit too often, where a character furious at someone will instead hit those closest to them, but the deep rooted empathy for these characters allows those moments to feel at least somewhat justified as we feel that intense release with them.The supporting performances are also fantastic, characters that although may follow a convention feel like they're coming from a genuine place. It's not often that a film like this would start its story with a relatively optimistic relationship as that dials down the potential for conflict, but John Gallagher Jr. and his chemistry with Larson makes it one we love watching and dread that moment where it inevitably goes wrong. Keith Stanfield is a standout from the younger crowd of actors whose powerful tenderness constantly gave me chills and Kaitlyn Denver who navigates around clich\u00e9 and provides an earnest and passionate performance. Short Term 12 knows its deck has familiar cards, but it plays them just right. It's nice to have a film that knows that an original perspective is more engaging than original content. Despite its flaws, it's a really great emotional film and definitely the type of film I'd love to make. 8/10",

            "content": "Greetings again from the darkness. \"An indie gem\" is meant to be a term of respect for a little movie that manages to make an emotional connection, usually while being screened at a film festival or in a very limited and brief theatrical run. The best ones drive us to encourage everyone we know to take the time to see it. Such is writer/director Destin Cretton's latest.Some movies offer a promising premise and then let us down with faulty execution. Short Term 12 is actually better than its premise would lead you to expect. Credit goes to Mr. Cretton's quasi-documentary directorial style, tremendous acting from support characters played by John Gallagher Jr (Mason), Kaitlyn Dever (Jayden), and Keith Stanfield (Marcus), and a stunning lead performance from rising star Brie Larson (Grace).Grace and Mason help run a foster care facility. We witness first hand their daily work with the kids, some of it quite mundane ... though other moments incredibly powerful. Grace and Marcus have their own personal connections to this way of life, and also happen to be in a relationship that seems built on avoiding the communication and connection that goes into their daily jobs.The use of art as a communication device plays a role throughout. Marcus uses his rap lyrics, newcomer Jayden draws and writes children's stories. These two kids are particularly important because they also mirror the inner sanctum of Mason and Grace, and we see these people all battle demons in hope of living a \"normal\" life. This is not a story of saints and sinners ... these are just people coming to grip with the deck they've been dealt.You will recognize Gallagher from his work on HBO's \"Newsroom\", and Dever made quite an impression in her time on \"Justified\". Larson's star is on the rise thanks to her presence in The Spectacular Now and Don Jon, as well as some upcoming projects. She IS what critics have been trying make Greta Gerwig ... an actress who breathes life into character we feel we know.",

            "content": "\"You need to get ready because it's so unbelievable it's going to seem fake, but I promise you it's not, Grace will vouch for me...It's a storytellers wet dream.\"Every once in a while a surprising film like Short Term 12 comes around reminding me why I love cinema so much. This is only my second five star review from 2013 and this small indie absolutely hit all the right notes with me taking me through a wide range of emotions thanks to its perfect balanced mix of comedy and touching drama. I was drawn to these characters from the very opening scene and was completely engaged with the story. Having visited a foster care facility a couple times last year and spent some time with kids going through similar situations, this film really hit home and helped me empathize more with them. In a way I kind of felt like Nate, the new counselor in this film who didn't connect right away with the kids and there was not much he could do to help considering he had no idea where they were coming from. On the other hand, the two other counselors, Grace and Mason, really connected with the children because they came from similar backgrounds and understood how they were feeling. Short Term 12 writer and director, Destin Cretton, uses this film as a vehicle to let the viewer have a better understanding of the social situation these kids go through. I don't know if this would've worked so well if it weren't for the incredibly touching performances from the cast. Brie Larson is so great in this film, she hit all the right notes, and in some way she reminded me of Jennifer Lawrence in Winter's Bone. She has that same potential and her career will definitely take off after this. She deserves an Oscar nomination because she's that good. Her co-lead, John Gallagher Jr. also delivers a terrific performance and if we haven't heard much about him it's because Larson steals most of the thunder here. Even the kids in this film were terrific and that's why I'm giving this film the highest possible grade because it does everything right.Grace (Brie Larson) is one of the young counselors at Short Term 12, a foster care facility for at risk teenagers. Along with Mason (John Gallagher Jr.), with whom she's in a relationship, they look after these kids who have come from a troubled past. The film opens with Mason welcoming a new counselor named Nate (Rami Malek), and he shares a story with him about his first day which didn't go too great. Then they introduce some of the kids to him: there's Marcus (Keith Stanfield) who's about to turn 18 and therefor will be leaving the facility soon, Sammy (Alex Calloway) who's going through a deep psychological trauma, and Luis (Kevin Hernandez) who's easygoing but enjoys bullying Marcus. A few days later a new teenage girl named Jayden (Kaitlyn Dever) arrives at the foster care center who seems to be deeply scarred. Grace begins to connect with her and realizes they have come from a similar past. Grace and Mason are both excellent counselors, mostly because they have come from a troubled past themselves, and despite helping these kids they also have to deal with their own scars in life if they want their relationship to work. I loved the way that Cretton decided to open the film with Mason telling Nate a story, and then deciding to end it with another one. The structure of this film was just perfectly executed and I loved the balance it maintained. There were several different plots going on as each kid was going through different problems. The final scene in this film literally gave me goose bumps all over my body. Many people had an issue with it ending with such a positive note, but I thought it was perfect. Larson is a major reason why this film worked so well, her character Grace is just that: a graceful person who is doing her best to help these kids while at the same time trying to deal with her own demons. Dever and Stanfield also deliver powerful secondary performances and each one of them shares a memorable scene with one of their counselors as they try to express their feelings through different ways: Marcus does so by rapping and Jayden by reading a story. These two scenes are extremely powerful and emotional and they stand out in the film without feeling forceful or manipulative at all. This film just has so much heart and it's no surprise it has such a high rating (99% on Rottentomatoes) because it really is a vivid portrait that draws us in to these characters troubled lives in the pursuit and need of healing. Brie Larson's Grace has just become my favorite heroine of the year. That octopus story will stick with me forever, there was a lot of powerful stuff in this film.",

If a movie doesn't have the budget to distribute their film to a vast amount of cities or campaign well, then it is unlikely to get its deserved recognition. I sat through the 96 minutes of this Indie film that got raved with impressive reviews at SXSW to see what the fuss was about. The people behind this movie deserve SO much more praise than they have gotten. This film, though not technically masterful, is emotionally wrenching. I laughed, I freaking cried my heart out, and overall it felt real. There was a connection to the film that was surprisingly amazing. The movie reminded me to Blue is the Warmest Color in the sense that it was raw, powerful, real, and astonishing. Brie Larson should have easily been one of the five nominees for Best Actress as well as Keith Stanfield for Best Supporting Actor. This film is a portrayal of neglected youth, a rare look at relationships, an articulation of the fears in the world, and a new point of view that most films have never shown before. I truly recommend this film to everyone, and will always give it the praise it deserves.",

The writer/director also had balance in the story, The most emotional scenes had tremendous impact because the timing when they occurred was not suspected. The scenes were gut-wrenching and drove me to emotional experiences as if I was a person in the film. Thus, the tears. This may be a hard film for viewers to be involved with, but it is worth every minute of it. The private lives of the leaders were weaved into the film and gave great understanding to the people who ran the agency.

            "content": "Taking a look at movies that are about to be taken off Netflix UK,I spotted a title starring Brie Larson.Since having only previously seen Larson be cute in the fun 21 Jump Street,I decided to go for a short term.The plot:Along with her boyfriend Mason,Grace works in a shelter for troubled teenagers,where they can each stay for up to 18 years,and get help to try and assist them with their psychical and psychological issues. Getting close to leaving the shelter,Mason and Grace find Marcus struggling with the prospect of entering the outside world again.Spotting her being completely quiet,Grace tries to bond with new resident Jayden.As Jayden begins to open up about the events which cause her to self-harm,Grace begins to open up for the first time about the similar events which took place in her childhood.View on the film:Expanding on his short movie and the work he did at a shelter for teenagers,the screenplay by writer/director Destin Daniel Cretton gives everyone at the shelter a fully fleshed out depth,where the actions of just one resident (such as running off) affect the entire group in the shelter.Displaying extraordinary sensitivity to the abuse that the teens have faced,Cretton delicately explores the abuses that Jayden,Marcus and Grace have faced by treating them as beautiful (but troubled) individuals,which shines as Marcus starts to rap,Jayden beats up a balloon animal,and Grace allows her guard to be dropped for Mason.Keeping Joel P. West's great score humming in the background,director Cretton & cinematographer Brett Pawlak give the film an incredibly raw atmosphere that picks up all of the painful scars covers the residences and the staff. Filming parts of the title in a hand-held manner,Cretton avoids the infamous \"shaky cam\" by smartly using the hand held method for tightly coiled close-ups which pours into the heart wrenching emotions that the staff and residence are revealing.Lying that she had worked with disadvantaged children in order to get the part, (she did apply to work as a volunteer in shelters for teens,but was turned down by each one) Brie Larson gives a passionate, incredibly realistic performance as Grace. Giving Grace a warm smile,Larson takes a caring, gestalt approach to Grace,by Larson gradually bringing down Grace's self-made, defensive barriers,to unveil the \"whole\" Grace. Largely cast from \"open casting\" calls,the residences of the shelter each giving mesmerising performances,with Keith Stanfield's earthy raps of Marcus and Kaitlyn Dever's astonishingly quiet,understanding outpouring of emotion from Jayden being just two of the incredible highlights from the 12th short term.",

            "content": "Short Term 12 is a powerful and moving drama that leaves you with warm feelings on conclusion. It depicts the personal struggles of a group of teenagers in supported care and their carers.Dramas of this sort can sometimes leave you feeling gloomy and have a depressing feel. It certainly has dark moments of personal struggle, dealing in mental health, domestic abuse, self harm and suicide but the standard of acting and ending of the movie most definitely leave you feeling positive.What stands out most about this film however is the cast. There are several strong performances even from the supporting cast with minor screen time.\nBrie Larson in the lead role excels. A breakout performance in a slow moving drama. One particular scene that comes to mind is the scene with Frantz Turner playing Jack. The outburst is a culmination of her protecting Jayden (played very well by Kaitlyn Dever) who she has begun to understand\nand create a close bond with, along with her own personal life frustrations. It is Jayden and not her boyfriend, despite his attempts, who allow Grace to open\nup and deal with her own personal struggles and her past.\nJohn Gallagher Jnr, who I had not seen much of prior to this movie also puts in an understated performance as the caring and supporting boyfriend and provides a few moments of comedic relief throughout the drama. I should also mention his scene at his foster family birthday celebration. The scene is only short but the emotion he displays in saying thank you to his foster parents was powerful.\nThis is also one of the early roles for Rami Malek, who has now gone on like Brie to much more significant roles. He doesn't have much screen time\nin this and no particular scenes of note.\nOther than Brie however I believe Lakeith Stanfield as Marcus puts in the best performance. His backstory doesn't get as much time as Jayden and it is\nless central to the plot of the film which is mainly the Grace/Jayden/Mason arc, but all of his scenes are very strong and he is very believable.",

            "content": "I saw this film a couple days ago at SXSW and it is still difficult to put into words how I feel about it. This is a truly special film and was definitely the big WOW moment of the entire festival. The film won the Grand Jury and Audience Award for Narrative feature and it deserves the accolades 100%. The acting in this film is so honest and real that I felt like I was watching a documentary at times. This is easily a star making role for Brie Larson, John Gallager Jr., and Kaitlyn Dever. All are young stars on the rise and I hope this film helps progress their careers in the right direction, because they all deserve it.The film tells the story of Grace (Larson) and her coworkers as they work at a dysfunctional foster care facility. There are many characters in the film, specifically the kids in the foster care, and each and every character with a speaking role is a completely fleshed out, multi- dimensional character. It was easy to connect with every character since you really felt for their difficult life situation and it was riveting to see these characters interact with each other in a realistic way.I don't want to say too much about the film, but there are some very moving scenes that definitely made me tear up. This is a very emotional film and you could feel the passion that was put into it by the cast and filmmakers. I believe wholeheartedly that this movie deserves Oscar buzz, specifically in Screenplay and some of the acting categories. The audience reaction as the credits rolled was one of the warmest receptions at SXSW that I experienced this year and multiple people gave it a standing ovation.I cannot wait to see this film again, definitely the best of the festival and one of the best first features by a director that I've ever seen. This is going to be a very important film in 2013 and I cannot wait to see what is in store for the film, the director, and these talented young rising actors. You will be a better person for seeing this film. Just see it.",

Clearly in a few months' time it will be accurate to refer to it as the finest movie not to even get nominated for several Oscars, the main one, of course, being for Best Actress which Brie Larsen should win going away.It is, of course, an emotive subject and one that is time-honored - I recall an outstanding (and also Oscar-worthy) performance by Judy Garland in 'A Child Is Waiting', but just because it's been done before doesn't mean you can't do it again - should there be no more movies about alcoholism just because Billy Wilder said it all in 'The Lost Weekend'? Of course not, Wilder merely set the bar for others to aim at. The positive thing is that Short Term 12 has been booked into the Multiplex rather than the Art House circuit in England but against that I watched it with only three other people whereas an Art House screening would surely have yielded a more respectable audience. Whatever, this is a fine and important film that deserves to be seen and more than deserves any plaudits that come its way.",

            "content": "Destin Cretton's script about a foster care treatment facility was a 2010 Nichol Fellowship winner. It's an earnest, feel-good effort which mainly focuses on its protagonist, Grace (Brie Larson), a 20 something counselor at the facility. She's in charge of a group of dysfunctional teenagers, who exhibit varying degrees of self-destructive behavior.Grace herself is a victim of domestic abuse at the hands of her father, who we soon learn will be released from a correctional facility after serving time due to Grace's testimony against him. Grace is involved in a relationship with another co-worker counselor, Mason (John Gallagher Jr.), who was raised by warm, loving foster parents, in contrast to Grace's damaged upbringing. Part of the plot involves Grace's internal arc, as she struggles whether to have an abortion, following an unexpected pregnancy. You can probably guess what she ultimately decides to do about having the baby.The bulk of 'Short Term 12' concerns Grace and Mason's struggle to help the kids in their charge. The staff eschews a punitive approach when dealing with the kids and are also bound by state laws that prohibit them from bringing them back to the facility, if they leave the grounds. Hence, there are a number of dramatic scenes where the counselors engage in mad dashes to try and prevent one particularly dysfunctional kid from exiting the perimeter.Probably the greatest strength of the film is the depiction of the meltdown of two particularly distressed teenagers: Marcus, an aspiring rap artist and Jayden, a teenage girl, who Grace suspects is being physically and sexually abused by her father. There are dark moments for both of the teenagers: Marcus attempts suicide and Jayden is taken home by her father on a weekend pass, where presumably she's being abused. Naturally, there is the obligatory happy-ending for both of them: Marcus eventually gets himself together and hooks up with a former beauty who attended the facility (this story happens off-screen and is related to us by Mason at film's end); and Jayden is saved after Grace convinces her to testify to social service agency officials about the abuse, at the hands of her father.'Short Term 12' suffers most from the lack of an identifiable antagonist. We never do get to meet either Grace of Jayden's father, who are depicted as uncaring monsters. By fleshing either one of them out (or both), and linking them organically to the plot, Mr. Cretton's narrative, could have been way more dramatic and exciting. Instead, Cretton loses sight of creating more complex characters by getting too emotionally involved in his subject matter. Probably the weakest scene is when Grace links her own crisis of the impending release of her father from prison to Jayden's, breaking into her father's home, and almost ending up bashing him over the head with a baseball bat. Instead, Grace and Jayden take turns bashing in the window of the deep asleep father's car. Yes, we understand that Cretton doesn't like abusers, but he never introduces any of them to us as real human beings.Finally, it's nice to know that the caring efforts of Grace and Mason pay off in the end, but how realistic is that? Often what happens is that dysfunctional kids, those who have been oppressed by abusive parents, become abusers themselves. Hence, the old dictum of the oppressed becoming the oppressors, seems to be missing here. How about a kid who Grace and Mason can't save, and is just plain evil? It's another opportunity missed to introduce a credible antagonist.As a first feature effort, Destin Cretton has created a fairly credible look at what goes on in some foster care treatment facilities today. With a little more seasoning, Mr. Cretton may break into the film business, as a full-time director. He certainly knows how to direct his actors and work with a cinematographer. Cretton needs to be a little less sentimental and work at developing a full-fledged antagonist, when he develops his sophomore effort.",

            "content": "After he graduated from college, Hawaiian-born filmmaker Destin Cretton worked in a group home for troubled teenagers. In 2008 he released a twenty minute short film called Short Term 12, which was a fictional drama based on some of his own experiences with these kids. This full length film uses some of the very same scenes as the short and retains one of the core character relationships. Sometimes when some short films are expanded to full length they can feel overstretched because the filmmakers do not know how to appropriate the concept and script to an entire feature. Yet Cretton has done an exceptional job in retaining the short's verisimilitude while expanding his thematic goals through an extensive reworking of the inner life of the main character too. In the short film the main supervisor character was a man. Here the same role has been written as a woman and is played by twenty-four year old actress Brie Larson (The Spectacular Now, 21 Jump Street), who gives a colossal performance as Grace. She is a tough, strict but also deeply caring supervisor who is in charge of looking after a number of teenagers with several workers, including her partner Mason (John Gallagher Jr.). There are a number of threads in the film, including Grace's pregnancy, a new worker who is introduced to the facility and a troubled Black teen. The most significant plot point though is the arrival of Jayden (a brilliantly anxious Kaitlyn Dever), a suicidal, self-harming girl whose experiences become a mirror of Grace's own past, and gradually unravels her own psychological stability. Cretton's screenplay is clear and well organised, balancing several arcs and providing dramatic weight to both the adult and teenager characters, and sometimes overlapping their experiences. The major transformation of making the main character a woman instead of a man pays off because it strengthens the credibility of the relationship between Jayden and Grace. It allows the exposition of Grace's own horrific upbringing to be slowly unearthed through this very tentative relationship defined by duty but also a great deal of empathy too. Their relationship is also indicative of Cretton's central theme, which he also expanded upon thoroughly from the short. He is interested in the conflict generated by caring for others needs, such as how this can be detrimental to one's own personal well-being. This is verbalised in a bizarre but funny opening story that Mason tells about chasing a kid who escaped but then defecates in his own pants at the same time. Failed parentage is also pertinent in the script with several characters disappointed or damaged by their upbringing or fearful of being a parent. Another success for the film is that Brie's personal life and love story doesn't detract from the realism and grit of the facility. Both threads complement each other. As the behaviour of the kids like Jayden grows more erratic and violent, Mason and Grace's relationship sits on a knife-edge. There are also agonising scenes of self-harm and verbal breakdowns in this film but one of the improvements as a feature film is that there are breathing spaces between the climaxes. None of these moments are gratuitous or exploitative, but believably gruelling and spontaneous jolts of uncontrollable emotions and behaviour, captured vividly through hand-held cameras and a minimalist visual style. The mood is often alleviated with surprising humour too. Given the subject matter, audiences might be surprised how many big laughs there are in the film. All the actors, including the young teenagers, show unwavering commitment in their roles. Brie Larson gives a star-making performance of palpable confidence and strength. She also plays the character as having a tentative personal life under her hardened exterior, revealing the most confronting details about her upbringing. We understand this character from her past as much as her actions. Grace's desperation to protect Jayden echoes her own past and her future as she thinks about how her own father's imminent release from prison. There is only one belated scene where her character's actions begin to wobble the foundations of credibility. Just as she reaches the apex of irrationalism, Cretton pulls the scene back at the right moment. John Gallagher Jr. is funny and highly charismatic as Mason and his character is also provided with a surprising but brief scene where we fully come to understand his character from his childhood. These portraits summarise the film: it is a minor tale in its scale and cinematic form, but the performances and the writing are so intimately drawn that it becomes an unexpectedly moving character study about welfare and painful upbringings.",

            "content": "Sometimes a movie that on the surface may seem small in both scale and scope has much more to say than anyone gave it credit for until they themselves have seen it. Destin Cretton's feature debut Short Term 12 is one of those films whose synopsis does not give it credit for what it broaches in its short 90 minute running time.Coming out of nowhere and striking a chord with audiences the world over Short Term 12 is a fantastically written and observant film that has a lot to say about both disconnected youth and those whose lives have been affected by sometimes unspeakable trauma. Cretton has a deft touch both in his screen writing and in his gritty hand-held filming approach and the two mould together to paint an emotionally driven portrait of those in the \"limbo\" house between broken home and new foster accommodation. There are some striking scenes in the film namely a heartbreaking rap from Marcus (Stanfield) a boy who has clearly experienced much heartbreak or two bookend scenes played out with dialogue chronicling adventures of the homes residents. These moments in the film showcase Cretton as a talent to watch just like the films leading lady Brie Larson.Small films like Short Term 12 have been a breeding ground for break out performances for years now, with those looking to break into a tough industry choosing tough roles to show off their wares. Brie Larson here in her role as conflicted and inwardly troubled worker Grace stamps herself as an actress capable of both pure heartrending emotion and an equal talent at comedic timing and lovable charm, no doubt a few tricks were learned from her time in praised TV show The United States of Tara and supporting roles in films such as 21 Jump Street and Don Jon. It's a pleasure to see an actress grow before your eyes as Larson does and she is ably supported by an impressive adult cast and a cast of young adults that are led by Justified's impressive young actress Kaitlyn Dever.Short Term 12 is as stated a small film that deals with big issues and deals with them in a way that is both confronting yet in a manner that seems just right. It's a film brimming with heart and personality and a film that could stand equal to many more high profile films of last year. I personally can't wait to see where both Larson and Cretton go to next.4 hated inflatable dogs out of 5 For more movie reviews and opinions check out - www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com",

It's also quite touching that the adults in charge are just as messed up as the kids but try even harder in covering it up. \"Short Term 12\" stars Brie Larson as Grace a twenty-something counselor who is in charge of fellow staff and a few emotionally-damaged kids.Grace is in a relationship with fellow counselor, and former foster child, Mason (John Gallagher Jr). Grace's emotionally-damaging childhood has left her ill-equipped to be in a relationship but Mason is such a loving, caring individual that she's going to need to mature up eventually.The highlight of the teenagers is Marcus (Keith Stanfield) who is turning 18 and has to leave the care center. He hides his insecurities behind masculine bravado, but as it doesn't fool our heroes and heroine, Mason eventually gets him to read his poetry. It's a rap song with many words and phrases that he's not allowed to say, but anybody watching will be laughing so hard that he probably can't be held responsible for every inappropriate thing in the song.There's a significant bit of drama unfolding in the foster care center, all of which can be very upsetting, but the beauty of \"Short Term 12\" is that the drama is folded into the comedy so realistically that it really is easy to like. The characters, particularly the supporting adults, are beautifully portrayed and allow the complexities, the flaws and graces, of our heroine Grace to evolve in their own time.",

It's one of those films that does well at festivals because viewers tend to soak up aspects wholeheartedly in that type of setting whereas home viewing does not, i can put something else on, and although I endeavored to watch it to the end, like all films, I was not enthralled. Its slow, and boring, with so much music rolling over every scene. It may be an indie film but it is definitely not a cult classic, there is just nothing to 'love' about it, and by definition alone a cult needs to be loved or at least liked and this film will just not reach that kind of status. Why?The acting - Great, but hardly off the wall to make it cultist in the slightest. The story - Hardly avant-garde, not thought provoking, slow, depressing, infuriating... clearly the ingredients for a spellbound time...? lacking cultishness, obviously. But in the end its a story that has been told before, of an ineffective system and it's tiring watching weak people in a bad system. The filming - Its not groundbreaking, in fact its so late 90's its not even original.Music - incessant, and unflinching in trying to keep the tone lighthearted.Short Term 12 doesn't come close to holding a candle to the likes of \"12 Years a Slave\", \"Gravity\" or \"Her\". The days of slow paced Oscar winners was not for 2014, and rightfully so. If \"Rush\" wasn't getting a nomination, or \"Stoker\" then I hardly see it fit to garnish one to a mediocre drama that shows more pros for indifference than excellence.",

            "content": "Actress Brie Larson is red-hot for her new film ROOM (2015), directed by Lenny Abrahamson (FRANK 2014), an Oscar hopeful this season, which seems to guarantee her first Oscar- nomination after the snub of her breakthrough performance in this indie feature, 2 years ago.SHORT TERM 12 is director/writer Cretton's feature debut and is inspired by his own experiences as a staff member at a group facility, which had been made as a short with the same title in 2008. This feature length stars Larson as Grace, a young supervisor working in a home for troubled teenagers, and it opens with the first day for a newbie worker Nate (Malek), who is a wide-eyed surrogate for viewers who is unfamiliar with their vocation, is given a pep talk by the old-hand Mason (Gallagher Jr.) and later joined by Grace. Although the excremental anecdote is off-putting (why Americans are so obsessed with toilet jokes?), it certainly generates an air of blitheness will contradict what is happening during their work, and Grace is the centre pillar of the narrative, and Cretton slowly but steadily discloses her own trouble past: through her firm determination to arrange an abortion after getting pregnant (also it is not her first time); the weird physical intimacy between her and Mason, who turns out to be her long- time boyfriend; how she decides to tell him about their baby after observing that he might be capable of being a good father and accepts the subsequent marriage proposal then rescinds it. The storyline of Grace's personal turmoil intersects superbly with her work, her bonding with those teens, particularly with Jayden (Dever), a girl experiences a similar situation of hers, it is to her she can finally divulge her abused past which she find very difficult to communicate with Mason, sometimes we can only blow the lid off with our own kind, at least in the first step.Larson is a formidable and dauntless actress, reflects an aura of maturity well beyond her age (she was only 23 when the film was made), no wonder critics likens her as a more low-key version of Jennifer Lawrence, equally feisty in exploring maturer roles and excels. In this movie, she excellently pulls off the somewhat over-cooked \"I have a secret but it is too traumatic to tell you\" manoeuvre, and outshines everyone else in it. Dever, a starlet with potentiality, outstandingly nails the scene where she tells the heartrending octopus allegory, and so is Keith Stanfield as Marcus (the only actor recruited from the original short), whose rap solo is such a powerful pathos-inviter. By comparison, Gallagher Jr.'s golden-hearted Mason, has a less showier part as the loyal and undefeated boyfriend, who has been rescued by his Spanish- speaking foster family and turns out to be an upright young man, a typical supporting default, but he brings about enough tenderness and compassion to be sincerely memorable.Cretton effortlessly wields the hand-held technique to create super-personal close-ups upon his characters, teases out a full gamut of emotions since most of the characters are victims of the dark-side of humanity, while remains a fitting gradation of detachment without being too aggressive or exploitive, especially the ending, resonates the opening and lands an apposite coda with a rosy message of hope and laughters. Overall, Cretton has done a remarkable job and emerged as one of the few new talents worthy of our attention for their next project, plus the film fairly earns a spot on my top 10 list of the year.",

            "content": "It isn't uncommon that after I leave a deeply affecting, emotional roller-coaster of a film that I am left speechless. Contrary to its title, the effects that Short Term 12 leaves you with are anything but short term. In what has become one of the most personal films of 2013, has also been one of my most challenging reviews to write. Ironically enough, Short Term 12 is also one of the most rewarding and mandatory films of the year. Thankfully, there is just too much to share about writer/director Destin Daniel Cretton film that can't be left unsaid. The film tenderly explores the lives of tormented souls who have faced and are forced to conquer the lasting repercussions of sexual and other violent abuse. For that, Short Term 12 is a weary yet rewarding film that refuses to beg for empathy. Instead it chooses to be a galvanic and delicate narrative intent on telling a story right. More below! The beauty of Short Term 12 lies in its profusely believable dialogue and story-telling techniques. Whether it be sharing intimate details of the lives of the foster-cares 'at risk youth'; lyrically, poetically or prosaically, writer/director Destin Daniel Cretton creates a film which the characters render the deepest and darkest corners of your heart, while never being melodramatic. Cretton has already explored this world in his Jury Prize winner short in 2009 at Sundance, and whatever politics surround the film as to why his newest feature which expands the world of his short was not included in the Sundance line-up this year, has yet to be explored. Unfortunately for Sundance, this is one feature film that compliments some of its illustrious winners, specifically my top film of 2013 Fruitvale Station, in admirable fashion.The real heart and soul of the film is Brie Larson who plays Grace, supervisor to the fragile youth inhabiting short term 12. The facility itself, a voluntary juvenile centre in California, is a home that throughout the film, creates constant wonder, sharing in the joys and pains of its guests. Acting as teacher, big sister and disciplinarian to the youth, Grace along with her secret lover and boyfriend Mason (The Newsroom's John Gallagher Jr.) are a tag-team duo. Together they create a healthy and safe environment where the youth are forced to lead lives that include healthy ways of communication and a healthy outlet for anger, fear and other very overpowering emotions.When we first meet Grace and Mason, who have tried to keep their relationship a secret to everyone at the centre, life is anything but perfect. Sharing an awkward and impulsively aggressive love-life, we realize that, like with so many 'inspiration-teacher genre' films, the teachers have just as many problems as their students. Deep-rooted in physical and sexual abuse, the two protagonists go on serving as uncompromising examples to the youth in the facility. It is with the arrival of Jayden (Kaitlyn Dever) that Grace's world is shaken to its core. Sheltered in her headphones wielded with angst-worthy music, Grace begins to connect with Jayden through drawing portraits and telling stories. As Jayden faces the deep secrets of her life and the dark corners of her past, Grace begins to do the same upon the news of her father's upcoming parole. Questioning her role as a partner to Mason and expecting mother, Grace is unhinged and begins a decent into a path of self-destruction.Each character in Short Term 12 gracefully begins to take similar faces to people in our own lives. The performances in the film, lead or supporting, are familiar reminders of uplifting success stories or tragic shadows of old loved-ones. Stand-out performances include that of the eldest short term patron, Marcus (the outstanding Keith Stanfield) who upon approaching his eighteenth birthday is forced to leave short term 12. Marcus along with Mason share some of the most compelling, witty, and powerful scenes together involving nothing less than a bongo-drum or hair-clippers.One of the issues that could have easily plagued the film was its overwrought subject matter and its ability to be preachy. Cretton, who admitted to having a position similar to his protagonists in his youth, instead opts for a very unnoticed \"fly on the wall\" filming approach that allows the film to explore the many hypocrisies that fill the 'inspiration-teacher genre' uninterrupted. Cretton creates deep characters with meaningful roles that share the same issues as their patients. Never lumpy, the overall commentary on listening to your own advice, institutionalized help and the role of care-givers juxtaposed directly against those of therapists and psychologists is revealing yet unwaveringly passionate.The authenticity of Short Term 12 as a whole is quite refreshing. Cretton, who exchanges the glamorous for the intimate, tells us a real story of ordinary people with real problems, never down-playing the impact of each trauma, no matter how small or how big. Throughout Grace's journey of healing, Cretton shows how life is filled with interchanging teacher/pupil roles and how regardless of age, we learn from one another.Larson is destined to become a force worth reckoning with thanks to her portrayal in Short Term 12. Larson's heartwarming yet weary depiction of a rehabilitated character really brings home Mason's description of Grace, where \"weird and beauty come together\". Grace's willingness to abandon all physical beauty as well as her joy to share deep emotional and mental insight to her children is never compromised. Larson is revelatory as a person raising a helpful hand to a small minority of the American population that is generally outcasted and ignored.Never in a million years would I have thought that a film full of monologues, including a monologue about someone shitting their pants, literally and figuratively, would have made it on my list of best films of the year. But much like the film itself, Short Term 12 is an unexpected diamond in the rough.Like this review? Check out the rest of it at www.nightfilmreviews.com",

This is a pure film , beautiful , well written , well acted , subtle , and funny. Yes . Funny as hell , in that indie film going to Sundance kind of way. Grace ( Brie Larson) is a troubled young woman . A woman for whom life has not been easy . She chooses to not hide from that pain but to embrace it , I think without even realizing it , by working and loving other people that are also troubled. Her job as little boss of the Short Term 12 center has her face to face with realities of life. Her relationship with another worker Mason ( John Gallagher Jr) who was also a foster child also runs in that \" hiding in plain sight\" pattern. In one week Grace finds that she is pregnant, is about to lose one of her charges to \"aging out\" of the system and meets a near mirror image to her self as a youth she quietly begins to lose her grip. She has never fully revealed to Mason, for instance , the depth of her pain . As it becomes clear , to us if not to her , that holding in the pain of her childhood continues to hurt her she is confronted by tragedy. Marcus ( Keith Stanfield) tries to commit suicide after the death of his pet fish. After that we finally know all the truth of Grace and why she is who she is. It isn't heavy handed it just is. Like real life . I don't know how to end this except to say the following: GO SEE THIS MOVIE . see it now , when it is under the radar or see it in January after the Oscar nominations come rolling in for this quiet and beautiful film.",

            "review_title": "Something of a Missed Opportunity",
            "content": "Much-lauded on its original release by critics and viewers alike, SHORT TERM 12 is a powerful drama set in a foster home, where twentysomething carer Grace (Brie Larson), and her fellow-workers Mason (John Gallagher Jr) and Nate (Rami Melek) spend their lives looking after disturbed or abused teenagers, including Marcus (Keith Stanfield), Jayden (Kaitlyn Dever), and Sammy (Alex Calloway). Their job certainly isn't easy: many of these teenagers have had difficult lives, and find it very difficult to talk about their experiences. Sometimes Grace gets into conflict with her superior Jack (Frantz Turner), in the belief that not enough attention has been paid by the so-called professionals towards the teenagers' plight. However Grace herself is not without problems: we learn that she has had a disturbed childhood - so disturbed, in fact, that she cannot even talk about it to Mason. The prospect of her father being released on probation from prison fills her with horror. Destin Daniel Cretton's production contains some powerful performances, notable from Larson and Dever, whose characters develop a bond with one another, despite their difficulties. However the script is marred by some obvious implausibilities: if Grace has had such a disturbed past, one wonders why she has been put in a position of such responsibility at the foster home. In one sequence she is shown entering Jayden's house, while Jayden is at home, using the front door key concealed under the doormat. One wonders why the key is kept there when the family are at home. Jayden and Grace smash up Jayden's father's car with a baseball bat, but no one - not even the police - visits the foster home to investigate what has happened. There is a happy ending, but it seems rather contrived, as the director wanted above all to show that these kids - Grace included - could be redeemed, so long as people made the effort to understand them. SHORT TERM 12 represents something of a missed opportunity, despite its subject-matter.",

            "content": "Brie Larson stars as Grace. She and her boyfriend work in a residential program for teens though through the course of the film you start to realize that Grace is just as screwed up as many of these kids. Because Grace grew up being sexually abused, she has a hard time separating herself from her clients and projects many of her problems onto the kids...and sometimes behaving VERY unprofessionally. All this becomes more of a problem because Grace is pregnant--and how can a woman who never worked through her own parent/child issues possibly raise a child of her own?This is a slow but engaging film. The more you watch it, the more you're pulled into the film and Grace's world. As a guy who once worked in residential programs for teens, I can say that the filmmakers did a good job of capturing what these places are like as well as the sort of folks that work in them. 'Walking wounded' workers isn't an unusual phenomenon at all. Well worth seeing and well made, though I HATED some of the shaky cam, especially early in the film. Why is it that young filmmakers think that bad camera-work is a good thing?!?! Most audiences don't want to have motion sickness while they watch a movie!!!FYI--The film had a mistake that I noticed. Grace's father is getting out of prison and the probation department calls her to inform her. This SHOULD have been the parole department--as folks coming out of prison are never put on probation but on parole.",

In the span of an hour and thirty minutes the movie made me connect to a character like he was a real person. Short Term 12 achieves this by underplaying everything. There are no spectacular shots, memorable lines, nor an actor that \"steals\" scenes, nothing in this film shouts \"look at me! I am important!\". Short Term 12 is the film that was stripped of anything flashy to just show the audience character relationships. Characters are introduced to a new environment, hearts get broken, and tears are shed. These are the epitome of tear jerker clich\u00e9s, however the audiences are not tricked into crying like the usual Hollywood films but gets comforted by the movie and how it all plays out. By stripping of everything but the characters, the director Destin Daniel Cretton focuses on the only the necessary elements to the film. The result is a warm and heart warming tale that's not necessarily a \"feel good\" movie. This is not the best movie ever, this was not aiming to be the best movie ever, but if you see this movie you will just lie down and enjoy it.",

I have worked in a similar facility and I believe that this movie really nails the way in which a place like this becomes an entity all its own with its own rules and character and reality. Short term 12 is its own world and the people who reside there are simultaneously cut off from the outside world and attached by quirky and generally disappointing bonds to that outside world. This film also faithfully coveys the ways that a person who works in this type of setting is molded by the experience and bound to the peculiar world within the walls. The movie has humorous and absurd aspects but makes clear that many of the kids are there, to a great extent, because of the dismissiveness and callousness of the adults in their outside worlds who failed to nurture and protect the kids.",

Remarkable dramedy about a foster care facility and its close and troubled relationships between faculty and residents. Larson gives an incredible performance as the lead staffer whose own personal demons threaten to unbalance her loving boyfriend/co-worker (Gallagher, equally affective and a truly natural performance) when a new arrival tween (Dever, ditto) proves to be a challenge all are not prepared for. Novice filmmaker Destin Cretton makes an indelible debut giving his actors plenty of freedom to inhabit their believable roles while the organic quality of the storyline does not hammer one over the head about the issues at hand (abused kids and long- term psychological damage often go hand in hand) yet is powerfully humane. An indie gem and a must see(k).",

            "content": "Every once in awhile, a film comes completely out of nowhere and utterly surprises me. This was exactly the case with \"Short Term 12\". It took a family member to recommended it to me...and even he only knew of it via film school! I'm glad I checked it out, though, as it held me in tow for the duration.For a basic plot summary, this film focuses on a \"holding tank\" for young people who are awaiting court judgments. In other words, the next step before either juvenile detention or foster care. Grace (Brie Larson) and Mason (John Gallagher Jr.) are the most experienced staff leaders, and they also happen to be in a relationship with each other. As the viewer learns more about the facility, residents such as Marcus (Keith Stanfield), Luis (Kevin Hernandez), Sammy (Alex Calloway), and Jayden (Kaitlyn Dever) are introduced, including an insider look at why each of them are at the facility.This is a movie about people and issues...plain and simple. Right from the opening scene, director Destin Daniel Cretton knows how to seamlessly begin weaving a complex drama, one which only strengthens as the characters are introduced. Basically, the strength of the film is that each character feels so \"real\". Nothing seems overly dramatic or \"made up\". Facilities like this exist, people like this exist, and \"Short Term 12\" tries its best to show the reality of the situation through a number of different possible scenarios.This movie is also quite a small production. It doesn't need a big-name director, crazy CGI, or a star-studded cast to succeed. It just relies on the \"old school\" qualities of a solid script, great acting from everyone, and a diverse range of characters that will give \"something to everyone\".Perhaps the biggest compliment I can give \"Short Term 12\"? I'm not just \"being nice\" to it because it is an independent film. It is more just the opposite...I'm marveling at how such a low- key movie can rank right up there among my favorites. Kind of a sad statement to make regarding the movie-producing business, which is so caught up right now in sequels and \"get 'em in the theater\" flicks. \"Short Term 12\" proves, however, that nothing over-the-top is needed to make a great film.",

To be clear, I cried twice while watching this. Twice. Maybe it's because I'm a little soft, but it represents life in a brilliantly beautiful light. The performances are all excellent; Katilyn Dever and John Gallagher Jr. are great, but Brie Larson is the real standout. In one of her earlier breakout roles, her performance as Grace is phenomenal. The supporting cast, including Raimi Malek, Stephanie Beatriz and Keith Standfield, is also extremely strong. What makes this film special though is the way that it is both incredibly moving yet also heartbreaking; to be honest, it may take a while for me to watch this film again. There are pivotal scenes difficult to watch, simply because they're so emotional. Short Term 12 is devastating, uplifting, inspiring, excellently cast, beautiful and one of my favourite films of all time.",

It's where kids go \"until the county figures out what to do with them.\"The director of Short Term 12 is Grace, portrayed well by Brie Larson. She's good at what she does, and she realizes that, given the situation, there will always be crises at the home.John Gallagher Jr. plays Mason, a seasoned staffer at the home, and Grace's partner. LaKeith Stanfield is Marcus, who will be 18 in a week, and will be leaving the home. Kaitlyn Dever plays Jayden Cole, the newest admission to the group home.A movie about a group home is going to be an ensemble film, with each of the residents having her or his role to play. However, the plot really centers around Grace, and her relationship with Mason and with Kendra. We see some great acting in the way Grace deals with her problems and with their problems. (It's not a triangle--it's Grace interacting with two important people in her life.)This is a powerful movie, and it has the ring of authenticity about it. I like that fact that it's called Short Term 12. There's probably a Short Term 11 and a Short Term 13. There's nothing special about Short Term 12, except that we know that all the residents and staff people have stories of their own. We get to see some of the stories of some of the people. If we went to Short Term 11, we'd see different stories. Director Cretton has taken us to Short Term 12, and has made these stories into an outstanding movie.Because most of the movie is set within the group home, the film works well on the small screen. The movie has an very high IMDb rating of 8.0. I thought it was even better than that, and rated it 9.",

Being released in the last week of August doesn't help matters. Anyhow, this small indie is utterly fantastic and is the best film of 2013. The realism plays a huge factor and so does the excellent screenplay, acting, and directing. Maybe this film will open eyes to those who have little knowledge about abused children in who are sent to group homes. This film is about character and emotion, good and painful emotions.This film is about life through the eyes of Grace, a twenty-something counselor at a group home who suffered from the same thing the children she takes care of does. She has a long-term relationship with a co-worker named Mason. But when one troubled girl named Jayden shows up, her life immediately begins to unravel.The acting is fantastic, especially Brie Larson. She should have been nominated for Best Actress. She adds soul to her character and the film does a good job in showing her character's dark past piece by piece. The film does feature other fine performances, namely John Gallagher Jr. as Mason, but no one comes close to Brie's fierce performance.Overall, Short Term 12 is an excellent film and a criminally underseen movie. This film is so realistic, one could almost view the movie as a documentary. But alas, this is the most powerful film of the year and that happens out of conversations and minimalistic action, which is a near impossible feat. Too bad this film was ignored by the Academy, because it deserved a boatload of nominations. I rate this film 10/10.",

In a performance that catapulted her to greater visibility, Brie Larson plays Grace, supervisor-cum-therapist to a small houseful of troubled youths. Grace seems to know the right approach to penetrating even the sturdiest veneer, but that understanding stems from similar incidents in her own past that she's never truly addressed. It can often seem easier to show others the way than to do the same for yourself, I suppose. Surrounding Larsen is an excellent set of supporting efforts, helmed by John Gallagher Jr. as her big-hearted secret boyfriend/coworker, but the real show-stealers are the kids themselves. Each touched with a turgid, tragic set of challenges all their own, they succeed at portraying mistrust, resentment, anger, helplessness... and, strikingly, an innate sense of community. Their complexities are the keys to this story, gateway to a dark world that many of us would never dare to explore on our own. Efficient, emotional, intense but not oppressive - tension-breakers arrive in all the right moments - this was a wonderful surprise, and something that's bound to stick with me for some time.",

I was pleasantly surprised that, although the film does essentially do these things, it does them in a way that works \u2013 that doesn't feel mawkish or exploitative towards the viewer.Set in short term housing for older \"disadvantaged\" children, we focus on a couple of the staff and a couple of the children as the main points for narrative, while at the same time life goes on with everyone else. The film does have a narrative through-line in terms of several of the characters and it does work, avoiding the potential shuffling and mumbling approach that it occasionally feels like it is going to do. The manner of delivery is what makes it though, since it never pushes too hard on buttons to make the viewer feel. The writing allows difficult characters to come out and for them to do so in a way that feels real and convinces. This is very important because the reason the film doesn't feel sentimental is that, although it does push things a little with music and the nature of shooting, the characters root the drama, so we always feel close to realism, not in a Hallmark channel movie.The shooting style is part of this and it is a beautiful film in terms of its deceptive simplicity. Visually we get a mix of clean but crisply framed shots but also close-ups for more intimate moments \u2013 it is a good mix and looks good through. The performances are a bigger part of it though and this is a film where a lot is understood by the cast and delivered. There are leads and supporting roles but generally everyone is very strong whether they carry the film or just carry one scene. Larson is the lead and I liked that she had plenty to work with. Okay I think the film let her character go a bit far in some ways, but she sells it and is engaging. Stanfield and Dever are very strong in their teenage roles, working with small touches and selling the larger moments of acting out.Short Term 12 is not without its fault and I will not pretend that it is without its own type of sentimentality at times (the ending I think was a bit of an easy way to bow out) but generally it is delicately crafted to engage, convince and move",

The way the film develops , no development happens in a way to make you care for whatever you're watching. I didn't care about these people , and the things that happened to them. Instead of caring , i got bored and wanted this film to end. And i wouldn't be that harsh a critic if this movie had a lower rating. Maybe a 6.5 rating , which makes it decent and indifferent which is exactly what it is ( not that there aren't movies i find great with a 6.5 rating , just speaking of average) But lately the newer movies , get high ratings easily.

As if Brie Larson wasn't enough, we are treated to Rami Malek, Kaitlyn Dever and LaKeith Stanfield. All of them were fantastic, and the on screen moments shared by Brie and Kaitlyn were so raw and touching, the real highlight of the film.I wouldn't necessarily say that Short Term 12 has a plot to comment on per se, more a collection of character arcs and explorations which are done so well. The characters were so well written, so delicately done and with great nuance and feeling. Particularly the characters of Grace played by Brie. Her performance was so sensitive, and understated, and absolutely perfect.I could go on about this film, but instead of wasting time reading my review just go ahead and watch it and enjoy a masterful hidden gem of a film.",

            "content": "Destin Daniel Cretton's film 'Short Term 12' is in my Top 5 films of the year. This candid look at life in a big group foster home for trouble kids is natural, endearing, and brutal all at the same time. I was completely moved and fell in love with each character in its 96 minute run-time, and didn't want to leave them when the credits started to roll. This film is more of an ensemble drama with Brie Larson and John Gallagher Jr. taking the more meaty roles. This captivating film will pull at the heart strings, but won't leave you depressed like so many of these similar films have done before. I cannot wait to see this again and again.Grace (Larson) plays one of several adults who work at a sort of compound for troubled kids - or group home. These kids are supposed to be placed here temporarily, but often get overlooked by the system and end up staying long term. The goal is to get these kids to a good family who loves them. One of the other counselors is Mason (Gallagher), who is an amazing and funny laid back guy and is secretly dating Larson. Mason is the kind of guy you want to be life long friends with.The counselors are told strictly to create a safe environment and make sure none of the kids are hurting themselves or others. They are not to act as therapists, friends, or doctors. However, we see Grace and her fellow colleagues going above and beyond to make these kids feel genuinely loved, because in fact, they do love each of them. And we see that these kids feel more comfortable with Grace and Mason as they let them in on some of their horrible past that they won't even tell their real doctors or therapists.For instance, one of the older children in the home, Marcus (Keith Stanfield), an 18 year old, allows Mason to hear a rap he's been working on, which details his childhood from his prostitute mother who made him sell drugs and then beat him. Or when newbie Jayden (Kaitlyn Dever) arrives at the home and does not want to be a part of the system, she eventually opens up about her abusive life to Grace in the form of a kid's story she wrote, that might just be all too familiar for Grace herself, and we being to see that the counselors might have more in common with their kids than meets the eye.Every scene will leave you breathless with its charm and drama, and will make you want to give each of these characters a long hug. What's so great is that, this never feels overly done or go into explicit dark territory. The moments feel real and genuine and while you might look at this story on paper and think, \"This is gonna be rough\", you'll come out the other side with a smile on your face and will be glad you took the ride.Brie Larson deserves an acting award for her role in this film. She is a top notch actor, who I feel can compete with Meryl Streep, Cate Blanchett, and Helen Mirren. Her wit and emotional breakdowns are true-to-life, and even when she might be making a mistake, we still love her. Gallagher Jr. is as always amazing to watch on screen. His comedic timing and ability to deliver a story is impeccable. And Cretton's direction is beautiful and magical, and shows every little quirk in these characters.'Short Term 12' might just be the best film of the year.",

Irrespective of the 'novelty' of the subject matter, clich\u00e9s abound here. The whispered scenes to show 'sincerity' between the characters (when oh when will directors realize that no people - no people on Earth - speak that way in real life?). Long, lingering scenes of the principal character (I watched for the full 97 minutes and never even bothered to listen to find out whatever her name is) in the shower cleansing away 'the pain'. And an innumerable number of scenes where someone whispers, 'We really need to talk about this...' 'You have no idea what I'm going through right now...' 'I can't help you if you won't let me in...' And as for the kid choosing to slash his wrists at 1 hour 15...man, having given this film that much of my time, I understood exactly why he did that.All in all, I feel I wasted my time watching this.

            "content": "As per the dictates of conventional Hollywood wisdom, films like Short Term 12 just don't get made. There's little to no demand, or so the argument would go, for a glum, tiny film about troubled kids trying to survive in a halfway house run by adults with just as many problems as their charges. It's precisely why Destin Cretton's smart, gritty film occasionally feels like a minor miracle, one so truthfully played that it manages to be painfully gloomy and unexpectedly uplifting at the same time.Grace (a wonderful Brie Larson) works at a foster-care facility that takes in troubled, frequently transient children without homes of their own (hence the title of the film: few kids wind up staying longer than twelve months). But even as she tries to soothe the churning darkness eating up kids like broody Marcus (Keith Stanfield) and mouthy Luis (Kevin Hernandez), she must come to terms with her own problems. When Jayden (Kaitlyn Dever) arrives at the facility, Grace finds herself getting dragged back into her own troubled emotional history. As a result, she pulls away from Mason (John Gallagher Jr.), her perhaps- boyfriend and colleague in the facility.Where Short Term 12 really works is in its careful, skilled development of its characters. At the film's heart sits Grace, who's barely older than some of the kids in her charge \u2013she presents a firm, comforting face to them, but hides beneath it her own reservoir of doubts and concerns. Her horrifying story is told in layers and chapters, peeled away as she gets closer to Jayden and pulls away from Mason.Even though Grace may take centre stage, and rightfully so, there's also plenty of room to explore the secret miseries and worries of even the most minor of characters. There's a story of extreme heartbreak tucked away in the form of Sammy (Alex Calloway), a boy who clings to his dolls and toys to avoid dealing with anything resembling the real world. The introduction of Nate (Rami Malek), a new colleague at the facility, allows the film to juxtapose the choices of the privileged against the predicaments of the underprivileged.In fact, Short Term 12 takes a good, hard look at the kids who usually get lost in the system: chewed up by bureaucracy and forgotten by the authorities, and typically assumed to be problematic and best left at the fringes of society. But the film suggests that, in this most unlikely, jail-like of environments, some kids can find the safety and comfort they need to grow up. It's a cycle, we soon realise, as we gain further insights into why Grace and Mason have wound up working where they do, in largely thankless jobs.Truthfully, Cretton's film falters in the home stretch. There is plenty of reason for hope and humanity in this world Cretton has created. But, for a film so unrelentingly realistic, it stumbles into an ending that seems almost too pat and too simple for the complex webs of relationships, problems and secrets it has otherwise so carefully woven.Laced through with an unswerving helping of hope, Short Term 12 is richer, smarter and darker than you might expect. Ostensibly, it's about bad kids making good, and that should be inspiring and bland in true Hollywood fashion. But, although the film drifts uncomfortably close to that territory in the end, it can be forgiven the digression for its insightful, effective exploration of so many big ideas about humanity and its capacity to survive pretty much anything.",

            "content": "Writer Director Destin Daniel Cretton created this full length feature from his Oscar nominated short by the same name. It is based on his own experiences of working with teenagers.Grace (Brie Larsen) plays the protagonist, the young supervisor of a group facility with young troubled teenagers. She with her boyfriend Mason (John Gallagher Jr) focus their attention on short-tempered talented rapper kid Marcus (Lakeith Stanfield). Grace builds an intimate bond with a new inmate Jayden (Katlyen Daver) to make her feel comfortable in the new home with other kids. In the process Grace learns about Jayden's abusive past through her metaphorical story of octopus and shark. The movie presents every day challenges of working at such facilities where abuse, emotional trauma, fights, self-harm, depression, fights etc. are common. A love story between Grace and Mason, both with a past of troubled kids themselves, is built in as a sub-plot.The director Daniel handles the subject with confidence, expertise, a keen-eye to detail, psychology and tenderness. Even though the movie is heart-breaking at places Daniel does not burden the screenplay with depressing heaviness and gives a heart-warming light feel throughout the movie.It is a short movie with 96 minutes running time and it is worth watching and one immediately connects with the main characters of the movie.The main led - Brie and John - were auditioned by Daniel via skype after sending them scripts via emails. The shooting of the movie took place only in 20 days with free flowing acts with main characters improvising on the dialogue and actions on their own. The movie is widely acclaimed and have won 35 awards and 70 nominations. Those who are working with NGO / NPO with less privileged people will definitely identify with the movie.I am going with 7.75 out of 10 for the movie",

            "content": "Ever since watching Room (2015) I've become a pretty big fan of Brie Larson. So when this movie came up as one of her better movies I figured I should give it a watch. I had very little idea what to expect, and I'm happy to say that I wasn't disappointed. Short Term 12 has an interesting idea that I haven't really seen. It's about underprivileged kids temporarily in a shelter while a new home for them is being searched for. It's primarily focused on the people running the shelter, and it's not just about them working with the kids. The characters are very well done. Like I said above, it's not just about them working with the kids. About half of it is about their outside lives, and half is about their work lives. But even if it'd been just about their jobs it still would have been great. Their characters are developed super well through their actors, all of whom deliver performances that make them feel genuine. They don't just feel like actors, they actually feel like real people. Their life struggles are realistic too, and while sometimes I felt like some characters were pouring themselves out anime-style (where they go into detailed explanations of their past), it was never pointless and it was in moderation. Plus they didn't include pointless details, everything about the characters pasts that were talked about were talked about briefly, like how a real person would tell their life story. But they only tell parts that are relevant, so it's nice that they didn't go into unimportant details like anime often does. The handful of children chosen to focus on are well- picked, as they are the ones who'd receive the most amount of attention. There's no real point in focusing on characters that don't cause any problems or need to be focused on, because most kids aren't horrible troublemakers. There will always be a select few though, and those are the ones focused on. Overall Short Term 12 just did everything right. It's got great characters that aren't perfect but still feel real and an interesting plot. I can see myself or anyone giving this movie an extremely high rating, but to me it just wasn't amazing. There's nothing wrong with it, it just isn't higher than an 8/10. In the end I'd definitely recommend this movie to just about anyone who cares about characters as much as I do.",

            "content": "A compassionate, honest perusal of teenage angst, Short Term 12 lays new ground rules for independent cinema and, in the process, delivers one of the most poignant films of last year.I'm trying to put into words the bliss I'm beginning to feel as my mind shifts back to the film. From a tremendously funny opening sequence to an achingly sad second, the shift of mood is one for the ages. Cretton finesses his story into the hustle and bustle of an institution for underprivileged, sexually-abused teens, who are trying to find meaning in their futile existence. The institution is managed by Grace, a twenty-something young woman, with her simpatico boyfriend, Mason. Grace and Mason run it like a weekend party - they talk, jest, sing, dance and engage into water fights and occasional games of baseball. When one of the kids cusses or brawls, they are curt and stern.It's like having parents your age, you know. I don't see their relationship with the kids any other way.Grace lays the rules down to a newbie intern, \"Remember, you're not their parent. You're not their therapist. You're here to create a safe environment, and that's it.\" Grace is conflicted. She's secretly pregnant, in love with Mason but she's too cloistered. She almost never talks about her thoughts on something, which miffs Mason though he understands.Mason is the guy everyone likes - kind, gentle, friendly and always funny. He tries to get Grace to talk to him, but she pushes him away. Not out of annoyance, but out of fear that she'll have to revisit her harrowing past.The arrival of a new girl, Jayden, changes a lot of things. Grace sees a younger version of herself in the dotty-mouth newcomer, and she's cautious. She wants to articulate her feelings to Jayden, who prefers to be alone, doodling. She doesn't take any crap from anyone, not even the dainty Grace, who wants to help her because she's lived through what the waspish Jayden's living through right now.Cretton handles the whole relationship delicately. Apart from providing sporadic comic reliefs, Jayden's character also provides a useful insight into the mindset of a neglected teen wanting to belong. Her inclination to claw herself to channel her inner rage is intelligible, and Cretton has observed it well. That's the kind of movie this is. It charms and ruffles you with its candid observations.But, you know, in all the teen flicks we've seen, the writer and director take liberties in knowing that it's a film after all. That's why these characters don't deal with situations pragmatically. And we enjoy watching what they do, but in some hidden nook of your mind, you'll say, \"That's never going to happen in real life. That's just sad.\"The thing is, whatever happens in Short Term 12, is real life for you. It's pragmatic, familiar and relatable. You won't doubt the authenticity of the world Cretton creates for even a split second, because he's been there. Based on his real-life experiences, Cretton aptly creates palpable world that's way too real. So real, in fact, that it's overwhelming. And to get lost in it is a thing of pure joy.The film vastly benefits from a near-perfect script made better by fluid direction and fantastically naturalistic performances. Cretton's script is witty and sympathetic, jumping from laugh-out-loud funny to melancholic so neatly that you'll be surprised it's a work of a debutant. It's a nicely textured piece of writing that's meticulous and profound. His direction is sincere, impelling us to mull over his characters and their problems, and urging us to try and figure out what we would've done if we were in their place. And that's something rare, a film that not only involves us as an audience, but also involves us as human beings.The casting works brilliantly. Young Brie Larson, whom you might remember as Jonah Hill's cranky girlfriend in 21 Jump Street, is a major revelation. The emotional detail in her performance is exceptional for a relatively unseasoned actress. And she has that strong screen presence that young actresses generally do not have so early in their careers. She's sweet, tough, fiery and understanding. And she makes Grace a character I'll remember for a long, long time.Gallagher shines in a role that looks so easy to pull off but is actually pretty hard. Mason is as conflicted as Grace, and while she acts her emotions out rather than talk about them, he does the exact opposite. It's a difficult character to write and play, and Gallagher does well, really well.The rest of the cast doesn't let us down. It's a solid acting ensemble that shows us that good films need good actors, not stars who think they can improve on a good script.Short Term 12 was my favorite English-language film of last year, a film made at a measly budget of less than a million and yet managed to shame many of the biggies I saw. It's passionate filmmaking you don't get to watch very often, and a spirited wake-up call for the revival of independent cinema. A film that is so quiet, entirely devoid of violence and shticks, theatrics and boredom. A film that is emotive, gladdening, affectionate and empathic. A film that needs to be watched and cherished. A monumental achievement in itself.In a year of discoveries, I think we may have found the biggest one. Remarkable.",

The screenplay, the acting, the cinematography, direction, editing etc. make us observe such issues realistically. Issues that we may be aware of but not on such a personal level. Cretton was inspired to write Short Term 12 based on his own experience of working in a group facility for teenagers. This, in line with the superb performances on and off screen, gave the film a realness that is rare. Many directors don't write the films that they direct. Many that do create a fictional premise. With ST12, Cretton uses first hand experience and it translates impeccably. His writing is excellent, and evokes a platform for the actors. The acting is spectacular. It's not a film that announces at any point that it's based on real life/true events. It doesn't need the audience to consider this because of its rawness.",

After some incident Grace and Jayden begin to merge in emotionally for having a similar kinda previous events. Grace gets disturbed and her life begins to trouble the present. With all this, how she gonna face the current situation is the movie to be told in the remains.It had a very good opening sequence.

            "content": "In \"Short Term 12,\" Brie Larson gives a breakout performance as Grace, a young woman who supervises a temporary housing clinic for troubled youth. One of her co-supervisors also happens to be her boyfriend, played by John Gallagher in another excellent performance. Grace, who herself is trying to recover from a troubled, abusive past, finds her emotions overwhelming her when the clinic takes in a teenage girl whose life circumstances are scarily similar to her own.The film has an authentic vibe to it that helps it avoid many of the pitfalls that would have plagued it had it been more of a Hollywood version of the same story. It does feel obligated to give us a happy, or at least hopeful, ending that doesn't exactly feel obligatory but doesn't feel completely authentic either. I don't know that in the real world kids who have been what the kids in this movie go through really ever come out of it o.k. in the end. But the performances are so good, and the film itself so assured, that it's not hard to overlook any nitpicky flaws.The film is bookended by scenes of John Gallagher's character telling stories about some of the kids who have lived at the clinic, and they are little masterpieces of naturalistic acting, perfectly capturing both the challenges and rewards inherent in devoting one's life to the kind of work the main characters devote themselves to in the movie.Grade: A",

So far I've watched a full hour of the 90 minute movie and seriously I cannot name a single one of the characters.We have beardy guy who tells an opening tell of following an escaped kid off campus and then beardy poops himself on the bus. It gets interrupted by a kid trying to sprint off grounds.That is the high point of the long dull tale. No joke.Then we meet the kids (names not remembered at all). The story then drags on in a dreamy Jiggly Cam manner for 50 more minutes. We meet the black untalented rapper who mumbles (that's his entire characterization). We meet the self-cutter girl who has zero value to the story until an hour later when she tells a rip-off octopus & shark themed knockoff tale of \"The Giving Tree\". The main female staff character reveals she is pregnant with beardy guy's baby and has no value to the story for about 60 minutes into it and the camera follows her every dull minute of existence.These characters are shallower than beer coasters and less interesting than anything that you'd find written on a beer coaster.You can keep about 8 minutes of the movie start, cut out 50 minutes of the movie after that and lose nothing at all. It picks up at about 65 minutes in, but frankly I think any audience not watching this on Cable TV or the Internet has all walked away by now. In fact, I am walking away from this movie after enduring 73 minutes of DULL DULL DULL moron-characters. It has no reward so far for enduring it at all.",

Cretton's actors are naturalistic, his camera intimate, and his plot unfolds with quiet wisdom. This is a director who has something honest to say about troubled homes, abused children, and the uphill battles social workers face in \"rehabilitating\" the flotsam and jetsam washing up against their doors.Unfortunately, whatever nuance the film's first half possesses disappears almost entirely in its second half. In search of a climax, Cretton cooks up a formulaic subplot involving pregnancies, commitment fears and a jailed father, and an attempted suicide feels wholly contrived. The film's \"blame the parent\" philosophy is likewise reductive, Cretton's cast all blaming mommy and daddy as the ultimate progenitors of all anguish, larger causal forces be damned.The film's aesthetic itself increasingly drifts too heavily into \"indie-film\" territory, with pseudo-\"poetic\" cutting and that cutesy score which pops up in every low-budget Sundance outing. On the flip-side, actors John Gallagher, Brie Larson and Keith Stanfield are uniformly excellent, and the film contains a nice subplot involving the use of art (rap, drawing, writing, music etc) as a means of either escape or personal therapy. \"Short Term 12\" was nominated for three Independent Spirit Awards.7.5/10 - See \"Martha Marcy May Marlene\", \"Away from Her\" and \"Capturing the Friedmans\".",

The screenplay (which began as Cretton's thesis project at grad school which he THEN turned into a short film before adapting it to feature length material) is incredibly nuanced and perceptive. The audience slowly learns just how similar the kids and adults are and the way this unfolds is simply magnificent, wonderfully executed. Art, for example, is a frequent commonality which subtly connects both the adults and kids. Creativity is clearly something to which Cretton can relate and this effortlessly shines through the story, its characters and film as a whole. The acting by legitimately every single person is outstanding and honestly, this film just finds a way to move you in so many ways. Thank you Destin Daniel Cretton for this wonderful work of art - I loved every second of it.",

A lot of this film is dealing with how life's struggles can really pile up and how its never a good thing to keep feelings and thoughts bottled up, Thus this film delivers a valuable life lesson along the way.

I didn't find the film that I wanted in Short Term 12. The film that I found in Short Term 12 was exactly the one was I feared to find since the beginning. A film without any ambition other than being a smaller version of the Hollywood industry.I mean, that story of someone taking care of a place with a bunch of mentally prejudiced people isn't something exactly fresh. And the characters were way too boring. Too normal, conventional. Even the 'mad' youngsters were uninteresting, mainly because of their generic acting skills. Jayden character was so far the most interesting in the whole film. Katlyn Dever brought energy to her character, something that all the others, in the way I see it, couldn't accomplish.I also didn't liked the sketchy music and some moments of the film seemed way too clich\u00e9d and manipulative. All the situation with Marcus cutting himself(character that had a wasted potential in the story) was forced in my opinion. Artistically, Short Term 12 is a very limited film.But the high points of the film are worthy. I really liked Jayden's character and the film's approach in a 'character study'. The only problem, a big problem, is in the characters, that aren't interesting. 6.6/10",

At first Grace seems to have everything well in hand, she is incredible at her job, interesting as a person and very easy to root for. Grace's life starts to get turned upside down when a string of occurrences, including the intake of a young troubled teen girl that reminds her of herself, begins to unravel feelings that she has been ignoring for years. The acting in Short Term 12 is completely incredible, every character from the small back ground roles to the main players are all completely believable, so much so that it sometimes feels like it could be a documentary. Saying that, this film is not going to fit everyone's tastes, there are no explosions or chase scenes, well, actually there are a few chase scenes, but not like anything you would see in a Hollywood movie. What Short Term 12 does have is heart, mounds and mounds of pure film lovers heart. So much so that when the last words were spoken and the credits rolled, all I could say to myself was, \"WOW!\" So do yourself a favor, give this small movie a chance, it may do you some good, or at least, make you appreciate what you have or had as a teenager. 5 Beards Out Of 5",

To see parents ignore, disown and even abuse their own flesh and blood, well, it doesn't make for an easy watch. In fact it might just be the worst. But Short Term 12 painted these teenagers in what I can only describe as the most appropriate watercolours possible. Bright vivid characters blending their sorrow and optimism together to produce beautiful personalities. We follow a group of carers, in particular a troubled young adult named Grace, in their daily lives of facilitating a healthy and safe environment for youths that are in need of care.This is one of those films that I've been avoiding for a few months now. Initially, I felt I had to mentally prepare myself. With many claiming they instantly bursted into tears, I was not ready for that. Having now watched these glistening characters for ninety minutes, only one word was on my mind after the credits rolled. Perfection. It is extremely rare, a near impossible achievement, to find a lucrative drama that exhumes every emotional stance available. Short Term 12 did. Not only that, but it made me substantially appreciate the work and effort that child carers put in every single day. An incredible and somewhat heroic job that Cretton intimately crafts through his delicate screenplay. He illustrates the very best of humanity within these characters, from the joyous opportunities that life has to offer to various days of darkened solitude.It would be an understatement to claim that this is so far away from exhibiting Hollywood clich\u00e9s, with absolutely no exposition and unnecessary quirky narrations. No. This is real life. Cretton gracefully opens a window, allowing us to peer into the struggles and opportunities these children and carers uphold. Frighteningly realistic. Every second builds upon the harshness of reality, gradually laying the foundations of each teenager's backstory. Abuse leads to self-harming. Ignorance leads to depression. Cretton does not avoid these scenarios, rather he tackles them head on. Further illustrating the importance of parenthood and how children rely on that unconditional love.Grace, who experienced a troubled past herself, symbolises the ever-lasting hurt one can receive from atrocious parenting. It never dissipates. All she can do is attempt to move on, distract herself by assisting others who unfortunately succumbed to the same harrowing treatment. Heartbreaking.Larson, in what was her first leading role, was incredible. One of the finest performances I have ever witnessed for such an emotionally complicated character. Whether it be an outburst of pure anger, tears of mental melancholy or smiles of genuine happiness. Larson transformed into her role without any physical alterations. This performance alone has changed my mind about her as an actress. Actually, every cast member was exceptional. Gallagher Jr. balances the smartly executed light comedic moments with a dosage of relationship woes, supporting Larson's performance magnificently. Even the teenagers, particularly a young Stanfield and Devers, captured the fragility and delicate nature of their troubled personalities. A tangible environment that hinges on an intricately sustainable aura that, if altered in some way, could turn the very best day into the absolute worst.Cretton's direction reflects an indie touch to each camera movement, with two tear-inducing scenes highlighting his powerful talent. Stanfield's one take rap, lyrically illustrating his anguish and hurt in being disowned, not only made me shed a tear but it was confidently executed by ensuring the camera never looks away from his face, in particular his eyes. The second is Devers' story about an octopus giving up her arms for a \"friendly\" shark. This time Cretton switches the camera between the three angles. The illustrations in her story, Devers' innocent storytelling and Larson's shocked face. A perfect culmination in building emotional depth from just one scene. Masterful. Oh, and I cried. Full on waterworks.I've had the night to reflect upon this dramatic endeavour, and the more I think about it, the harder it is to criticise. Therefore I came to the abrupt conclusion that for me, this film is faultless. It is an incredible work of art that immediately draws you in with its personable characters, human qualities and harrowing themes. So, without further ado, let's get the inevitable final sentence out of the way. I've been low-key excited to say this...! Short Term 12 obtains that elusive perfect rating.",

            "content": "The film is set in a short term foster-care facility for at-risk teens and follows trials and tribulations of the teens living their and staff members Grace (Larson) and Mason (Gallagher Jr.) who take care of them. When a new child arrives at the facility, it forces Grace to confront her troubled past whilst continuing her struggle in preparing soon-to-be 18 Marcus (Keith Stanfield) for life outside of the care facility. The film is inspired by Cretton's experience of working in a foster-care facility for young people and this helps the film tell an emotionally honest and heart-wrenching story, avoiding most of the tropes and clich\u00e9s common in these type of films. It was met with critical acclaim when was first released and won the Grand Jury Narrative Feature Award and the Narrative Audience Award at South by Southwest Film festival. Short Term 12 features masterful storytelling, its tightly scripted with natural everyday dialogue that comes across as real and improvised and is cemented by true to life , seemingly effortless and naturalistic form of acting with performances so-convincing it almost makes you feel like your watching a documentary. There are no one dimensional characters in the film and each feel authentic. In particular Brie Larson gives a impressive and awe-inspiring performance as grace a caring and loving young women with heavy baggage from her past locked up tight and bursting at the seams due to her inability to trust and open up to people. She was nominated for numerous accolades for her performance in the film and won Gotham Independent Film Award for Best Actress. The two scenes that bookend the film were particularly interesting. The film opens with Mason telling Nate (a new worker in the facility) and Jessica an embarrassing and comedic story of his first week working at the facility. This excellently establishes the friendships between the characters with natural interaction between them which is a pleasure to watch. Before mason finishes telling the story, a child in his underpants with American flag wrapped around him like a Cape, busts out and makes a run for the exit. The ending scene also contains mason telling a funny story and again the story is interrupted by Sammy running for the exit. This excellently reinforces the naturalistic style of the film as it shows the audience that the narrative includes the everyday struggles of the characters and that there are no easy solutions. Additionally the scenes are similar but the differences effectively showcase how things have subtly changed. It particular they show how our relationship to the characters have evolved. at the start of the movie, we were in the shoes of Nate (not knowing what to expect) . At the end, we are more familiar with the characters and have a better understanding of what happens at the facility. The film is shot predominantly using hand-held cameras and consists mostly of medium and close-ups shots.The shots are tightly framed and this help make the viewer feel as close to the emotions on screen as possible. The camera is a patient, unobtrusive presence among the characters and the almost observational style also strengthens the audience's emotional connection to the characters in the film. Though some may criticize the rather convenient and perfect intertwining of individual narratives and struggles throughout the film as well as its irrepressible sense of optimism, I feel the film sticks to his naturalistic style effectively, never becoming melodramatic or unbelievable. The various revelations that occur throughout the film come to us organically in characters' conversation and it has beautifully crafted lighting which gives a warm glow to the film and a beautiful sense of optimism. In the hands of a less talented director, the film could have felt overly-sentimental and syrupy but instead feels brutally honest with the right amount of grit and grace. In closing short term 12 is a marvel of a film. It is perfectly scripted piece of drama that features wonderful performances and a genuine and heartfelt story that will stick with you long after you watch the film.",

Obviously some aspects of life in a group home for at-risk teenagers may have been softened and sweetened to fit the requirements of a 90-minute indie film that doesn't set out to be totally tragic, like something by the Dardenne brothers or Ken Loach. Brie Larson is both appealing and convincing as Grace, an empathetic and effective staffer who starts to lose it after she bonds with a new resident (beautifully played by Kaitlyn Dever with just the right amount of prickly reserve) whose case history reminds her too much of her own. Good work by John Gallagher Jr. (\"The Newsroom\") as her coworker/secret boyfriend; typical of the tight script that he's given a backstory that seems just right for his character. Nice too to see an indie film where the characters are something more than love-starved geeks or aimless hipsters.

            "content": "There seem to be a lot of movies coming out in the past few years centering on young adults going through terrible hardships and learning a whole lot about life in the process. Short Term 12 aims to give the weary viewer a bit of a different look at this type of story. The movie centers around a group home and the at risk teens who reside there as well as the adults who work there who are not much older than the residents. What sounds like an emotional sob story is really a headfirst dive into the lives of these people and puts them is a light that is more about understanding and less about exploitation.The cast while not filled with well known names is extremely well rounded. These characters have to read as real people, and not as famous actors trying to make you forget that they were on Conan last night. For a group of relatively unknowns the realism achieved in these performances is impressive. The kids each feel like they are individuals while the adults have relate able insecurities of their own. The stand out performance here is from Brie Larson, who after this and the recent release of Room is becoming a top young actress. This was a role that she could have overplayed or taken the movie over, but she falls right into this one and takes a complicated character and puts a perfect performance on the screen.Writer/Director Destin Daniel Cretton is a name I had not heard of before this but I am sure this is not the last time I will. Movies like Short Term 12 have a problem where these characters that seem to have a perfect understanding of life and like to wax poetically about it for about an hour and a half. Short Term 12 is written to show that all of these characters are lost in some way. Even the people who are there to help these teens are not even close to having things figured out, but are trying their best, wish is all the world can really ask of you. As a director Cretton knows how to shoot an indie. It is a quiet movie that makes you feel as if you are there in the room with these characters. Instead of being filled with what I like to call \"emotional porn\" it tries to put the viewer in the shoes of the characters, rather than spending the movie feeling sorry for them.Short Term 12 is not an easy movie to watch for all the right reasons. It takes you out of your life for a bit and puts you into this world, where everything is not great, but as the movie goes on you will realize that you are not so different from some of these people. Everyone has problems, that you can guarantee, and Short Term 12 attempts to show that even if you think no one out there understands you or what is going on in your life, there is someone who knows what its like and they are more than likely willing to help. Movies should not be sad for the sake of being sad or uplifting for the sake of being uplifting.

            "content": "There are only a couple of movies that made me feel the way that \"Short Term 12\" did. This powerful and moving story takes place a foster-care facility for at-risk teenagers where both kids and some elements of the staff had some rough moments in their childhood, being displaced from a parent or even abducted. Grace is a 20-something supervisor that works alongside with her longtime boyfriend, Mason. Grace always kept her problems away from everyone but with the arrival of a new girl, named Jayden, her life will never be the same again. While trying to help Jayden, Grace has to remind herself of the troubles that she had in her childhood and with the help of Mason and Jayden she will find the courage that she needs to face at last the problems that bother her for a long time. \"Short Term 12\" shows a reality that is unknown for a lot of people. It's about fighting for survival and about growing up. It was so wonderful to watch and I felt connected to the story right from the beginning. The acting was so amazing and I am still astonished about how great was to watch Grace dealing with her problems while she was helping Jayden. For those children, hope was almost gone and therefore the staff task was sometimes really hard to accomplish. Grace and Mason chemistry was one of the strongest points of the film, because the way that they solved their problems together gives a touch of romance that gives power to the story (\"It's because you are the weirdest, most beautiful person that I've ever met in my whole entire life.\"). \"Short Term 12\" it's a another proof of the great quality of indie movies and it reaches your heart with this moving and touching story. Because sometimes, when you think there is no hope left for you, you just have to keep fighting for your life. \"Short Term 12\" it's a ride filled with drama, joy and moving moments.",

            "content": "'SHORT TERM 12': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five) Critically acclaimed indie drama film about a foster-care facility for troubled youths and the people who run it. It was written and directed by Destin Cretton and is adapted from his own 2008 short film of the same name. It stars Brie Larson, John Gallagher Jr., Kaitlyn Dever, Rami Malek and Keith Stanfield. The movie is absolutely heartbreaking and depressing at times but ultimately uplifting. A very impressive accomplishment for Cretton as well as Larson in the lead.The film centers on Grace (Larson), a counselor in her twenties who has a troubled past of her own. She works at a foster-care for 'at-risk teenagers' and is in a romantic relationship with another counselor there named Mason (Gallagher, Jr.). She also just learned that she's pregnant. This combined with the drama of the kids, she's working with, is becoming too much for her. One kid, Marcus (Stanfield), is about to turn 18 and be released from the facility. He's having a lot of trouble with this. Grace also bonds with a new teen she's now in charge of named Jayden (Dever). Jayden and Grace have experienced similar trauma, involving people they trusted, that brings them closer together.The movie seems really realistic and true to life and brings together a lot of different types of people with similar problems. It's very touching and at times almost too depressing but like all great drama it manages to find the light in the darkness (which is what truly makes films like this special). Larson is very pretty and talented but I've only seen her in supporting roles before this (like 'SCOTT PILGRIM VS. THE WORLD', 'THE SPECTACULAR NOW' and 'DON JON'). She really does an outstanding job in the lead here; her character is very relatable and admirably strong (despite her past abuse). Cretton did a very good job of coming up with such a believable screenplay and bringing all these characters to life (the supporting cast is all more than decent as well). It's definitely a very memorable and moving film.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAydMPYt0Hs",

Broken people who as usual once they are \"reformed\" mostly end up working to help \"reform\" other broken people, it's just how the cycle works to repair itself. In this story we have a great cast of counseling staff, and some very distant but obviously caring Doctors, and a mixed up bunch of over all really good kids who are all in need of real help, and support. All three levels are played by a supreme fringe cast of people who are all just about to break out in the real world, and this movie is going to nothing but improve their chances. The two lead female rolls are two young women you will see more, and more of in the next few months, and if they make the right moves they could do very very well. The story is a nice one, not a light fluffy tale about bunnies, but a real life tale of Monsters, and the only way to really get away, if you ever do. (I hope you do) I really Enjoyed the movie for the cast, and the skill in portraying these broken people who all understand how to help others, but not themselves as we all are. The story was good, short I think, but it had all of the needed elements so why drag on? I would recommend this film to anyone out there who will admit to being a bit broken, and especially to those who won't admit there is a problem, you need this movie. (heck you need help)",

            "content": "Short Term 12 is a good movie with a well written plot and a stellar cast. The performances are without a doubt the highlight, everyone gives it their all. Every piece of dialogue is delivered with pure realism, there is no sense of acting, the best scenes are without a doubt those between Brie Larson and John Gallagher Jr., there chemistry was superb. Neither of them was afraid to unleash themselves to the other. I was, however, disappointed by the ending, as it ends without us getting much of a sense of where these characters are headed, there is not much progression to their lives. It is practically the exact same as it is in the beginning. It starts the same way as it ends, which some people probably loved, but I felt it contradicted everything that occurred prior. As well as that, Grace never seems challenged, she seems perfectly capable of handling every problem that comes her way. There is no moment where the character is really struggling and loses her strong demeanor, never a moment where she loses all hope, which should occur to every movies protagonist in order to gain the viewers support. I felt the intimacy of the film was what made it unique, taking place almost entirely within the facility, which was certainly a clever way to make us form a bond with these characters. Sweet, dramatic and well acted, Short Term 12 has its flaws but makes up for it with what it does right, I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good drama. Grace works in a shelter for young people where she finds herself struggling to juggle her work and love life. Best Performance: Brie Larson",

            "content": "Trigger Warning(s): Cutting & Attempted SuicideA friend of a friend recommended this film and after seeing the trailer, featuring so many familiar faces, I thought \"why not?\" After all, we have Brie Larson who has really just grown into a great and diverse actress; Rami Malek who I wish was in more things since I have been following his career since The War at Home was on air; and then we have, from Brooklyn Nine-Nine, albeit not in a big speaking role, Stephanie Beatriz. Characters & StoryThe title of the movie Short Term 12 is about this place which seemingly is supposed to act as a temporary foster facility. At said facility are the line workers Grace (played by Brie Larson), Mason (played by John Gallagher, Jr.), Jessica (played by Stephanie Beatriz), and Nate (played by Rami Malek). Together, they help monitor at least a dozen kids who are in this home for various reasons. The two main kids they focus on though are Marcus (played by Keith Stanfield) and Jayden (played by Kaitlyn Dever).Now, it should be noted that in the story they don't go easy on the teen/ child actors at all and they very much deal with what is considered \"adult emotions/ situations.\" There is a lot of talk of abuse, a showing of scars and bruises, and the story, especially for Grace, deals with the trauma which is dealt with even decades after the abuse ends. But, at the same time, there is a strong showing of how loved ones, even those not blood related, can make a bad situation better, or at least be there to keep them from getting worse.PraiseIn general, I try to keep these reviews under a 1000 words, but to really properly praise this film I might need more than that. So, let me try to summarize the best I can. Starting off with Brie Larson, I think most of the praise and admiration Jennifer Lawrence is getting right now, should definitely be shared with Brie Larson. Taking nothing away from Lawrence, Larson quickly brings you into Grace's life and keeps you in awe. In awe that despite it all, she can smile; despite it all she can love; and though I have no idea what Larson may have been through in her life, her taking on this role gave me the type of empathy in which I was crying, worrying about any future children I could have, and I swear to you I was getting depressed for her.And on that note, I must say I did like how Larson portrayed someone with a mental illness and didn't try to make it quirky, or even how the writer/ director Destin Cretton didn't write the mental illness to be something so debilitating that it stopped her from life. I mean, yes, she struggles being in a relationship, and even around kids who could be triggers, but despite all that happened, she still pushes on. And it was also nice to see a boyfriend who wasn't blindly supportive, but seemed to actual fit the type of emotions you'd imagine yourself having if you were in love with someone who was trying their best, but sometimes cracking under pressure.Leading me to talk about the two kids, or young people, Keith Stanfield and Kaitlyn Dever. Like I said in the Standing Up review, it is so rare that actors of juvenile age are allowed complex emotions that it makes it so when you see a child struggle with insecurity, past abuse, or other issues, it is so heart breaking. I mean, just thinking about these two actors performances have me panting like I was the one running, even if what I was running from was miles away. Stanfield's character, for example, in itself could have been its own movie, albeit it might mirror Precious, but stories like that do need to be told. And then with Dever, through her we see Larson's character Grace and the parallel is written so well that I'm mad at myself that I didn't hear about this movie while it was in theaters.CriticismReally, the only issue for me was that Grace gets pregnant in the film, and be it the fact Grace dresses in baggy clothes or consistency issues, she goes from once scene in which we can see a baby bump to her seeming like she isn't as far along as we thought. Also, I must admit, as much as I loved Larson and the other actors/characters aforementioned, I did feel that the shine they got was at the expense of everyone else. Malek and Beatriz essentially are just there, and while you understand not everyone can be given a developed background/ story, after you finish the film you do wonder about the other kids and staff there.Overall: Must SeeI don't care if it is on TV, VOD, Rental, or what have you, you should see Short Term 12. This is such a good indie film, one which shows what happens when the talent comes and is ready to work, and not simply the talent comes because of the money and that extrinsic motivation which comes from monetary gain. For, to me, this film is one of the few I would ever consider to almost be a ten, and though admittedly I'm sure this elation will dissipate, I doubt my admiration for Brie Larson after this film will. To me, this is definitely the type of film which makes you a fan.",

This is what group homes look like.I did this job for years. I've worked in several group homes and been a social worker for 10 years. I've been interested in helping \"the underprivileged\" since I was a small child myself. This interest has made me view almost every film I could come across dealing with social workers or underprivileged teens/adults. This is, BY FAR, the most accurate adaptation I have seen to date. The way the children blow up unexpectedly and have to be \"restrained\" is a day to day (if not hour to hour) occurrence in these settings. I remember my first summer, at age 19, chasing a child down the street for hours because it's true, you can't keep them there, they aren't prisoners. But you ARE supposed to maintain a safe environment. So them leaving, is not safe. So you chase them, and try to reason with them. Getting spit on? If that's the worst thing that happens to you, it's a good day. The scene where Grace blows up at her boss for not taking her report of child abuse on a resident seriously? It is ALL too real, and made my stomach hurt to watch. I could write for hours about the things that have happened working in places like this, but that's not the point.This film shows what working in a place like this is like. For the kids, and for the all too naive employees. I don't think this is meant to be a cinematic masterpiece, but it shows something very real. I hope this gives a GLIMPSE of what social workers give there lives for on a daily basis.I only take away from a 10 rating because I feel the development of relationships was rushed. In reality, you would never disclose your own abuse to a client, especially so early on, and teenagers of abuse don't tend to be very receptive to ANY authority figures, especially after only a few days. Regardless, it still is the best representation of this kind of work that I have seen so far, and for that, I am appreciative!",

So, I've read small reviews from people I know praising this movie and Brie Larson's acting in particular, it got me intrigued, so I thought I could check it out. Man, what a right choice. I'm no movie critic, but I loved this movie so much that I just wanted to write a small piece for anyone deciding if they should spend an hour and a half of their lives watching it, my advice is: absolutely, drop everything you're doing and watch it. Brie Larson's Grace is amazing, she has a past that still torments her, but she decided to make the best of it by helping these hopeless kids with such a motherly nature, she's soft and cool, she knows how to handle them and doesn't back off easily, or at all; she has flaws, doesn't always make the right decisions, but you see her struggle and try. Her co-worker and long-term boyfriend is the sweetest, they're made for each other, and everything they do is genuine. Those two actors are pretty damn good if you ask me, they just deliver every single thing with such heart, it's almost impossible not to believe them. The supporting characters are also really good, Keith Stanfield is amazing as Marcus and I've found out is also a talented musician, his track at the end of the film is really cool. The girl playing Jayden, the new kid (who I remember from a small part in The Spectacular Now, also a really great film) has some troubles, her mother just died and she's not giving her father such an easy time, per say. The connection between her and Grace is palpable, and their scenes together are gut-wrenching. I don't exactly know how this type of places work, I don't know if this is portrayed accurately or a little pink-colored, but there's no denying that this is the movie with the biggest heart I've seen in a very long time, excluding The Spectacular Now. Give it a shot, in my experience, I can say that it might remind you not to be so hard on yourself and everyone else the whole time. Be kind, everyone is going through some sort of struggle at the time, why waste time being mean when you can not be? This makes a must-see for me. I hope it is for you too.",

If you have a mind then please exercise it more by watching paint dry - it will be far more enthralling. The kids are not really kids but young adults trying to play them. The carers are also all young adults pretending to be mature. But genuine human reactions are either simply ignored or more probably not even understood by the cast or production team. For example in one scene, where a very disturbed adolescent is robbed of his treasured toys, the carers simply sit next to him and sympathize with words or a touch on the shoulder. He is plainly distressed but no one thinks of giving him a cuddle or a tickle to make him laugh or at least smile. It is as if real human care doesn't exist anymore - and had that been the them of the film it would have been more interesting. But as it is the film seems to project the media comfortable image that modern child care is entirely healthy and that all we need to do is tell the kids they can achieve anything they want in life given the right effort.

This isn't a sign of sloppy film-making however, it's actually genius. Not exactly a coming of age but a coming of character.

Connecting emotionally is not a challenge with this film, you'd have to be a psychopath to not feel empathy or understanding towards every character we meet.\nIt's a film where every moment captured speaks for itself, it's subtle and simplistic yet speaks a tremendous amount of volume to not just its subject matter but to what it is to be a human who feels, everyone can take something from this film in some way, big or small.

Now my question is, all those years working with troubled kids, and this for some reason is the first girl she met that was sexually abused or self-harming and thus triggered her memories of her own abuse? Okay even ignoring that, maybe she just saw her younger self in the girl due to their slight resemblance but even then...This movie was very superficial. I kept waiting for them to delve deeper into the characters and their backstories but they never do. Grace finally reveals that her dad abused her at the end of the film and is now in jail, but that is as deep as the story gets. Also at one point Marcus mentions his mother hit him on the head, Grace is being abused by her dad (very vaguely talked about) and Grace's boyfriend was raised by foster parents. This paragraph is pretty much the entire movie's action summed up! Oh also the redhead kid is mentally ill and his therapist takes away his sister's dolls, leading him into a depression.As someone who is actually familiar with the institution they are depicting, there were much deeper and more interesting stories they could have told. They did not even scratch the surface. It was more like a \"feel-good\" story about making the best of a bad situation but I just couldn't get past the shallowness of it all.

It starts on one counselor's first day as he listens to a funny story from a tenured counselor about a former kid they looked after. In what quickly becomes standard for the plot, the story is interrupted by one child who makes a run for the gates, hoping to escape the center. The counselors rush to catch him, and hold him down as he gets his frustration out, at which point the tenured counselor finishes his story, which ends rather unfortunately in the death of the child who was the subject of the story.The film continues this pattern in an organic way that mimics life itself rather beautifully: things become happy, then sad, then the happy thing you thought was going to end well sometimes does and sometimes doesn't, the message being you have to live for the beautiful moments because life is full of crap sometimes.You might think \"Wow this sounds preachy and cheesy\" and I don't think you'd be wrong.

It feels like a documentary. It moves slowly but at the same time nothing feels forced. I totally feel for the main characters and even cried once. If anything the emotions are sort of downplayed and not forced on us.I hardly noticed the shaky cam, it definitely did not reduce my enjoyment of the film. It sort of amplified the low budget feel of the film. Actually much of the cinematography is quite lovely. It gives you that fly on the wall feeling where you are observing but not really judging.I suspect that some of the people that ripped the film apart are effected by the subject matter. They may have feelings of abandonment or not feeling loved growing up that they haven't dealt with. Being part of the foster care system must be very painful in itself. As must be having been sexually abused or feeling suicidal and not ever getting to deal with it. Short Term 12 is an important film. It brings up a lot of issues that cause us pain in our youth as well as when we grow into adults. The stories of the residents were more interesting to me then the counselors however. I would have preferred more about the kids and less about the counselors.",

            "review_title": "Short Term 12 feels like home",
            "content": "Short Term 12 opens with a story that lets us know immediately how irrational and threatening the charges at the titular care facility can be, how scary the job is, and how bleak prospects are for children upon leaving the facility. It sets itself up perfectly to be a Hilary Swank save-the-kids vehicle filled to the brim with plenty of crying scenes, lives changing for the better, and other assorted white savior nonsense. But instead, the film unfolds delicately and organically, never playing up the drama or belittling its characters or ingratiating the audience; director Destin Cretton has crafted a marvelously intimate and observant masterpiece that reaffirms what a powerfully emotional and cathartic medium cinema can be when filmmakers eschew cheap tricks in favor of intelligent, realistic and heartfelt storytelling.First-day employee Nate (Rami Malek) is our window into the isolated, fascinating world of Short Term 12, a home where at-risk adolescents can stay for up to a year - though some, like soon to be released Marcus (Keith Stanfield), have been there much longer. Jessica (Stephanie Beatriz) and secret couple Grace and Mason (Brie Larson and John Gallagher, Jr.) round out the line staff, who are instructed not to play the role of therapist but merely to maintain a safe environment for their charges and keep them in check. A new arrival (Kaitlyn Dever) shakes things up both at the facility and in Grace's personal life as her familiar battle scars threaten to dredge up events in Grace's past that she would rather not confront.Larson is unrecognizable here. She comes across much older than her 23 years, weighed down by the weary maturity of a girl who grew up too fast. As compassionate and sisterly as Grace is with her charges, Larson's deadened eyes and perennial half-smile suggest hidden darkness and pain that she slowly and surgically reveals at exactly the right moments. But the greatest strength of her performance is the way she executes her explosive arc flawlessly while never stealing attention away from her costars. John Gallagher, Jr., Keith Stanfield and Kaitlyn Dever are assigned the stock roles of nice guy, rebellious black kid and sultry goth girl but all do so much to add layer upon layer to their characters until they are as complex and well-defined as Grace is. Stanfield and Dever in particular are revelations, delivering the film's most heartbreaking moments in the form of a violently angry rap and a disturbingly metaphoric children's story. Larson is at the center of all this, but the beauty of her performance is that no matter how much Grace is struggling in these scenes, she never draws the focus to herself and blends quietly and perfectly into the ensemble. There are plenty of high-emotion and high-volume scenes like Dever and Stanfield's respective breakdowns, but Cretton weaves the film with a steady hand and a level head - it never gets overwhelming and in spite of some questionable plot developments in the third act he maintains a measured state of earthy normalcy. His even direction, coupled with the natural performances and a shrewd, quiet sense of humor in the writing about the characters' hysterics and interactions, take what could have been overcooked to the point of after-school special melodrama and make it play out like a regular day in the life of these characters. Montages of the kids' day-to-day activities, throwaway shots of people sitting or playing together, wards looking at their birthday cards or redecorating their bedrooms - it's the simple things that carry the most meaning, and that cumulatively make Short Term 12 feel very much like home.",

If you see any films this month, makes sure this is one of themFirst time helmer Destin Cretton, with two years' experience in a similar care-giving facility (The title refers to the 12 or so group homes for teens in the county), has masterfully relayed the love and sorrow inherent in a place where virtually everyone is displaced from a parent, or abused, even the staff.The story belongs to Grace (Brie Larson), a caring giver who influences for good many of her charges, not easy cases any one of them. Part of the reason she is so successful is that she knows from abuse by her father, who is in prison for his offenses. She finds a younger Doppelganger of sorts in defiant teen Jadyn (Kaitlyn Dever), whose traumas at the hands of her father are ongoing and call for identifying with Grace's experiences and strong remedy. Watch for an Oscar nomination if this indie is seen by enough of us.To parallel the challenges of the home, Grace's home with fellow staffer, boyfriend Mason is both loving and stressful because she struggles with becoming pregnant and reconciling her tortured past with her father, who is ready to be released form prison. Mason is the ideal caregiver, loving and competent with the teenagers and her.Although many moments could be melancholic or downright tear-jerking in other hands, Cretton doesn't allow excessive sorrow to rule; rather, the sadness is mitigated by the small triumphs. Hey, that's just like real life.This little indie will cure you of any longing for summer blockbusters and their half-billion-dollar entanglements. Short Term 12's situations are enough satisfying drama for ten Lone Rangers.",

The ambience of this film is spot on for the content; ultimately, I was very impressed with the way this film was shot. The overall \"feel\" of this movie is anchored in realism; the shaky camera shots and lack of filters do a great job setting the tone for the bleak environment these characters live in. I applaud the director for portraying this world in a believable fashion. I will also say that the acting in \"Short Term 12\" is impressive overall. With memorable performances from Brie Larson and John Gallagher Jr, the entire film feels very authentic in it's own right. The supporting cast does a fine job as well; Rami Malek contributes a solid performance as the new guy at the facility and helps set the tone with the rest of the cast.When it comes down to it, I just didn't find the story in \"Short Term 12\" very engaging. This is just my humble opinion and should not sway others from seeing this film, but I thought the script left much to be desired. In the midst of all the great acting and ambience, the story and script is ultimately what brings this movie down from greatness. While I did not enjoy the story (I fell asleep 3 times) I must give credit where credit is due.

It follows her life, both at the facility and in the rest of the world, as she deals with a stressful time in her life. She is a very loving and caring person, but she has her own demons and sometimes she unable to separate her own problems from her problems at work. Larson does a great job of portraying this person getting worn thin by the problems in her life and retreating emotionally from people who care about her, all while being this strong leader for very troubled youth. John Gallagher and Kaitlyn Dever also have great performances as Mason, Grace's boyfriend and co- worker, and Jayden, a young girl living at Short Term 12 who Grace sees a lot of herself in.Destin Cretton, the writer and director, does a great job of developing these characters, as each scene gives the audience insight into who these people are and why they act the way they do. While some of the criticism of presenting problem's through children's stories is valid, I'm going to withhold too much judgment because it allows us to see these kids as actual people, instead of files and descriptions.Overall, this is a good movie worth seeing just for Brie Larson's acting alone. This movie tackles a difficult subject with very broken people, but it handles them in a sincere and honest way to a very rewarding end.",

It is an emotional drama with a dark comedy tone to it, this film shows the difficulties and emotional rides these kids can be through, and also how these young supervisors not just sympathize with them but carrying about them and trying to make them feel better and have a brighter view to life, disregarding whatever happened to them. Besides the charming dialogue, the score gives a great mood to the film as well and makes it more enjoyable. Regarding the performances, everyone does a great job, you get a sense that this cast must have had a great time together because the chemistry among them is very strong, otherwise so many scenes wouldn't be emotional and effective to the audience, I should mention Kaitlyn Dever can have a bright future in acting, and John Gallagher Jr. is just an awesome story teller, otherwise the ending scene wouldn't be so charming.

            "content": "Short Term 12 is a film focusing on heavy, dark themes which would threaten to mire us in inescapable gloom, if it weren't for the levity and comforting emotional truth which permeates its themes. The people in this film act, react and interact like real human beings and not pawns in a rigidly preordained script, giving the subject matter much more weight. Brie Larson shows immense early promise before her shattering work in 2015's Room here as Grace, a member of a residential treatment facility for orphaned and troubled teenagers. Every day she is faced with various youngsters who are troubled in different ways, and initially she appears to us as a girl who is capable and stable in her work, using intuition and compassion to help. But as the plot moves on, we begin to see that she comes from a harrowing background not unlike the kids she is working with. When withdrawn, cynical Jayden (Kaitlyn Dever, who made quite an impression on Justified and nails a difficult, vulnerable role heartbreakingly here) comes into the picture, Grace is jarringly reminded of her own past and starts to unravel. Her relationship with fellow worker Mason (a wonderfully naturalistic John Gallagher Jr.) suffers confusion and trauma at a critical stage, her work with the youths adding further stress to her already haunted state of mind. The film explores how people's past experiences, particularly the traumatizing ones, can help, hinder and simply be relatable to one another further on in life, reminding a seemingly confident individual of something they may need to reconcile with, even if they don't consciously know it. It's tough to tread around subjects like sexual abuse and avoid both sensationalism and exploitation. This one does both admirably and without any showboating. It simply shows human beings who have suffered unfathomable mistreatment, connecting on a painful level that crystallizes into healing. Larson and Dever beautifully illustrate this with their brave, compelling work, as does an excellent supporting cast. Incredibly important and essential viewing.",

Whether it makes you cry at one scene, or to burst out laughing at the next. This film has it all.Grace (Brie Larson) is a serious young woman in her 20's, a supervisor at a foster-care facility for at-risk teenagers. She's dedicated to her job, and also the kids in her charge \u2013 so much so that her relationship with long-term partner and co-worker Mason (John Gallagher Jr.) appears to be a secondary concern. Grace presents herself as a tough, no non- sense, yet compassionate figure, but when troubled Jayden (Kaitlyn Dever) comes into care she starts to see her own problems reflected back at herself as buried secrets from the past being to emerge.Brie Larson, best known for minor roles in 21 Jump Street, and in this month's Don Jon, performs perfectly, so perfect in fact that an Oscar nomination buzz is already starting to surround it. We won't take any magic away from the film, but Brie jumps straight into the deeply challenging central role \u2013 dealing with everybody else's problems as well as all of her own. It's a roller-coaster experience that is heartfelt, emotional and simply tremendous.Destin Daniel Cretton's striking first feature is actually based off his own experiences, spending two years in a similar facility. Filmed with hand-held cameras throughout makes it feel all the more personal, crafting what is a rare independent gem, and one of the best of the 57th London Film Festival.",

After having started well, it became less and less convincing and a number of scenes and even the acting in those scenes seemed very contrived.

Short Term 12 not only shows the events inside a group foster home, but really captures what it might feel like to be there. Watching Destin Daniel Cretton's film brings out the same emotions, if only for a shorter period of time, as you would experience if you were in the position of the workers in the home. Focusing on Grace (Brie Larson) who is head of the line staff in the home, and her troubles both inside and outside of it, the film at once grabs you and does not let go until the end of this haunting but humorous journey of healing, learning and discovery.The film, of course, is written with personal experience seeping through every scene. Cretton spent two years in the staff of such a home, and when his short film entailing his encounters there went down so well at Sundance, the logical step was to allow it to blossom into a feature length script. Cretton is a very talented writer. At the instant it feels like an opportunity might have been overlooked, he brings out something even better, something not only logical but inevitable, keeping us on our toes the whole time. If it ever feels predictable, it doesn't stay this way for long, with the direction of the scene being thrust from left to right, from comedy to catastrophe. At times is it a true example of textbook storytelling, but at no point does it tire or feel previously well trodden. On the contrary it is fresh and explorative in a way that I have not seen before. Opening on a new member of staff's first day, we are immediately invited into the home and the story, and before we know it we care about all of the children and our co- workers. Larson, in a role that has allowed her to show her full capabilities and that will no doubt make her a star, is excellent as Grace who, on the arrival of a new girl, Jayden, realises that maybe it is herself that is the most troubled child in the home after all. This simply allows for some beautiful scenes between Grace and her loved-up boyfriend and co-worker Mason (played by the equally brilliant John Gallagher Jr.) in a story that otherwise may have lost direction getting outside of the foster home had it been handled by somebody else. Also worth note are Kaitlin Dever (Jayden) and Keith Standfield as Marcus, the two teens we learn the most about.The film is shot with a hand held style and mostly with close ups, which helps us engage and feel part of the anecdotes, tragedies and celebrations straight away, and with a delicate score that can lift the mood and bring it right back down in an instant, the elements of the film work well together and are confidently handled to create a well crafted drama, whose realness, openness and immediacy you will fall in love with at once. This is a film whose success will hopefully not end at South By South West where it won a number of prizes, but should see a lot more buzz around it as we enter the awards season.",

There was something about the amateur yet great cast that was very enticing. Short Term 12 is a little too rough to be a sappy everything works out in the end movie. The music blends the story together incredibly well. Like I said at first glance a guy like myself has no interest in this type of movie, but stellar acting and a good bit of unpredictability kept me enticed throughout the entire film.

I don't know if the character development is lacking, or it's the story itself, but something is lacking which makes it not an 8/10 for me.It is emotional too but it could've been more, if we had more time with some of the characters. Like we don't even get a full 5 minutes of time with Rami Malek's character other than the first scene.I also read from some of the reviewers that the shaky cam is awful, which I disagree. Even though the shaky cam is noticeable from the start, you get used to it and it adds the realism and drama and it didn't bother me at all.All in all, decent story, good performances (I like Brie Larson before she became Captain Marvel), decent directing and simple and sufficient cinematography, but the story and characterization and character development is lacking, so it's a 7/10 for me.",

I have to say I'm really fond of the shaky movement of the camera, that along with the mentioned astonishing acting, produces a great intimate effect, giving the film an extraordinary bridge with the only purpose of guide you into Short Term 12.We get into the lives of the staff and children of a shelter dedicated to these not so fortunate kids. Fighting their own demons, Grace (Brie Larson) with her boyfriend Mason (John Gallagher) and the rest of the staff, try to make the days of the children inside Short Term 12 a little, or sufficiently, less hard to live. With so much stories in there and heartwarming characters, I got a \"One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest\" vibe. Its theme is a very tough one, there is no easy way to talk about it, but we are presented a very subtle road into troubled children's life; without being explicit, Destin Daniel Cretton lets us contact with them.Life is never vacuous of tragedy, in fact it may look like it's filled with it; but even the worst of all disgraces could lead into something beautiful. It's terrible that sometimes disgrace has to come into someone's life in order to let the good human out of the dark cover that smothers him or her, but at least that good human being exists.10/10",

            "content": "I am sixteen going on seventeen, about to begin my senior year of highschool, and about to begin my life. Just about every person, I've learned, has been in the exact same position I am in right now: faced with the decision of what to do with the rest of their life. So no, I'm not unique in my dilemma, I have ninety classmates in the exact same place I am, but I can surely tell you that it's as real as ever. So this week I am in New York City, taking a week long course at the New York Film Academy, hoping to learn something, have some fun, and most of all praying that I can answer some of these questions that loom over my head as I stand on the doorstep of life. I may return knowing what to do and who to be, I may not, but what I do know is that you're getting this instead of the review of \"The Expendables 3\" that you probably expected.As I began the second half of my junior year of highschool I decided I needed to begin thinking about what to do once I graduate. I have five siblings who had finished highschool by that time and so I was able to take a look at what they'd done to try to get an idea. What I observed is that they all followed they're passions: what they loved and what came naturally. One loved books as a kid: she became an English teacher. One was good at art: he's studying to be a graphic designer. Another was fascinated by the human body: she's headed for Medical School. So what's my passion? Easy, I love movies. . . Okay, well where do I go with that?About this time I stumbled upon Short Term 12. I hadn't heard that much about it, no one had. It was a little independent film that hadn't gotten much notice. It made big splashes at smaller awards shows and festivals, but otherwise it was completely unknown. But somehow it found its way onto my television and what I found when it finished was that I had just had a ninety minute emotional ride. I laughed more than I expected, I cried more than I care to confess, and I loved these fictional people more than I thought was even possible.Short Term 12 is a story about a twenty-something young woman named Grace. Grace works at a place called Short Term 12: a home for young teenagers whose home and family lives have become unsuitable and detrimental places for them to live. As can be expected, these kids have rough lives. Many have tried to harm themselves, most fall into extreme stages of depression, and yet amidst this all of them have found a couple of people they can call a really good friend: Grace, Mason, Nate, and Jessica. Grace and her co-workers aren't social workers, they don't have a certificate and they haven't gone to school for this, they're just the person who's there for the kids when they need it.I'm unable to describe with words the things that take place in the short ninety minutes that make up Short Term 12. The way director and writer Destin Daniel Cretton knows these kids and how they behave and react in such delicate situations makes the story so personal even when there is no other way for a person like me to relate to them. I never imagined a short children's story about an octopus could bring an ocean of tears to my eyes or that someone could find such personal value in something as simple as shaving your head. These kids have been forced to live awful lives, yet they still have those little things to give them hope. Even more amazing seen in the story is the character of Grace. Brie Larson's incredible mental performance is one that should be treasured forever, and one that makes you love the person that Grace is. Grace, along with Mason, Nate, and Jessica, is a good person doing an incredible thing. They're not going to be recognized for it, no one's going to give them a military medal or a sports trophy at the end of the movie, all they are going to have at the end of the day is the knowledge that they've done a great thing. And tomorrow morning, it's back to work. Every time I watch this movie I realize more and more how much good these people are doing. Sure they're fictional, sure they can put whatever they want onto a movie screen. But what makes this movie stand out from the rest is that it's real. Grace and Mason are so real. And it makes me jealous because they are such, in the most simplistic way, good people. I still don't know what I want to do as a career, but I do know what I want to do with my life. I want to be a good person. I give Short Term 12 a 9.6/10.",

            "content": "I watched this movie specifically because the script won a Nicholl Fellowship. I wanted to see what the Academy thought was a good script. It may be that the script was great, I don't know. But as far as the execution: Almost every actor, even those that actually had talent, mumbled their lines, spoke too softly, spoke into themselves, whispered... it was almost impossible to understand what anyone was saying. That did not help make this a watchable film. That aside, the beginning, with its insane \"sh*t-in-pants\" story that went on ad infinitum, was not entertaining. It was a ruse to set us all at ease to allow one of the nutcase teens from the house to run out screaming. This was used to also bookend the film. The problem with the first one is we meet 4 people almost at once, we don't who they are, why they are there or what they do. They are also talking about people we don't know or care about. None of them has what I would call \"star quality.\"I did not find it an effective way to start the film and I found it almost impossible to keep track of who was who. It took about 40 minutes before the film became interesting. And then, I will give it credit, and it's because of Kaitlyn Dever as the deeply troubled \"Jayden\" and Brie Larson as \"Grace.\" These were the two strongest actors in the film and their unusual shared story... although a bit predictable -- drew me in and kept me with them till the end. I found the film to be sloppily shot and it resembled a total indie package. The sound quality was all over the place. I had to have my finger on the volume control the entire time. That said, the concept for the story was interesting. There were WAY too many people introduced up front and the story should have honed a more narrow path and stayed with Grace. By not doing so, it spread itself so thin that I was waiting for the entire thing to crumble. Still... it had some level of uniqueness. But I have several problems with the film which I cannot explain. There seemed to be 4 \"handlers\" and one \"adminstrator.\" Can someone explain why the 4 handlers were standing outside having a chatfest when they KNEW that there was a houseful of troubled teens that might do ANYTHING (i.e. cut themselves, harm others, etc.)? It was incomprehensible. Also, since Grace was pregnant and her fianc\u00e9 Mason (John Gallagher Jr.) knew she was pregnant, why is it that he allowed her to CHARGE after Jayden? What man in his right mind would let her do that, knowing she was pregnant? Why would he say to the other handlers, \"It's okay.\" In what realm of the imagination could it be okay? Katilyn definitely has some bite in her performance and I sense she might go somewhere. Brie also has a feeling that something great might come her way. Other than the two of them, I wasn't sensing any breakout stars. An interesting watch, but very, very depressing, with lots of \"f\" words -- most if not all which were completely unnecessary.",

At the crux of the film is Grace (Larson) who leads the facility's workers and helps kids while also dealing with her own life. It's really quite sweet that Grace and her boyfriend Mason (Gallagher) have fragmented childhoods, and so they have to (rather than want to) help ease the pain of these children and the problems they face.

It had a beautiful score but it was never used to convey the mood in scenes. The filmmakers just showed what happened but left it up the audience to interpret moments which is great for any film to do that because it's not telling us how to think, but letting us think for ourselves. Every character was flawed and real, even the minor characters were given a chance to shine. The only gripe I had with the film was the poor cinematography with blown out whites (especially in the indoor to outdoor shots), grainy footage, and odd out of focus shots.

            "content": "{8.5 stars}SHORT TERM 12 is a plainly produced yet startlingly realistic film about a treatment facility for troubled adolescents. Brie Larson (\"Grace\") and John Gallagher (\"Mason\") give fine performances as the young staff members who must be simultaneously authoritarian, self-effacing, firm, gentle, and everything else a particular moment requires. The way they lose themselves in order to find themselves in this consuming, exhausting job, the kinship they share with the teenagers, and the one they lack with the upper administration is ultra-real. Equally impressive is Stephanie Beatriz as Jessica, full of rage and estranged from her family for good reasons the film reveals. That being said, everyone in this film is quite convincing.While it may be a little inconclusive in one or two spots, the plot is still compelling, with some truly disturbing surprises and revelations. SHORT TERM 12 also does a splendid job of balancing comedy and tragedy, connecting them together with various things that fall under both categories. Though plenty happens here, this film may be too unspectacular for some tastes. It's definitely not a \"thriller,\" and sensationalism would obviously have ruined it.I recommend SHORT TERM 12 to anyone who's ever been a teenager.",

            "content": "I want to start off by saying I read quite a few reviews before watching Short Term 12 and going into the movie I thought for sure I was going to cry my eyes out and also get queasy from all the \"shakiness\" everyone complained about. After finishing the movie I was confused by those reviews. The camera is not shaky in the way documentary-style hand-held films are, it's just that the camera is never steady as if it were mounted on something. It distracted me at first, only because I was already expecting it. Also I didn't shed a single tear, which makes me wonder why this is listed as such a tearjerker. Don't get me wrong, it deals with heavy subject matter, and I've gone through enough traumatic experiences to relate to this movie, but I didn't find it \"heartwrenching\" as a few reviewers said. This is coming from someone who cries over everything. I cry at commercials, any slightly sad story or even happy ones. This just didn't affect me this way. I'm only relaying this so that someone who reads this before watching doesn't have the same expectations I did. As far as the film's story, I didn't find it to be anything groundbreaking. I'm truly shocked at the high rating on here. Unlike some users, I didn't find it slow or boring; I found it interesting and was drawn in within the first few minutes. I felt like there were some stereotypes played out here, but I guess one could argue that people can be pretty stereotypical. I feel like this was a good movie to showcase the kind of people we don't often see in films. Overall, I give this a 6/10 because it's not really a movie you enjoy in the sense that you want to see it again. It's one that you see once, appreciate and maybe discuss, but that's about it. It was kind of average to me. Definitely overrated, but I don't think that means it should be skipped.",

            "content": "One of my favorite films of 2013 was the indie film \"Short Term 12\" directed by Destin Cretton based on his previous short film of the same name. It's the story of a group home for wayward teens and the counselors who work with them, but words and labels can't do it justice. It's simply a perfect film with deeply felt performances throughout. The filmmakers bring such authenticity to it that it feels like it could be a documentary.We follow Grace, played by Brie Larson, an early twenty something girl, as she leads most of the groups activities. She is in a relationship with fellow counselor Mason (Peter Gallegher Jr.) that they try to keep on the down low in front of the others, but everyone seems to know. We are also introduced to a new counselor named Nate (Rami Malek) who like most people initially has a rough time fitting in. Trying to make a good first impression on these kids is nearly impossible and when he calls them \"underprivileged\" Marcus, the eldest of the group, is deeply offended by the term. It really is like a slap in the face to all of them. Although Nate didn't mean anything by it and is good guy at heart he has a lot to learn.Short Term 12 offers these kids unconditional love and support and a safe place for them to just be themselves. All of the residents, through no fault of there own, have ended up at there and must wait out their time until fate revels itself or they turn eighteen and must leave. All of the teens are well crafted multi-dimensional characters as complicated and real as it gets. Sammy, Luis, Marcus and the new girl Jayden are the main teens we follow throughout the film. Through their struggles they've built up these thick walls in order to keep everybody out and It's the counselors job to slowly but surely chip away at these walls and try to make a connection. Sammy is no more than 10 or 12 years old and has lost his only family in his younger sister. He might either be autistic or depressed but is really battling though some tough times for such a young age. Like all of the residents Luis is a good kid but a victim of circumstance. Marcus is a deeply complex man who soon turns eighteen and still fighting through some fierce emotional issues. The abuse by his mother has left deep emotion scars, but he seems up to challenge to reclaiming his life. Jayden is the new girl and almost a carbon copy of what Grace was like when she was her age. Jayden sparks something inside Grace that force her to deal with her own brutal past. Life is now pushing Grace to a boiling point as her past, present and future all collide and she must make decision that will affect her life forever.",

Didn't on this one .I was very much aware of Brie as Captain Marvel, so to see here here doing something incredibly different was delightful. Her credibility as an actress in my opinion has risen enormously and I want to see more.Not my usual sort of movie, and I really don't know how to talk about it without ruining the plot, but every now and then a movie like this comes along and grips me.

            "review_title": "An emotional journey that leaves you wanting more",
            "content": "Short Term 12 is a movie that has the power to influence you emotionally. For one, the narrative revolves around young adults who supervise a foster care facility. A different spin on the coming-of-age genre opens up different opportunities. Secondly, every single resident at the facility is relatable from one angle or another. We didn't get to explore their stories as it doesn't completely revolve around them but you just wish you knew a bit more about them. And lastly, the subject of past trauma can make you heartsick. Sometimes even despondent but Grace's emotional support to the resident provides the needed enthusiasm that doesn't let the heart grow cold. Even though she's the one struggling with past trauma, she doesn't give up on the kids.This movie featured several actors that would appear in cinema or publications in the future. Just two years after Short Term 12 was released, Rami Malek, who played Nate, got to star in Mr. Robot, a personal favorite of mine in the 2010s. Grace was played by Brie Larson, who got to join Marvel Cinematic Universe as Captain Marvel. She was also starred in Room (2015), which is rated really high, but I'm yet to watch that movie. The third actress that I want to mention is Kaitlyn Dever. She played Jayden, the tough but frail girl with a history of harming herself, and she also starred in one of my favorite comedies in the recent past - Booksmart (2019). One thing that I like about watching a lot of movies is seeing some familiar faces from time to time. I know these three actors from movies of completely different backgrounds and seeing them interact in such circumstances, under such roles, and just seeing a different angle of their talent as actors were pleasant for my viewing experience.Even though I liked this film a lot, it fails in comparison to other coming-of-age movies and even some of my favorite dramas. The biggest strengths here are the acting and the use of tools to bring out a huge emotional response but it's a bit weaker in storytelling and the pace. It was a bit difficult what kind of story is being told here as it was mostly revolving around personal problems that Grace is dealing with and how the foster house residents remind her of the demons that haunt her past. To me, it sometimes felt that every sequence in the territory of the foster home was fascinating to some extent but every shot that was taken outside of it just didn't have enough charm to keep it interesting. I don't know whether this is the result of using the angle of young adults instead of the kids at the foster home or just the lack of scenes that are worth remembering or maybe even the fact that the most important scenes of the film, the ones that are supposed to have the highest impact, are a bit underwhelming. My favorite scenes here would include the rap by Marcus, the story by Jayden, and the stories at the beginning and end of the movie, Mason just has a knack for storytelling and I love it. The underwhelming scenes here would include the one where they smash the car with a baseball ball, Grace and Mason falling out because of Grace being afraid to open up, and, I guess, Jayden's violent tantrum after her father fails to pick her up from the facility. That sequence was really strong and acted well but I just felt awkward when watching it, it was uneasy to experience that.Overall, I'd still say I like it. It wasn't as impactful as The Perks of Being a Wallflower (2012), a movie that also dealt with past traumas, or Frances Ha (2012), a movie that dealt with someone desperately trying to hold on to her past, but it still stood out and gave me a warm fuzzy feeling when viewing. Those two movies are among my favorites of the genre in the 2010s and I don't dare to say that anything worse than them is automatically bad. Usually, I'm a bit discouraged when films are too long but here, I kind of wished it was longer so we would get to see more of the kinds, maybe having a bigger ending or maybe looking into what's hurting the other residents in the foster house. I just felt like I wanted more and this movie had more to deliver but just didn't share it, at least it felt like that. But besides that, I'm happy with what I've got.",

The locations are very lifelike, the entire film has a very calm & relaxed atmosphere for which the shooting location is responsible for, editing is finely done & it is smartly written & directed. On an overall scale, Short Term 12 is one of those dramas that are heartwarming & heartbreaking at the same time that will have you go through every emotion you're capable of and dares to deal with issues most people or families aren't very comfortable viewing or discussing about.

            "content": "Short Term 12 did a great job of encompassing everything in its hour and thirty minutes of runtime. I didn't feel like anything was left out, nor unnecessary. There were details and close ups of how time passes in the facility, as well as outbursts. It shows how the workers manage to keep their calm throughout chaos, how much will and persistence they have in helping those teenagers; how accustomed they've grown to it. The workers went through similar things as some of the teenagers there, so they know how horrifying that is. That's why they're helping them and providing them with a safe place to be. A lot of the teenagers aren't just saddened and willing to accept help - they lash out at others and themselves. They're filled with rage and confusion because of being raised in households where there was violence and abuse. They associate love to manipulation. They developed illnesses because of it. It makes me so sad that people are cruel to children. The workers are very compassionate towards the teenagers, they don't force anything onto them, try to make them happy or \"fix\" them. They're simply there for them, they keep things in order and provide them care. Thats's something every young person needs and deserves. The movie shows how Grace is still recovering from her adolescence and coping with it. She has trust issues with Mason and her pregnancy brings negative associations from the past with it. Her dad is coming out of prison in a week. She empathizes with the teenagers, especially the new girl who comes into the facility. Lots of the teenagers are very talented and artistic. When the new girl read a children's story to Grace, I was struck with grief. My eyes filled with tears numerous times throughout the movie. I'm glad the beginning and end have great and funny stories. The relationship between Grace and Mason is really nice, and intimate. Overall, the ambiance is quiet but powerful and it's a very significant topic. I'd recommend this movie to everyone. It'll shake you up or if anything, it'll show you the world of teenagers who have experienced abuse and their treatment. And I'm guessing those who have experienced such things will be able to resonate with it. (I watched it because I saw that someone who has, loves it.)",

            "content": "It all could have been painfully mawkish, populated as it is with the kinds of kids who provide inspiration for after-school specials. Instead, \"Short Term 12\" comes from a place of delicate and truthful understatement, which allows the humanity and decency of its characters\u2014and, yes, the lessons\u2014to shine through naturally. The film's originality begins with the setting: a foster-care center for at-risk teens whose troubles run the gamut from depression to substance abuse to self-mutilation. Writer- director Destin Daniel Cretton based \"Short Term 12\" partly on his own experiences working at such a center, and previously made a short film on the subject. In drawing the story out to feature length, Cretton takes an abidingly naturalistic, conversational approach to both the complicated issues these kids face and the no-nonsense way their counselors try to help them. Chief among them is Brie Larson as the twenty-something Grace, a formerly troubled teen herself who now hopes to serve as a guide for others. Just as the extent of Grace's painful past is revealed to us in deliberate pieces, Larson's performance itself is a revelation. It's a welcome and long-overdue lead role for the actress who's been so engaging in supporting parts in films like \"The Spectacular Now\" and \"Scott Pilgrim vs. The World\" and the Showtime series \"The United States of Tara.\" There's a directness about her that's appealing, even here where she's meant to look a little mousy and low-key. At the film's start, Grace seems to have achieved a comfortable balance between her professional and personal lives. She handles both the mundane routine of the place and the volatile emotional flare-ups with the same sort of cool confidence. She also has a loving, playful relationship with her longtime live-in boyfriend, the shaggy, foulmouthed Mason (played amiably by John Gallagher Jr.), who works alongside her as a supervisor at the center. But the impending departure of one kid and the arrival of another shake everything up for her. Tough, intense Marcus (Keith Stanfield) is about to turn 18, which means he'll have to leave the home; frightened to make his way on his own, he acts out during these final days instead of facing his future. A profane and deeply felt rap song he wrote details his life of neglect and abuse, and the fact that Cretton presents the performance in one long take adds to its power. Marcus overlaps briefly with the surly and withdrawn new girl, Jayden (Kaitlyn Dever), who insists her father is coming to get her soon so she refuses to make friends. One of the subtle beauties of \"Short Term 12\" is the way it intimately depicts how the counselors find ways into these kids' lives and connect with them. For Grace and Jayden, it's through a shared love of drawing. But Jayden also uses her art to reveal the truth about her home life, which stirs secrets within Grace that she'd fought hard for years to suppress. This upheaval comes at a time when Grace and Mason are trying to create something lasting for themselves: a home and a family of their own. The ambivalence Grace finds herself feeling, and the way that emotional shift shatters Mason, are both believable and heartbreaking. Cretton shows as much care and kindness with the minutiae of the daily routine\u2014the doling out of meds, searches for contraband and forced recreational activities like Wiffle ball games \u2014as he does with the larger issues that plague these lives in flux. He also infuses his story with unexpected humor as the kids hassle each other\u2014and their supervisors\u2014on the road to healing. While some of the third-act choices his characters make seem a little extreme compared to the realism that marks the rest of the film, Cretton consistently refrains from employing a tone that's heavy-handed. \"Short Term 12\" is a small gem in which the uplift feels earned rather than preached.",

Brie Larson and John Gallagher Jr were terrific! The problems and the situations were a bit out there, but you know that stuff like that probably happens. I thought it was raw, real, and sharp. The emotions that arose in me while watching this were really overwhelming at times and I also thought the children played their roles really well. I tried to find something that I didn't like about this movie but I honestly couldn't. This definitely should have been up for some academy's/golden globes and I was really surprised that it wasn't even nominated. I know that it killed in the festivals, but wow. Just a great movie. If you had any hesitation about whether or not to see this, I promise you, it is not a waste of your time.",

Perhaps her best performance yet.Another standout is Kaitlyn Denver.She is young and talented and plays the role of a troubled teenager.All the kids and teenagers were interesting. The chemistry between them is clearly visible especially between Brie and Kaitlyn. Every character undergoes through mental stress in this film and its a treat to watch them tackle it and come out stronger than before.\"What doesn't kill you make you stronger \" literally ; applies here .The Rap song scene was truly great and is still fresh in my mind months after seeing this.In the end, you will feel good about life after watching this.

It will be etched in my mind forever.Brie Larson, as Grace is exceptional and John Gallagher Jr. (of Newsroom) is extremely talented and right on the money as Mason. Kaitlyn Dever turns in a mature performance for a 17 year old and Keith Stanfield plays the subdued Marcus to a tee. A must watch movie and easily one of the best, if not the best movie of the year.",

            "content": "Being a huge fan of Brie Larson, I was incredibly excited for Short Term 12. I have to say, not only did it meet my expectations but it completely surpassed them.Short Term 12 is based on the 2008 short of the same name, which I have not seen. I knew roughly what to expect after watching the trailer, but I had the worry that perhaps the trailer showed too much of the movie and I wouldn't be as engaged as I possibly could. I needn't have worried at all, Short Term 12 is captivating and excellently written. Even with the short 96 minute run time, we get HUGE amounts of character development, more than many 150 minute movies have. The character building is so good that you feel as though you know these characters and enjoy hanging out with them.These complex characters would be nothing without good actors to play them, but thankfully the cast of Short Term 12 isn't just good, it's outstanding. There are some incredible supporting roles from very young actors like Keith Stanfield and Katylin Dever, both of whom's story lines are very genuine and well written. In the more major roles we have Rami Malek and John Gallagher Jr, who are both excellent in their roles, But of course, the star of the show is the incredible Brie Larson. Short Term 12 doesn't seem to be receiving much awards attention which is a shame, as Brie Larson deserves so much more recognition and every leading actress award there is. She delivers a stunning performance cementing her as one of the best actresses in the business, she gives a performance that's easily one of, if not the, best of 2013.Destin Cretton directs Short Term 12 and does a brilliant job of doing so. The cinematography is beautiful and there is so much raw emotion that the movie doesn't need to rely on sad music to make you feel emotional, it manages to do it with the incredible acting, writing and directing. Short Term 12 is a roller-coaster ride of emotions, it will make you feel sad, happy, depressed and uplifted. It's a true tour de force of cinema, and is my favourite movie of 2013.",

It gives you just enough to look at the screen and see people instead of characters. It's really hard to explain the emotions this movie made me feel without ruining it for you. If anything, watch it for an extremely powerful performance from Brie Larson. She's going to be a huge deal in just a few short years.

            "review_title": "A very Intimate and Heartbreaking Look into the Lives of People who have been Damaged.",
            "content": "This movie immediately drew my attention when I read the summary. My own mother has worked in a similar institute, and I was always curious how one keeps up with those situations on a day-to-day basis. When I finished watching, I was in awe. This movie is very powerful and full of love and heartbreak, and deserves a very high amount of praise.Acting:\nBrie Larson always has been a tough actress for me to judge. She can be incredibly subtle and professional with the right role, but also very flat and stoic with the wrong one. This is one of the better ones. It is not uncommon for coworkers at such an institute to have come from a similar background as the kids they are looking after, and the more the movie progresses, the more you want to find out what happened to this young woman. How does one who is so full of compassion and understanding and wisdom unable and afraid to open up about herself and follow her own lessons in life? Brie sells every likable aspect about this character excellently, and convinces you just how much respect these kind of people deserve for doing their job right.John Gallager Jr is even better; not necessarily in terms of acting, but his character is an absolute joy to watch. He radiates professionalism, friendliness, warmth and love all at once, while not being perfect all the same. John himself does a terrific job at giving life to all these aspects, and watching him interact with Brie is wonderful.Katlyn Denver as Jayden is a gem. While she carries often the same sullen expression in a lot of her roles, this character fits that attitude perfectly. Once you slowy discover what she struggles with everyday, you feel a great amount of empathy for her, and when this gets the better of her, it is absolutely heartbreaking to watch and a testament of the talent of this young woman.Lakeith Steinfeld as Marcus is another excellent choice. The young actor has a cold armor around him all the time, radiating stoicness and absolute rage and\nimpotence all at once. Just like Jayden, his background is very moving and sad, and he gets a lot of moments that truly hit the hammer on the nail for what this movie wants to convey to us.As for Rami Malek, his role feels a bit unnecessary, as he is mostly used to represent the audience who feel absolutely baffled an shocked at the events that occur in the treatment center on a day to day basis. He does a reasonable job, and at the end of the movie, he integrates fairly well. I just think that you could have given him slightly more screentime to watch that integration really blossom.Direction:\nKnowing that Destin Daniel Cretton actually has experience in the care of abused children, explains a lot regarding why this movie works so well. He knows exactly how to show the pain and psychological damage without saying anything, choosing to follow every character very closely and using very natural and heartfelt dialogue. He created nothing short of a masterpiece here.Cinematography:\nThe colour choices for this movie are interesting. Even at the toughest and gutwrenching scenes, the overal picture looks nice and warm and yellow. It reflects in a certain way the kind of environment that the workers want to create for the kids. Outside the treatment center, where help is less easily accessed, and the characters must figure out their problems themselves, grey tones and dark shadows are used. Handheld camera is preferred here over steadycam, to make you feel like you are in the same room with these characters when they are at their most vulnerable, and it works incredibly well. Sometimes you really feel like you are invading their moment and that you need to leave.Plot:\nSome people critisized this movie for being little more than a series of moments inside the life of this treatment center, but while not entirely true, it is also kind of the point. It shows a lot of variety in terms of the problems each kid and their helpers are dealing with, adding a lot of human element to it. At the same time, we follow Grace and Mason outside of their work in their own problems and relationships, and how some of it translates itself to their work and vice versa. It never drags or becomes less engaging, only more compelling. The first and last scene are particulary well written in a way that makes everything come full circle.Editing:\nWhile not that special, the pacing works remarkibly well in this movie thanks to the editing, and some scene transitions between strong emotional moments and a lighter tone work very well.Tone:\nAs previously mentioned, the approach is very human and intimate, both warm and extremely bone-chilling. How the movie can switch between these tones expertly is amazing, and nothing feels out of place. You get attached to every character and the compassion and warmth that they exert, while at the same time not losing sight of the horrible problems and tragedy that they deal with every day.Overall Concensus:\nThis movie is one of the most gripping and compelling experiences I have ever had. A lot of people can relate to the themes and topics in this, and the direction ensures that you are engaged as much as possible to what is happening. A short and intimate masterpiece, 8.8/10",

From my experience, when you house a bunch of kids together (any kids, but especially kid with serious parent issues, some as old as 17) - it doesn't take long for things to descend into some real Lord Of The Flies territory. And often. I.e. For them to spend a hefty portion of their overflowing, youthful energy and creativity - straight torturing each other. The corresponding bureaucracy too, having a selection effect where people who genuinely, objectively care - get unceremoniously weeded out. I'll trust for now that the guys who made this film know something I don't, but if this representation of what a \"taken away\" kid is likely to encounter in such an institution is an uncharacteristically rosied one - I'd have to call this film extremely irresponsible. Because if not doing ones due diligence here, is likely to result in even one kid getting over-hastily thrown into what I suspect to be much more of a meat grinder - that would absolutely mangle all of this film's ample strengths.",

Like they did not believe we would get the character's personalities unless they were beaten into us. Critics applauded movie largely for its the frank portrayal of the marginalized lives of kids in the limbo of foster care, group homes, and other living situations. I agree that they were humanized here very well. The sad was really sad (which seems consistent with the setting), but for all its supposed grittiness and realism, the sweet was a little too sweet. I just could not get past this.(On an odd note, the time frame of the movie was unclear. At certain points it seemed that a lot of time was passing and then it was suggested that not much had.)",

I saw the trailer, and I felt like it was something I'd watch someday, but not really like. I was so wrong.I haven't been to a place exactly like Short Term 12, but I have spent some time in psychiatric hospitals and rehab, and I can say, watching this film, I felt nostalgia towards being in rehab. The teens felt like people I'd met, and their reactions to things seemed so real, such as lashing out, trying to run away, swearing, crying, not being apart of group. The characters seemed like a family, and in places like that, you do sort of become a family.I have not seen another movie that showed such a realistic portrayal of this sort of place. My only real issue with this was the way Grace acted, as in telling the kids about her issues and going to Jayden's house and destroying her father's car. In reality, I couldn't see her acting out like that, but, I reminded myself that it is a movie, and more ridiculous things have happened in so many other films.Short Term 12 is a beautiful film, that really reaches out and touches the viewer's heart. For people who have spent time in places like Short Term 12, I would definitely recommend this film, even though it can easily be a trigger.

I watched Short Term 12 over a week ago, and the characters are still with me as vividly as if I had watched it an hour ago. I suspect it will be with me a year from now, or longer. In fact, I liked the movie so much, I am writing this review . . . my very first. Short Term 12 is, to me, above all else, a character study. This movie proves that story always matters; high-budget special effects mean nothing if not adequately supported by a good story with compelling characters. This movie has nothing in the way of special effects, but, oh, what a wonderful story with characters that are so real that I found myself forgetting that they are not real people! It actually feels, at times, like more of a documentary, though don't let that scare you off if you're not a fan of documentaries. It's a compliment that the actors were so convincing. The story centers on Grace, a counselor at a facility that serves as a temporary home for teens and preteens between foster homes . . . as best that I could ascertain. Grace and her boyfriend, Mason, do their best to be comforting, reassuring figures for the kids living there. Their job is to \"keep them safe.\" Still, they are so much more than counselors to these kids. I will not relate the entire story, but there are a few points I feel compelled to mention. Namely, Jayden and Marcus are the characters with whom I most sympathized. Yes, Grace is the lead character and Brie Larson NAILED the role, but Marcus and Jayden both stole my heart. Many reviews relate Marcus' rap scene and Jayden's scene in which she reads her Octopus story to Grace as the most heart-wrenching moments (and they were indeed powerful), but for whatever reason, it was Jayden's reaction to the birthday cards the other kids made for her that got my eyes watery. In a masterful stroke of subtle foreshadowing, it is complemented at the end when Jayden has the cards displayed on her wall . . . it is one of the sweetest moments in film I have ever seen. Suffice it to say, I loved this little movie. If you like good character studies, this is one you cannot miss. Finally, I would be remiss if I did not mention how much I liked they way the movie begins and ends . . . with lovable, foul-mouthed Mason telling a story in front of the building and the subsequent chaotic (yet not at all surprising to Grace and Mason) \"chase.\"",

Then, you are hit with another surprise element about where are they and what they do. This a language of filmmaking which has been long forgotten.Though it is not a mystery or suspense thriller, the lesser you know about the plot, the more chance you give the director to achieve what he wants to, with the audience. The thing I loved the most about the film is that it isn't centered around only one character. Because of this, you can feel why Grace is doing what she is doing and how Mason feels hurt or what the story of Octopus of Jayden means.The only downfall I felt in the film was absence of deep characterization. Of course, the character didn't do anything that was illogical or seemed pretentious (they behaved like real people would in circumstances like that), but the 'deep characterization' like in Jagten (The Hunt) could have set it apart.It was lovely film to enjoy and engage you throughout its running time, however, it gives you nothing to think about after it is over (you can say it loses you after the ending).Thank you for reading.",

It does well to be uplifting without short-selling the pain and the trauma, the times you feel useless as you sit in the hurricane of pain in front of you and the way that awakens echoes of your own pain. \n\nBrie Larson's low-key, brilliant central performance shows what we'd see later down the track in Room as well as Marvel movies, that she's more than able to carry a film, and really connect us to the emotional core of the film. The supporting cast is also excellent, with special mention to Lakeith Stanfield and John Gallagher Jr.",

After reading up on director Destin Daniel Crettin (who is a new favorite of mine after this and Shang Chi), his personal history working in a group facility for teenagers is clearly felt. Having worked in a related field for most of my adult life, his screenplay is true to life - complete with its ups, downs, and the free flowing relationship residents have with staff workers. The story, while heartbreaking at times, moves gracefully and shows real empathy for its characters. It is interesting as it more focused on the staff than the residents of the group home, which is an avenue that has been rarely explored in films. While the in facility story resonated much more with me than the out of facility story concerning Grace and Mason's romantic relationship, this is a great movie.",

The chemistry between Grace (Brie Larson) and Mason (John Gallagher, Jr.) was a delight. Rami Malek's character, Nate, on the other hand, was a complete waste of space. I understand he's supposed to be the vessel through which we are pushed into the group home \u2014 the film begins on his first day as a volunteer \u2014 but he is so out of place and ineffective that he reminded me of one of those good-intentioned American teenagers who go to Africa to build homes, only to have the locals re-do the work at night. The intimacy of the camerawork, if at times claustrophobic, made the home feel tight and on-edge, even when engaging in something as simple as morning work group \u2014 you know, the typical seated circle where feelings are to be discussed, always to the chagrin on its circulants (word mine). I also wanted to note Kaitlyn Dever's performance as Jayden, the snarky, borderline acerbic, newcomer to the home whose story becomes central to Grace's arc. My only real gripe is why did Grace immediately make the appointment for an abortion, then tell Mason they're having a baby and accept his proposal, only to revert back to her original decision (which she then flip-flops on again)? It felt like the whole reason for the initial appointment was so she could drop the line \"I already made the appointment\". Was it supposed to be a trial run of some sort and she reserved her spot in case she wasn't satisfied with the results? Wherever this was, it didn't seem like abortion openings were few and far between. The tear-jerker ending was deserved and satisfying.",

            "content": "Loving and empathetic to its characters' pain.\n\nDestin Daniel Cretton's indie drama Short Term 12 (2013) is an emotionally devastating ordeal of such great sadness and profound catharsis with a mellow vibe. The openness of the cinematography is so freeing and feels genuine like you are watching real interactions in the daily lives of people suffering from trauma or grief. Cretton's melancholic tone makes Short Term 12 a hard watch, but it is so beautiful and rewarding. The hopeful ending is satisfying and uplifting to a degree.\n\nCretton takes a simple premise of a young woman, who is hiding the fact that she herself was abused by her perverted father, while she now helps those in similar situations to a reflective state. Short Term 12 sees Cretton write several realistic characters all going through pain of some kind in a neglected youth center similar to a film like Girl, Interrupted, but Short Term 12 is filmed closer to Room. Cretton's writing has no frills or fraudulence to it, his style is realism grounded in the coping process like how people actually try to recover and rehabilitate in actual life. Thus, Cretton's thoughtful dreamy direction gives Short Term 12 a truly empathetic feel alongside his authentic script. Destin Daniel Cretton is quite the writer and director.\n\nBrie Larson is inspired as Grace. Her clear inner strength is projected outwards to aid these teenagers by using her own pain and insecurities to empower others. Larson is so moving as she brings a genuine warmth and impressive anguish in how she displays Grace's doubts. She gives such a nuanced performance in Short Term 12, that Larson was already preparing for her magnificent role in Room, wherein she pulls off an even more devastating performance. Brie Larson needs to continue her dramatic acting in the vein of Short Term 12 and Room as she is just marvelous at it.\n\nJohn Gallagher Jr. is so heartwarming and patient as the sympathetic Mason. He is quite funny and endearing. His acting gives an optimistic look on all the horror around him as he tries to cope with his own girlfriend Grace's issues. Gallagher Jr. gives an excellent foil role as Mason to Larson's powerful leading lady Grace.\n\nI must mention the standout young actress Kaitlyn Dever (Booksmart) as she is sublime as Jayden. You feel so bad for her, while liking her wise cracking teenage girl character. Dever is one of the best young actresses working in Hollywood today as Short Term 12 displayed her potential and Booksmart achieved it. She acts on the same level as Brie Larson, which is about as high of praise as I can give here.\n\nFurthermore, LaKeith Stanfield is really gripping as Marcus. You see a deep pain as Marcus raps his frustrations, fears, and aggression against his mother out in a touching honest scene. His story is as tragic as anyone's in Short Term 12. Stanfield is outstanding as a dramatic actor. Between Short Term 12, Selma, Straight Outta Compton, War Machine, Get Out, and Sorry to Bother You, I would say that Stanfield is here to stay. His range is impressive and he continues to astonish me.\n\nThe lovely score from Joel P. West is mesmerizing and adds a serene warmth giving Short Term 12 a Summer vibe. Despite the dark subject matter and complex themes, the music in the movie is certainly beautiful.\n\nLastly, Rami Malek is neat as the new guy named Nate, but he's really just a glorified cameo. His supporting role is mostly a surrogate for the audience to have an ally experiencing all the anguish of Short Term 12 along with to ease our viewing session. He is very good at making specific facial expressions of shock or sorrow.\n\nIn all, Short Term 12 is a fantastic indie drama from director Destin Daniel Cretton. Brie Larson is as inspiring and engaging in Short Term 12 as she is in her more acclaimed role in Room. LaKeith Stanfield gets a cool acting debut feature film and we get a robust film to endure and enjoy.",

She lives with her long-term boyfriend and coworker, Mason (John Gallagher Jr.), but finds it difficult to open up to him emotionally. When Grace finds out she is pregnant, she schedules an appointment for an abortion; she eventually tells Mason about the pregnancy, who is overjoyed. She does not tell him she plans to have an abortion. At their facility, Grace and Mason focus their efforts on Marcus (Lakeith Stanfield), a resident who is about to turn 18 and is struggling with the prospect of leaving the facility. Meanwhile, Nate (Rami Malek) begins his first day as a supervisor at the facility. Grace bonds with Jayden (Kaitlyn Dever), a recent arrival at Short Term 12 who has a history of self-harm. Jayden distances herself from the other teenagers, as she does not intend to stay at the facility for long. When her father fails to pick her up on her birthday, she reacts violently toward the staff. After her outburst, she sits in the \"cool-down room\" with Grace, who shows Jayden her own scars from cutting herself. That night, Jayden leaves the facility in the middle of her birthday celebrations. Unable to force her to return, Grace follows Jayden to her father's house. After finding the house empty, they return to Short Term 12. When Jayden reads Grace a cryptic story she has written, Grace begins to suspect that Jayden was abused by her father...\n\n\"Short Term 12\" premiered on March 10, 2013 at South by Southwest, where it won the Grand Jury and Audience Awards for a Narrative Feature.

The film is considered one of the best films of 2013, appearing on several critics' year-end lists.\n\nRotten Tomatoes critical consensus reads, \"Short Term 12 is an emphatic, revealing drama that pulls audiences into the perspective of neglected youths. Germain Lussier of /Film wrote of the film, \"The whole thing just feels perfect or magical, a shining example of what cinema is all about\", adding, \"The performances are mindblowing, the writing sharp, and the direction beautiful. It's a very special movie.\" In Variety, critic Peter Debruge wrote, \"the stunning SXSW fest winner puts the recent Park City competition lineup to shame ... this compelling human drama finds fresh energy in the inspirational-teacher genre, constantly revealing new layers to its characters.\" In a review for the Los Angeles Times, Kenneth Turan described Short Term 12 as \"a small wonder\", \"a film of exceptional naturalness and empathy\", and \"moving and intimate\", offering particular praise to the film's honesty and plausibility. Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian, on the other hand, criticized the film's credibility, describing it as \"well intentioned, but somehow inauthentic\" with a \"too-cute-to-be-true ending\".\n\nThere\u00b4s something truly compelling with this indie drama, despite the fact it is a \"traditional\" indie drama in many ways so to say. We have a main character in Grace that struggles in life and at the same time tries to help others in their struggle. I really really like Brie Larson as she has such a natural way of acting and she really becomes her character. It\u00b4s a joy to see her on the screen. As Katie Walsh of Indiewire wrote, \"[Larson] manages to convey her character as someone fierce and strong and steely, and also utterly fragile, delicate, scared and broken ... It's an incredible emotional and physical performance, and she's a whirlwind.\" That is spot on. \"Short Term 12\" has that lingering feeling of authenticity and almost being a documentary, which makes you really believe in what you see on the screen. Destin Daniel Cretton has directed this film with a strong hand and Brie Larson shows what a great actress she is. I like that the film is dialogue driven and the set pace gives the characters breathing space in their emotional journeys. \"Short Term 12\" is a great little indie drama despite being a \"traditional\" indie film as said.

All so real. I felt all the characters lives, all their pain. \nEven the hip hop song he wrote---and NO, I don't listen to hip-hop but reject it--- truly brought me to tears & resonated in my head for a long time.

Although. no worries that  it's too \"hard\" a view, not at all. NO matter what you think...see it ANYHOW, That is not the most pressing reason (to check your own life situation). NEVER relies on fake sentimentality or often used manipulative tactics, this ones about as real as life comes. Rings sincere! And yet immensely inspiring & hopeful. These kids & the 2 actors will blow you away. \nWhat a terrific little gem of a film. Masterful. \nGo see it!!",

Her character, Grace, is a young woman in charge of the day-to-day care of the troubled kids who inhabit a short term foster care facility.  Looking after the kids comes naturally to Grace, but she struggles with the hardships of her own life. When her center takes on a new young girl, Grace is reminded of her own unspeakable past.\n\nBrie Larson will turn in great performances for a long time. If you liked Room, you'll love Short Term 12. Larson's humanity is so closely tied in her warmth and vulnerability. It's painful to think of the situations some kids call reality, but the characters' authenticity provide a semblance of guidance and comfort, even when they don't all have it for themselves. Mr. Robot's Rami Malek also delivers a solid performance as the newest staff member who realizes he may be in over his head.\n\nWhile the movie is excellently shot and scored, I was most impressed was how well the screenplay handled exposition.  Nothing needed to be explained, and nothing was over explained. You are given exactly what you need to know and nothing more, and it's dealt in a way that never feels ham-fisted. Instead, you grow to care for the characters because of the subtlety, not because you're told to care for them.  Short Term 12 packs some emotion but is full of hopeful laughs and smiles. Maybe keep a chopped onion close by so you have an excuse.",

Destin Daniel Cretton; the writer-director, surpasses its witty script through his brilliant execution skills and offers an adequate response to the raised questions in here. Brie Larson pulls off her role convincingly despite not getting the expected support from her supporting cast. It is short on technical aspects like sound department but is fulfilling in editing and its camera work which makes it pleasing to encounter as it keeps it light; contradict to its premise. The minor dilemma in here would be the priority of the character and its perspective that is kept above the plot track which bars the range of the feature a bit.

This was the first film that I noticed Brie Larson and John Gallagher Jr. as this is a small film, and it's all about the acting here. So for this, they were amazing in this that it's honestly one of their best. The movie does a great job of establishing the characters into human beings that has human problems to deal with, and you feel sorry for a lot of them. The writing by the director is well-written and tight that it understands the drama of the situation and what the children, even the people working there, are going through as Destin Daniel Cretton actually have some experience of working in a facility like that. It feels very realistic, and also very human as people care about each other, even if they don't show it. The pacing is slow, but it still keeps you interested thanks to the acting, the writing, and the likable characters that'll entertain you while also giving a lot of sense of heart.",

The story of a social worker trying to deal with the problems of others while struggling fervently with her own is presented so humanely that you quickly begin to accept that these are not actors portraying the problems, but real people living them. Brie Larson, in the role that allegedly won her the Oscar-winning lead in Room, is fantastic. She has a permanent look of weariness constantly stuck behind a barrier of optimism and false smiles. What she goes through might be a little clich\u00e9, but it's handled sensitively, and Larson's ability to pull us into what she's going through keep it grounded and believable. The child actors are especially good, and inject their parts with enough flair and gravitas that they're not completely outdone by the adults. It may be too slow for many, but I loved it, and would recommend it to anyone looking for a film with relatable characters, moments to remember and questions to contemplate.",

A film with a natural aesthetic needs to rely on its actors and scenarios to anchor it, tighten it, draw you into its world and fell for that world's inhabitants. Short Term 12 has a typically underwhelming opening, but one perhaps rife for larger metaphor.\nAs a bunch of camp workers stand around sharing a rather crude story, we get a sense of a very relaxed, mumblecore tone being established. They are a bunch of late twentysomethings, directionless, moping about and telling stories. It is the kind of indie film pastiche seen many time. Yet suddenly, a disturbed child rushes from an adjacent door and hurtles towards an exit. Suddenly, there is panic and shouting, the mood becomes tense. This is the essence of Short Term 12 . From the relaxed tone of mumblecore comes real shock and, occasionally, real darkness.\nYes, the camp is a camp for troubled youths. Where escape attempts are but minor worries when put in context of suicide attempts. Indeed, any plot arch that attempts to reach outside the realm of the camp almost seems futile. For instance, I'm struggling to even remember the presence of a romance between Grace (Brie Larsen) and Mason (John Gallagher Jr) after the fact, as the discussion will no doubt center so strongly on the scene involving the teens. Petty squabbles become major threats, and any attempt to get to close to troubled youths may be dangerous.\nThe film's universe carries the sort of consequences inherent to a war film. A rap performance in particular may leave you breathless; a scene in which the teens decorate a fellow housemates walls carries devastating weight. Yet, the film has an optimistic undercurrent, one that manifests in the viewer a possible fulfillment amidst emotional exhaustion.",

            "content": "With SPECTRE and THE HUNGER GAMES dominating the box office of late, the cinemas won't be showing anything worth our time and money until STAR WARS arrives in three weeks' time. That makes it a good time to look at some gems that may have missed our attention. One of these is SHORT TERM 12, which was released in 2013 but never made it to Hong Kong. It stars Brie Larson, a name that may not mean much to you now but will very soon. Her latest film, ROOM, was released in the US yesterday and should make it to our shores in early 2016. The advance word on the film is extremely positive. It has been playing the festival circuit since September and has already racked up eight awards there. I mentioned Brie in one of my early reviews, DON JON. She has a very small part in that film but she makes it a memorable one. She also appeared in THE SPECTACULAR NOW, which was one of my favourite films of 2014.\n\nGrace (Larson) works as a supervisor at a short-term group home for emotionally broken teenagers. The kids are supposed to stay there for less than a year - until the county figures out what to do with them - but, as we learn, some, like Marcus (Keith Stanfield), are there for more than three years. Grace and her three fellow counsellors have a huge job on their hands and it wouldn't be surprising if they cracked under pressure but they all seem to be able to handle each day's challenges with a heady mix of professionalism, empathy, humour, gravity and a bit of exhaustion. Grace, herself, is soft-spoken but she's not afraid to enforce the facility's rules - no closed doors, no profanity spoken, and no unauthorised leaving. Thankfully, most of the kids understand the rules and appreciate her tough love approach but there are a couple of kids who are still too deeply troubled to be able to stay on track all the time.\n\nGrace's guarded world slowly starts to unravel when three big events hit her at the same time - she learns that she's pregnant; she receives word that her father will be released from prison; and Jayden (Kaitlyn Dever), a new charge, arrives at the home bearing emotional and physical scars that Grace seems to understand a little too well. Though she is well able to overcome the trust issues that the kids have, she can't seem to be able to tear down her own wall, particularly when it comes to her boyfriend and co-worker, Mason (John Gallagher Jr.; TV's THE NEWSROOM).\n\nSHORT TERM 12 was written and directed by Destin Daniel Cretton, who once worked in a California facility similar to this one. His experiences there formed the basis of a short film of the same name that he wrote in university as his thesis project. It was released in 2008 to great praise. The long version of the film has been a festival darling since it premiered at the SXSW Film Festival in March 2013. There, it won both the Grand Jury and Audience awards, and 32 more awards at other festivals from Abu Dhabi to Mexico.\n\nThere are a couple of scenes in the film (Marcus' rap song and Jayden's children's story) that will absolutely break your heart but this film is far from being mawkish. All the performances are delivered with such sincerity you may just think that these actors understand abuse on a firsthand level. Larson's quiet and sensitive performance, though, really stands out in this work that is both solidly written and directed. As much as Grace would like to like to sublimate her own past, the events that surround her won't let her. Through her, the kids and even Mason, we see that while you can cover up the scars, they remain with you long after the abuse ends.",

Grace seems to know the right approach to penetrating even the sturdiest veneer, but that understanding stems from similar incidents in her own past that she's never truly addressed. It can often seem easier to show others the way than to do the same for yourself, I suppose. Surrounding Larsen is an excellent set of supporting efforts, helmed by John Gallagher Jr. as her big-hearted secret boyfriend/coworker, but the real show-stealers are the kids themselves. Each touched with a turgid, tragic set of challenges all their own, they succeed at portraying mistrust, resentment, anger, helplessness... and, strikingly, an innate sense of community. Their complexities are the keys to this story, gateway to a dark world that many of us would never dare to explore on our own. Efficient, emotional, intense but not oppressive - tension-breakers arrive in all the right moments - this was a wonderful surprise, and something that's bound to stick with me for some time.",

The film stars a then-unknown, Brie Larson, in a star-making performance that was clear evidence of her great work to come and her stripped-down and damaged portrayal of this character really stuck with me. John Gallagher Jr is also terrific here as a fellow co-worker and long-term boyfriend to Larson's character who seems incapable of making her happy, which drives a majority of the hard-hitting drama in the film. As said, this film is pretty bleak at times due to the frank realism; each troubled youth suffering from their individual nuances, but it's also uplifting seeing how much the staff care about helping people and you leave the film feeling fulfilled emotionally. The story takes some predicable turns (and a few way out of left-field) but overall this is a solid drama that stands out due to the exceptional performances from the two leads and the serious handling of the subject matter is praise-worthy.",

I absolutely LOVED this film, I'm usually an action movie guy, mostly out of fear of being bored to death, but I will dip my toes into other material. Everything about this film is perfect. The plot is so interesting and grabs you tightly especially in its third act. The actors and actresses were all fantastic, I knew Brie Larson and John Gallagher Jr were going to be fantastic here, it's what I've come to expect. The huge surprise was the actor who played Marcus. Holy. Shit. He absolutely blew me away and was such an interesting character who I really wanted to know more about. The guy didn't talk much and every time the actor made his dialogue somehow the ones I wanted to hear the most. The dialogue was amazing, I really was hanging onto every word said because it all seemed so real and yet otherworldly. The plot was incredibly interesting and it gave a ton of surprises that really worked for me. It gave an array of very intriguing characters that I wanted to know more and more about no mater how much was revealed about them. The ending was extremely satisfying and gave a real sense of everything being alright despite the recent turmoil these people went through. I know it will never happen, but I really want to see something showing these characters a few years or months later, especially the Marcus character, I don't know where I'd rank it in all time performances I've ever seen, but it's definitely a favorite of mine especially since it would've been so easy to make the guy just an angry little shit that would've got annoying after a while, but Keith Stanfield really gave Marcus something extra. Short Term 12 is by far one of the best films I have ever seen, and I would HIGHLY recommend it to everyone",

            "content": "\"Short Term 12\" is a powerful story of resiliency and the transformative power of love.  This genuine, honest portrayal of troubled teenagers is based on the real life experiences of director Destin Daniel Cretton.  Many of the characters and scenarios in the story are based on people that he encountered while working at a group facility.  It is a chilling dose of realism that will immediately engage your empathy toward teens that come from bad family situations.  Stylistically, the film uses just enough shakey cam to make it feel personal but not so much that it makes you sick.  Once it draws you in to its reality, there are a few inevitable tearjerker moments but it is nice to see that every drama does not have to end in the depths of depression.  There are even a few moments that will make you laugh!  My only issue with the script is the excessive language.  I agree that much of the profanity spoken by the teens in the facility is absolutely necessary to create the realism of their mental situations.  My issue is with the conversations of the workers.  A film like this needs to give the audience a break from the profanity so that we do not become desensitized.  By including f-words and s-words in every scene, they become less potent in the most powerful moments of the film.  While the film is set up for success with this profound script, it comes together through strong acting from top to bottom.  Between Brie Larson's powerhouse performances in this film and in \"Room,\" she has established herself as the next big Hollywood actress.  She possesses the ability to harness the raw emotions from deep in her soul and portray them through her characters.  The real surprise is 16-year-old Kaitlyn Dever as the passive aggressive character Jayden.  Her spectrum of emotions ranges from subtle sarcastic facial expressions to a total mental breakdown.  The rap by Marcus (played by Keith Stanfield) is completely heartbreaking.  All of the residents of the facility perform beyond their years, and the cast is rounded out by John Gallagher, Jr. as the balance between normal and disturbed.  \"Short Term 12\" is not the most well-known film but it is a must for fans of \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,\" \"Girl, Interrupted,\" and any other drama that creates a realistic portrayal of life in an institution.",

            "content": "Right off the bat let me just say this, if anyone thinks that Brie Larson's Oscar for Best Actress was some kind of lucky fluke, then they need to go back and check out this movie from earlier in her career. Her performance in Short Term 12 might be even better than Room, and I think John Gallagher Jr. manages to pull off the same high quality acting. Actually all the cast is magnificent and that's impressive particularly because of how young some of these actors were at the time. The film is about life in a short-term housing facility for at-risk teenagers. As the movie progresses we see how the staff and residents manage to form bonds that provide healing and growth. It's a tough film to watch at times because the home situations that some of these people came from is bad (to say the least,) and they are dealing with trauma because of that. But then there are other moments where we see the connections they make with one another and it melts my heart and even made me cry more than once. The story isn't shockingly new or unique, there aren't big twists and turns in the plot, and the characters don't surprise you by acting in ways you wouldn't expect. But there was something so heart-warming, authentic, and special about the story that I loved it from start to finish. I'm so glad I caught it while it's free on Netflix streaming because this is a film that I probably wouldn't have sought out otherwise. I highly recommend you track down Short Term 12, because this is a movie that left me with a big smile on my face, and I hope it will do the same for you.",

            "content": "This film is extraordinary. The film basically is about a group of kids who have all got something wrong in their life. Whether it be abusive parents, recent loss, mental issues or anything of the sort. They stay at Short Term 12 until they move on somewhere else. \n\nBut although the story seems like your basic story of this ilk I am telling you it is so much more than that. On the surface, these kids and adults all seem fine but once you start to delve into their lives you realise just how much trouble they have been through. \n\nThere are 3 stand-out characters in my mind. Brie Larson as Grace,  Kaitlyn Dever as Jaden and Keith Stanfield as Marcus. All three of these characters are masterfully portrayed by their acting counterparts and all have different problems. Grace and Jaden meet after Jaden is sent to Short Term 12 after the passing of her mother and immediately hit it off.  Both seem to find common ground in their suffering and the rapport between the two girls is glistening while you watch. There is one scene between the two. After an incident where Jaden strikes out because her Dad didn't pick her up on her birthday the two of them sit in the cool down room. Grace says to Jaden \"All of the problems in the world are impossible to deal with when there is blood coming out of you.\" This essentially sums up the mentality of somebody in a dire situation. Many do not understand how it feels and I do not claim to but from all of the films I have seen dealing with this delicate subject I have never seen it summed up better.\n\nMarcus' character is one that seems easy to read at first. He's the cool kid who has a problem with anybody who doesn't follow his lead but there is a scene where he opens up to one of the staff in a whole new way. He sits in his room and reads out a rap that describes his childhood. It's extremely powerful.\n\nAll in all this film is a masterpiece. I feel sad that it has taken me almost 3 years to watch it and now that I have I sense the way I look at certain situations will change. Not many films give you that kind of reaction when you finish them but this small, hipster film did just that.",

            "content": "There's a moment in Short Term 12, about an hour in, that feels so wildly out of place it will take your breath away. It's a scene out of any number of movies-a slasher flick, a gangster movie, the Jennifer Lopez vehicle Enough-but certainly not this tender-hearted drama about struggling teenagers and the two formerly-struggling teenagers turned barely-keeping-it-together adults who take care of them. And just when you think Short Term 12 has finally fallen off the tightrope it so expertly navigated for that first hour, a well-placed quip and, shortly thereafter, an emotionally devastating revelation bring it back to a place of unequivocal brilliance.\n\nThat's the film in a nutshell. It toes so many lines-it's at times almost too mawkish, frenetic, and under-detailed. But it improbably manages to avoid being any of those things. It is, instead, parts an onion-like character piece and a penetrating coming-of-age drama that manages to sprinkle in just enough beneath-the-pain smiles to make the exercise enjoyable. Simply put, it's a once-in-a-blue-moon movie that's sure to rank among my very favorites this year.\n\nThe film's title refers to the home for at-risk teens that Grace (Brie Larson) and Mason (John Gallagher Jr.) work at. Both are great at jobs they love, and both are lucky to have found love on the job. Yes, Grace and Mason are together. It's not a well-kept secret, but they aren't trying to keep it a secret. Grace, however, is keeping a secret from Mason; she's pregnant.\n\nWhile she contemplates having an abortion (it'd be her second) or keeping it, a new girl arrives at Short Term 12. Jayden (Kaitlyn Dever) has been in and out of homes like this her whole life; she knows the rules. Grace is taken with this girl almost immediately, and she's able to connect with Jayden in a way no one-including her father-has been able to. But there's a reason she's here, and as things start to go south with Jayden, so they do with Grace. She has some tendencies, and as various pressures in her personal life threaten to boil over, those tendencies begin to show.\n\nOne must start with Larson. Acting this good just doesn't happen very often. It brings to mind Elizabeth Olsen's breakout turn in Martha Marcy May Marlene in 2011, if not substantially than at least in the sense that it should make the young actress a star. Larson, of course, isn't a total stranger. She was the romantic lead in 21 Jump Street. She also popped up in The Spectacular Now and Rampart, but to lead a film as good as Short Term 12 and as well as she does is, well, pretty huge and monumentally impressive.\n\nWhat's great about the performance is what's also great about writer/director Destin Cretton's top-notch screenplay. The film opens with a monologue-one of several laugh-out-loud funny monologues from John Gallagher Jr., who's also terrific in the film-and while it's being told, we see Grace as this put-together good samaritan. Along the way, it's little details-the way she nervously picks her skin, her almost obsessive protectiveness over Jayden-that hint at a dark past. She's not an open person, however, so there's a nagging mystery at the heart of the film. It never suffocates us-character very much comes first in Short Term 12-but we're fed just enough story to remain satisfied throughout.\n\nI really adore Short Term 12 for so many reasons-including its deliberately unpolished look-and it's a little tricky to define why other than to say I've seen films like this many times that fail, moderately or miserably. Not so with Cretton's feature (based on a short he directed in 2008). It's an utterly delightful experience. Its subject matter isn't joyful, but you'll find joy instead in the perfect way it all comes together.\n\nhttp://www.johnlikesmovies.com/short-term-12-review/",

However, like many downer movies, this is also uplifting in that it highlights people's ability to cope with extreme situations.  The acting is naturalistic and these people felt real - only occasionally does the script lead them to be a bit more overt about their feelings/problems than you might expect.  That said, people hurting this bad might actually cross that line into awkward self-exposure as a cry for help.  Brie Larson is the backbone of the film, as the lead line worker who has a similar background to many of the kids in the facility and struggles to keep her balance as life keeps happening to her.  Not the kind of film I would normally choose for escapism but I'm glad I did.",

I love the dynamic between Grace and Jayden, but parts of it bothered me.  There are several scenes where Grace opens up to Jayden about her own abuse, but all of these instances are unprompted.  It makes me wonder what was so special about Jayden?  What kept Grace from opening up to Marcus or Luis... or her boyfriend.  Sure, sometimes there is something special about a person and you feel oddly connected to them... but this is a movie.  These types of things need to be explained... or else questions such as mine arise.  I didn't like the overuse of shaky-cam.  It made the movie feel atmospheric for sure, but also made me feel nauseated.  The acting is by far the movie's strong point.  Couple that with the fact that I worship Brie Larson, relate to this material and am super into indie flicks -- you've got a perfect recipe for a movie I'll love... despite several major flaws in the script.",

            "content": "Sometimes a movie that on the surface may seem small in both scale and scope has much more to say than anyone gave it credit for until they themselves have seen it. Destin Cretton's feature debut Short Term 12 is one of those films whose synopsis does not give it credit for what it broaches in its short 90 minute running time.\n\nComing out of nowhere and striking a chord with audiences the world over Short Term 12 is a fantastically written and observant film that has a lot to say about both disconnected youth and those whose lives have been affected by sometimes unspeakable trauma. Cretton has a deft touch both in his screen writing and in his gritty hand-held filming approach and the two mould together to paint an emotionally driven portrait of those in the \"limbo\" house between broken home and new foster accommodation. There are some striking scenes in the film namely a heartbreaking rap from Marcus (Stanfield) a boy who has clearly experienced much heartbreak or two bookend scenes played out with dialogue chronicling adventures of the homes residents. These moments in the film showcase Cretton as a talent to watch just like the films leading lady Brie Larson.\n\nSmall films like Short Term 12 have been a breeding ground for break out performances for years now, with those looking to break into a tough industry choosing tough roles to show off their wares. Brie Larson here in her role as conflicted and inwardly troubled worker Grace stamps herself as an actress capable of both pure heartrending emotion and an equal talent at comedic timing and lovable charm, no doubt a few tricks were learned from her time in praised TV show The United States of Tara and supporting roles in films such as 21 Jump Street and Don Jon. It's a pleasure to see an actress grow before your eyes as Larson does and she is ably supported by an impressive adult cast and a cast of young adults that are led by Justified's impressive young actress Kaitlyn Dever.\n\nShort Term 12 is as stated a small film that deals with big issues and deals with them in a way that is both confronting yet in a manner that seems just right. It's a film brimming with heart and personality and a film that could stand equal to many more high profile films of last year. I personally can't wait to see where both Larson and Cretton go to next.\n\n4 hated inflatable dogs out of 5 \n\nFor more movie reviews and opinions check out - \n\nwww.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com",

It doesn't have any major stars (though Brie Larson seems on her way to becoming one) or anything technically remarkable about it, but it's got everything it needs to be powerfully moving.\n\nThe story follows Grace (Larson), a young woman who works at a short-term care home for at-risk teenagers. She's a humble and compassionate presence to her young charges, but we slowly learn that she's got some serious damage of her own. In following her story, the movie also provides significant glimpses into the life of her boyfriend, who also works at the home, and several of the kids she takes care of. There are other movies out there in which a teacher or social worker tries to help troubled youths (the gratingly fake Half Nelson and the overblown and ridiculous Precious come to mind), but few if any of them feel as honest and real as this one. There isn't that much more than that to say, really. This is a great movie in a very simple and straightforward way. It's genuinely compassionate for its characters' problems and doesn't provide easy or fake solutions. And the excellent closing scene illustrates very clearly how life just goes on. I strongly recommend it.",

Brie Larson as the most ambitious employee in this film was great! She was an awesome character, I wanted to go through the screen and give her a hug. I pretty much wanted to do that with all the main characters because they are really likable compassionate people! The characters have great chemistry together and it really shines in this movie. The film mainly shows the troubled pasts of Marcus and Jaden and they were really likable too. Their backstories were very sad and got the tears jerking. This is a very sad movie but that really works with the chemistry between Jaden and Grace because of how much they had in common. Their relationship was so good and interesting to watch. The whole baby situation and starting a family was a bit overused for the movie but nevertheless I enjoyed that too. This is a movie that I believe the world needs. I learned stuff from this movie that in my opinion is essential to know in life and to keep in mind. Short Term 12 is full of heart, tragedy, tears, great characters and a great story. A-",

            "content": "There are a short list of films that for whatever reason strike a emotional nerve with me.  They don't necessarily have to be about something that I personally identify with, but they do such an effective job at pulling me into their world and their characters and their trials that I feel like, just by watching, I'm toeing emotional eggshells.  Short Term 12 is one of those films.\n\nThe movie focuses on a group of people who supervise a home for foster kids who are considered \"at-risk\".  The film opens with the workers on a break of sorts, chatting it up and enjoying themselves.  It's funny, but it's also a great way to acclimate the audience with these very real people who have a hell of a job.  The head of this group, Grace, is played to perfection by the charismatic Brie Larson.  She hammed it up for cameras as Envy Adams in Scott Pilgrim vs. The World, but here you'll find a much more real persona.  People talk of a lack of heroines in films and while I know they're mostly referring to those of the action variety, Grace is inspiring in a very different capacity.  She's struggling to deal with her own shoddy past and how that's fucked up her life, all while helping teenagers try to deal with their own shit.\n\nIf the movie sounds like it deals with some serious subject matter, that's because it does.  Don't let that scare you away though because thankfully the film knows when to lighten the tone so the whole ordeal doesn't go \"Requiem for a Dream\" on ya.  A large source of the amusement comes from supporting character Mason, Grace's love interest.  He also works with the troubled teens and actor John Gallagher Jr. keeps Mason from becoming a caricature.  He's a funny guy, but the kind that's real-world.  You wouldn't mind sitting down and having a drink with the man.  And then there's the kids themselves, and each one walks and talks with an aura of authenticity.  There's not a scene or a moment you'll question.\n\nAs you can see, I've talked mostly about the characters of this story.  The plot threads weave themselves in and out of this foster care program, but what you'll remember is the characters these people portray.  Life can be hard, especially for a teenager.  When they don't have a family who can help guide them, these people in foster care programs are more than just names and faces; they ARE family.  This film has a lot of heart and it often hurts but I'm happy to say that I found a very uplifting message come the film's close.",

It follows a protagonist, who acts as a guide for children or young adults in order to prepare or shelter them from the real world. The prime difference between the two films is that both are caring for two different aspects of a person's life; The Class on education and wisdom, while Short Term 12 on emotional and physical trauma. The Class swept me away due to its empathetic and sympathetic protagonist and featuring problems that were a genuine reflection of our own classrooms. Short Term 12 certainly hits the mark in delivering effective and authentic drama, but it didn't \"move\" me as much when watching it.\n\nThe film does not feature a core complication for the audience to dwell on, therefore it does not establish any sort of measurable goal. Instead, Short Term 12 is a character-study, under the facade of a documentary style, as it simply follows the life Grace and exploring the relationships that she is trying to maintain within and outside the residential facility. The film allows us to see the connections she has with her profession and how that and her personal history build and shape her relationships. Grace displays a sense of empathy towards the young residents, as a way to make them feel comfortable; her aim is to build a shield for them, so they won't have to suffer from the evil that lurks outside. Though she acts as a mentor to these people, she herself is not as composed and balanced as she displays herself to be; there are some demons that are feeding from her soul, and with each problem that surface, it becomes harder and harder for her to survive in her profession, especially in an emotional level.\n\nThe film's camera-work utilises a hand-held approach in order to achieve that intimate documentary feel that Destin Daniel Cretton, the director, requires to tell this story. It creates this feeling, like as if the audience was a spectating caretaker herself, following and monitoring Grace; similar to what she and her co-workers does when a person escapes from their facility.\n\nShort Term 12 wouldn't have been the emotional and intimate ride that it is, if it weren't for Brie Larson's performance. Larson was able to meet the demands that were needed in making this role come off as sophisticated and most importantly, real. Her role is the type that would normally cry out to its audience for sympathy, but she does not force it down our throats; the timing and tone that she delivers her dialogue makes her character's own personal story feel natural and convincing.\n\nShort Term 12 is drama at its purest form. The film did not require screaming matches or physical confrontation to create tension and it showcases a marvellous performance from Brie Larson. If this does not lead her to more varied and sophisticated roles, then cinema and its audience are missing out on a wonderful thing.",

At the crux of the film is Grace (Larson) who leads the facility's workers and helps kids while also dealing with her own life. It's really quite sweet that Grace and her boyfriend Mason (Gallagher) have fragmented childhoods, and so they have to (rather than want to) help ease the pain of these children and the problems they face. In comparison is a college worker who would like to help, but doesn't know where to start. The performances from the child actors in this film are nothing short of astounding. Brie Larson commands complete presence onscreen, as Grace, a multi-faceted basket case who is always trying to do better, but inevitably has to fight her demons.

It has mostly unfamiliar faces and it is terrificly original, which makes for some superb realism in filmaking you can't get on Mainstream. You've heard about this movie. And you should see it.\nShort Term 12 is about a Foster Care center for Trouble Kids, and Grace (Brie Larson) along with his boyfriend Mason (John Gallagher Jr) love their job of running the place. As the movie flows through our veins, we discover more about these characters, and oh god, Short Term 12 is really that good.\nIt has lots of humour, to begin with. It sort of plays with the fact that this teens have trouble and that leaves us some quirky moments. It's impossible not to smile as every positive moment is so heartwarming. This movie really gets the feels, and in both ways, as it is also heartwrenching. Of course it is expected. It is a film that is not shy of showing how messed up some of this kids are. The emotional payoff is sensational, and thanks to amazing performances, the film is an A+ Superior Tearjerker.\nBrie Larson is magnetic. Every presence is a scene stealer. She is really coming to herself as a great actress and the heart and soul of this film. Destin Cretton has crafted a film so amazing that it is a contemporary masterpiece. On demand, on Hulu or wherever you find it, go watch Short Term 12, and tell other people to watch it. It is a necessary, but also thoroughly enjoyable little gem that is full of energy and punch.",

Anyway, here we go.\n\nTo give some context, I worked as a Child and Youth Worker for over four years in group and foster care homes. Therefore, when I watched this, I watched it from the perspective of a worker rather than just a viewer being captivated at the great story here of the children's realities, but also the worker's realities as well. As there is some obvious sensationalism for the sake of the movie in terms of Brie Larson's character, the movie is scaringly accurate to what life is like as a worker within group homes. \n\nDown to the first scene, it was clear that the writer of the movie knew what he was talking about. I can't tell you how many times those situations happened. The realism of the charts on the walls, binders of client files, and just the overall look of the home screamed authenticity. It was really hard for me to watch at times because as a former front-line worker, seeing restraints within the film brought out some traumatic events of my own as a CYW. \n\nBeing spit on, kicked, punched, bitten, almost having your eyes gouged out, etc. These are just some of the circumstances that workers face when working with at-risk children and youth. However, what most people don't know is the sheer lack of respect worker's get, and the severe lack of funding/pay worker's receive. Worker's are over-worked (I would sometimes work 24 hour long shifts with no breaks), underpaid, and undervalued. However, we press on for those kids. That's what matters. Those kids. They drive you, and even when they're having the worst day in their lives, it's the silly joke or face that brings them back down and makes them feel safe again.\n\nThank you, Destin Cretton and the cast and crew. Hopefully, this movie will gain the eye of the majority and people will recognize how difficult but rewarding this job really is.",

            "content": "Heartfelt, compelling, authentic, and visceral in its emotions, Short Term 12 is an amazingly impacting film. The story follows Grace, a young 20 something woman who works as a supervisor at a home for at-risk teens, along with her boyfriend. It is through Grace that we see the tragedy of the youth's lives, the anger, depression, confusion, and yet the hope that still abounds. It's a film of sadness, but also of love.\n\nToo many films along similar lines have resorted to clich\u00e9s or forced storylines to tell their story. This is not true of Short Term 12, which has an emotional intensity that is rare, and does this without melodrama. The characters in this film are treated with respect, not idealized or pitied, rather they are shown as what they are, we see the different coping mechanisms employed, while also understanding the underlining issues at hand. The family dynamics, and the dynamics amongst the youth feel real and organic to the story. The script is both finely written and poignant, delivering us a snap shot in a world that is hard to really face, but one that rings true.\n\nThe film is populated with fantastic performance, headlined by Brie Larson, in a role that should certainly serve as a launching point for her career. The direction, the pacing, the script, all are pitch perfect in a film that unfolds within itself without the use of gimmicks or plot devices. It's a methodical burn without being slow, subtle without holding back.\n\nA must see. \n\n\n4.5/5 Stars",

            "content": "A poster for Short Term 12 shows Grace (Brie Larson) chasing after a scrawny preteen, draped in an American flag, across a yard. This yard is in the foster child complex where Grace is employed beside her long-term boyfriend. Her specific unit, the titular \"Short Term 12,\" houses a spectrum of children ranging from around 8 to 17 years, 364 days. In a thankless profession, Grace struggles with her complex role as part housekeeper, administrator, mentor, babysitter, and occasionally warden. However, Grace's real trials aren't limited to her professional life; she is understandably overwhelmed by a multitude of other issues, including her increasingly complex bond with her boyfriend Mason (John Gallagher Jr.) and a prison release with excruciating emotional effects on her mood and her relationships. As with any job, her personal challenges have significant effect on her work duties, for better or worse. \n\nAs wonderfully crafted of a script as this was, writer (and director) Destin Cretton owes an incredible debt to lead Brie Larson. I saw Larson earlier this year in The Spectacular Now where she played a small but significant role. In that role, she easily kept up with the fantastic performances of Miles Teller and Shailene Woodley, who have the ability to act anyone off the screen. Here, she owns the leading role, forming a formidable onscreen partnership with John Gallagher Jr. who counters her occasionally introverted nature with a goofy and charming performance not unlike his role in HBO's The Newsroom. \n\nThe script, however, is not to be overlooked. Originally a short also written by Cretton, the dialogue and progression of the relationships were organic and unhurried, an unfortunately rare trait in many movies in the genre which usually put tear-jerking ahead of a script which attempts to mirror reality. Short Term 12 partially focuses on the uneasy bond between a new foster child Jayden (Kaitlyn Dever) and Grace, and while the parallels between these two are certainly no surprise, they're presented smartly and with a sense of purpose, rather than just looking to draw a reaction from the audience.\n\nThere were a few elements of Short Term 12 which were perhaps a bit fatigued. The score, while initially spunky and different, became quite tired by the end of the film, having what seemed like limited variety to really accentuate emotions as the story progressed. The visual palate was similarly limited, perhaps accurately reflecting the dry, hot Los Angeles setting, but really never seemed utilized to its full potential (especially considering the phenomenal editing and camera work; every scene was deliberate and resonate). \n\nShort Term 12 is a gut-wrenching film, not necessarily sad and certainly not downbeat, but rather overwhelming emotional. Certainly we can identify with Grace's struggles; overworked, underappreciated, balancing life at home with professional duties. The way in which Grace and her coworkers relate to their young residents is thought-provoking and even inspiring. Cretton presents to us a role in society which could have easily been exploited for tears, and he instead challenges us to question the motives and choices Grace, Mason, their boss, and even the kids who reside in Short Term 12.\n\nRead more reviews at RJGFilmAnalysis.com",

She shows her tenacity and toughness by never giving up on the kids even though she has problems of her own.  She forms an especially powerful bond with Jayden (Dever), a girl who mirrors a lot of her own troubles.

Short Term 12 takes place at a home for at-risk teens. Supervised by four people, probably in their mid-30's, who find the balance between being cool and authoritative. The newcomer, Nate, has to ease into the sometimes wild and vicious fits that only afflicted humanity can muster. When Mason (John Gallagher Jr) begins the film telling a funny story about when he defecated his pants on a bus, Pete laughs, but later in the movie when it is revealed that the bully who picked on him killed himself and was found in a bush, he is taken aback. \"Yea. I don't like that part,\" Mason replies. The standout performance, of this film and of her young career, is Brie Larson. She is at the center of this home, and the center of the story. Having gone through a lot of what the kids are suffering through when she was a girl, Brie Larson's character Grace is able to level with the more afflicted teens who are shocked to find out that they're not alone. Grace is compassionate for these kids and desperately wants them to do well. When one of the girls is released back to her father who Grace believes is sexually abusive, she blows up on her boss and loses her job. These kids mean a lot to her and its a way for her to deal with her own pain, but when questions of the future begin to be raised concerning her loving boyfriend, Mason, she is conflicted. This film is a masterpiece of character, mood, and writing. The world of the at-risk home, even the term \"at-risk home,\" is an interesting hodgepodge family dynamic that is worth investigating. Here our authoritative figures, who are not quite parents, and here are their kids who are not quite their kids. Everyone knows that this place is only a short term thing, and plus, that they are afflicted, so everyone is free to be themselves and in a way, act out their wild raging impulses with the safe, judge-free environment. It really is a spectacular situation if you think about. I'll end with this. The ending of this movie is pure gold. I hope it get's the sort of attention and appreciation it deserves. It is the perfect metaphor for the message and tone of the movie. And I dare say that there is something uniquely American about it.",

Short Term 12, without a doubt, stands out as one of the greatest and most impactful indie films of 2013, and it deserves much acclamation for its gorgeous cinematography, deeply moving plot, and realistically humane style.\n\nShort Term 12 follows Grace, our kind-hearted yet troubled protagonist working at a foster-care home for underprivileged and troubled children, named-you guessed it-Short Term 12. Grace is the best at what she does-connecting with children living in the home and helping them through their social and emotional issues. She lives with her boyfriend Mason, and early into the film, Grace receives the news that she is pregnant. This unplanned pregnancy-along with various anxiety and familial issues-are all demons Grace must battle internally to remain strong and effective as a caretaker at the facility. Shortly thereafter, Short Term 12 receives a new intake named Jayden, a darkly dressed and bad-mannered teenage girl. Grace learns to connect quite well with Jayden, along with other members of the home, due to her similarly painful past.\n\nThe beauty of Short Term 12 lies in its striking realism, immersive character development, and engagingly symbolic cinematography. Every character has their moment to shine as we notice their individualistic mannerisms and the seemingly unimportant objects they pay attention to, each with its own emotionally dense backstory per respective character. Not a single scene is wasted in Short Term 12, relying on single-shot frames of scenery, events, and facial expressions as symbolic representations of the story being told. The film is both light-hearted and powerfully somber, injected with quick-witted humor the entire way through while slowly inching its way into your heart. \n\nThroughout its entertaining playfulness, Short Term 12 also forces you to face the dark realities of life, such as the children that suffer in neglected or abusive homes and its psychological consequences. This film is truly an accomplishment for indie cinema, because few films can be so amusingly clever and boldly genuine. At one point in the film, Mason is retelling one of his favorite stories and states, \"It was so f**king cute, I almost pissed my pants.\" The same can be said about Short Term 12, because it is a film that is simply impossible not to adore.",

What a shame, for \"Short Term 12\" was this quiet engagement that I couldn't peel my eyes away from, and was thus left speechless when it ended. It had such raw emotions and powerful dialogue that I was knocked off my stool and brought to tears. Brie Larson, whom I'm only starting to realize has played varied roles such as in \"Community\" and \"21 Jump Street,\" is brilliant as the youth worker who tries her best to reach out to troubled teens while dealing with her own dark history. Intimate and grounded, \"Short Term 12\" is definitely not a short-term film for me. It's a late addition to my favourite films of 2013 and it's staying there in the long-run.",

That's not to say that there isn't enough of it already here amid the fractured and fragile characters found in Short Term 12. Cretton delicately infuses the unrealised potential for far-reaching hopelessness here with a wholly welcoming delicate air of warmth and sensitivity.\n\nLeading the charge here is the fabulous Larson as Grace. Her stoic presence within such a potentially volatile environment is all the more remarkable when her outwardly simple life beyond the walls of the foster system she works in slowly starts to fracture. It's a subtle splintering that never, ever once lends itself to unnecessary overwrought dramatic irrationality. Through Cretton's screenplay, Larson gives Grace a vulnerable strength that centres the film and provides a stunning balance between her personal demons and the unwavering commitment she has towards her charges.\n\nCredit to Cretton's wonderful direction and screenplay in that as devastating as Short Term 12 could possibly be, the movie all the more stronger for holding back on some aspects of the characters lives. His focus on positive dialogue and creating a safe environment for his audience with a beautifully shot film never makes this anything less compelling than it is.\n\nShort Term 12 is a spectacular achievement in subtle intensity, and an exemplary example of beautifully affecting dramatic filmmaking. Combined with powerful, poignant, even courageous, performances across the board from such a capable young cast, the result is a surprising, significant film experience that's more than worth your time.",

It has got drama and for sure, it's got shitload of drama but the director has put in several tid-bits. It is well-infused with action and humour but not so much so as to over-shadow the main theme, which itself is intriguing but well-defined.\nThe director should be commended for his portrayal of grave topic which subtly stood out despite the strong acting. The characters do a very well job in providing just an optic, a keyhole to look and understand the base of the movie, shying away from providing any well-defined angle to understand this movie. Scenes seeming irrelevant at first fit in almost perfectly. Almost. \nTo encapsulate the above 2 paragraphs, this movie is transparent.\nThe first 20 seconds leave you curious but the last 20 seconds just makes you wish that the movie shouldn't end here. However the director and the actors leave you pretty satisfied in the end.\nIt is not a movie that you might watch during lunch but it is that 4 o'clock movie, when you have nothing else to do but you want your mind to be occupied.  It depicts the truth of the 'neglected youth' who are being taken care by 'neglected youth'. A movie that I deem must-watch\n\nAnd at the end of my first critique, I understand why some critics never make sense and use jumbled formations to say something that is as easy as 'Go, watch this goddamn movie' It probably makes sense just to the one who writes it..",

It's probably my direct experience with the subject matter that threw me off (15 years working with troubled kids), I was expecting a more realistic film.  Though the depiction of a few of the kids is pretty realistic, that's where it ends.  I keep hoping that one day a movie will actually get it right, but I guess I'll have to keep hoping.  Regardless of its inaccuracies, it's still an emotional film and effective on that level, even if the end is too sweet for the subject matter.  I just wish the filmmakers had done a little more research into what these kids are really like, and as well as the people who work with them and the child welfare system as a whole.

Writer/director Destin Daniel Cretton composes a movie that deals with how victims become victors. With a fantastic cast and a wonderful eye for drama and character, Cretton brings the audience into the world of people who work with at-risk teens, and the personal struggles they deal with.\n\nBut what Cretton does so well is making Short Term 12 more personal than I expected. In the hands of his lead actress, Cretton's story of a young woman exorcising her demons through her work with at-risk teens who have had similar struggles as her, becomes just as much about her triumph as the kids she's helping. Larson is so charismatic and sympathetic that even though she's so weathered from her tenure at Short Term 12 we still can see the passion in her eyes for what she's doing.\n\nWith the help of a supporting cast, Larson and Cretton bring such powerful emotion to bear on the story that you can't help but be drawn in. In both the dramatic and the sweeter character moments you'll find yourself invested in the emotions these performers are portraying. But Larson is the key here. Her performance is so subtle that she seems like a real person. We often forget she's acting, because she's portraying so many motivations and emotions at the same time.\n\nIt's a film that deals with complex emotions and storylines in a very simple way: heart. The film has a lot of heart, and it's clear everyone involved was passionate about the story being told. It's a definite must watch.",

It makes you believe it will fall into a simple \"girl helps all\" cliche, but turns itself onto another cliche regarding the \"girl has issues of her own\".  It's not necessarily a bad thing, just not solidifying it as a story piece and more about the characters (a la David O Russell).  The supporting cast is fine, providing moments of comedic touch, in an otherwise dark tale about abuse and power.\n\nThe camera work is a bit hectic, to symbolize the film's overall spastic nature to shift between tone so unevenly (totally it works, just the shakes cam has been done to death and is annoying).  It's not 99% good, but it's a satisfying movie to see raw emotions play out even if not every character is fully fleshed out (I'm looking at you Rosa!)",

Despite complications, there is a large amount of success shown in a very short period of time.  Otherwise, it would have been a bummer overall, which probably wasn't the director's goal.  I wouldn't say that it's any worse than your standard drama, but as far as cons go for this film, that's probably the main one.  Other than that factor, the film's reality isn't that heightened, it's mostly our world.  \n\nAnother comment I have, though less on the piece itself and more about my thoughts on the matter of kindness, is that this story doesn't depict people performing far beyond the standard empathic forcing function of helping another version of themselves.  The protagonists aren't really branching out and helping people that they don't immediately relate to.  I would tend to say that in universal social situations, reaching out beyond your realm is the more impressive action.  However, for the tightness of this story and the poignance of the fact that we aren't nearly as alone as we sometimes feel, it's a boon.  Are they agents of selfish compassion?  Perhaps, but I'll take it, it's leagues better than nothing.\n\nIf this film has one strength, it's naturalism.  The premise and dialog of these compassionate people using the fiber of their past as fuel to help the next generation is presented with full believability.  Brie Larson is apparently a chameleon because her earthbound performance here bears no resemblance to Envy Adams!  She displays a full range of emotions and states, with impressively limited histrionicity.  I'm happy to report that she has a bit of range, not unlike Jessica Chastain.  Keith Stanfield is also impressive as the dynamic youth Marcus.  \n\nThe film is also more visceral than I was expecting, underscoring how a restrained depiction of realistic circumstance often has more power than the most outrageous of blockbuster situations.  The tone of the film almost reminds me of a documentary or PTA's \"Magnolia,\" for some reason.  I suppose the degree of naturalism this film contains is somewhere between the sobriety of a documentary and the near surrealism of the latter.  Accolades-wise it was probably overlooked because it's centered on young people with the most significant characters maxing out in their 20s.\n\nWhile a bit too small to really stand out as a great film to me, \"Short Term 12\" is a very effective portrait of \"troubled\" edge city young people at different stages in their lives.

            "content": "Short Term 12?\n\nMore like Short Term FAIL.\n\nThere rarely comes a time when a film this highly praised is one I would unashamedly consider straight-up bad. There are many films that get equal amount of praise, that I personally may not like, but be able to watch objectively and at least understand why it has been so praised. Why someone would love it so much. But with Short Term 12?\n\nNo, it is bad. It is just not a good movie.\n\nI can sum up its problems very swiftly, wrapped in a single sentence or two, but I would much rather go into some detail of it. And no, I am not going to give you that short run-down. I would much rather you read some of the details.\n\nLet us first discuss the foster-care facility in which the majority of this film takes place.\n\nWe see, maybe, ten to fifteen teens here. There might be more, there might be less. Does not matter. Either way will prove my point. But for the sake of the initial argument, allow me to say there is roughly ten to fifteen teenagers. \n\nCool. Ten to fifteen teenagers in this facility? Not bad! This is good! The more the merrier, right?\n\nWell, guess what.\n\nThere is only four employees.\n\nAnd their boss who does not have much to do with anything regarding this place other than granting teenagers in and out.\n\nSo, allow me to bash some of these characters, okay? Which falls under under the facility, so I will be bashing that too. And this is also all bashing Short Term 12's writing. Okay?\n\nThanks.\n\nLEZ TALK BOUT GRACE\n\nThe Rotten Tomatoes consensus says \"Short Term 12 is an empathetic, revealing drama that pulls audiences into the perspective of neglected youths.\"\n\nThis is one of the most misleading consensuses I have ever read. I could break down each part of that sentence, exposing how flat-out wrong it is. But let me start with the last part, \"pulling audiences into the perspective of neglected youths\".\n\nWe only ever get involved with, in one way or another, with three of the teens staying at the facility. Two of each are not actually neglected. Marcus's mother beats him. Jayden's father abuses her. That is the opposite of neglection.\n\nHowever, the third teen (who we see three or five times, never having more than ten seconds of screen time), is one we can easily assume is neglected. Because it is stated in one scene that his therapist had just taken away his dolls or toys or whatever, which are said to be his only friends.\n\nAnyway, this film is not, by no means, told from the perspective of any of these teenagers individually or collectively. Instead, this film is told by Grace's perspective, our main character, one of the facility's employees. Which is AOK! I like this element! I am just pointing out the misunderstanding that is in Rotten Tomatoes' consensus.\n\nNow, Grace has been here for a while. We can infer, from a story told by Mason, that it has been at least three years. At least. But even without that, we know she is nowhere near new because she knows all the teenager's names, knows them inside and out, she leads all the meetings and programs all the activities. Et cetera.\n\nSome of the employee requirements to a job like this, I would assume, is to have a testimony. To have had a history of depressive and / or suicidal behavior. It is truly the only way you can have a real in with the teens. To be more than able to help and understand them. But, obviously, of course, you have to have been cleared as mentally stable yourself and whatnot prior to hiring. Which I am not sure how thorough this facility was with that process.\n\nGrace begins to lose it when she finds out Jayden, who had been giving some pretty symbolic yet blunt signs of an abusive father, is granted to go back home. To her abusive father. So she storms into her boss's office, Frank, to yell at him. And she certainly does. Calling him out as well. Some insults here and there. All of this is understandable. To a degree. But it is taken to a whole new level when she grabs his desk lamp and runs out back to smash it against the pavement. Shattering completely. \n\n1) Would she really do this? It is actually so forced and so unrealistic.\n\n2) Could this really be the first time this has happened? She acts as if it is. And you would think, since she has been there for three or more years, this is not the first time a teenager was taken back to the very home in which they are abused / neglected.\n\n3) How is she not fired or suspended for snatching her boss's desk lamp and smashing it to pieces? Not only for the crime of damaging someone's personal property, but because she is making a solid case against her mental stability. I mean, as Bill Engvall would say, \"There's your sign!\" \n\nI mean, the guy actually had some valid points. Jayden never outright said she was abused let alone abused by her father with whom she still lives with. Although that is not to say Grace is wrong either. She is most definitely right, but still. Solid evidence is nothing less than essential.\n\nLater, Grace goes all the way out to Jayden's house. Predictably to seek revenge. Which we know is not close by. Jayden ran away once from the facility and Grace followed her. It started from the afternoon and they did not get there until a while after it was dark.\n\nBut anyway, Grace goes all the way out there enraged.\n\nBreaks into the garage. Carefully scavenging for a weapon. And she settles on a baseball bat. She then proceeds into the house, looking for Jayden's father, so she can bash his brains out senselessly. \n\nIs this sounding realistic to you? Does this sound like something a foster-face facility employee would do? Especially one that has been cleared mentally stable? Sure, we all snap. We are not perfect. But how many of us, previous depressed / suicidal or not, would actually go to this length? This is just dumb.\n\nThen they go outside and beat up his car instead of his skull ... where the luxury car's alarm refuses to go off and nobody in the neighborhood can hear the sound of shattering glass for a good two minutes. Not even the neighbors.\n\nHave I made my point about Grace? \n\nShe is a poorly and unrealistically written character.\n\nMASON!!!!!!\n\nNow, Mason, although not indisputable like Grace, is also a terribly written character. Having said that, he is the best written character of Short Term 12. \n\nThere is one scene that really stands out to support this claim.\n\nOf him being poorly and unrealistically written, that is.\n\nIt is when Grace exits the hospital after waiting so long to hear about Marcus's condition and Mason goes after her. She is clearly upset, and it is clearly that there is more going on, so Mason pressures her (reasonably) to tell him what is happening with her. They are a long-term couple, yet Grace has trust issues. And somehow, Mason does not understand why. Needless to say, Grace cannot even explain it to him. Hence the trust issues.\n\nIt blows my mind away, that after all these years, Mason does not have a single clue to what is wrong. And I will tell you, readers.\n\nAnd Mason. If you're reading this.\n\nIt. Is. All. Be. Cause. Of. Her. Fath. Er.\n\nAt least three times in the film it is stated that her father is in prison. And has been for quite some time. We are told by Grace herself it has been over ten years. Thankfully, it is not said why he is in jail. What he did. But it has definitely put a toll on Grace. We can see her carrying it.\n\nDid he do something to her or her mother to go to prison? Maybe it is nothing related to abuse of any kind, maybe it is something else completely. Like tax evasion or something. But because he has been gone for ten plus years, missing the most important time in his kid's life, that has messed her up some. A father's absence can have an enormous effect on a child / kid / teenager.\n\nThough I am still willing to bet my money that his imprisonment is due to domestic abuse of sorts.\n\nSince, you know, Mason and Grace are a long-term couple, not to mention even longer friends, you could certainly presume Mason knows about her imprisoned father. And of course, he does. But how do we know this? Well, there is a scene when he answers the phone. When he hangs up, he tells her that it was her father's parole officer on the phone saying that her father is going to be released in a month.\n\nMason, seriously. How have you not realized this? The absence / abuse of her father has caused her to develop trust issues. This is not rocket science. I would think, since you yourself have had a troubled history, and that you have been working with troubled kids for over three years as well, that you could have figured this out ages ago and have talked to her about it already. But I guess you really are a poorly and unrealistically written character in this poorly and unrealistically written film.\n\nOMG TIME 4 NATE OMG NATE\n\nNate just might be the stupidest, most incompetent and pointless character of all-time. And further proves the incompetence of this foster-care facility in which the majority of this film takes place.\n\nFirst of all, he calls the teenagers \"underprivileged\" to their faces. Yeah, I know, he did not mean to offend them, but how stupid are you? Why would you call anyone underprivileged and to their faces? Even if they were somehow underprivileged? \n\nHe lacks any confidence whatsoever. Is awkward as awkward gets and has no idea what he is doing at any given time. He just does everything wrong. Nor does he seem to have any level of understanding regarding not only teenagers, but troubled teenagers. It seems as if he has had zero experience. With anything.\n\nWas this foster-care facility so desperate that they hired the first person they saw?\n\nAre there no requirements at all?\n\nAgain, further proving this place is utterly incompetent. \n\n(I am going to keep using that word)\n\nPlus the dude is just a dreadful actor. Which only makes watching this character so much worse.\n\nJAYDEN LUIS & MARCUS\n\nNow I am going to touch on a different aspect of how awful the writing of this film is. And it starts with these three teens.\n\nSo Jayden is a white girl, right? Nothing wrong with that.\n\nLuis is a Hispanic boy, right? Nothing wrong with that.\n\nAnd Marcus is black, right? Nothing wrong with that.\n\nBecause Jayden is a white girl (who's depressed / suicidal), that means she has to have her headphones all the time and completely fill up journals with whacky drawings, right?\n\nWell ... no.\n\nBut does she?\n\nYou betcha!\n\nBecause Luis is a Hispanic boy, that means he has to be all cocky and trash talk constantly (which includes yo' momma jokes), right?\n\nWell ... no.\n\nBut does he?\n\nOf course!\n\nBecause Marcus is black, that means he has to write rap lyrics all the time (especially about his mother), right?\n\nWell ... no.\n\nBut does he?\n\nDuh!\n\nThese teenagers are so stereotypically written. I am still waiting for the day when kids and teenagers are not stereotypically written. I think the closest I have seen this to happening is Michel Gondry's The We And The I.\n\nAlso, let me point out how Jayden dresses.\n\nAll black with complements of purple and sometimes red. Because, you know, all at-risk people wear black and purple / red with 4000 wristbands of the same color scheme. Oh, cannot forget the tight jeans either.\n\nAnd another thing, her drawers are loaded with journals that are packed with obscure drawings of all kinds. With thick crayon, marker, you name it. Mostly in black, purple, and red colors, of course.\n\nThe number one praise this film gets is how authentic it is and it is just everything but authentic.\n\nShort Term 12's writer and director, Destin Cretton, clearly has no understanding of teenagers. Or people. Or facilities. So let me go back to that.\n\nTen to fifteen teenagers. Four employees. And a lazy boss who does nothing, knows nothing. I can tell you right now that there needs to be more employees around. I mean, come on, hire me! I have attempted suicide six times and been a camp counselor twice! I got credentials!!!!!!!!!\n\nSeveral times in the film suggest that four people is not enough. And I do not think this was intentional.\n\nOnce Jayden goes AWOL.\n\nTwice Sammy goes AWOL.\n\nMarcus goes after Luis but instead cuts himself and has to go to the hospital. Nobody saw this happening. Who knows how long Marcus was lying there before Grace showed up. And when Grace did find him, she yelled for help and nobody was around to assist her. Until a few minutes later, who knows how many, the film cuts to the next scene before we can find out.\n\nI have said more than I have needed to but I must say it again, that this place is so stinkin' incompetent. It is ridiculous. I am not kidding you when I say it is mind-blowing how badly this film is written and directed. \n\nThe third aspect in how terribly written it is, outside of character and portrayed stereotypes, is how predictable it is. From start to finish. You can see where every other scene is headed and it just gets exhausting. There are no surprises in this film. But, hypothetically, let me say there are surprises in the film, they are still not surprising. You do not gasp. You do not freak out. It is \"meh\". But again, chances are you will not be surprised in any shape or form.\n\nNow on a technical level, Short Term 12 is mediocre. Better than its writing, but still mediocre. Its cinematography is nothing special. Just your classic \"hay lookit we're a hip indie film\" cinematography.\n\nThe editing does not stand out, neither in a negative or positive way. \n\nSound design did not have to be anything other than it was, so nothing to say there.\n\nScore was fine, I guess. Not worth buying or anything.\n\nThe actors gave their best to fill the void of these pathetically written and developed characters. Except the guy who plays Nate. You could give him the greatest written character on the planet and he will turn it into something worse than a Degrassi character.\n\nHowever, the film had its moments here and there. But there is not enough, nor are they great enough, to be considered a redeeming quality is such a bad bad bad movie.\n\nI would like to give it one mango out of four, but the cast did the best they could and it did have those occasional moments, so I will give it two mangos out of four.\n\nBut don't think that means it's worth seeing. Because it isn't.",

            "content": "Rarely does a film come along that can celebrate life in such a way that fully acknowledges the white and black aspects of life, and turns melancholic grey into something inconceivably blissful, Short Term 12 is that film. Setting the film in a foster care facility was the perfect setting to emancipate this idea for almost every child is filled with blackness which caretaker Brie Larson must help assuage with white security, whilst also dealing with melancholy. Director Destin Cretton beautifully realizes this idea through his long takes and beautiful lighting. Beauty oozes through every frame of Short Term 12 making the film a pleasurable viewing experience. However, it is Cretton's actors that steal the show with the most realistic performances to come out of a motion picture in a great while. Needless to say ever actor is on the top of their game, with special attention paid to Kaitlyn Dever's portrayal as troubled teen Jayden, and Brie Larson's depiction of foster caretaker Grace. Dever brilliantly maintains a relatively low key performance avoiding over the top antics for subtlety, which she delivers intensely through her melancholic expression. Larson's performance as Grace similarly assuages pain through her low key performance for her and Jayden both experienced abuse by their fathers, however, Larson personifies comfort and love through her comforting performance as Grace, certainly delivering one of the best female performances of the year. Perhaps the best aspect of Short Term 12 is the compelling and emotionally moving screenplay by director Destin Cretton. The dialogue is never filled with fluff instead; Cretton always treats every scene in the film as important and urgent. Especially a scene between the characters Grace and Jayden when Jayden tells of a story between a squid and a shark to describe Jayden's abuse between her and her father. Short Term 12 is a brilliant piece of art that is near flawless in every aspect, truly an emotionally compelling masterpiece of cinema.",

            "content": "The stories behind the at-risk youth in Short Term 12 may be fictional, but there is an element of truth to them that unnervingly reverberates in an all too realistic fashion. Writer-director Destin Cretton spent two years working at a similar facility as seen in the film, helping him craft an environment that feels almost pulled from a documentary at times. The understated brilliance of Short Term 12 is seen through the eyes of those given charge of temporarily watching over these kids, and how perhaps they're not much better off themselves. They may have life slightly more together in the present, but deep down are just as broken and in need of the same things.\n\nBrie Larson is magnificent as our \"heroine,\" the main person in charge of the center who comes with her own set of childhood baggage. Larson excels in the scenes interacting with the kids, and then turns around and is completely heartbreaking when she doesn't take her own advice and plunges her personal life into chaos. It's my first time seeing Larson in a lead role, and it will not be the last because she is destined for greatness.\n\nThe rest of the cast is a proverbial who's who from recent TV shows, and while it's a bit distracting at first, they settle into their roles nicely. John Gallagher Jr. (The Newsroom) especially makes an impact as Larson's boyfriend and shows what he's capable of when actually given strong material. Kaitlyn Dever is terrific in a role similar to her troubled turn on Justified, while Rami Malek (The Pacific) and Stephanie Beatriz (Brooklyn Nine-Nine) make brief appearances as the other staff members.\n\nShort Term 12 might be a little overhyped by critics (it was 2013's highest-rated limited release on Rotten Tomatoes after all), as admittedly some of the melodrama feels a little manufactured (bad things tend to happen in rapid succession). However, to its credit it really nails the group-home dynamics and is a worthwhile film demanding of a wide audience, especially by those who work or have worked with teens. At its core, it speaks to how every person has the same profound aching for love, and it is love that in the end keeps us together. It might sound sappy, but Short Term 12 proves it's for real.",

It is difficult to find a negative review for it, because it is  a movie which has almost everything - a roller coaster of every emotion, managing to be both heart-warming and heartrending at once. It has some faults, it's not perfect... like life itself!\r\n\r\nThe story is told through the eyes of Grace, a twenty-something supervisor at a foster-care facility for at-risk teenagers. She is passionate and tough, a formidable caretaker of the kids in her charge - and in love with her long-term boyfriend and co-worker, Mason. Grace and Mason work hard, but sometimes struggle to help some of the children... like Marcus, for n example... an intense, quiet kid who is about to turn 18, cope with the difficulty of having to leave the facility. We are let in slowly to discover Grace's own difficult past, added to the surprising future that suddenly presents itself - throwing her into unforeseen confusion. A new arrival, girl called Jayden, a gifted but troubled teenage girl with whom she has a charged connection, just complicates things more!\r\n\r\nActing was top level, especially Brie Larson as Grace, but I could not say I didn't enjoy the easy going attitude of John Gallagher, Jr. as Mason, serious and intelligent Kaitlyn Dever as Jayden, confused Rami Malek as Nate, amazingly transformed Keith Stanfield as Marcus and one of the most natural young actors I've ever seen - Kevin Hernandez as Luis.\r\n\r\nIf you want to see performances to be remembered, have experience of sharply written screenplay and beautiful directing - this is a very special movie for you.",

Exactly the same, how convenient!  What was realistic, and I saw coming a mile away, was how people who had horrible childhoods growing up SHOULD NOT WORK WITH AT RISK YOUTH!  They need people that are stable and don't think that they need to fix everything that's wrong in their lives.  I think lots of people that may  have loved this movie view the main character as a hero, but she was working in that place to try to solve her own problems, but unfortunately I don' t think a lot of viewers see it that way.

When we look into his eyes, we can absolutely see that he never has, but has always longed to, know what a \"normal\" life's like. But for Marcus and the other underprivileged kids living at Short Term 12, the temporary foster care facility that gives this extraordinary little film its title, a normal life seems beyond their reach.\n\nWritten and directed by Destin Daniel Cretton, Short Term 12 centres around Grace (Brie Larson), a young woman who works at the home for at-risk youths with her boyfriend Mason (John Gallagher Jr.). As Grace explains to a rookie staffer, their job is not to play therapist or parent, but simply to \"create a safe environment\".\n\nThat can sometimes be a stressful responsibility given the dangerous tendencies some of these troubled youngsters have developed. However, as we learn through the impeccably gradual exposition of Grace's backstory, no one understands them and what they're going through better than her.\n\nShort Term 12 is one of those exceptional, unassuming dramas that requires no antagonists and no overt conflict for us to develop concern and attachment to its characters. Or at least, the conflicts that do propel the character arcs never turn the audience against a character. The film is populated entirely by decent, empathetic people principally at war with themselves, their pasts, and their futures, rather than with each other. The heated arguments and violent outbursts we witness merely open up windows through which we can see the true battles that rage inside against personal demons.\n\nCretton's near-perfect script never gives direct face to the evil that ubiquitously looms over the lives of these kids. It only ever reveals itself in the form of scars; emotional or physical, self-inflicted or by some oppressor. In essence, the abuse, neglect, and social indifference that has cursed these youths becomes an intangible and all more serious threat, but without pulling focus from what Short Term 12 is really about: healing the wounds.\n\nAnd there's plenty of healing to do. Not just for the teens inhabiting Short Term 12, but also (especially) for Grace. Although she is a strong, independent woman and a crucially positive role model for the wards under her care, her independence is in fact what weakens her the most. Every day she neglects to follow her own advice about emotional transparency, allowing the ghosts of her own troubled childhood to continue to haunt her.\n\nThese unresolved feelings come to the fore when a new girl, Jayden (Kaitlyn Dever), arrives at Short Term 12. Jayden is a simmering mess of father issues with a history of cutting herself, to whom Grace finds she can relate all too well. While this allows her to slowly gain Jayden's trust and confidence, it also triggers long suppressed emotions that shake the fragile stability of Grace's life.\n\nAnother modest triumph (but a triumph nonetheless) of Cretton's screenplay is its use of simple symbolism to peel back the layers of characters who are, by nature of how Cretton conceived them, too scared or confused to open up explicitly. A goldfish can be more than a goldfish, a toy doll can reveal a lifetime of anguish, and a drawing of an armless octopus can manifest a soul's worth of unspoken thought and feeling.\n\nAll this precise writing wouldn't be worth its own ink without strong actors to interpret it, and Short Term 12 is blessed with an abundance of them. Every role, big and small, is beautifully played by a simply terrific cast, built organically around Brie Larson's quiet revelation at its centre. The combination of their earnest performances and Cretton's storytelling finesse makes Short Term 12 a picture that's easy to invest oneself in, and it's an investment that pays incredible dividends.\n\n**** out of ****",

Looked it up and it killed at Film Festivals and carries an 8.2 imdb rating and an 8.2 metacritic rating.\n\nFirst, it's one of those rare movies without a weak character. Given the range of problems the characters face, and given the age of the actors, this is a significant feat. Brie Larson definitely carries the movie, but John Gallagher's character (Mason) will go down as one of the greats. That is just one magnificent fucking character. Kaitlyn Dever as Jayden is also good, but Keith Stanfield kills it as Marcus. There is rarely a scene with him that cannot make the eyes a little moist.\n\nAnd that's what the movie is about: second chances and kindness. Mason leads the charge there as just a guy with a lot of patience and not a lot of judgement. Larson's character is close but she has her own demons. \n\nMany movies come to mind: Sling Blade, Girl, Interrupted. A few others. But definitely also Good Will Hunting. The more I live my own life, and it was definitely a theme here, sometimes people just need a hug and the line, \"It's not your fault.\" Goddamn it's brilliant in GWH, and though the line is never said in this movie, that's the sentiment expressed by the staff. And instead of judging and punishing, they just try to help. This is one of the top movies of 2013.",

This is only my second five star review from 2013 and this small indie absolutely hit all the right notes with me taking me through a wide range of emotions thanks to its perfect balanced mix of comedy and touching drama. I was drawn to these characters from the very opening scene and was completely engaged with the story. Having visited a foster care facility a couple times last year and spent some time with kids going through similar situations, this film really hit home and helped me empathize more with them. In a way I kind of felt like Nate, the new counselor in this film who didn't connect right away with the kids and there was not much he could do to help considering he had no idea where they were coming from. On the other hand, the two other counselors, Grace and Mason, really connected with the children because they came from similar backgrounds and understood how they were feeling. Short Term 12 writer and director, Destin Cretton, uses this film as a vehicle to let the viewer have a better understanding of the social situation these kids go through. I don't know if this would've worked so well if it weren't for the incredibly touching performances from the cast. Brie Larson is so great in this film, she hit all the right notes, and in some way she reminded me of Jennifer Lawrence in Winter's Bone. She has that same potential and her career will definitely take off after this. She deserves an Oscar nomination because she's that good. Her co-lead, John Gallagher Jr. also delivers a terrific performance and if we haven't heard much about him it's because Larson steals most of the thunder here. Even the kids in this film were terrific and that's why I'm giving this film the highest possible grade because it does everything right.\n\nGrace (Brie Larson) is one of the young counselors at Short Term 12, a foster care facility for at risk teenagers. Along with Mason (John Gallagher Jr.), with whom she's in a relationship, they look after these kids who have come from a troubled past. The film opens with Mason welcoming a new counselor named Nate (Rami Malek), and he shares a story with him about his first day which didn't go too great. Then they introduce some of the kids to him: there's Marcus (Keith Stanfield) who's about to turn 18 and therefor will be leaving the facility soon, Sammy (Alex Calloway) who's going through a deep psychological trauma, and Luis (Kevin Hernandez) who's easygoing but enjoys bullying Marcus. A few days later a new teenage girl named Jayden (Kaitlyn Dever) arrives at the foster care center who seems to be deeply scarred. Grace begins to connect with her and realizes they have come from a similar past. Grace and Mason are both excellent counselors, mostly because they have come from a troubled past themselves, and despite helping these kids they also have to deal with their own scars in life if they want their relationship to work. \n\nI loved the way that Cretton decided to open the film with Mason telling Nate a story, and then deciding to end it with another one.

            "content": "\"You need to get ready because it's so unbelievable it's going to seem fake, but I promise you it's not, Grace will vouch for me...It's a storytellers wet dream.\"\n\nEvery once in a while a surprising film like Short Term 12 comes around reminding me why I love cinema so much. This is only my second five star review from 2013 and this small indie absolutely hit all the right notes with me taking me through a wide range of emotions thanks to its perfect balanced mix of comedy and touching drama. I was drawn to these characters from the very opening scene and was completely engaged with the story. Having visited a foster care facility a couple times last year and spent some time with kids going through similar situations, this film really hit home and helped me empathize more with them. In a way I kind of felt like Nate, the new counselor in this film who didn't connect right away with the kids and there was not much he could do to help considering he had no idea where they were coming from. On the other hand, the two other counselors, Grace and Mason, really connected with the children because they came from similar backgrounds and understood how they were feeling. Short Term 12 writer and director, Destin Cretton, uses this film as a vehicle to let the viewer have a better understanding of the social situation these kids go through. I don't know if this would've worked so well if it weren't for the incredibly touching performances from the cast. Brie Larson is so great in this film, she hit all the right notes, and in some way she reminded me of Jennifer Lawrence in Winter's Bone. She has that same potential and her career will definitely take off after this. She deserves an Oscar nomination because she's that good. Her co-lead, John Gallagher Jr. also delivers a terrific performance and if we haven't heard much about him it's because Larson steals most of the thunder here. Even the kids in this film were terrific and that's why I'm giving this film the highest possible grade because it does everything right.\n\nGrace (Brie Larson) is one of the young counselors at Short Term 12, a foster care facility for at risk teenagers. Along with Mason (John Gallagher Jr.), with whom she's in a relationship, they look after these kids who have come from a troubled past. The film opens with Mason welcoming a new counselor named Nate (Rami Malek), and he shares a story with him about his first day which didn't go too great. Then they introduce some of the kids to him: there's Marcus (Keith Stanfield) who's about to turn 18 and therefor will be leaving the facility soon, Sammy (Alex Calloway) who's going through a deep psychological trauma, and Luis (Kevin Hernandez) who's easygoing but enjoys bullying Marcus. A few days later a new teenage girl named Jayden (Kaitlyn Dever) arrives at the foster care center who seems to be deeply scarred. Grace begins to connect with her and realizes they have come from a similar past. Grace and Mason are both excellent counselors, mostly because they have come from a troubled past themselves, and despite helping these kids they also have to deal with their own scars in life if they want their relationship to work. \n\nI loved the way that Cretton decided to open the film with Mason telling Nate a story, and then deciding to end it with another one. The structure of this film was just perfectly executed and I loved the balance it maintained. There were several different plots going on as each kid was going through different problems. The final scene in this film literally gave me goose bumps all over my body. Many people had an issue with it ending with such a positive note, but I thought it was perfect. Larson is a major reason why this film worked so well, her character Grace is just that: a graceful person who is doing her best to help these kids while at the same time trying to deal with her own demons.

            "content": "Short Term 12 (2013)- 80%\nDestin Cretton directs Brie Larson (as Grace) and John Gallagher Jr. (Mason) in a powerful drama that focuses on the fragile world of under-privileged children with deeply penetrating precision and heart. We enter the dedicated lives of the young couple, Grace and Mason, as they train a new member of their team (Nate), at a safe-house where abused, troubled and challenged children are monitored, nurtured, disciplined and supported 24 hours a day. The film intimately and masterfully captures the unpredictable and often turbulent nature of these teen's lives and examines deeper subtleties of their experiences, like Marcus, who after years in protective abode must begin a new life outside its' safety walls. \nCretton genuinely explores the complexities of working with these kids through Grace, simultaneously weaving her own challenged relationships with her imprisoned father and her boyfriend Mason into the story. Ironically while she encourages the children's openness and communication her past serves as her Achilles heel; it hardens her to build up walls, allowing her to excel at her job, but also shuts out a fulfilling and trusting life with Mason. \nWhen Nate (Rami Malek) repeatedly divulges that he is \"not feeling well\" each time situations escalate in the house, Cretton captures the level of stamina and compassion that is required by staff who struggle with the fine line between the personal and personally-impersonal aspects of their responsibilities daily.\nIt is when Jayden (Kaitlyn Dever), a reckless and difficult teen, arrives at the home that this fine line is further blurred exposing even deeper layers of pain and struggle in Grace. We gain more glimpses into her delicate interior and begin to question whether maybe she would be better suited for life in the home than hold the supervisor position. Cretton begins to craft a connection between these two girls that functions as their catharsis, powerfully transforming them in the process. \nThrough extraordinarily sincere performances, precise direction and a script that breathes life into horrible experiences with soothing compassion, humour and wit, Short Term 12 succeeds in gracefully entering us into a complex world that not only fascinates and terrifies us, but ultimately strengthens our hearts.",

While the film is a small and short indie, it is by no means a lightweight one.  The film focuses upon twentysomething Grace (Brie Larson - The Spectacular Now, 21 Jump Street) who is a kind, caring and authoritative voice at Short Term 12 who cares deeply for its residents as she too had a troubled upbringing.  She is forced to confront some of her own personal demons when a young girl arrives (Kaitlyn Dever - Bad Teacher) reminding her of her own past history she is unable to speak of to anybody ... including her long-time boyfriend Mason (John Gallagher Jr. - 'The Newsroom') who also works at the home.  Short Term 12 wisely chooses to center primarily on one character who is involved in the lives of others but it also never allows any of the periphery characters to feel un-important to Grace's story.  It is simply told and presented as it unfolds in a natural-feeling way.  The film reminds a viewer that not all kids have a happy-go-lucky life and that not all homelives are ideal.  Many of us have no idea what these kinds of kids go through ... and this film allowed me to see how quickly I do judge others in unfortunate situations many have no control over.  Grace herself is highly flawed ... but she tries.  And she loves.  She has learned what is important in life ... and this film shows us that.  Listen.  Learn.  Love.",

Then something happens in her personal life than begins to change her while she gets a new teen whom she takes a special interest in because she sees so much of herself in her.  This is a pretty solid little movie with a great performance by Larson.  Mark my words in the next few years she is gonna be a major actress.  She was the daughter on \"United States of Tara\", a show which few people watched but was amazing.  The kids in the home feel like kids that got plucked right out of the streets/bad homes.  They all do great.  The movie is one of those \"quiet\" movies with a lot of shakey camera shots and not a lot of background music.  It does drag some, but it never gets boring or tedious.

Destin Cretton's beautiful script is sure to hit you hard, and even tear at your heartstrings, but his subtle direction (keep in mind this stands as only his second feature length film) never makes it feel melodramatic. The film is full of powerhouse performances, not only from the likes of Brie Larson, John Gallagher Jr., and Rami Malek, but also the impressive supporting cast consisting almost entirely of unknown young actors and actresses. Larson in particular does a marvelous job, playing a young woman who seems strong on the outside, but has problems of her own. It's great that this film has served as a sort of breakthrough for this young actress. Overall, Short Term 12 is a hugely impactful indie film that in most certainly worth watching. The strong performances paired with an emotionally resonant screenplay and sense of direction makes this one truly something special.",

The film could've easily taken some typical route filled with unnecessary melodrama or even throwing in some love triangle, but it didn't. \nIt's also worth noting that Brie Larson was robbed for not bring nominated this year. This was hands down the best performance by an actress this year, I don't know how this film was overlooked altogether by the Academy.\nI cannot recommend this film highly enough.

No one I know has even heard of this film, but I am sure more and more will hear about it as the word of mouth continues to spread about this film.\n\nAllow me to spread the word right now: \"Short Term 12\" is a realistic and emotional portrayal of supervisors in a troubled teens care centre that not for a second feels fake. All very grounded and organic. Every performance is well executed. Some secrets you can see a mile away while others pop up and surprise you, but they all work. Great character development in the script here which allows everyone to bring their best to the table. Scenes come that leave you reflect. Many scenes come that make you laugh. Many scenes come that leave you with dread, while others leave you on the edge of your seat as the film tries to shake you out of it.\n\nThis is the type of film that deserves some major Oscar nominations, but because it's too small, it goes un-noticed without a trace come January. Hopefully I am wrong and the word of mouth that has been spreading really pushes this film to the forefront. Brie Larson gives a brilliant performance here. So do many of the other actors and actresses involved and though you might be able to recognize some of the cast, the characters feel all to real to the point that any Indie stardom they have built up on previous films is left on the back burner. The script is an Oscar worthy gem as well. \n\nAll to real, never careless with it's subjects, and emotional enthralling, this film never lets go. If it were not for \"Before Midnight\" earlier this year, \"Short Term 12\" would most likely have been top dog. \n\nIt is imperative that you see this film!",

It stars actress, Brie Larson as Grace, who works at the facility and is a former foster home resident herself. Grace's life is becoming a bit of a scramble as our story begins: she's recently found out that she is pregnant by her boyfriend, there is a new girl named Jayden who's not making Grace's job any easier with her obstructive behavior, and the soon-to-be-of-age, Marcus is acting up in his final weeks at the center just adds to her frustration.\nThis film (both in terms of it's story and it's film-style) is a beautiful mess -- what I mean by that is, \"Short Term 12\" has so many characters and so many subplots going on all at once, that it seems like the entire thing should fall apart at the seams, but it stays together due to the seemingly effortless way in which the film is paced. \"12\" runs around the setting like a roller coaster, never allowing the viewer to get bored or to feel too rushed, it's found just the right speed at which to showcase each of these characters and their individual lives in a very fluid, free-forming way. It's a visual story that feels so real that you begin to think you are actually watching these people simply live their lives (or try to).\nSpecial attention must also be drawn to Larson's performance, as well as Kaitlyn Dever's portrayal of Jayden -- the two separately make up some of the film's best acting, but together their chemistry on-screen makes for the best scenes in the entire movie (and possibly of the year 2013).\n\"Short Term 12\" is what happens when you bring together a little bit of everything that makes any film decent, and wrap it up into one single, small package: you get a rowdy, tear-jerking, film festival award-winning, work of art -- and love and labor and loss.

I don't know what their official job title is, but it seems closer to babysitter than it does to therapist.

There's Marcus, an angry/sensitive black rapper who's about to get kicked out because he's turning 18. There's Luis, a Latino jock who likes to stir up trouble.  And then there's the new girl - Jayden.\n\nJayden is a smartass artist cutter with a rich daddy and a troubled home life. Grace tries to befriend her and get her to spill her deep dark secrets because not long ago she too was a cutter with deep dark secrets.  Actually, she kind of still is.\n\nIn the movie's main flaw, Grace suddenly finds herself facing a multitude of big personal issues all at once, and combined with the already tumultuous goings on back at the kids' home, it makes for just TOO...MUCH...DRAMA for a 96-minute film. The kid stuff alone is already pushing it a bit - each incident in and of itself seems realistic but is every single day really this action-packed? - but add to that Grace's abusive father getting out of jail, an unplanned pregnancy, getting fired from her job, and breaking up with her boyfriend and it starts to seem more like a blues song than a movie. \n\nThe kid stuff, though, is actually very good and almost documentary-like in its realism.  Marcus and Jayden both have very moving scenes in which they express themselves through rap lyrics and a children's story respectively.  Grace's big ball o' personal problems, as distracting as it is, isn't enough to undermine this otherwise excellent movie.",

Variety is what our multiplex cinemas should be all about. Unfortunately if no one shows up to see indie films, they will eventually be pushed out because frankly why would the multiplexes want to lose money on them?\n\nIt could be that people simply aren't aware of the existence of Short Term 12. Equally it could be that people want to spend their money on escapism and not the tough world that this film inhabits. Ultimately though there is a lot to take away from Short Term 12. It is a tough film but it is a rewarding one in equal measure. There are nicely placed moments of humour and it has a warm heart at the centre of it which does pay off. There aren't any performers who clock in anything less than an excellent performance but Brie Larson is the centre of the film and her turn as the care worker who has her own demons to deal with is star. In an ideal world she would court an Oscar nomination. We will see on that one.",

            "content": "Grace (Larsen) is a supervisor at the title facility, a foster home for troubled teens. Though it remains a secret from their charges, Grace and coworker Mason (Gallagher Jr) are lovers who live together. When Grace learns she is pregnant she initially keeps it a secret from Mason, placing a strain on their relationship as Mason grows tired of her mistrust. When a teenage girl, Jayden (Dever), with a history of self-mutilation arrives at the home, Grace is reminded of her own troubled past. Another kid under her charge is Marcus, due to leave in a couple of weeks when he turns 18, but seemingly unprepared for life in the outside world.\nRecent movies dealing with the issue of care-giving (the obnoxious 'Thanks For Sharing' and last year's 'Smashed') have tended to adopt a patronizing tone, in no way reflective of real life. The setup of 'Short Term 12' in the wrong hands could have easily been another offensive story of flawless white people saving minorities but writer-director Cretton (adapting a story he previously filmed as a short) gives us protagonists who are as flawed as those under their care.\n\nGrace constantly tells her kids they need to verbalize their issues, something she refuses to do herself, much to the annoyance of her incredibly patient boyfriend Mason. Explaining why she cut herself as teen, she tells Jayden \"When there's blood coming out of you, you don't have time to worry about anything else\" and this seems to be her motivation for caring for others, allowing herself to forget about her own troubled background by focusing on others' more urgent problems.\nI don't know if Cretton has a background of working in facilities like this, and I've never experienced one myself, but his portrayal of this world is thoroughly naturalistic and convincing, if slightly too good to be true. I've always loved movies that take you inside an unfamiliar lifestyle, be it the ambulance drivers of 'Mother, Jugs & Speed' or the cops of 'The New Centurions' (a movie this is very reminiscent of), and allow the rules and processes of their world to unfold in a natural way, like being thrown in at the deep end on your first day in a new job.\nLarsen is a revelation in the sort of meaty role young actresses are rarely afforded. The ensemble is roundly great though my one complaint is that the kids look a little too clean cut and feel a bit \"central casting\" when compared to the young untrained actors we've seen a lot lately in European films like 'The Selfish Giant' and 'The Kid With a Bike'.\nThough there's a dark undercurrent to the film, Crettin never lets things get too downbeat and avoids falling into the \"misery porn\" trap. While his film is populated with lovable characters, things never get schmaltzy and you in no way feel like your emotions are being cynically manipulated.\nI suspect the real world versions of these facilities are a lot more grim but, like Mason's anecdotes that bookend the film, 'Short Term 12' may not be grounded in truth but it sure is comforting.",

It seemed that if something was worth doing, it was worth doing at a preternaturally young age. Throughout my early years I tried hard to live up to these pretentions: in grade school, I attempted to write several novels (they all involved genetically-engineered dinosaurs and hubristic theme-park owners unable to contain them); at seventeen, I sent spec screenplays to Hollywood studios (my great accomplishment: receiving a rejection letter on official 20th Century Fox letterhead, signed by Batman Forever writer Akiva Goldsman). My ambitions, however, were grander than my talents. Or perhaps grander than my commitment to seeing them through. And your new film, Short Term 12, proves that you're a bit more committed to your ambitions than I was...

His film short Drakmar: a Vassal's Journey which he co-directed in 2006 won best documentary at the San Diego Comic-Con International. Then, in 2009, a short version of Short Term 12 won Best Short Award at the Sundance Film Festival. In 2010, he won an Academy of Arts and Sciences Nicholl Prize for his script of I am Not a Hipster, which was shown in the next category at Sundance, then he won another cash award from the Nicholl's to complete post production on his latest feature, which he wrote as well as directed,  Short Term 12. ST 12 won the audience award and the grand jury prize at the 2013 South by Southwest Festival in Austin and had its Maui premiere on June 16th where it won the audience award for best narrative feature drama. \n\nThis powerful film is a wonderful love story. When i was studying in New York, one of my teachers used to ask, \"Where is the love? If there's no love, we aren't interested.\"  Well, this film has every kind of love there is and I guarantee when you see it, you will love it as well.\n\nCretton, who is a great story teller and creates engaging, real characters, spent two years working in an adolescent residential center so he knows this subject intimately, but he insists this film, which at times feels like a documentary, is a work of fiction. \n\nThe film centers around Grace, a 20 something counselor at an adolescent residential center. Her life mirrors the kids that she is caring for. Played by Brie Larson in a performance worthy of an Oscar, with truth and honesty seldom seen on the screen, this is a story, which brings the audience into the world of troubled adolescents. These young people are in the center because they  have either been abandoned by their parents, committed to this place because their parents couldn't handle them or they have no parents or family to care for them.\n\nWe see their daily routine and the behaviors the staff is subjected to and how they understand and control these extremely difficult and often volatile situations.  \n\nGrace is a complex character, who is hiding lots of secrets. She is hiding her relationship with a co-worker, Mason, played by Newmakers and Tony Award Winning John Gallagher Jr. She refuses to share her past with him and she is trying to deal with being pregnant. \n\nInto this cauldron comes Jadyn, a goth girl who doesn't want to be a part of the \"family.\" she declares in her first meeting that she doesn't want to participate because she will be leaving soon. Kaitlyn Dever, of ABC's Last Man Standing embodies the essence of adolescent angst in this power house performance.  \n\nAlso there is tension between Marcus, Keith Stanfield and Luis, Kevin Hernandez. It explodes when Marcus's pet fish dies and Luis is suspected of picescide. Keith Stanfield is another exceptionally strong performer who imbues Marcus with deapth and complexity. his rap, which i was told he wrote, is both inciteful into the character and haunting. \n\nI said this was a love story and it is. Mason is the lover. He loves the kids, he loves his foster family and he loves Grace. His character is the new leading man, sensitive, yet strong, caring without being controlling, loving without being stifling. A true breath of fresh air in male characters. \n\nCretton has gotten truthful, real performances from young people for whom this is their first film and from veteran's like Larson who has been working since she was a child. There is not a weak link in this great cast. \n\nThis film has everything. A great story, that will touch your heart and your funny bone. Wonderful characters that you root for every moment, and important things to say about youth and young people.",

This film is one of those rare cases where I walked in knowing little to nothing about what I was going to experience, but I was pleasantly surprised to find a well balanced tone of what mirrors real life the closest. None of us live completely within the bounds of these genres that Hollywood has so conveniently put together so as to garner massive audiences for each one that cater to the dominant attitude one might carry. Despite the fact humans generally tend to gravitate towards specific personality traits or uncontrollable factors that determine how they are perceived the majority of us live a life filled with moments of equal highs and lows. Granted, this range of emotions is usually reserved to be explored in the smaller, less expensive films that tackle more singular subjects and therefor may have a more narrow audience looking for it, when they are done well they can likely appeal to whoever stumbles upon them and it seems Short Term 12 has the potential to have that appeal. Writer/director Destin Daniel Cretton has expanded his 2008 short film of the same name into feature length form and in doing so has given himself room to explore the devastating effects of what mental, physical and sexual abuse have on children and not just in the immediate aftermath but years and years on when you would hope the victim might have been able to look past and move on. It is as much an enlightening and inspirational film as it is a heart wrenching and extremely personal documentation of the individuals who have experienced such disgusting encounters and have had to grow and learn to adapt in a world that often times expects them to get over it without ever being able to accept the fact they could live what most of us would call a \"normal life\". With a strong script and some purely exceptional performances Short Term 12 turns out to be one of the more affecting films of the year that has probably been seen the least.   \n\nread the whole review at www.reviewsfromabed.com",

It is clearly one of the best movies of the year and it features one of the best acting performances in that of Brie Larson. The film centers on a foster home for trouble kids, by troubled I mean kids who are abused by parents or adults to the point they are at risk of committing suicide. The supervising staff is made up of young adults in their early 20's. The 2 main supervisors are Grace and Mason played with much care by Brie Larson and John Gallagher Jr. Their daily duties included looking after the kids, getting them to be social in groups and to check their room for any objects that do not belong in the facility. We meet the kids they are looking after - One of them Marcus, is just a week away from turning 18 which means he will have to leave the home. Through a couple of powerful scenes our eyes are painfully opened to Marcus' troubled past and we get some understanding of what he must be feeling. I say \"some\" because as great as this movie is, it is difficult to ever fully feel what some of these poor kids do. We also meet Jayden, a young girl who is new to the home. Grace connects with Jayden as she sees much of her self in her. And speaking of Grace, we learn more about her own trouble past and what led her to a life devoted to helping these young troubled kids out. Brie Larson is simply outstanding from start to finish and this is not a simple character to play. I also can not say enough good things about the screenplay written by writer/director Destin Cretton. It would be easy to make a movie on this matter and just focus on the kids, but by including the young supervisor's struggles as well he has given us a true gem of a film. The movie opens and closes with the telling of a story - both are funny, yet one is sad...and one is uplifting....and that sums up Short Term 12 - funny, sad, uplifting. What is a life if it is not cared for.....Ry's Grade: A.",

These teens are shuffled from home to institution to home, witnessing and enduring unspeakable abuse.  Growing increasingly unwilling to open their hearts in the frightening uncertainty of their existence, these teens can be certain of only one thing - chronic rejection, by others and by themselves. We meet Jayden (Kaitlyn Dever) and Marcus (Keith Stanfield) amongst others, in the group home where they routinely test boundaries, unconsciously driven to determine what is and isn't safe. The staff, deftly led by Grace (Brie Larson) and Mason (John Gallagher, Jr.) offer such safety, and much more; they test the boundaries of their own hearts, their capacity to love, as determined by their willingness to go towards pain, when every natural inclination is to run the other way. The result is a powerfully moving unfolding of truth, and as such, beauty. We experience beauty in the form of the enduring human spirit; A spirit that will, in darkness, if given just a little bit of love, find a smoldering ember in your heart, and light a fire.",

That is until I saw Short Term 12.\n\nThe plot & premise of Short Term 12, while not entirely original, was beautifully executed by allowing important plot details to slowly seep into the viewers minds, writer/director Destin Cretton mastered the art of good storytelling.\n\nThe main attraction to this masterpiece was an against type performance from Brie Larson, fresh off her comedic turn in last year's 21 Jump Street. Her character Grace deals with a troubled young girl named Jaydenwho is new to the short term facility, whose problems eerily echo the myriad of troubles hidden beneath the depths of Grace herself.\n\nThis film had wonderful supporting roles & performances. The two that stand out are Mason, played by The Newsroom's John Gallagher Jr., as Mason, Grace's boyfriend/co-worker with the patience of a saint. The second performance that was noteworthy was that of Keith Stanfield as Marcus, the troubled teenager who is just about to turn 18.\n\nOverall, the two moments that I think sold the movie for me is the scene where Marcus performs his rap for him, and the scene where Jayden shows Grace her octopus story. Both scenes showed you a lot of how the characters feel in a rather unconventional manner.\n\nOverall, this film is already one of my favorites for 2013, and will definitely be placed in my top 10 for the year. Hopefully, the Oscar committee feels the same way that I do come nominations time. Rating: 4/4 Stars\n\n-K.",

Writer/director Cretton has crafted an affecting story, one that is clearly informed by experiences he has to have had earlier in his life; there's a verisimilitude and a rawness that could only be reproduced from first-hand, intimate knowledge of this world.  In fact, the movie feels almost documentarian at points, which came close to keeping me at a bit of an emotional distance - because my life experience is so far removed from the circumstances depicted - but in the end, it was the work of lead actress Brie Larson that made everything work for me.  She gives a superb performance, a nuanced and moving portrait of a quite complex, enormously empathetic young woman.  The actual narrative itself follows the kinds of contours that we might expect (save for a brief sequence in the third act that is surprisingly suspenseful, and had me wondering if the movie was about to get REALLY dark), but it doesn't really embrace cliche, either.  That being said, it's Cretton's clear point-of-view/authorial voice and Larson's work that really elevates the plot.",

            "content": "It's rare for a movie to be emotionally devastating while also being overwhelmingly inspirational and hopeful, but Short Term 12 achieves the nigh impossible.\n\nShort Term 12 follows the inhabitants of a small foster care center in Middle America. Many of the kids have been taken from their biological parents because of abuse, neglect, imprisonment, or death. Many have never known a stable home life. And many will age out of the system at 18 and be trusted to make something on the outside by their lonesome. Grace (Brie Larson) is the lead counselor for the center. She's dating a co-worker, Mason (The Newsroom's John Gallagher Jr.) and pregnant, unsure of where to go from here. As the center prepares for one Marcus' (Keith Stanfield) age-out departure, they welcome Jayden (Kaitlyn Dever) to their abode. Jayden's well-connected father is getting his life in order for full custody, but it also becomes clear that her home life is a danger to her well-being. Grace fights to get Jayden to open up, then she fights to keep her safe, all the while forcing her to deal with her own long hidden pain. \n\nIt's so easy to get engaged in this movie. The very setting calls for plenty of drama and pain to be explored, and it will be, but that doesn't mean that the film goes overboard with histrionics. The characters are written with such naturalistic ease, allowing an audience to understand them without judgment. These people, be they the foster kids or the counselors, feel refreshingly, exceedingly, magnificently like flesh-and-blood people. The characters feel lived in, their struggles feel real, and their responses are sincere. The foster care system in this country is grueling. A counselor needs a big heart, thick skin, and an immeasurable supply of patience. There are a lot of abused kids in the system, just hoping to find an adult who wishes to love them, to nurture them, to care. The kids don't want pity, they are perturbed when they're referred to as \"underprivileged youth.\" What they really want is respect and sincerity. Highly charged emotions are a given considering the circumstances of the characters, but what makes Short Term 12 exceptional is that they are fully earned. We don't just feel for these kids because they've suffered, we feel for them because they are presented as characters instead of martyrs. I was emotionally moved throughout, tearing up several times, feeling heartbroken at turns and then brimming with buoyant hope at others. It's a balancing act the movie masters. \n\nWriter/director Destin Cretin (actually remaking his 2008 short film of the same name) explores these characters in gentle waves, allowing the characters to open up in ways that don't feel forced. You learn about these characters and their history bit by bit, sometimes through creative expression where one must read between the lines. Marcus might seem to be one character, then his rap song he write reveals an aching degree of personal pain, and then the revelation for why he wants to shave his head, which at first just seems like an average teenage compulsion, will break your heart all over again. You yearn for these kids beyond measure, wanting them to taste delayed happiness in this world, but you also understand why they're so guarded, why the system grinds together as it does. This is no polemic overburdened with speechifying and soapboxes. It doesn't really make any larger points about foster reform or the people who run the system. Instead Cretin gives every participant in the film complexity, empathy, and humanity. Even Grace's supervisor, easily set up for quick blame about decision-making, is allowed empathy. You feel the man's plight as he tries to make the best out of a bad situation, which is exactly what the counselors are trying to do themselves with their charges. Cretin's emphasis is on his characters and not necessarily on making overt political attacks. I knew within minutes that I was in for something special. You can feel it with the dialogue, how easily Cretin is shaping character without splurging on exposition. These people come alive under Cretin's watch, and you'll be pulled in within mere moments. \n\nThis is also fundamentally a star making performance for Larson. The young actress has had visible roles in Scott Pilgrim vs. the World, 21 Jump Street, and TV's The United States of Tara, but nothing prepared me for the power of her performance. Larson's character has plenty of personal pain and secrets and a gnawing sense of futility, but she pushes forward, trying to make a difference somehow in this world. You feel her intensity and determination but you also feel her setbacks and uncertainty. Larson never strays outside the emotional bounds of her character, staying true to her aims. Grace is no saintly and selfless figure. She's paying a real price keeping her own pain bottled up, focusing completely on others so that she doesn't have to assess her own damage, but Jayden forces her to examine her own history. Larson serves as the dependable emotional anchor of some very choppy waters. In a just world, Larson's name would be bandied about come awards season, but the overall small, understated nature of Short Term 12 and its limited release leaves me in doubt. However, there is no doubt that Larson gives a deeply humane, gripping, heartfelt and marvelous performance. \n\nThe character relationships are just as compelling and provide a rich texture to this world. The dynamics within the foster center are interesting, nothing as simplistic as slotting kids into staid high school types. There are divisions within the home, chiefly between Marcus and an antagonistic Luis, but it's also invigorating when you witness the various kids come together in solidarity and community, when they look out for one another. Jayden is surly at first but won't let on how truly hurt she is that her father missed her birthday. Marcus leads the other kids and they all make a slew of birthday cards to cheer her up, make her feel that someone out there cares. It's a small gesture, and yet when it plays out it hits with a wallop. The relationship between Grace and Mason is sweet and frustrating, representing a romantic coupling of two people with an obvious connection but also enough baggage to derail potential long-term success. Gallagher Jr. is a nice fit for the part. I really enjoyed how Mason is developed as the film progresses. Initially he seems like a pseudo-cool authority figure, then a scruffy screw-up, then a sincere and grateful individual worried about Grace and aggravated by his inability to help Grace.\n\nThere are movies that feel true in a broad sense but clumsy with the fine details, and vice versa, but Short Term 12 is that rare movie that feels so authentic that it could have been a documentary. Sure there is convenient plot developments and a tidiness that life just doesn't want to provide, but the overall impression is remarkably genuine. The character feel like actual people, their world feels recognizable, and their struggles feels familiar and relatable and raw. Short Term 12 doesn't glorify the counselors, nor does it demonize or sanctify the kids under their care. Here is an unblinking look at the sheer weight of the work of trying to provide for those in need. The movie is a potent drama with several heartbreaking incidents, but I don't want to scare people off with the impression that Short Term 12 is all artsy doom and gloom. On the contrary, the film is resolutely hopeful in the face of such dire adversity. The perseverance of the counselors, as well as the kids striving for independent lives, is what I walk away with. Not the abuse, not the systematic neglect, but the indomitable perseverance of the human spirit to transcend damage and to succeed anew. This is the long-lasting impact of this superb movie. It's not about the pain inflicted, rather than human connections forged and the optimism of recovery. Not everything will get its happy ending, but it is inspiring to watch people put it all on the line, thanklessly. Short Term 12 is the kind of movie you bug your friends until they finally watch it. Ladies and gents, commence bugging.\n\nNate's Grade: A",

But Short Term 12 is something else: something fresh that eschews easy sentiment and preaching. It's more than an exceptional film, it's a gift. Set in GoldDerby, a short-term foster care ward for at-risk teens, Short Term 12 lucks out with a gifted cast and a terrific script that doesn't spell everything out for us. The supervisors for GoldDerby are 20-ish counselors Grace (the amazing Brie Larson), who seems to be in most control of herself, even though she's hiding a pregnancy and relationship with co-worker Mason (John Gallagher Jr.). Grace and Mason arent treating their kids as if they're doctors, their role is to provide a steady hand. The kids include brooding Marcus (Keith Stanfield), who fights his demon with raps, Jayden (Kaitlyn Dever) a cutter with a steely attitude. These aren't exactly new character types, but Short Term 12, written and directed with astonishing grace and grit by Destin Daniel Cretton, who has experience working at similar facilities. Cretton doesn't avoid harsh truths, he lays them out. That the film also gets to you ad shakes you is also a tribute to the actors. Gallagher Jr., freed from the hackneyed claptrap of HBO's The Newsroom, is excellent as a guy who cannot always do the right thing.And Larson (The Spectacular Now, 21 Jump Street) is more than superb. She turns in one of the year's very best performances. She's the heart of a film that digs deep and really gets to you.",

            "content": "The coming out party for Brie Larson is complete. After delightful turns in Scott Pilgrim vs. The World, 21 Jump Street, and The Spectacular Now, Larson gets a starring vehicle in Short Term 12. As good as Larson is here, Short Term 12 is even better since it gives insight into the day-to-day lives of temporary living arrangements from the perspectives of the workers and the kids. Expertly written and shot by Destin Cretton, Short Term 12 gives some well deserved attention to people who don't receive enough of it. \r\n\r\nGrace (Brie Larson) and Mason (John Gallagher Jr.) are a couple who feel compelled to work at a Short Term 12 facility taking care of kids with nowhere else to go. They are both very good at establishing connections with these children, but for different reasons. Mason feels the need to give back due to his foster upbringing, but Grace's aid comes from a darker place. She has a more fragile emotional state than she lets on and big life events come to her in the form of a pregnancy and Jayden (Kaitlyn Dever), a child with a similar past to Grace's. \r\n\r\nThe camerawork in Short Term 12 draws the viewer into a very intimate and delicate situation. These people in the shelter are so hurt that any further pain can push them over the edge. Watching Short Term 12 is like standing on the edge of a knife; even when things go well, a wrong turn of a phrase or confiscation of dolls can be enough to cause a character to spiral downward into a pit of despair. Dragging a broken person from that type of personal hell requires great patience, understanding, and lots of luck outside of your control. Short Term 12 succeeds at showing the entire process to the audience. The little \"wins\" where the kids open up are so emotionally rewarding and satisfying leaving the audience with a massive high, only to be dragged back down by what can appear to a normal person a small inconvenience. Most importantly, these scenes (until the final act) don't feel manipulative. The kids are smart people who just don't understand what a normal life is like, and the caretakers are smart enough to break the sullen shell of a malcontent and find a moment of raw connection. \r\n\r\nEqually as compelling as the Short Term facility is Grace's personal story. Slowly revealed over the course of the film, Grace herself is walking on pins and needles. Work gives her focus and purpose, and outside forces are banging on her door leaving her at a loss for what to do. Her emotional scars have turned into scabs that cover herself from those closest to her. By not coming to terms with her past, Grace has trouble moving on to her future with Mason, who only asks to let him inside her head. These scenes provide much needed humor, but also add layers to Grace's character that make the payoffs all the more satisfying.\r\n\r\nThis film takes a calculated risk on Brie Larson's ability to carry a film mostly on her own, with great success. Larson is wonderful here: a strong woman put through the ringer and coming out the other side, but not without some consequences. She can be simultaneously caring and cold, smart and illogical, etc. She also has some help around her. John Gallagher Jr. is very good as Mason, playing a very likable caregiver and love interest who tries to coax Grace out of her cocoon. Kaitlyn Dever is wonderful as Jayden, a younger version of Grace. Dever nails her characters mask of hurt with sarcasm, but when she snaps, she snaps. Keith Stanfield and Rami Malek get nice arcs as a troubled kid and na\u00efve new counselor respectively. \r\n\r\nShort Term 12 exposes the world to the underbelly of society people like to forget exists. In the struggle to force people to conform to societal standards regardless of who you are and where you came from, Short Term 12 focuses on the people who fall through the cracks and the people who notice and take action. Kudos to the filmmakers for taking this story, the people involved, and their plight seriously. I will also never take a fish for granted again.",

            "content": "Wow. Wow. Wow. The credits begin to roll after Short Term 12 ends, and these are the primary thoughts racing through my head after experiencing such an emotionally dense film. Despite its simplistic storyline, Short Term 12 is nothing short of extraordinary, because it forces us to experience the full spectrum of human emotions as the film progresses-quick-witted humor, sorrow, apathy, and ultimately, the existential significance of the decisions we make as we grow as emotional human beings. Short Term 12, without a doubt, stands out as one of the greatest and most impactful indie films of 2013, and it deserves much acclamation for its gorgeous cinematography, deeply moving plot, and realistically humane style.\n\nShort Term 12 follows Grace, our kind-hearted yet troubled protagonist working at a foster-care home for underprivileged and troubled children, named-you guessed it-Short Term 12. Grace is the best at what she does-connecting with children living in the home and helping them through their social and emotional issues. She lives with her boyfriend Mason, and early into the film, Grace receives the news that she is pregnant. This unplanned pregnancy-along with various anxiety and familial issues-are all demons Grace must battle internally to remain strong and effective as a caretaker at the facility. Shortly thereafter, Short Term 12 receives a new intake named Jayden, a darkly dressed and bad-mannered teenage girl. Grace learns to connect quite well with Jayden, along with other members of the home, due to her similarly painful past.\n\nThe beauty of Short Term 12 lies in its striking realism, immersive character development, and engagingly symbolic cinematography. Every character has their moment to shine as we notice their individualistic mannerisms and the seemingly unimportant objects they pay attention to, each with its own emotionally dense backstory per respective character. Not a single scene is wasted in Short Term 12, relying on single-shot frames of scenery, events, and facial expressions as symbolic representations of the story being told. The film is both light-hearted and powerfully somber, injected with quick-witted humor the entire way through while slowly inching its way into your heart. \n\nThroughout its entertaining playfulness, Short Term 12 also forces you to face the dark realities of life, such as the children that suffer in neglected or abusive homes and its psychological consequences. This film is truly an accomplishment for indie cinema, because few films can be so amusingly clever and boldly genuine. At one point in the film, Mason is retelling one of his favorite stories and states, \"It was so f**king cute, I almost pissed my pants.\" The same can be said about Short Term 12, because it is a film that is simply impossible not to adore.",

            "content": "While we aren't likely to get sympathy from anybody, it becomes a tough slog keeping track of the literally hundreds of movies that muscle their way into theaters every year. Especially during those arduous summer months, where every expensive blockbuster looks and sounds the same, the characters have all the substance of rice paper, and whether the film is even worth the price of a single ticket a dozen sequels are already on the way. What little aspirations these movies have don't really amount to much, and mostly they'll be forgotten in the time it takes to cross the mall food court. But then a film like Short Term 12 emerges out of nowhere and blindsides you in a way few movies could ever hope to, and serves as a reminder of why you fell in love with cinema in the first place.\n\nThose are big words, and Short Term 12 lives up to them in every way possible. It's a spark plug of a film, the sort of life-affirming, uplifting piece that Hollywood doesn't make any more. You have to go out and work to find a movie like this, and while that's sad in its own right, you'll be much happier for having done it. The supremely talented Brie Larson is Grace, a young woman working at a short term foster care facility watching over at-risk (don't call them underprivileged!) teens. She's fierce, empathic, and protective to a fault, but Grace also has a warmth and dry humor that is instantly welcoming. Her live-in boyfriend Mason (The Newsroom's John Gallagher Jr.), all scraggly and earnest, works with her at the facility and they form a sort of power couple, although the kids aren't supposed to know they're dating.\n\nWhen we first meet them both, it's on Nate's (Rami Malek) first day working there, and while Mason is deep into a self-deprecating story about a run-in with a minor that led to an unfortunate sharting incident, one of the youths in their charge bursts through the doors headed for the street. At first it's unclear whether we should take it seriously or if it's supposed to be funny, but the reactions by Grace and Mason tell it all. They've seen this before. They're used to it. They've lived it. The boy is having a panic attack. They deal with it. Calmly. Simply. Dealing with the problems of others is what they're good at. Dealing with their own issues is a different story.\n\nYou hear that a film takes place at a foster home and probably the first instinct is to write it off as just another sickly sweet melodrama or one so brutally uncomfortable and depressing it should come with a warning label. The magic of Short Term 12 is that it's neither of those things. Yes, it has moments that will reach into your heart and fill it with the utmost joy, but there are just as many that are heart breaking. The trick is that writer/director Destin Cretton plays them all with the same level-headed approach, never under playing or over selling the very real emotions on display.\n\nWe think we have Grace all figured out, she's smart and tough and takes no crap from anybody. But then we learn right along with her that she's pregnant, and what we don't fully understand is why she doesn't seem to be happy about it. It's not for the usual concerns, that much is clear. And Mason seems like the perfect All-American guy. Those questions swirl believably to create a storm that eventually begins to break the stoic Grace down. The arrival of Jaden (Kaitlyn Dever), a rebellious young girl who spends weekends with her busy father, dredges up old memories Grace would rather forget, and her inability to deal with her past problems threatens to ruin her future with Mason.\n\nCretton is truly writing to his strengths here, having worked in a facility just like this at one point. He populates the film with believable characters that could have easily been stereotypes, but are so much richer as their stories unfold. There's Marcus (the incredible Keith Stanfield), who has been there for years and faces uncertainty now that he's 18 and must leave the facility. Like prisoners who don't know how to function on the outside, Marcus begins acting out in increasingly desperate fashion. To him, foster care was a port in the storm, after a horrific upbringing seemed to map out a terrible life that could only end in two ways: jail or death.\n\nRevelations unfold with the patience and care they deserve, never for a moment hitting a false chord. What's more, they actually inform us about who these characters are. Every word, every moment has meaning, has real impact. What looks like a random party for Mason's parents becomes one of the affecting and touching scenes in the film, letting us in on exactly why he values honesty and family more than anything else. Mostly it's Jaden and Grace who gets the biggest breakthroughs, and like life they come when you least expect it. It's a true emotional roller coaster, one that comes with incredible highs and terrible lows. You'll laugh as Grace and Jaden beat up an inflatable dog as a means of therapy, or at Mason's lame attempts to be cool. You'll cry as one reveals a deeply-rooted personal tragedy, or when another slips into destructive habits. And then you'll probably cry tears of happiness at all of the little triumphs along the way. Ok, so it's a little crazy that so many events hit this one facility in the span of a few days, it never for a second feels less than authentic. Only at one time, when Grace goes a little nutso and begins taking matters into her own hands does Cretton go a bit overboard. While the actions Grace takes are probably consistent given her protective nature, it veers a little into \"wish fulfillment\" territory.\n\nLarson has always been a fantastic actress, who has stolen scenes in 21 Jump Street, The Spectacular Now, and in Joseph Gordon-Levitt's Don Jon, but her performance is the kind that careers are made of. It's a tough balancing act to portray a character like Grace, who is so tough and confident, yet fragile and scared at the same time. She captures the look of someone who has been through a lot and expects to go through a lot more, and will work tirelessly to make sure others don't have to endure the same. There's a wonderful, lived-in quality to all of the portrayals here, so much so that at times you may think you're watching a really well-made documentary.\n\nShort Term 12 has already amassed a number of awards on the festival circuit, and it deserves every single one. It deserves more, actually. It deserves to have some awards created specifically for it. As you might expect, there are no simple endings to this story, but the ending we do get is a hopeful and spirited one, and it may just have you looking at life with brighter eyes.",

Inside, Nate says he took the job to work with underprivileged kids which Marcus(Keith Stanfield) takes grave offense to.  When he turns 18, all Marcus wants for his birthday is to have his head shaven.  Jayden(Kaitlyn Dever, of \"Justified\"), a new arrival, figures she will not be sticking around the facility long enough for her to turn 18.  Outside, Grace and Mason are a couple, with Mason wondering why it has been 9 days and 13 hours since they have had sex.  Maybe that has something to do with Grace being pregnant which Mason does not know about, yet.\r\n\r\nIf you have to see only one movie about troubled teenagers this September featuring Brie Larson...well, I haven't seen \"The Spectacular Now,\" yet, so it will have to be \"Short Term 12\" which in any case is very much worth it, especially due to its excellent performances.  In addition to one scene that almost made me want to cry, the movie uses humor well to modulate the emotions and to relieve the tension while the characters use it to deflect.  Overall, this is a situation where all the characters, both adults and teenagers, are facing an uncertain future where the youth are watched over by people not much older than they are.  Of particular interest is Grace, whose past is gradually revealed and knowing what she knows about herself has to decide what kind of parent she will be, if any.",

Brie Larson (21 Jump Street) gives an Oscar-worthy performance and perhaps the best performance of the year as a young supervisor of a home for at-risk teens. The performance is natural and true. Her own past has taught her to deal with the kids, but at the same time, it has prevented her from moving on. The movie is about the struggles of dealing with troubled childhoods and trying to find the light to a better future. The performances are raw and real and the teen actors are just as good as the adults. This is a heartbreaking, sometimes funny, but very sobering story that will leave you speechless for its brutal honesty of these teens and adults trying to live a better life. This is one of the best films of the year and should not be missed. \n\nGrade: A",

The film follows Grace (Brie Larson) as she supervises a home for at-risk teens. With each interaction, at work and at home, a new set of issues is at hand, progressing naturally and hauntingly to the breaking point for our leading actress. Directors don't just stumble upon strong emotions like these; they are masterfully honed and developed by a keen touch and existing emotions ready to evoke. Brie Larson does an expert job of portraying these emotions, thoughtfully, absorbing the content and expressing it with a believability that keeps the film on course and never over the top. The supporting roles create a strong emotional foundation for the film as well, with excellent showings from the at-risk teens in Kaitlyn Dever, Keith Stanfield, Alex Calloway, and Kevin Hernandez all of whom take their somewhat small roles and carry them to the next level, with understated emotional responses to their surroundings. John Gallagher Jr. balances out Larson's performance with some much needed comic relief. Independent films can be a mixed bag, relying heavily on the competence of the director and the resonance of their voice alongside the cast and how versatile and emphatic they are in their performance. \"Short Term 12\" is easily one of the strongest independent films of the year and spells a long successful career ahead for both Brie Larson and director Destin Cretton.",

Taking on a hot-button and rarely explored film subject in the form of the youth foster care system, Cretton makes many resounding statements that are as thoroughly fleshed out and multi-dimensional as Brie Larson's meditative central performance. The writer-director aptly stays far away from rookie mistakes and the film, despite its topical weight never feels heavy-handed or didactic. The dialogue feels and is presented naturally and efficiently but also quite bitingly. One standout part (out of many) includes a very raw scene between John Gallagher Jr.'s empathetic Mason and one of the more troubled youths named Marcus who opens up to his counselor in the form of a rap that left me (as well as Mason himself) speechless. Another comparative scene happens between Grace and tomboy Jaden who shares a short story as a metaphor for paternal sexual abuse and neglect. The stakes in the film, for all of the characters, are never greater as each beat strikes the perfect semblance of heartwarming sentiment and grave brutality. There are many more light-hearted moments throughout as well, especially in the first act, that keep the film from feeling like an albatross. If ever you thought of entering this line of work for at-risk teens and the sacrifices it entails, this film will serve as documentary. This film, much like 'Fruitvale Station' and last year's breakout Aaron Paul star-vehicle 'Smashed' gives me hope for the fate of independent cinema. A must see.",

Short Term 12 is also as excellently scripted as it is mounted, with there never being a dull moment in the film, and the lighting gives the film an artful veneer without sacrificing its plausibility, which means Destin Daniel Cretton only needed one film for me to start calling him one of our country's best new filmmakers. Hell, the film would be a must-see alone for Brie Larson's performance, as the young actress has made some notable bit parts over the year, but here we discover that she's an actress of great range and somber effect, playing a very complex character. There's really something for everything in this movie, as it's equal parts joyful, meditative, hip, plausible, intense and heart-breaking, and it will certainly be considered one of the year's very best films.

            "content": "In the midst of films such as The World's End, Elysium, Kick-Ass 2, and numerous summer movies, you become overwhelmed by these movies, full of action and explosions. But then there's a movie that sneaks in, coming out of nowhere, that makes you stop and think about life. A movie that tugs at the heartstrings and makes you feel emotions reminding you how powerful a simple film can be. Short Term 12 did just that.\n\nThis film centers around a group home which houses abused and troubled children and the individuals that work there. We specifically see the story play out through the eyes of Grace, who's basically the supervisor at the place. We see the kids from an outside perspective at first, seeing their daily activities, from the time they wake up to the time they go to sleep. But then it starts going deeper where we meet two children that live there: Marcus and Jayden.\n\nThe movie starts out in a joyous tone where Mason, a worker at the home, tells of a funny story involving one of the kids at the home. But then the tone changes when we meet one of the children for the first time, running away from the home, screaming profanities at the top of his lungs. At that point, we realize how serious this movie was.\n\nOne of the kids Jayden, has just transferred to the home. She's an angry child, filled with rage, and masks her emotions with her sarcastic wit. Her journey is done well, seeing how her mind works and the emotions she gives off. We see her growing relationship between Grace and Jayden as they are mirror reflections of each other. Jayden has a haunting tale especially through the story of The Shark and the Octopus seeing the difficulty of her opening up and being ashamed of experiencing it. Seeing Jayden struggle, Grace starts to open up about her past. She too is a troubled individual and we get to see one of the reasons why she works at the home in the first place.\n\nMarcus on the other hand has been living at the home for quite some time and will be turning 18 in about a week. His story was the one that really connected me. He's a kid with a tough exterior. His childhood is coming to an end which means he will be an adult soon, meaning that he will have to leave Short Term 12. We see that difficulty of him struggling to face the fact that he will leave the only he place he's called home. He's gonna leave the sanctuary. We see him grow as a person, seeing his layers be peeled away. He's a quiet boy, only expressing his thoughts through a rap. After a meltdown he experienced, he opened up letting Mason hear one of his songs. This was one of the most powerful scenes and the most haunting. Just in the span of one song, he opens up and he becomes the most vulnerable. His voice starts off strong, angry and powerful. His lyrics were full of profanities especially towards his mother. But as it plays out, it becomes deeper and his voice starts to crack and his eyes start to water. \"Look into my eyes so you know what it's like, to live a life not knowing what a normal life's like.\" And when it ends with that, it was utter silence both in the movie and in the theaters.\n\nThe whole movie was pretty much an emotional fest. But there were upbeat moments. There were surprise, joyous moments, that relieved the tension throughout the film. It crushes your heart at one point leaving you with tears gushing down your face and then the next thing you know, you're laughing hysterically and you're smiling with such relief.\n\nWhat I found most interesting is that throughout this movie, we never see the abusers or any of the abuse played out. All we see is the outcome of those actions. We see the emotional outrage the kids face due to the abuse. We see their point of views of the abuse. In addition to the challenges the kids are experiencing internally, we see them struggle with reliance of drugs and the hardship the system faces trying to understand what these kids need.\n\nDirector and filmmaker, Destin Daniel Cretton does a wonderful job displaying a real life scenario of a group home and the relationships the workers have with the children. It could be because he spent a year and a half in a group home as well, just before he attended film school. I don't think anybody could have done it as well as him. Certain scenes in this film are actually based on real life experiences of Cretton as a worker.\n\nBrie Larson as Grace, is one of the best things about this movie. She plays it real and normal having a subtlety to her performance. Her performance is perfect and stunning playing a person dealing with mixed emotions and one that has a\"hot and cold\" nature. Her portrayal of Grace is definitely Oscar worthy and should be nominated for one. Actually, Short Term 12 is a film that I hope would be taken into consideration for an Oscar.\n\nIf you can't tell by my review, this movie is a definite must see. It's one of those films that's a whole different cinematic universe. It reminded me why I love movies so much. The poignant moments in the film mixed with the upbeat moments were haunting and heartbreaking. The movie never gets melodramatic and \"soap-operatic\". It just portrays a realism to these situations.  Those scenes mixed with the top notch performances delivered a truly masterful experience.\n\n4.6/5\n\nCheck out more of my movie reviews: http://mswintersoldier.wordpress.com/",

            "content": "While we aren't likely to get sympathy from anybody, it becomes a tough slog keeping track of the literally hundreds of movies that muscle their way into theaters every year. Especially during those arduous summer months, where every expensive blockbuster looks and sounds the same, the characters have all the substance of rice paper, and whether the film is even worth the price of a single ticket a dozen sequels are already on the way. What little aspirations these movies have don't really amount to much, and mostly they'll be forgotten in the time it takes to cross the mall food court. But then a film like Short Term 12 emerges out of nowhere and blindsides you in a way few movies could ever hope to, and serves as a reminder of why you fell in love with cinema in the first place.\n\n \n\nThose are big words, and Short Term 12 lives up to them in every way possible. It's a spark plug of a film, the sort of life-affirming, uplifting piece that Hollywood doesn't make any more. You have to go out and work to find a movie like this, and while that's sad in its own right, you'll be much happier for having done it. The supremely talented Brie Larson is Grace, a young woman working at a short term foster care facility watching over at-risk (don't call them underprivileged!) teens. She's fierce, empathic, and protective to a fault, but Grace also has a warmth and dry humor that is instantly welcoming. Her live-in boyfriend Mason (The Newsroom's John Gallagher Jr.), all scraggly and earnest, works with her at the facility and they form a sort of power couple, although the kids aren't supposed to know they're dating.\n\n \n\nWhen we first meet them both, it's on Nate's (Rami Malek) first day working there, and while Mason is deep into a self-deprecating story about a run-in with a minor that led to an unfortunate sharting incident, one of the youths in their charge bursts through the doors headed for the street. At first it's unclear whether we should take it seriously or if it's supposed to be funny, but the reactions by Grace and Mason tell it all. They've seen this before. They're used to it. They've lived it. The boy is having a panic attack. They deal with it. Calmly. Simply. Dealing with the problems of others is what they're good at. Dealing with their own issues is a different story.\n\n \n\nYou hear that a film takes place at a foster home and probably the first instinct is to write it off as just another sickly sweet melodrama or one so brutally uncomfortable and depressing it should come with a warning label. The magic of Short Term 12 is that it's neither of those things.  Yes, it has moments that will reach into your heart and fill it with the utmost joy, but there are just as many that are heart breaking. The trick is that writer/director Destin Cretton plays them all with the same level-headed approach, never under playing or over selling the very real emotions on display.\n\n \n\nWe think we have Grace all figured out, she's smart and tough and takes no crap from anybody. But then we learn right along with her that she's pregnant, and what we don't fully understand is why she doesn't seem to be happy about it. It's not for the usual concerns, that much is clear. And Mason seems like the perfect All-American guy. Those questions swirl believably to create a storm that eventually begins to break the stoic Grace down. The arrival of Jaden (Kaitlyn Dever), a rebellious young girl who spends weekends with her busy father, dredges up old memories Grace would rather forget, and her inability to deal with her past problems threatens to ruin her future with Mason.\n\n \n\nCretton is truly writing to his strengths here, having worked in a facility just like this at one point. He populates the film with believable characters that could have easily been stereotypes, but are so much richer as their stories unfold. There's Marcus (the incredible Keith Stanfield), who has been there for years and faces uncertainty now that he's 18 and must leave the facility. Like prisoners who don't know how to function on the outside, Marcus begins acting out in increasingly desperate fashion. To him, foster care was a port in the storm, after a horrific upbringing seemed to map out a terrible life that could only end in two ways: jail or death. \n\n \n\nRevelations unfold with the patience and care they deserve, never for a moment hitting a false chord. What's more, they actually inform us about who these characters are. Every word, every moment has meaning, has real impact. What looks like a random party for Mason's parents becomes one of the affecting and touching scenes in the film, letting us in on exactly why he values honesty and family more than anything else. Mostly it's Jaden and Grace who gets the biggest breakthroughs, and like life they come when you least expect it. It's a true emotional roller coaster, one that comes with incredible highs and terrible lows. You'll laugh as Grace and Jaden beat up an inflatable dog as a means of therapy, or at Mason's lame attempts to be cool. You'll cry as one reveals a deeply-rooted personal tragedy, or when another slips into destructive habits. And then you'll probably cry tears of happiness at all of the little triumphs along the way. Ok, so it's a little crazy that so many events hit this one facility in the span of a few days, it never for a second feels less than authentic. Only at one time, when Grace goes a little nutso and begins taking matters into her own hands does Cretton go a bit overboard. While the actions Grace takes are probably consistent given her protective nature, it veers a little into \"wish fulfillment\" territory.\n\n \n\nLarson has always been a fantastic actress, who has stolen scenes in 21 Jump Street, The Spectacular Now, and in Joseph Gordon-Levitt's Don Jon, but her performance is the kind that careers are made of. It's a tough balancing act to portray a character like Grace, who is so tough and confident, yet fragile and scared at the same time. She captures the look of someone who has been through a lot and expects to go through a lot more, and will work tirelessly to make sure others don't have to endure the same. There's a wonderful, lived-in quality to all of the portrayals here, so much so that at times you may think you're watching a really well-made documentary.\n\n \n\nShort Term 12 has already amassed a number of awards on the festival circuit, and it deserves every single one. It deserves more, actually. It deserves to have some awards created specifically for it. As you might expect, there are no simple endings to this story, but the ending we do get is a hopeful and spirited one, and it may just have you looking at life with brighter eyes.",

The title refers to a short term foster home where teens supposedly stay until the court decides on more long term placement. Brie Larson is Grace, a young supervisor at Short Term 12. John Gallagher Jr. is Mason, one of Grace's co-workers and her boyfriend. Keith Stanfield, who also appeared in Cretton's short with the same name, is Marcus, one of the older teens who has had a longer stay at Short Term 12. Stanfield also recorded the rap for the closing credits. Kaitlyn Dever, who also appeared with Larson in The Spectacular Now as a fellow high school student, is Jayden, a new arrival to the home. Grace seems to function better when she is helping the teens with their problems rather than dealing with the emotional trauma of her own life. We get small glimpses of her background throughout, not through flashbacks, but when she shares stories that might help the teens. She is so compassionate and knowledgeable because she went through similar foster care. Mason, we find out, was also a foster kid, who was adopted by a loving family. Marcus is preparing to age out of the foster home. Jayden is dealing with abuse similar to what Grace experienced. Grace struggles with memories of her father at the same time as trying to decide if she should start a family with Mason. The leads and the few other supporting characters who are revealed a tiny bit form a well woven tapestry. It is emotional material that is delivered in a touching manner with lots of love and occasional laughs where appropriate.",

            "content": "In our privileged lives, most don't take the time to think about the individuals who aren't so lucky in theirs.  In school, there's always that one kid who constantly has trouble just getting by, and we feel for them, but that's about it.  \"Short Term 12\" is a movie about those kids - the ones who are neglected by their families, have troubled pasts, and long for a better life.\n\tShort Term 12 itself is a facility for at risk teens, with workers who were/are just as troubled as the teens they are attempting to save.  One of those dedicated workers is Grace (Brie Larson), a committed young woman who is great at understanding what the kids are going through (she had an abusive childhood), but at times uses the job to cover up her inner turmoil.\n\tShe's in love with her job, and also with Mason (John Gallagher Jr.), a colleague with whom she's had a long relationship with.  Grace's biggest problem, however, is the fact the relationship is beginning to look towards marriage territory, and her emotional past is getting in the way of forging such an endeavor.  \n\tThe film explores troubled youths in a way that hits much harder than we'd ever expect - it doesn't attempt to hone in on just one of them, but a handful, all of which have had things happen in their lives that no one should have to go through.  There are some scenes that could make anyone want to break down in tears: it's simply awful to see these kids have breakdowns when we know of so many that are born into homes that give them joy rather than pain.\n\tMany films of the same vein are cringe-worthy, showcasing outbursts of drama that follow the mold of a been-there-done-that clich\u00e9 instead of projecting honesty.  \"Short Term 12\" has many moments that beg to be glossily over-the-top, but thanks to its subtle performances and Cretton's understated direction, it's a film that feels like an all too realistic documentary.\n\tScenes flow not with Hollywood tinge, but with the normalcy of a day passing by, with moments of humor and disappointment intertwining with ease.  The dialogue is limited, but when it's on full display, it has a way of digging at us.\n\tAt the center of the film is Brie Larson, an actress who proves her buzz whole-heartedly.  As Grace, it isn't hard to witness her perpetual tug-of-war with her mind, completely aware that her life is in the process of turning out to be a damn good one, but simultaneously is being dragged down by the hardships of her early years.  Larson is gut-wrenching.  In some scenes, she shows Grace's abilities of fine care taking, while in others, displaying a sadness that makes our empathy rise to new levels.  She's a wonder, an actress who could easily go down the same route as Jennifer Lawrence.\n\t\"Short Term 12\" may not always be easy to watch, but it's so well-done in its unflinching ways that it still is extremely hard to look away.",

Here is the kind of dramatic indie feature that I can happily support, as it manages to hit a lot of familiar beats, while taking a step in a different direction from the norm.  The film features a strong lead performance by Brie Larson, some solid support from both the adult and younger actors involved, and this is all achieved with a certain level of comfort that allows the film to feel at many times like a docu-drama.  The sense of realism is there, but writer/director Destin Cretton does a lot of good work making a fully realized motion picture out of this story adapted from his own short film.  It will only have a limited release in theaters, but it definitely deserves a large audience.\n\nread the whole review at thecodeiszeek.com",

This is, without doubt, the most emotionally riveting story I have ever seen captured on camera. Around halfway through, I honestly wasn't sure what I was going to think about this movie once the credits rolled. The emotion was more real than I've ever seen before, but the story felt disjointed and the direction somewhat sloppy... But once the credits actually rolled, I was blown away. Never before have I cried as many times during a film as I did during Short Term 12. The seemingly disjointed first half of the movie ended up making perfect sense once the film had ended. Every scene, every conversation was essential to the message and the story being told. The acting was, in my opinion, the only weakness of this film; but in many ways, the offbeat performances added emotion and honesty to the roles. There is so much to be taken away from this movie that I don't know where to start. Bottom line, this is the best movie of the year (so far) and one of the best films I've ever seen.

            "content": "2013 was a big year for me. I graduated high school. People with whom I've shared eight-plus years of my life I no longer see on a regular basis. I got my driver's license. Everything I'd been fearing about growing up and moving on has begun to take shape, and I feel like my life now is supposed to mean something, but I'm not sure what. I have the most amazing parents in the world, three beautiful siblings who love and would die for me in an instant and I them. I live a modest life that not only caters my obsession with film but allows me to discuss/vehemently defend movies and other various pieces of pop culture with equally strident individuals I've come to know as not strictly peers, but friends I feel I can be real with about anything when I don't have anywhere else to go (Mark Zuckerberg, I promise you.)\n\nThis prelude isn't to relate my troubles to the serious cases of abuse drug-affiliated and/or domestic of teens who enter into halfway housing. Again, a day doesn't go by where I don't stop and thank my lucky stars I was blessed or whatever enough to end up in the situation I am; I just put pressure upon myself that I'm not succeeding/trying hard enough to make it up to my parents for raising me to be the, I'd say kind and decent and unable-to-accept-any-form-of-flattery person I am today. I want to say I emotionally sympathize with struggling youth who also see the outside world as a big and scary place that's fit to swallow you whole, but at the end of the day, it physically isn't the environment from which I come.\n\nWhen Nelson Mandela died last month, I wrote a brief something on Facebook in quasi-memorial to his passing about how much I appreciate the people in this world who sacrifice their lives in pursuit of making it a little bit of a better place than it was before. One of the many delusions I mentally wrestle with is the metaphysical marriage between art and activism. Both try to relate universal truths about moral- and humanity. Art requires a willing audience though, a third man; activism puts you right in the shit and hands you a mop. Do we need more writers or poets in the mainstream any more than we need more lawyers or business executives? I'm not saying talent isn't too indelible a thing to waste and act like I don't seek out and let form a personal connection to emerging musical acts and bands. This divide is just something that fascinates me.\n\nI've said this somewhere previously, but I call bullshit on movies being about escapism. No amount of metallic clank and CGI clobber can shrug off story having to mean something; ANYTHING. The best works of art get at larger points of society and/or the plight of the singular spirit, blending fact and fiction to the degree the lines blur, stop making sense, give up the ghost or whatever your cheeky not-so-critical reference.\n\nAs you've probably made like Jennifer and garnered if anyone's even read this far (that last pun was most likely also the last straw) I didn't want to write a quote-unquote \"professional\" review of Destin Cretton's phenomenal \"Short Term 12\"; I've been waiting to see this movie for so many months now you can find troves of those anywhere. But just how much \"Short Term\" spoke to my sensibilities should be enough of a reason to warrant an immediate recommendation. Or if you're still on the fence, take Vampire Weekend's word for it -- no spoilers, the lyric \"all you who change your stripes can wrap me in the flag\" has never been more apt or literal. You'll know what I mean.\n\nAlso JGL, I loved \"Don Jon\", but nobody puts Brie Larson in the corner. Nobody. (89.100)",

He once worked at a facility like the one portrayed in the film, and that definitely shows through the way he is able to create characters that feel like real human beings, dealing with real life problems. Brie Larson, giving the best performance of her career by far, plays Grace, who works at Short Term 12, and doesn't hesitate to risk her job and oftentimes physical well-being to support and protect the kids she is responsible for looking after. Her troubled past is slowly revealed throughout the film, mainly by her interactions with the kids residing at Short Term 12. Her boyfriend, played by John Gallagher Jr. (Jim Harper from The Newsroom) is clearly passionate about his job, and like Grace, genuinely cares about these kids. He wants to help them in any way he can, even if it's just sitting there listening to a teenager express their disturbing childhood through rap. This film is as much a character study, as it is an examination of the the roles people play in each others lives. Grace and Mason need those kids just as much the kids need them, and the authenticity of both the characters, and place, make for one of the better independent films I've seen this year.",

It is a simple film on paper, butShort Term 12 gives itself time to take shape, but once we are on board it ends up becoming greatly powerful and passionate in its telling of vast emotional intricacy, determination and resonance. It is a simple film on paper, but overwhelmingly deep in life, body and soul. It is a heartwarming film and a heart wrenching film. By the end, we have a big smile on our faces and see that our characters\u2019 lives come full circle for the best intentions. You can\u2019t expect or want more from this film.\r Brie Larson gives a most natural performance as Grace who is in general charge of the facility, though she is not the boss, a psychologist or even a therapist. She is simply a friendly, kind and interactive role model for these hardened kids. Larson has been a gem on the indie screen for the last few years and she certainly has a long and lustrous career ahead of her. She carries the show here.\r What is so wonderful about this film is that we get to meet and follow more than one resident\u2019s story. This isn\u2019t a plot overdrive, everything adds up justifiably and we should, in fact, be grateful. The film is perceived to avoid the loophole of sentimentality and offer a window into convincing and manifold characters. Destin Daniel Cretton, the director, reportedly worked as a staff member at a place such like the one shown in Short Term 12. This shows through his material and ability to bring together multiple stories with such fluency and emotional impact. He ensures his characters are worthy of love and attention.\r A new arrival to the foster home, Jayden (Kaitlyn Dever) seems to be one of the most deeply troubled, and is a \u2018cutter\u2019 as they call it. It is through Jaydan that we learn more about Grace\u2019s dark past, as they strike a sweet and subtle connection with one another. One may doubt Grace\u2019s ability to stand in the position of authority that she holds; Grace is yet to see closure with her own issues, but she is great at what she does through her kindness of heart. It\u2019s no surprise why she does this job: she doesn\u2019t want anyone to have to suffer the same way she did.\r Due to her deeply routed internal struggles, Grace struggles to give real intimacy; she cannot commit and is prone to sudden emotional bursts that seem completely irrelevant at the time. This is obviously a problem for her boyfriend of three years, Mason (John Gallagher Jr.). Mason is a nice guy and does exceedingly well not to grab his bags and head for the hills; he will fight for what he believes in. Mason tells two wonderful stories that act as opening and closure for the film. One is funny and sets the day-to-day tone of conversation and spirit in the workplace, whereas the other is one of inspiration and romance that ends the picture suggesting that all the characters have taken a path of elevation.",

The film allows for these characters to fully live and have dimension, and much of it's core and heart, comes from the interaction of the actors. The director is also very successful in capturing the frailty of children's lives and expectations, as is in the way it captures the hardship of a young relationship and the steps to becoming a responsible adult. The threads that the film successfully builds are as delicate as they are strong in it's emotional impact.

From first shot to last, the film is stunning; it is emotionally vast, beautifully and intimately shot, and an incredibly acted success.\r Short Term 12's subject matter lends itself to immediacy, and so the film presents its characters in stride, building up Grace, her paramour co-worker, ally, and confidant Mason, and the teenagers in their care with small, detailed brushstrokes  for example, we learn who Mason is primarily through his natural storytelling ability as he introduces the facility to a new staff member; with anger-brimming older boy Marcus, it's a profound but not unbelievably polished rap session. These moments are expository without ever feeling forced or out of place; Cretton's mantra seems to favor an almost voyeuristic naturalism above all else. There are a few scant moments where the writing takes a turn for the more forced, especially when the script plays for laughs and the jokes stand out from the rest of the dialogue because they are so obviously structured for punchlines. These are easily forgiven, however, as the film quickly slips into its deeply sympathetic stages, teasing out the wracking pain and broken pasts buried within these kids, who quickly demonstrate that they're far more than the band of colorful misfits they initially present as. The aforementioned Marcus as the facility's veteran resident and a newcomer, Jayden, whose  attitude and scarred over past most closely resemble Grace, play the primary fulcrums for Mason and Grace to pivot around. Instead of one great urgency that drives the narrative forward, there is a looser, short-story style that weaves its way through the film, thus adhering to its dropped-in, naturalistic feel. The conflicts these kids (and other adults!) introduce and the sympathies they engender are utilized as ways to explore, primarily, Grace's own frustrations, weaknesses, aspirations, and pain. Grace is the all-encompassing center stage here, and at its core, the film is very introspective, an elegant psychological portrait that strikes a near-perfect balance between what it shows and what it leaves for the viewer to surmise.\r So, of course, we must talk about Brie Larson's superlative, sumptuous performance as Grace. This is as close of an embodiment of the now mythical strong female character as you're likely to see all year. She's immediately admirable and likable  it's clear that she cares for these children and operates with a generous compassion and patience, but her balancing flaws are what make her truly stand out. Instead of a few individual negative traits (like the general impishness that infects every manic pixie dream girl derivative, or, say, emotional volatility  because, you know, women are crazy), her demons form an almost terrifying  certainly tragically  cohesive whole. She's constantly receding from some past open wound, and it makes her at times prideful, stubborn, defiant, pitiful, and difficult. Her past and her person come together to form a character that understands how to fight through pain, and demonstrates courage through her resilience and fire, but is never quite sanctified and all the more laudably grounded for it. Though in broad strokes it is a rich and comprehensive and powerful portrayal, there are a few pinprick moments where the direction does seem to recede into comfortable cliche  do we ever need another shot of a character looking vacant and troubled in the shower? Still, a few of these are easily forgiven, and the larger picture painted is still breathtaking. This centerpiece that is Grace owes equal dues to Cretton's heartfelt script and Larson's performance, the latter of which runs the gamut between optimistically aloof, passionate, distant, angry, and, when earned, triumphant, and she leaves nothing on the table.\r Larson would stick out like a sore thumb, however, if her supporting cast didn't all rise to the challenge to extend the tapestry of her character into a fully realized world populated with all sorts of interesting. As Mason, John Gallager Jr. gives a far less showy but quietly stellar performance as Grace's partner in all things; if I had to nitpick, there are moments where he suffers from Gary Stu syndrome, but he has enough to do to quickly rise up as a formidably substantial character on his own. When Grace runs into adversaries, instead of being heartless bureaucratic hardasses like the DMV caricatures administrative types are usually presented as, they offer counter-arguments that are both logical and passionate, and Grace is far from always right. But we continue to root for her in tremendous ways, because she seems so knowable, because she's heartwrenchingly thorough, because this story, in spite of its sometimes angsty trappings, comes across as so personal and real.",

In spite of all of the travails facing these workers and wards,, the movie is uplifting and gives us all hope and the ability to believe that no one is beyond help and redemption.
