            "content": "Expertly crafted, acted, and directed. Linklater obviously hits the nail on the head in all technical film making aspects. This film drained me though...I mean talk about a jarring experience. Rooting for the fantasy love that the first 2 films portrayed really set me up for resentment of a scene late in the film. Everything about it was realistic and thought-provoking but it was upsetting. I'm glad the ending provided hope for the future. I believe they stay together. Love isn't perfect, but its love nonetheless and finding true love like the love Jesse and celine have is rare. I just cant see myself going back and enjoying this film nearly as much as Sunrise and Sunset. Maybe as I age, I will appreciate more aspects of the arguments presented in the film. Yet, I still really appreciated the daring direction this film went in and it kept me on the edge of my seat.",

            "review_title": "Before Midnight is a Masterpiece (****)",
            "content": "Before Midnight is a different type of animal this time around. I didn't expect the team could top an already beautiful story but what they achieve in the newest installment is the most accurate and authentic portrayals of love since Michel Gondry's Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004). The film is an absolute marvel, showcasing the very best dialogue and capturing the sheer essence of acting brilliance from stars Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy. Director Richard Linklater has also created the crowning work of his directorial career, showing incredible restraint and focus on two characters that still feel just as new and fresh as the day we met them. The film opens with a near fifteen minute take that gets its hook into you and never lets up. It's a cinematic sensation. Midnight takes place nine years after the events of Sunset. Jesse and C\u00e9line are still together and have managed to have twin girls, Nina and Ella, and are living in Europe. The film takes place at the tail end of a six-week vacation in Greece where Jesse has just dropped off his thirteen-year-old son Hank, from his previous marriage, at the airport for his return back to Chicago. Realizing that he's missing the formative years of Hank's teenage life, Jesse and C\u00e9line explore the option of possibly making a move to America, leaving opportunities and a life in Europe behind. This film is easily the best film of the franchise so far. Packing an emotional and euphoric punch like third-installments like Toy Story 3 (2010) and The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (2003), films that have a close-nit relation to their predecessors but saving all the masterful speeches and epiphanies for the viewer to indulge in their finales. Obviously there's no big fantasy battle or a near death experience in an incinerator for the meaning of life to be physically explained but in the power of words, and words alone, Before Midnight manages to become the poster child for screen writing and brilliant storytelling for years to come. The film doesn't take any cheap shots with every scene constructed from real emotion and feeling incredibly authentic and genuine. There are long takes for the viewer to be present whether it's in an airport conversation between Jesse and Hank or at a lunch with in the beautiful valleys of Greece or even in a hotel room where a man and a woman share intimacy like older lovers typically do. Ethan Hawke is an actor that never quite caught onto the awards circuit for some odd reason. Nominated for his performance alongside Denzel Washington in Training Day (2001), Hawke has shown tremendous range throughout his career including missed opportunities for recognition in Sidney Lumet's Before the Devil Knows You're Dead (2007). As Jesse this time around, Hawke uses every ounce of magnetism, charisma, and acting ability to bring himself to the levels of legendary actors like Daniel Day-Lewis and Marlon Brando. He becomes a man all too familiar to the male viewer and ignites the film into a spectacular frenzy of passion. Hawke isn't afraid to show the inner turmoil of Jesse as the growing cancer of guilt has come to the surface. He works moment after moment in expressing the bewildering beauty of love at the expense of one's own values and sacrifice. He's almost the distant, and utterly toned down, cousin of Freddie Quell from Paul Thomas Anderson's The Master (2012), a man so complex but inserted with terrific character beats and an actor willing to commit entirely to the craft to portray him flawlessly. Hawke surpasses not only his past features but the very being of himself as an actor. It's his finest turn yet. Julie Delpy is as imaginative and magnetic as ever. She's a wonderful presence, often very skillful example of acting on the finest level. She executes the pure feelings of uncertainty in conjuncture with the script which is a clear and marvelous character study on love. She's wildly immersed into C\u00e9line, accomplishing not only a somewhat free- spirited damaged woman but a sex appeal that triggers any person's romantic desires. She's an effortless existence in the film, which makes C\u00e9line not only explicitly real, but tenderly and mysteriously loving for the viewer. It's a performance that defines her abilities as an actress and one that will be remembered fifty years from now as we all think back on the amazement of Julie Delpy. The film is breathtakingly accurate and precise in capturing the love and relationship of couples, it will and should be studied by film schools and writers for years to come. Linklater bares his soul, frame after frame, showing confidence of his own idiosyncratic vision of this story and being as accessible to even the youngest of people. This is Linklater's most personal tribute to the scope of cinema and will be his defining moment on the silver screen. The film is a must-see and is the first masterpiece that 2013 has to offer. Before Midnight is an instant Oscar-contender and a triumph in filmmaking. It's the go-to film of the Tribeca Film Festival and the best picture of the year so far.",

The couple (Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy who both co-wrote with Linklater) are now in their 40s and face some very real challenges to their menage. I started laughing and crying within about 3 minutes and both emotions kept up until the very end. Everyone sat through the credits so they could wipe their faces clean. Brilliant acting . . .This film gives one hope for the state of American film making and reminds you that Linklater is one of our most underrated auteurs. I sincerely hope he continues and I live long enough to see the couple well into their senior years.Even if you have never seen the first two movies, do not miss this one.",

I've always liked Ethan Hawke's acting and I thought the scripts were full of life and fresh dialog. I felt that way for maybe 1/2 of this latest film and then, for me, it just deteriorated into one long argument between the two protagonists, often accompanied by vicious barbs and personal verbal attacks. I thought for a moment I was back watching \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf\", from decades before.It was not entertaining for me to watch Jesse(Hawke) and Celine(Julie Delpy) try to win this argument by throwing out all the stereotypes, generalizations, and platitudes that you might find in \"Men Are From Mars-Women Are From Venus\". They've been together now for many years, and the parents of twin girls Ella and Nina. Jesse is divorced and his son Henry is just leaving Jesse to head back to the States where he lives with his mother. They've all been vacationing in beautiful Greece for the summer.As mentioned, why ruin all the positives of the first two films and half of this one with all this mean spiritedness?",

Jesse has written 2 more books. It's one of the last days of their summer vacation in Greece. Jesse sees his son Hank off after spending the summer with him. Hank's mom is still angry and Jesse wants so much to spend more time with him in Chicago. Celine is thinking about taking a government job with complications.They are 41. They have kids. It has the naturalistic long takes very much in keeping with the previous movies. I love the sly humor and human scale of their lives. There is also something great about growing old with these characters. This is what comes after happily-ever-after of the second movie. I do like the scenes with Jesse and Celine alone more than the scenes with other people. I don't mind the other characters but I loved the private moments with just those two wandering around bullshitting. Also it's great to have them continue their relationship with their problems.",

            "review_title": "The three films together are stunning! But this is the least of them",
            "content": "Before Midnight (2013)The most interesting facet to this slim movie is that it continues the singular predecessors with such glowing continuity. Most people know that Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke started their conversational fictional companionship on film with \"Before Sunrise\" and then continued it with \"Before Sunset.\" The first of these was shot in 1995, and the next followup was nine years later, and then this new one, nine years more.If you saw (and liked) the first two films as I did, this continuance alone makes \"Before Midnight\" worth checking out. And if there is a huge deadening flaw here it is simply that the continuing continues so expectedly. There are times here when this couple\u2014which has been living together for nearly a decade\u2014talk as though they are on that first date in 1995. It's not that they don't know certain things about each other, but more that they are talking about things as if for the first time--and they are such common things. Surely they've gotten around to some of this stuff before. It's not endlessly revelatory.The director of all three films is Richard Linklater, and he absolutely gets a lot of the credit for an easy, almost languid style. Some would call it boring\u2014all talk and walk, nothing much to watch. But it isn't boring. The first movie for sure is the most fresh (it was the first one), but the second keeps things really interesting because the two leads (Jesse and Celine) are meeting up again after a huge gap, and it's an odd and unpredictable situation. By 2013 things have fundamentally solidified. They are a happy couple with twin girls, living in France. The day proceeds with conversation, and we listen closely (there is nothing else to do), but in fact there is nothing to be surprised or even curious about.So the words become so critical they can't help but fail. A long dinner conversation with a group of educated friends is fast paced and filled with clever banter, but it goes nowhere. Yes, you absolutely wish you were there (and maybe that you had such friends\u2014that would depend). But what is said is not so wonderful after all. It's just a mood of warm, lively companionship.Likewise elsewhere. It's all fun and clever. When they squabble a bit it never seems remotely possible that the fight is for real, or that the incredible ease and love shown earlier in the movie would unravel with a slight ill wind. The very last scene confirms, and is oddly wan.So\u2014a mixed bag. I truly think if you haven't seen these films you might find the style and the remarkable believability (at times) really special. It is. But for me it was more special and more interesting as a story in the earlier movies. This one can now not be separated from those, however, and the great whole, a trilogy with a possibility of more to come, is a special and worthy part of contemporary cinema. Start somewhere and see what this is all about.",

            "content": "I just saw this amazing movie at its Sundance premiere. It's wonderful on so many levels I don't know where to start. The performances are fantastic. If Julie Delpy doesn't get an Oscar nomination it would be a shame (the only stupider thing the Academy could do is have 10 best picture nominations.) Ethan Hawke's performance is brilliant in its own way, however, it's a less showy part and I'm not certain it'll get the recognition it deserves. The writing is astounding. Sharp, intelligent, biting, humorous, with staggering subtext, but most importantly--it feels real. If the screenplay doesn't get an Oscar nomination it would be a shame (the only thing stupider the Academy could do is have 15 best picture nominations.)Rick Linklater is now officially the Jedi master of indie filmmaking (Yoda Soderbergh actually said he's giving up filmmaking.) SLACKERS was only 22 years ago, and Linklater has matured into one of the most original filmic storytellers in the history of the medium. 95% of the movie is two-shots of people talking (the other 5% is people talking at a dinner table and cut aways to the gorgeous Greek landscape.) I don't know any other living filmmaker who could pull this off. There's a one-take during a car drive that lasts probably ten minutes (before a brief cut away), however, it goes on for probably another ten minutes (and Linklater said he could have kept the whole take, but needed to show ruins along the country side and cut away for script purposes, not performance.) There's a 30 minute scene of the two actors in a hotel room and I didn't even notice it (by that time I was so invested in the characters and their actions and emotions I wasn't even aware of time, it wasn't until the post screening Q&A that Linklater mentioned the actual time of the scene.) All three, Linklater, Delpy, and Hawke have matured into their rolls (writing, directing, acting) so easily that it's all just great fun for them and the audience. This is a must see for many reasons (including the history of film--there's only one other modern trilogy where the final film is the best--LOTR, and their food budget was probably more than the total cost of BEFORE MIDNIGHT.)i could go on gushing about this movie ad nauseum, however I'll finish by saying that BEFORE MIDNIGHT is what indie film making (and the Sundance Film Festival) is all about--truly original, creative, unique, interesting characters and their stories, told outside the Hollywood system, by people passionate about their craft (and in this case at the top of their craft).",

            "review_title": "Too depressingly realistic to be enjoyable",
            "content": "(I'll warn when I get to the spoilers)This is the third in a trilogy which includes Before Sunrise and Before Sunset. I can't imagine this one being watched as a stand-alone movie and having anything near the effect it should. In fact, I would even recommend watching these several years apart. I watched these movies as they were released, and being the same age as this fictional but very realistic couple made it more of an involving experience.The strongest aspects of this trilogy are the flowing endless dialogue, the acting, and the real characters. As opposed to many other opinions though, I sometimes felt that the dialogue in the last two movies became too pretentious and condensed to be real. These movies need more silence, pauses and looks.In Before Sunrise, they were in their early 20s, smart and practical but open to experience an idealistic short romance based on their chance encounter. They connected, they were charming, they were real, and they pulled it off much to the delight of audiences.In Before Sunset and nine years later, for the first half of the movie, they were unbearably self-obsessed and pretentious and talked at each other instead of with each other. They spent a few hours together, and gradually their attraction and chemistry came back, and made you believe that they may actually recover from their last few years of miserable relationships and closed-minded lifeless lives that were obviously bringing them down, as long as they got together and developed what they had. Some charm and romance crept in despite their newfound self-deprecating cynicism, leaving audiences with an open-ended ending full of potential. I hated it at first, then grew to like it better on second viewing.In Before Midnight, in a too-realistic portrayal, they have been a couple for 9 years (with kids), but their personality differences have not been worked on and their marriage is on the rocks.Jesse is a successful writer but his break with his previous wife and son in order to be with Celine is causing increasing strains in his current marriage. Little annoying things he does add to the strain, but what is very obvious in this movie is that she doesn't love him anymore so every little thing adds to the complaints.Celine in this movie is like an amalgam of every neurosis in modern women. She is an angry activist, an angry feminist, an unfulfilled angry wife, a woman who is so lost and confused regarding what she wants, she cannot be satisfied no matter how many efforts he makes to clarify things and express his love for her, and she doesn't have the tools and outlook to fix her feelings for him so this is a Sisyphean task in any case. As three-dimensional as she is, this is not a sympathetic character to say the least.*spoilers* Which is why, at the end of the movie, anyone with a brain will realize that the small bone she throws him at the end is worthless and that this marriage is doomed. Which is why, as realistic as this movie is, it simply was not enjoyable. Not that movies need to be fun or romantic, but I do expect them to be rewarding or insightful in one way or another. I do not need to go to the movies to watch neurotic people flail at their last threads of marriage and fail at it miserably because of commonplace emotional incompetence.If there is a next movie in a few years, the only possible outcome is that they got divorced soon after this night, and they get together one more time to talk about how they failed their marriage with humorous hindsight and resignation. And then they have sex for old time's sake because the attraction will still be there, although they have no clue what to do with it. That's my screenplay for the next one.But Ingmar Bergman already covered similar ground with his superb and recommended 'Scenes from a Marriage'.If it were up to me, I would have made this movie differently: The fight wouldn't have been so convincingly final. And they would recover from a vicious fight because they made us believe that they built a solid loving base with which to recover. That could have been just as deep, realistic and much more enjoyable.",

            "content": "Mixed feelings about this movie, the third of Richard Linklater's trilogy. The trilogy started in 1995 with Before Sunrise, continued in 2004 with Before Sunset and now, another nine years later, we have Before Midnight. The movies follow the lives and love of Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and Celine (Julie Delpy), with the span in years between movies reflecting the spans in their lives. We are getting snapshots of their lives, at nine-year intervals.Before Sunrise was OK, but not great. Really a dressed-up romantic drama, just with a more realistic and original plot and more subtle direction than your average romance movie.Before Sunset was the pick of the bunch. Rather than just a snapshot, it relates, through their dialogue, all the happenings in the last nine years of their lives, and demonstrates how much each of them were key in the other's life. It had more of a complete story and more character development.Before Midnight now picks up with them together, with their two kids, holidaying in Greece. Like the first two, it is very dialogue-intensive. Like the first two (especially Before Sunrise) the dialogue can be a big negative at times: pretentious, navel- gazing stuff.However, on the plus side, we get to see how relationships end up. Romantic dramas tend to end with the couple walking off into the sunset, very much in love, blissfully happy and without a care in the world. They never cover all the unromantic, even irritating, stuff that comes after it: kids, domestic life, mundanity. This does.On the downside, there is a reason this is never covered: it's boring, even annoying. Who wants to see a bitter, very protracted argument between husband and wife? Or people discussing domestic stuff? Thus, a two-edged sword.So, kudos to Richard Linklater for the concept of these movies and for not shying away from the less glamorous domestic years in a relationship. However, the domestic years aren't very entertaining to watch...",

This time it leads more towards the changing of times, life after marriage, and rationality vs. emotions. When it comes to the past films in this franchise, both Jesse and Celine brought out some interesting points. But this time Celine is the dis-likable character. Maybe because I am a guy, but she just comes off as a bully that is super into the the feminist movement. She basically wants Jesse to bend over backwards in order for her to be satisfied. I don't know, this time around the back and forth conversation just seems more depressing and uncomfortable. Than amusing and intriguing, thus it feels drawn out. I won't be watching this one again, plus it lacks substance compared to the previous two installments. And seeing how it ends, there will probably be another installment. If not, this is just plain out depressing even if it relates to real life to a degree.5.5/10",

            "content": "The 56th San Francisco International came to a close at the magnificent Castro Theatre with a showing of Richard Linklater's \"Before Midnight\", the third in Linklater's series of \"Before\u0085\" films. Preceded by \"Before Sunrise\" and \"Before Sunset\", the film continues the story of Jesse and Celine, now a middle-aged, two child couple on vacation in Greece. Things are not quite right between the two, and there is much to be said between them. So they talk. For two hours. And it is absolutely enthralling.I have to admit that I haven't seen the first two films. I was aware of them, but they just never jumped out at me as something I had to see. I admire Linklater's work ( I thought last year's \"Bernie\" was one of the best films of the year) but just never had a reason to put seeing those films above others I had more interest in. I attended the screening mainly because it was the closing night film, but had concerns that not having seen the previous two would put me at a disadvantage in appreciating his latest. Festival friend (and \"Before\u0085\" series lover) Stacy McCarthy assured me the film stands on its own.She was right. Nothing much goes on in this film but conversations between people, but these conversations are fascinating and have a sense of reality about them often missing from films of this nature. Credit for that obviously goes to director Linklater and actors Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy, who collaborated on the script. It doesn't hurt that the film was shot in Greece, but the picturesque beauty of that country comes second to the riveting portrayal of a couple at the stage of life where the often painful questioning of a couple's future begins.Two hours with these characters flew by, and as the credits rolled my first thoughts were about how much I really liked the film, and how I need to think more \"out of the box\" when it comes to selecting films to view. I'm guilty of often limiting my scope, and I'm thankful that Film Festivals force me to widen my film horizons.www.worstshowontheweb.com",

            "content": "The first time I saw Before Sunrise and Before Sunset I didn't think  much to them. I thought it was a cute concept to revisit characters,  particularly with the irony that Jesse wrote about Before Sunrise but  it wasn't until a rewatch when they opened up. I wish more films were  two interesting people talking and walking through beautiful cities,  especially if they can be as breezy and rewarding as Before Sunset. So  now that I'm a fan, I was excited for Before Midnight and felt that it  could tie the knot that the first two left loose. It did. Midnight is  definitely the funniest and most hard-hitting film I've seen in a long  while. In the other films I've found their existential conversations  interesting but it's never felt like they've dug their fingers in my  brain like this film. It feels like a mirror of my feelings. In a  single shot they articulate all the transient anxieties I have about  the world and life in a more profound way than I could've achieved in  my lifetime. With its real-time gap in time between films with events  and moments only left to the imagination of the viewer, that element of  reality is fascinating. The mere idea that Jesse and Celine have days  like Before Midnight everyday is more overwhelming than an epic drama.  But beyond the fiction, there's a scene where Julie Deply is topless  through a range of emotional tones which adds an extra strange element  of reality that the other films don't have regarding the chemistry  between the leads. As Ethan Hawke suckles on Julie Deply's nipple, the  idea of an intimate relationship between Hawke and Deply in reality  lifts the fiction of Jesse and Celine to a new realm of emotional  impact, especially considering the sharpness of their argument scene.  Midnight has one of the best endings I've seen and if it left it at the  penultimate scene, I would've been far too wrecked. The humour is just  so poignant and wonderful and true. On a technical level, the film is  terrific considering their choices of where to set conversations and  how they're executed in long shots. I loved the way the score for the  film was adapted from Celine's \"Waltz For A Night\" song from the end of  Sunset. As always, the acting is genuine and charming and while it  struggles to adapt to the barrage of side characters at first, they do  have something fascinating to say. Before Midnight is draining but  thoroughly enlightening and satisfying. I have no hesitation in calling  it the best of everyone's careers and best of the year unless anything  else hits me harder.  9/10",

They are now a couple with a pair of twin daughters, and Jesse is struggling to adapt to the role of being a separated father for his son, Hank, having him fly several times back and forth between the United States and France, where Jesse lives with Celine and the daughters. On the last day of their vacation in Greece, Jesse and Celine are trying to find the spark in their relationship again - we are dealing with a couple, like so many others, who in their 'middleage crisis' start asking themselves \"where am I in my life, why do I live it this way, and does my husband/wife still love me?\".For me, the relevance of the film, is its force, along with of course the acting and the script, which Hawke and Delpy again have written together with Linklater. Hawke and Delpy are so much into their characters and you feel how deep their relationship is established - it feels very natural and just like watching a couple in the 21st century. We live in a world where couple's separate, find a new partner, get children, separates again, find a new partner, get new children again (maybe this is a bit extreme, but something like that). Both the husband and wife have jobs and their relationships are affected when suddenly, the only things they are dealing with his who gets the groceries, who picks up the children from the kindergarten etc., and the love and romance between one another slowly fades away. That's the relevance to the age we live in now, that is so strong in Midnight.I can highly recommend fans of the two first movies to see it, and if you are not familiar with the movies, you are certainly in for a treat! In my eyes, Midnight works very well for as an end to a trilogy, but the door is of course a little open for another sequel 9 years in the future (2022...?)Again, the acting is superb (the entire hotel scene is magnificent!), and dialog is so grounded, natural and strong and the film has relevance and could inspire a lot of couples struggling with their relationship to their partner.10/10",

            "content": "I enjoyed Before Sunrise when I first saw it, and thought it was a clever, charming movie with an innovative approach. In my opinion though, Before Sunrise was vastly elevated by being paired with Before Sunset 9 years later.Before Sunset is an exceptional movie, much more melancholic than its predecessor, but understandably so because the characters had grown up and had to let go of childish notions of fairytale happy ever afters. What makes Before Sunset so wonderful though is the notion throughout that even though things went wrong it's never too late to fix them. Before Midnight is a different film to the previous two. In my opinion it is about two people who, having made the mistake of losing contact the first time, will work to make sure it never happens again. They were never going to have a fairytale life because they are both very complicated, and I liked the realism of how their relationship developed as they got older. I strongly disagree with other reviewers who say that Before Midnight can be watched without seeing the previous two. I criticised people who did that for Before Sunset and would caution against it even more for this one. Before Midnight relies on the idea that the audience understands how complicated the characters are and therefore continues to like them even when they do things which could seem nasty and shallow. In summary, while my favourite of the three movies remains Before Sunset, Before Midnight adds richly to the overarching story that has been told, in real time over 18 years, of two characters that fans of the series have grown to love. As a three part series, the Before movies are practically perfect.",

Even though it's the third movie, they managed to keep it interesting, with smart dialogues still not missing from the script. It was really fascinating how they inserted Greek habits and parts of everyday life, without it seeming forced or unnecessary. I really liked how they presented the different ideas of love in each movie. \"Before Sunrise\" showing us young, innocent love, \"Before Sunset\" displaying the difficulties you face as an adult being confused about what you really want for your love life, and finally \"Before Midnight\". In this film they successfully introduce to the viewer the phase in two people's lives, where they have settled down and try to deal with some of the problems a married couple with kids could encounter. The lead actors had great on-screen chemistry once again, achieving to realistically present us these situations. Overall, I believe that it's a smart, entertaining movie with so much to offer. I truly recommend it.",

            "content": "Despite what idealized viewers might think when it comes to their beloved romance films there are numerous events and circumstances that can occur outside the frame that could strengthen, fracture, or challenge that particular relationship beyond the assumed happily ever after conclusion. This idea behind continued uncertainty is essentially called life and though the realist perspective might damage some optimist hopes there is a genuine beauty to the wonderful truth that is a relationship that cultivates or fissures in the face life's challenges. Eclectic filmmaker Richard Linklater, known for such diverse films such as his debut indie feature Slacker and his wide appeal comedy School of Rock, understood the idea of life beyond the ending credits once he reintroduced his two romantic leads Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and Celine (Julie Delpy) with a chance encounter in Before Sunset after their initial meeting nine years earlier in Before Sunrise. Before Midnight, the latest chapter of this ingenious film series, offers the creative staples that the romantic saga is known for with Linklater's consistently delicate observational style, Hawke and Delpy's engaged performances, philosophical witty banter relating to relationships, life, and more but this time unfolding the details of a relationship that has marinated beyond its initial romantic beginnings and changed into something far more palpable, strained, and relatable. The collaborative writing between Linklater, Hawke, and Delpy demonstrates their immense understanding of their created characters and deliver their most uncomfortably emotional and richly life-affirming vignette in this particular reflective road stop in the lives of Jesse and Celine. When poet John Keats wrote the famous last line \"truth is beauty, beauty truth\" in his poem \"An Ode to a Grecian Urn\" he realized that even the most unpleasant truths had intense beauty in its mere recognized existence and the Before saga is one of the purest cinematic exercises in revealing that kind of beautiful truth. Before Midnight takes the initially romantic setups in Before Sunrise and Before Sunset and expands them into their most logical and equally emotional prolongation where it expands the narrative strength, character vivacity, and philosophical importance of the series into a fully realized and painfully heartfelt whole that speaks uncomfortable truths in an engagingly entertaining way.Read more: http://wp.me/py8op-yV; more reviews: generationfilm.net",

            "content": "First and foremost, this is not your typical mainstream summer movie. However, if you're reading this, then I'm sure you've already seen the two preceding films, Before Sunrise and Before Sunset. If you have, then you'll know exactly what I'm talking about. This movie is driven by the characters and their dialog. No fancy special effects, no elaborate sets, no uber-popular actors to stuff in the movie to make people watch it. Just great dialog from two excellent actors.Now that that's out of the way, I was a little uninterested when hearing about this movie, that it was filmed in Greece. However, after seeing the film tonight, I find that the setting was quite lovely and really had little to do with the movie itself. The movie was more about how these two main characters are dealing with getting older and being parents, and how over time, your opinions about things and about each other can change.One thing I've always liked about these movies is the gritty realism of the two characters. Being an American myself, and previously having a French girlfriend (and living in France), I can totally relate to the two characters and the idiosyncrasies that are attributed to both of them in this story of their lives.This movie was, once again, a model example of good dialog and great characters! I was very happy to see this movie, and I'm glad to see the writers haven't lost their touch. This movie was written by not only the director, but also the two main actors, and this series is really their \"baby\" - you can tell much love and care went into these films, even though they are all shot very quickly and with a small budget. I love how there are very few cuts in most of the scenes, and you can tell that everything about this movie was simple. This is a true breath of fresh air in time full of poorly-written movies and cheap special effects.",

            "review_title": "A Truly Bad Movie and I was a huge Before Sunrise fan",
            "content": "I can consider myself a fan of the before series of films, I saw Before Sunrise years before the sequel came out and hipsters started jumping on the band wagon of this film. To explain why before midnight fails I need to explain the film from the perspective of both Before Sunrise and Before Sunset.Now Before Sunrise was a slightly flawed yet still really captivating and original film about two people who randomly by chance meet in Europe, Jesse the American and Celine the french girl. They walk around together for a day until dawn and then Jesse must catch his plane back to America and thats it the end, they agree to meet up again a year later but as we find out in Before Sunset that falls apart.Now Before Sunrise is cute because they are both supposed to be 23 in the film and its OK for 23 year olds to have stupid ideas or be overly dramatic because hey they are young and thats how it works. In Before Sunrise the cracks started to show, the film still held up but the plot began to meander into strange directions, first off when they meet up again they still decide to be \"cutesy\" around each other which is a little odd for people in their thirties to be that way. But the cuteness of the situation is allowed as they haven't seen each other in a long time, also the weakness of Before Sunset exists because get this Jesse writes an acclaimed book to get Celine back and the book is about how they both met.The concept of Jesse as an author is weak because it is very apparent that the guy is kind of stupid and a goof, there is never any indication of depth or being an articulate human being. The other thing is in Before Sunset you get the feeling these two should not be together, they are different and Celine gets annoyed by Jesse but that of course is all very slight. The \"celine getting annoyed by Jesse\" plot line takes the front and center part of the stage in Before Midnight.Really this should have just been two movies, I truly believe that. In part one they separate at the end and in part two they get back together and stay together and just leave it at that. Before Midnight first off doesn't function quite well because of this fact, Jesse and Celine still have stupid cheap back and forth banter between each other except that doesn't make sense because now they aren't 23 and they definitely haven't gone a long time without seeing each other so they are 40 somethings who argue about nothingness.During the first segment of the movie, Jesse and Celine driving back from the airport with their daughters in the back, Celine gives Jesse a hard time about eating one of their daughters apples but in a way a 14 year old would taunt another 14 year old not the way a couple in a long term relationship would act. There are many examples of that and thus begins a two hour long film filled with Celine's passive aggressive and aggressive aggressive attitude towards Jesse.You get the feeling Celine truly and genuinely hates every aspect of her life, she is with a guy that she thinks is dumb, she has two kids when she never wanted any kids, her environmental job always results in failures and having to work with idiots shes annoyed by every aspect of her existence and its truly miserable to have to watch her. There's nothing entertaining or charming about Celine, she is simply very very bitter at Jesse for \"ruining\" her life by getting involved with her.Now the argument here is \"well this is reality\" OK watching paint dry is also an element of reality it doesn't mean I want to go to a movie theater and experience it. This film is different there's none of that whimsical carefree attitude that exists in the first two movies. The few brief moments of entertainment come from Celine not being around, Jesse has some conversations early on with some author who invited him out to Greece to stay with him.Also when Jesse and Celine arrive at the hotel the owner of the hotel asks Jesse to sign a copy of the books he has written then begs Celine to sign them which she refuses because being angry and bitter is all she knows how to be in this film. Finally Jesse pressures her into signing them, but shes angry as always. Also twice Celine is on the phone with Jesse's son and then hangs up before he has a chance to chat with him, which is actually pretty rude.This was such a garbage movie, an utter waste of time and talent, although probably not that much of a waste of time for those who made it I am sure they shot it and scripted it in about 5 days. The critics have all praised this movie but they only praise things that are different, and sitting and listening to two people argue incessantly on screen for 2 hours is certainly different but also stupid.",

Don't get me wrong, I like this genre which I call 'yappy dee yap' movies. Movies which are about lengthy blabber, random tantrums and pointless conversations. Movies with no backbone except for chit chat. I loved the following:\"Before Sunset\" which seemed to have a point or driving towards one.The excellent \"2 Days in Paris\" and its inferior sequel \"2 Days in New York.\" Woody Allen's \"Midnight in Paris.\" \"The Trip (2010)\" with British comedians Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon.But \"Before Midnight\" is just too much. Every 3 minutes I felt like screaming \"Will you please SHUT UP!\" This is not a good sign. It reminded me of young me being stuck at the dinner table with boring self-castrated adults. Every now and then my imagination worked on how the movie would greatly improve if a tractor rammed into the (clich\u00e9 cute) twins or if the roof collapsed on the old people at the lunch table. How about if the couple brought varying degree of bad luck everywhere they went but they didn't know it was their fault until it struck midnight and a giant meteor fell on their head? That alone would have kept my interest up instead of downward sloping.I think the yapping was way over the top this time and nothing really happened in the movie. It's crossed the line of truly annoying and irritating. Even the nude topless scene was too much and disconnected with the rest. I cannot connect with the characters, their life or the story. If that couple were my friends, I would never invite over and permanently hide their status updates on social networks.",

In the end of the vacation, Jesse takes his fourteen year-old son Hank to the airport to fly to Chicago, where he lives with his mother. One of his Greek friends offers a hotel room for Jesse and C\u00e9line to spend one farewell dream night, but they discuss their relationship instead.\"Before Midnight\" is the third chapter of the adorable saga of the French-American couple C\u00e9line and Jesse. Now they are mature and married with children, alternating good moments with crisis in their marriage like \"in real life and not a fairy tale\". The chemistry between Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy is very beautiful and intense and makes the movie worthwhile. Unfortunately, the plot is weak and hard to believe that a couple together for so many years has some attitude shown in the movie (for example, in the car returning from the airport). The unstable behavior of C\u00e9line, who hates her life and Jess success as a writer, seems to be of a woman with bipolar disorder and not caused by a marriage crisis.

The last third of the movie get's oddly dark and becomes uncomfortable viewing and then suddenly like that the credits are rolling and I'm breathing a sigh of relief.Arguably the weakest of the three Before Midnight for me is devoid of entertainment value, the only new thing it brought to the table was the revelation that Julie Delpy has one boob considerably bigger than the other.

Although I sometimes think that the rating on here are ridiculous, when over 41,000 people have given this a ranking of over 8, I'll admit the possibility that it must have something going for it. Mainly, I'm going to admit that because I realize that this is the third of a trilogy - a trilogy of which I was completely unaware. My wife rented this without knowing that actually. Had I known of the trilogy I would probably have suggested watching the first two before getting into this. But I didn't, she didn't, and so we rented this. And I still have to give my honest thoughts, noting that I haven't seen the first two instalments.I watched it two days ago and have been trying to let it percolate in my mind. Unfortunately my basic thought about it hasn't changed. After watching it and spending two days reflecting on it, I still really don't have much of a clue what it was about. Yeah. I get it that it's about the relationship between Jesse and Celine (Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy) - married with children but with a relationship that has more than a few issues, although at first at least it seems happy enough. So it's about them. OK.First of all, though, I thought there were far too many conversations going on - sometimes between them, sometimes between groups. Sometimes they just went on and on and on. The opening car ride with the two of them and their children sleeping in the back of the car was excruciating. I almost joined the children in blissful sleep. The scene around the table with the group who were invited there to spend the summer with the famous writer (why?) was heavy on philosophical meanderings but really not interesting. I wondered how the actors could get through the script awake. And the hotel room scene between the two of them where everything finally fell apart? Some think that was a magnificent portrayal. Me? I thought she was coming across as a - well - I won't use the word. I suppose the redeeming quality of that was that to me at least it finally portrayed the man of the relationship in a positive light, expressing love, while she seemed to be twisting his every word into some sort of attack on her, on her life, on her identity. Whatever. Yeah. It came across as a totally unnecessary feminist diatribe. Ultimately, it ended on a somewhat hopeful note. But I can't say I got too much out of it.But I'll cut it a bit of slack. I don't have the background of the first two instalments. Maybe that would put all this in context. Maybe. So - 3/10.",

The first two movies in this series were so charming and enjoyable. Getting through this one though was a tough, tough slog. There are no redeeming qualities whatsoever to either Jesse or Celine. Indeed, most of the movie is a case study in passive-aggressive behaviour - awash in bitterness, regrets and jealousies. The acting wasn't bad at all, but it is beyond anybody's talent to make these people seem even remotely interesting or enjoyable. Who wants to watch such a banal, petty, dysfunctional relationship where absurd arguments meander on and on ad nauseam? I kept fast forwarding in the hopes of finding a better movie - but, not to be.Why would the writers do such a disservice to the beautiful Celine in this third movie?

            "content": "Feelings of regret, remorse, and guilt dominate Before Midnight, the third film in Richard Linklater's \"Before\" trilogy. The film takes place in Paris eighteen years after Jesse (Ethan Hawke), a then young American aspiring writer first meets Celine (Julie Delpy), a French graduate student on her way to Paris from Vienna. In Before Midnight, now approaching middle age, Jesse and Celine are a couple living in Paris and have settled into what appears to be a long-term relationship. Though not married, they have twin daughters, Ella and Nina (Jennifer and Charlotte Prior). As the film opens, Jesse is saying goodbye at the airport to his son Hank (Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick), who is returning home to Chicago where he lives with his mother, Jesse's ex-wife.At the airport, Hank tells his dad that it was the best summer of his life which only makes their parting more difficult. Jesse wants to be closer to Hank but his ex-wife will not permit it and he discusses with Celine the possibility of her giving up her job as an environmental advocate and moving to Chicago, a topic that carries with it a great deal of baggage and is a bone of contention during the course of the film. As in the first two films, the third consists mostly of extended rapid-fire conversations between Jesse and Celine as well as with Jesse's literary friends with whom they are spending six weeks at a writer's workshop in Greece.At an outdoor luncheon at 85-year-old Patrick's (Walter Lassally) villa, talk centers on a wide range of subjects such as whether books are still viable in the modern age of computers, how different age groups relate to love and romance, and other relevant topics that sound \"deep.\" To make sure we know that the film is \"edgy,\" Linklater sprinkles the dialogue with cutesy references to sex, orgasm, and genitalia that feels as if one has wandered into a high school cafeteria rather than a gathering of artists and intellectuals. As Jesse and Celine walk back to the luxury hotel that their friends have given them as a gift for the night, tension surfaces and they begin to tease each other and question each other's commitment.When they arrive at the hotel, the good feelings of the afternoon have dissipated into bickering about who is at fault for everything that is wrong with their lives. Dangerously close to gender stereotyping, Jesse is depicted as the strong and calm one while Celine is shown as borderline hysterical. Talking at each other rather than to each other, Jesse again tells Celine about his regret at not being closer to his son and thinks about how he could fix the problem, but never acknowledges that it was his choice to leave his family. Celine shouts about how he abandoned her when the girls were born and calls him passive-aggressive to which Jesse responds by telling her she is \"a crazy woman.\" After Celine complains about how her creativity has been stifled because of the lack of time she has to do anything other than to be a housewife, the quarreling deteriorates into a tug of war to the point where Celine walks out of the room. Before Midnight restates the conventional wisdom about the spark in relationships inevitably fading with the years but the result feels more like an artistic concept than an organic experience with the characters having sacrificed their reality to the formula. Some critics have said that the no-holds-barred outbursts in the film are examples of adult behavior and are \"proof that the couple has finally achieved a true intimacy.\" To me, however,though well-done and engaging, Before Midnight is a primer on what does not work in a relationship. A relationship should not be a power struggle but a partnership based on mutual support in which the partners truly listen to each other without always having to be right. Contrary to the film's message, love does not have to die in order to be reborn, but can be created newly each day. That does not mean that all problems magically disappear, but only that you are willing to include any condition or any circumstance of the relationship as part of your experience of love. Here's looking at the next sunrise.",

Deply's Celine brought to mind a stern Hillary Clinton and Hawke's Jesse a bumbling, clueless dude. Bill Clinton? Hawke's angst over abandoning his teenage son in favor of this new woman and his new family will certainly resonate with so many men today. He used an example of Deply being late to pick up their young daughters from school and the panic she felt to explain how he feels that about his son all the time. Well played.The BadNo magic between the two, so little affection. The bickering and \"issues\" would have been easier to digest had there remained some kind of magical, lyrical love between them. We could have felt the tug between true passion and the burdens of real life and real conflict. As it sits now, all we have are the conflicts. Just stop, is what I was thinking.But Maybe . . . It could be that when the next installment arrives in 2022, the couple will have fallen love again. The daughters will be 16, perhaps in boarding school, the son from a first marriage will be a young man and maybe even presenting a grandchild. Who know if all of these characters will be alive? There could be a death, no? If the couple falls in love again, or becomes bonded again over tragedy, we could look back at this film as commentary on the burden that raising children is to a romantic relationship. If the couple are still together 9 years hence, and able to love more and bicker less, perhaps even showing compassion toward each other, we could all say: see, it's best to endure the tough times and let the love return.However, if this is to be the last movie of the series, not good.

They made her out to be sulky and angry and somewhat fake. Julia Delpy is very talented but this one is a miss for her. The enigmatic Celine in the first movie is gone, instead now we are presented with a garden-variety resentful, know-it-all, and condescending wife, who would not let up even after repeated attempts by Jesse to calm her down and cheer her up. The Celine embodiment here is all wrong and has lost the magic of her character and their passion from the first one. This is a movie, and it should allow you an escape from mundane life, not to be thrust watching a couple continuously bicker because the wife wouldn't stop nagging with her drama!",

I was, I am delighted to say, hopelessly wrong. This is simply filmmaking at its best and totally against the run of cgi, s&v, gross-out comedy etc. Simply an adult film made by and for adults about that most hackneyed plot the Human Condition. It has to be one of the most economical films ever made as there can't be more than 20 shots throughout. So accomplished are the trio that they are able to shoot up to thirty minutes in one take witness the drive from the airport, the walk through the town, the hotel room, three marathon scenes kept afloat simply by conversation - if you wanted to be superficial you could say it was My Dinner With Andre with a mixed couple as opposed to two males. Delpy is still gorgeous despite making absolutely no effort; she wears two dresses throughout, neither a designer outfit, lets her hair fall where it may and generally looks like any typical forty-something mother of two except, of course that most forty-something mothers of two are not dropdead gorgeous. As most of the comments I've read here have noted if there is any justice (alas, no) this movie should walk away with Best Actress, Best Actor, Best Screenplay, Best Director, Best Film.

Their roles & relationship were so complex it was as if I was viewing a marvelous display of fireworks over the alluring skyline of a wicked train wreck. This story unquestionably needed a third film. I was prepared for an emotional roller coaster as I selected the film for viewing. What I did not account for was Ethan's progression as an actor, and his ability to bring it to this character. He magnified Jesse's charm while also amplifying his toxic masculinity. This is the first film I have ever given a negative rating to for the actors acting too well. The way Ethan was able to dominate every conversation and argument was astounding. After the hotel scene I felt like I needed a shower just to wash off the heaviness of the gas lighting that took place. Along with this, they took a strong independent feminist that was Julie, and made her submit to his masculinity and compromise all of her beliefs for the sake of love and family.I give this film a 3/10 because it took these characters with so much potential, and made them into the things they hate. I understand this is the point of the trilogy, but I can't help myself in giving the rating. It was heartbreaking. Julie deserved so much better in this storyline. I will play this trilogy for my girls when they become older and become interested in boys. It will stand as a reminder of everything to avoid when entering a relationship.

As a fan of Sunrise and Sunset (the latter upon viewing it several times), it was hard to swallow what was served in Midnight.Delpy and Hawke are both good actors, and they have returned to their respective roles well, but why has Celine turned into a bitter old woman, and Jesse into a selfish ass? They both displayed the seeds of these traits in Sunset, but in Midnight, all redeeming features have been deleted.Both characters could have walked out of a bad American sit-com. Enter a frustrated artist wife, who worries incessantly about her body and mothering skills, and is unfulfilled in numerous ways. Then add a guilt-ridden run-away father who talks like a teenager and acts supercilious in arguments. It's hard to like either of them, but you end up siding with Jesse, because Celine has become so hard as to be unbearable.The scenes in which Celine plays the bimbo, ostensibly to attract Jesse, are cringe-worthy. The final scene therefore deals a death blow to the series. The Celine of Sunrise and Sunset would never have dumbed herself down to be found attractive, probably not even in jest. She is out of love with Jesse completely, and it would have been more honest for her to suggest a permanent separation! Jesse on his part seems largely contemptuous of Celine, making numerous remarks about how he puts up with her, as if he's the only person in the world who could love her, and as if he has no qualities that might make him irksome at times.Content-wise, the conversations in this latest 'Before' film are of much lower quality. Gone are the deep revelations of inner truths, the pretentious thoughts of youth, and in its place are platitudes and sex jokes, with a great deal of sexism added. It's like Before meets American Pie, and it hurts.Better it is to imagine Jesse and Celine had a one night stand in Vienna, and a short fling in Paris, for Jesse to return to his son in the US.Linklater, here's a deal: I'll forget all about Midnight, and you'll stop murdering this series.",

It's not necessary to see the first two movies to follow Before Midnight. The movie features long takes (sometimes not cutting for 10 minutes at a time) the story takes place over a day, and dialogue and naturalistic acting are paramount. There's a complexity to their characters and relationship that refuses to fully romanticize or demonize them. It's something of a realist romance in (deliberate) contrast the beautiful settings. Careful viewers will notice a handful of ironies that ground the romance in reality. I won't give examples here, or go into the details that keep me from giving this a 9 or 10 as many critics do. The movie is the proverbial breath of fresh air, though. I'd say that the main weakness of the movie stems from its strengths, in that when artists set out to make something so true to human nature (as opposed to fluffier rom coms or Nicholas Sparks movies) it's easy to hear the (few) false notes that are played. There are very few; and unless you're jonesing for a mere-nonsense 'entertainment' movie, this movie should appeal to practically anyone.",

There aren't enough negative adjectives to describe \"Before Midnight\"---but I'll try. You can't really complain about the plot in this film because there isn't one. A better title for this two-hour gas-fest would be \"The Nitpickers\" because that just about sums up this movie in a nutshell. The two hours of torture that Ms. Delpy and Mr. Hawke put themselves through is only matched by the suffering of the audience. Viewers hoping for any type of distraction from the \"action\" between the two leads will be disappointed. The bickering and arguing continues nonstop throughout the entire screen time without any respite. But viewers at least can walk away from this experience and realize what level of talent it takes to actually make a good movie, whether it be a comedy or a drama, because there is positively none exhibited here. There was no sense of \"reality\" here either, despite what some earlier reviewers raved about. In fact, ranting and raving has everything to do with the interchange between Delpy and Hawke. They cover a lot of ground on a variety of subjects, but end up saying nothing significant about any of them. Their conversations give new meaning to the word \"pretentious.\" If two people like this actually existed, they would've killed themselves or each long before they ever took a vacation to a Greek island. These folks don't need a marriage counselor; they need loaded pistols at twenty paces. Depending on one's point of view, either Delpy or Hawke could easily win the award for most aggravating person ever in a film. I would cast my vote for Delpy simply because her nerve-wracking incessant whining will never be duplicated (not that anyone in their right mind would want to duplicate it). And this is a trilogy? It's more like three strikes and you're out. Heaven help the film industry if this movie in any way portends its future. To put it bluntly, unless you're a certified masochist, avoid this horror-show at all costs. You will never get these two hours of your life back.

For me, it was a Sunday.I recently sat down, and travelled, to see all three BEFORE movies, which ended with Before Midnight in theatres. It was extremely nice to be able to see Before Sunrise, Before Sunset and Before Midnight all consecutively verses over almost two-decades of filmmaking.Maybe this gave me a different perspective. I loved the first movie, admired the follow-up and felt Before Midnight, while a nice send up to the two decade journey of two characters, kind of, hard to watch.That's not to say it wasn't good and nice to see these two lovebird's conclusions. And it ended (spoiler, sorry) just as they predicted throughout the franchise. I, too, saw the signs and learned a lot about how these two soul mates would view life in the future. But, the fantasy was gone. The reality really hit hard.Following the wonderfully ambiguous finale of the second chapter, Before Sunset, you learn that these two humans have, in fact, finally got together and stayed that way. In fact, they now have children of their own. The movie follows the same staple pattern of the first two, whereas the camera follows the couple, Jesse and Celine, around as they converse in under 24-hours. Only, now they're dealing with the consequences of making sure they are together.This movie relies less on romantic love and more on realistic situations for couples. It's a reality check for those who fantasize about romantic encounters. While it's still rich in great dialogue, it's such a culture shock for the hope of the first two movies.Yeah, I guess, at times, the sh|t's gotta get real, but maybe I loved the love story of the first two more and found myself engulfed in the fantasy of true love.

            "content": "Before Midnight (2013) *** 1/2 (out of 4)The third film in Richard Linklater's series continues the relationship between Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and Celine (Julie Delpy). I would give more details about the actual plot, the way they meet up and so on but this here would pretty much give away some spoilers that I'm sure fans of the last film don't want to know going in. After all, we've been waiting nearly a decade for this latest installment so why take away the surprise before seeing the film? I will say that this film doesn't come close to the major that was the last but we really shouldn't blame this film because it was going to be hard to top that. With that said, fans should really enjoy this third installment as once again the director and two stars do a wonderful job in regards to the performances, the dialogue and just the way they let the film and characters roll. I think the strongest aspects of this episode is that it's a lot darker than the previous two. There are certainly a few things that are going to shock people or at least catch them off guard and I personally think these moments contain a lot of raw emotion and heart. It's not easy fulfilling whatever notions people have about these characters going into the movie. I mean, have fans not wondered what was going on in these two people's lives since we last saw them? I'm sure fans have thought up their own things so then getting to see and hear about what's actually happened could always contain a bit of disappointment but for the most part the film delivers. It should go without saying but both Hawke and Delpy are perfect together and you really do feel as if they're a couple who have been in and out of each other's lives for nearly two decades. Linklater does a very good job at keeping the film moving at a longer running time and the cinematography is top-notch as usual. The only real negative moment for me is a rather long sequence where a larger group of people are talking. I know what they were going for here but I just don't think it worked well enough and it took us away from out two characters.

            "content": "There is a moment in Before Sunset where Ethan Hawke's Jesse tells Julie Delpy's Celine that he wrote a fictional version of their story where they rendezvous in Vienna and end up not liking each other. It appealed to her sense of realism. Indeed, she later touched on it again. Walking out of the theater I knew Before Midnight more or less answered that vital question.Here we add nine freaking years to the previous 13 or so hours of their time together. So, understandably, Jesse and Celine are not as we left them. Bearing the increasingly heavy chains of life's complications, they still love to bat around ideas and make each other laugh. More importantly, they really want to understand each other and be understood.For Jesse, seeing little of his son Hank (now 13 and played by Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick) is the unacceptable cost of being with Celine, mishandling his separation, and having a vindictive, dejected ex-wife. Desperately wanting to be consistently present in Hank's life, their latest farewell is the final straw. He and Celine had been in regular contact with Hank for two years in New York City, but Celine's very complicated pregnancy with twins (Ella and Nina, now 7-years-old and played by Jennifer and Charlotte Prior respectively) made it imperative that she be close to her mother in Paris.Jesse obviously did the right thing by staying with Celine and he knows it, yet he shoulders the guilt of an absentee father and externalizes it. Celine, though not exactly an innocent bystander, is subjected to unfair manipulation. Generally quite reasonable as to the father/son question, she is, by my reading, unconsciously passive-aggressive about it. The unarguable fact is that a move to Chicago (where Hank presently lives with his mother) would amount to babysitting every other weekend for want of joint custody. As for Hank, he gets on well with Jesse, but there is a definite sense of detachment. He doesn't even look over his shoulder as he turns the corner out of sight at the airport.Jesse is otherwise very good: he is leading the life of a successful writer (three books out and a fourth in the works) with Celine--the unquestionable love of his life--as his wife and a good mother to their twin daughters who are healthy (and of course dressed differently). He just somehow figured on Hank living with them. By thinking through his crisis aloud, Celine (no longer a closed book) says in a half-kidding way that it is the beginning of the end for them.It is nice to see them interacting socially for the first time in the marvelous, detail-rich dinner scene. Everyone contributes more or less evenly as the conversation ranges from artificial intelligence to gender differences to various interesting perspectives on love and romance. The trio of Linklater, Hawke and Delpy pour themselves into making the absolute most of these naturalistic films, and it shines through palpably. It is interesting to learn that Hawke and Delpy wrote a lot of each other's dialogue. This happens to be the funniest of the three films, in my opinion. Great music again, too! Celine, feeling disconnected from Jesse as to her own stresses, wants out of their planned night together, but irrevocable arrangements had been made on their behalf. Walking together as we had come to know them, their natural chemistry is evident in short order. Celine acknowledges this while remarking in a downplayed way that she doesn't feel the connection at times. Jesse responds in jest, unaware of it as a crisis that will soon converge with his own. They enter their hotel room feeling good about the whole shebang. Then Hank calls again and things gradually spiral downward into a serious case of love on the rocks for these well-meaning veritable soulmates in the southern Peloponnese of Greece.Celine is more complicated than Jesse--who is not about to leave her and the girls for Hank in Chicago--and even less inclined to contentment in life. The professionally-minded activist with little in the way of a maternal instinct has been saddled with the aforementioned twins and is essentially trying to balance domestic mundanities with her environmental work in the ineffectual non-profit sector. She no longer finds time for music, her creative outlet. By contrast, Jesse to her mind takes his easygoing novelist life to the highfaluting hilt. Though wonderfully good-natured to be sure, envy continues to be a problem of hers. She respects his intelligence, but slights his work, and being the inspiration for his first two intimate novels does not sit well with her at all. She also feels every day of her 41 years and even accuses him of infidelity, as if only to clear the air.The backfiring of a wind turbine project has her set on working for the government again despite doubts. Not knowing she considers it a \"dream job\" of sorts, Jesse rouses Celine's feminist spirit by suggesting she perhaps forgo the position for something in Chicago. Celine quotes someone in earnest: \"Women explore for eternity in the vast garden of sacrifice.\" It took Jesse's out and out mockery of her innermost feminism to later warrant her saying she doesn't think she loves him anymore.In the final scene we find Celine understandably despondent and Jesse appropriately self-reproachful. Employing a time travel fantasy reminiscent of that which convinced her to see Vienna with him 18 years before, he realizes his failure despite desirous efforts to understand her. By reconciling herself to him, Celine sees in his sincerity the very magic she spoke of in Vienna. It could not come full circle more wonderfully.Their protracted relationship continues to be the very height of my cinematic experience, so it pleases me greatly to know that the door is being left wide open for a fourth film and hopefully more. Richard Linklater, Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke will know if it is right.",

This movie is just plain dull, that's it, you must not go further. The movie try to show us the difficulties of love in the 40, but they succeed only in the boring and the routine; the try to enchant us with Greece, but they didn't miss a single opportunity of the common image clich\u00e9; they want to show us how the beauty can't withstand the harshness of the routine, but in doing this they ruin the beauty, they ruin the wit, the love, the affinities, and they transform the harshness in pure stupidity. This movie is just a failure.",

Because people think oh this is like a *real life* horrible relationship - that makes it amazing. The two spend the entire movie arguing. Celine spends literally the whole movie marginalizing everything that Jesse thinks and feels.She is not only bitter the whole time but she is outright rude, insensitive and cruel in some parts. Straight cruel. All the while, Jesse continuously tries to please her and compliment her. It's sickening. Celine's role in this film makes me downright angry. She just invents reasons to be mad and you spend an entire movie listening to a crazy, jealous, bitter old woman.I cannot summarize enough my complete and utter disappointment in this installment of the series.",

I thought that by the time Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and Celine (Julie Delpy) hit their Forties they would have matured into some semblance of a meaningful relationship, but their two hour banter between themselves and among friends on a vacation in Greece is downright excruciating. And once again, it's Celine who initiates excessive use of the 'F' word and gets in the gutter on topics ranging from her first boyfriend to Jesse's attempt to reconcile a relationship with a son from a first marriage. Jesse had it right when he squirmed over her 'can't win' question that went 'What about me would you change?'. Guys, if you want to answer correctly, you have to say 'Nothing' and stick with it no matter what. Otherwise you'll have to endure an hour of endless recrimination over everything that's occurred since the beginning of the relationship. Then again, if you answer 'Nothing', you'll be badgered into coming up with something that you'll regret in any case, and if you're not as creative as Jesse with an ability to think on your feet, you're cooked. It was with a great sense of relief when the final credits rolled because most everything I had to sit there and listen to was nailed by the Greek guy Stafanos (Panos Koronis) commenting on Jesse's idea for his next novel, and suitably describing the way I felt about this picture - \"Well, I don't know..., sounds pretentious\".",

            "content": "All right, maybe I'm a little jaded by this point, but the final installment of Richard Linklater's installment just didn't work for me. Or, at least, it didn't work nearly as well as the previous two, which were near masterpieces. Before Midnight is a talkfest, which is not a problem, but it's a boorish talkfest, which sort of is. It has moments of absolute brilliance surrounded by what feel like epochs of people arguing and giving no ground. It may be realistic, but it's sure uncomfortable to watch at times.We catch up with Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and Celine (Julie Delpy) in Greece, where they are vacationing with their twin daughters. They are returning to a friend's house after dropping off Jesse's son at the airport - you might recall he married and had a kid between the first and second movies - and converse while their girls sleep in the back. Jesse is still the rakish, if unshaven, man he's always been, and Celine is still utterly beautiful. But whereas in the previous movies there had been love lost and found, here there may be love lost, period; there is something afoot in their relationship. There are many areas of stress, many complications in their lives, and from the beginning the viewer suspects a break up is around the corner.The movie is a bit of a cross between Scenes from a Marriage and Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? Well, more precisely, to Scenes from a Mall, Woody Allen's homage to Bergman's Marriage. There's a lot of talking, and some deep-seated feelings are revealed, some inadequacies and vulnerabilities laid bare. Is the relationship on the rocks? It may depend on your own prejudices. I'm probably prejudiced to take Jesse's side, because for the life of me I saw him as the victim (to be fair, only for the most part) and Celine as the aggressor. I'm not quite sure how to process that; do I feel that way because that's what I was seeing or because it was what I expected or could better relate to? I'm not sure. But I can tell you this for certain: each conversation between Celine and Jesse seemed to veer from tenderness to viciousness quicker than a jackrabbit doing handstands while on meth. It became hard to witness after a while, because Hawke and Delpy are both so good that one was immediately invested in their prospects. For me, that meant I would go from being joyful at the love each obviously (still) felt for one another to cringing at the sight of their malicious bickering.The enduring question arises: if either had the chance to do it over, would Celine get on the train with Jesse, and would Jesse ask Celine to get on the train with him? We get conflicting answers, as if each is testing the other's fidelity while professing not to care. One minute they're happy to grow old together, the next each is questioning the other's motives. For Jesse, he feels that his son's childhood is slipping away and wishes he were more a part of it (in Chicago, rather than France); for Celine, she has a chance to take a better job with a man she dislikes but is caught between doing something for herself and doing something for the family in general and Jesse in particular. The bouncing back and forth between melodrama and quiet, romantic interplay is jarring, even if it is realistic. I'm certainly not saying this is how many relationships go, not at all; it's just that I wouldn't want to witness one of these euphemistically named discussions in person, either. It's not entertaining, even if it's real, like eavesdropping on an old married couple across the hall while they argue about duvets or table runners or something equally mundane, only with the conviction of Patrick Henry asking for liberty.As with the earlier films, the movie focuses almost exclusively on conversations between our two leads, with two exceptions: one is a group dinner in which (surprise) truths are revealed, and the other is two scenes in one, with Jesse talking to the men in the film and Celine to the women. Every scene is a cornucopia of philosophies, some earthy and some pretentious, some with hidden meanings within the plot's framework, some existing just to exist. One needs to have one's head on a swivel to keep up with the changes in tone and the number of intentionally misunderstood phrasings.The sheer poetic chemistry between Hawke and Delpy remains palpable as ever. Delpy is outstanding - lovely, sparkling, and passionate. Hawke, who's made quite a name for himself as a scruffy Gen-X nonslacker, is also superb. And Linklater's direction is surehanded. It's just that, in the end, it feels as if nothing has changed, that the previous two hours meant nothing to the characters. The movie took me on such a emotional ride that, rather than be enthralled, I was exhausted and spent by its middling conclusion.",

Just saw Before Midnight, the third, which pummels us with how beautiful, wonderful, sensitive, wise, soulful, charming, earthy, tasteful, piercingly perceptive, honest, brilliant, talented, witty, caring, committed, and utterly, ineffably perfect its protagonists are. Of course they are! Everyone says so, including not only the \"distinguished\" British author, the gorgeous young lovers, and the attractive Greek couple they spend their vacation with, but the woman at the airport who asks for both of their signatures on Jesse's book, \"because it would mean so much to my husband.\" All on a postcard-perfect Greek island, no less.My apologies to both Erich Rohmer and the recent Woody Allen for ever having complained about how cute and perfect their characters can be. Linklater trumps them easily, to the point I was hoping it was all supposed to be a goof on terminal bourgeois whiteness (one longs to put the script in the hands of a reincarnated Luis Bunuel to see what he'd do with it). There's some kind of serious theme rolling around here in the long conversations, the suggestions of how our younger selves speak to our older selves, etc., no doubt further explored in Boyhood. But the sexual politics are about as profound as Men Are from Mars Women Are From Venus, and there's nothing much to care about in Jesse and Celine's big fight, because by that point in the film, we don't like either of them enough to care.Before Midnight represents a colossal lapse of self-awareness by Linklater, and an even more embarrassing load of self-absorption from its stars and co-authors.",

This third installment isn't as unexpected, I don't think, but it certainly doesn't disappoint. These films have become, as a whole, one of the greatest of all cinematic statements, one that truly understands how people work and the way history effects the future. This film finds Jesse and Celine, now together for the past decade, in Greece at the end of a summer vacation. Jesse is saying goodbye to the son he had with his ex-wife, and on the way back from the airport he thinks aloud that he could probably be a bigger part of his son's life if he lived back in the United States (the couple and their twin daughters reside in Paris usually). This begins an argument between the couple that eventually turns quite bitter. Through the course of the film, we learn everything that has happened in the intervening ten years. There's also a great scene, unlike the other two movies, where the couple converses with other people, all of whom have their own theories on love and life. As with the previous two installments, this is incredibly lovely. Both Hawke and Delpy are brilliant. As with Sunset, they co-wrote the screenplay with Richard Linklater. Linklater has made plenty of good films in his life, but this series will be his legacy. It will also be Hawke's and Delpy's. And it is to be included amongst the best things the cinema has ever produced.",

The difference this time is that the characters aren't falling in love, or re-discovering what made them initially attracted in the Brief Encounter sense. Now they're married, have two kids, and have the struggles of what married couples deal with (well, some of them anyway) , a kid from Hawke's previous marriage that he has to send off back to his home at the start of the film (they're in vacation in Greece, after all), and the conflict that this will pose, which is both somewhat minor AND great at the same time, if that makes sense.And just the, you know, what happens to a couple when they've been around each other for a long, LONG period of time. The love is still there, but the fire has to keep burning. At both ends. And is there love, is the question? Can these two stay connected? Who will win in an argument where it's more about being right than full-on logic? (which makes up the third act and boy-o-boy, watch out Ingmar Bergman for your title as King of the Marriage Dramas!) I loved this movie so dearly, for the time it takes giving us these characters anew, and how they speak like real people, like grown-ups! What a concept in modern cinema! The conversations here, including (breaking, in a great way, the tradition in 'Before' movies of it just being Jesse and Celene) new characters in this Greece setting talking about life, the universe and everything that matters \u2013 but especially love and relationships \u2013 are witty, engaging, not too high-concept but not dumbed down to any extreme.These three films, but especially this one which, like Woody Allen's 2013 entry Blue Jasmine, shows a maturer sensibility, some learned-ness about the state of being with a person, and being yourself around that person, and that there can be humor in the process. In fact the most pointed and spot-on message in the film I took away with, mostly with Hawke's performance and character, is that the ability to make your significant other laugh and be amused is really the key to it all (in a moment of desperation Jesse even says flat out, \"I'm trying to make you laugh!\") And that, too, is an asset as this is the funniest of the 'Before' series, particularly in that last bitter act where they hash it out in a hotel room. If you can't laugh, what's the point of it all?",

You are!\" Jesse (Ethan Hawke) to Celine (Julie Delpy)Nine years after they met in Before Sunrise, Jesse and Celine have moved into the relative craziness of early middle age, with two children and careers making demands that threaten their love. Unlike most Hollywood romances but like My Dinner with Andre, the plot is all talk, an American take on the maturity of European cinema. The chatter, at times homage to early screwball comedies, never grates and gives an authentic feel, as if we were overhearing conversation at the next table.As the committed couple ramps up the intensity of the disagreement, which starts with his veiled attempt to have her leave her career in Paris to move with him to Chicago to be near his son, the language takes on universal meaning to the extent that most 40 something's in the audience can appreciate the challenges children inevitably bring to romance.Director Richard Linklater, Delpy, and Hawke collaborated on the script, and it shows. The acting superbly achieves a verisimilitude, an organic quality that makes it all believable, and the direction keeps the camera simple in order to focus on the powerful words. Linklater et al. have taken us over the years from the heady days of romance to the sobering moments of reality.Yet, I have a feeling this couple can survive even much worse than this film's skirmishes into the blinding light of experience. One friend describes Jesse's recent book as \"a better book\u2014it's so much more ambitious.\" \"Ambitious\" is the name of this film's game and one for which I can't wait for the next inning.Celine: I feel close to you.

Jesse dumped his wife for his French girl and Celine just hates everything.I'm also rather unconvinced Jesse would have left his first wife. I can see them having a fling after Before Sunset, but it seems a bit hard to believe he would have left her considering the chaos this would cause their son, especially considering Jesse's rather relaxed personality.",

Abrasive characters to whom the viewer cannot bond, pointless, gratuitous sex-speak, irritatingly filmed in front of the two actors as they drove or walked toward the camera, bickering non-stop for the entire length of the film. We just wanted them to shut up. Somebody could have filmed us walking around for two hours, talking randomly, and it would have been a much better movie. Why do we want to hear these people spew dysfunctional drivel? Yeah, we get the message, but what a brutal delivery for the viewer to have to endure.

But some of the acting, and some of the direction and editing, and the cinematography is good enough to raise it to 6 stars. My main overarching complaint with this film, and the two which preceded it, is that I just wasn't impressed with or even entertained by the dialog. Some of it is insightful and clever and relevant but it just seems to keep repeating in different words, in different modes, the same sentiment. So when the chatter - the endless, circuitous chatter that isn't one half as clever as it likes to think it is - finally subsides we are left with two very attractive, semi intelligent narcissists marveling at the tedium of their lives. I was initially fascinated by the intensity of their irksome self interest, but I soon tired of this. Delpy is breathtakingly gorgeous and a supremely talented actress and Ethan Hawke is likewise attractive and a genuinely compelling thespian, but the self fascinated, often tedious discourse was just too calculated, contrived and manipulative for no other reason than to impress me with its audacious theatricality. I was craving a genuine, mundane, real moment that wasn't so emphatically genuine, mundane, and real.The repeated times I audibly uttered such words as \"Oh c'mon!\" and \"Really?!\" and \"A-Doy!\" make me think I may possibly benefit from a few sessions with a gifted relationship therapist because every utterance of desire and disillusionment in this talk junkie's dream had me contemptuous of the very idea of anyone ever again attempting to pair up. I know this opinion is the opposite of popular but I must be candid and frank and honest with you good readers. In short - not for me.",

They are not overly attractive. Hello, shave or don't but that stubble thing looks awful. I hate it when good movies go bad.

The point is that today, nobody wants to watch a thirteen minutes scene from the same angle (the scene in the car for example), with a couple boring as hell, talking about their personal life and the kids, and their prospects, and the kids again, and so on. The thing that run on the screen, was not a film.

The third installment in the series destroys everything that you loved and cared about the two most fascinating and enchanting characters that were painstakingly built on a refreshing premise of two normal people exploring a world of stuff over a string of conversations over exotic locations.The Celine and Jesse you came to grow so close are nowhere to be seen here. Its appalling to see how poorly written these characters are this time around. The 9 years since the last movie seems to have ripped the soul out of these two beloved characters reducing them to a bickering, bitter and neurotic dime-a-dozen couple. The topic of most discussions are so bizarre that it appears a bunch of 18 year olds were forced to write a script from a perspective of 40 somethings. And why would they choose to mould these two in this fashion? What happened to the slightly larger than life motivations of these characters, that spirit, that aura that they had? Jesse and Celine were always special people. There is nothing special about the dried and drained personas that are on show here this time. There is absolutely no romance, no mystery, no nothing.And yeah the music sucks. One of the interesting things in Greece is a dog and a bunch of goats. The whole setup has a forced feeling.As I walked out of the screening I realized I didn't care anymore whether they will make a new installment. Jesse and Celine are forever lost to the realm of banality and mediocrity.What have you done Mr Linklater?",

As I expected, this installment is a great movie, both as stand-alone and as the third part of the series.In this chapter, Jesse and Celine deal with the inevitable problems and disappointments of approaching middle age. They are both still very attractive and well-articulated, but now they carry the burden of responsibilities and are starting to consider the idea of their final demise (although hopefully still far for both of them).This time they walk and talk in Greece, during the last day of a six-weeks holiday. Jesse is dropping off his son Hank to the airport. We learn that Jesse harbors some guilty feeling about having somehow \"abandoned\" the son from his first marriage, although Hank looks very well adjusted. Outside the airport, Celine waits for Jesse, their twin-daughters sleeping in the car.Their first conversation takes place while they drive back to their friend's house. They talk about the burden of parenthood, work problems and relocating to the US. No flirting, but still excellently executed. The second long conversation is at dinner, with their friends. It touches several subjects, among which the different perception of love, according to your age. Since the age of their friends varies from early 20s to late 60s, the conversation is very compelling.Then Jesse and Celine walk to their hotel, where their friends insisted they stay to get one night of privacy and romance. We understand clearly that nowadays they hardly ever have conversations that are not utilitarian, which makes the situation very realistic. Once they reach the hotel, drama ensues in the shape of a major argument.Anybody who quarreled with a loved one will undoubtedly admire the skilled way in which the argument is presented: the anger about trivial matters, the resentment about past events, the illogical change of topics.... During this exchange, their national idiosyncrasies are exploited in a subtle, yet funny way (Celine cannot pronounce an English word, etc...). I took Jesse side, as he seemed a bit more grounded, while Celine, in all her French arrogance crossed the border from shrill to almost hysterical (although she had some good points).But no matter how bad things get with them, I still hope they will stick together and will transform their passionate love into a mature feeling. Despite their denial, they are still giving hope to all the romantics about the possibility of everlasting love.",

She also looked as if she was created by man, who hates women and who gave her all the bad qualities without any reason for them being there. I could not emphasize with her one bit. I also felt bad for Jesse, because he was practically a perfect husband and he did everything: he apologised, he tried to cheer her up, he tried to seduce her, he gave her compliments, he took action and tried to make peace. Basically he showed us, that he could do so much better and she doesn't desserve him one bit. In the first movie they both were equals and I loved it. Here, instead of maturing, Celine degraded. Jesse stayed more or less the same as in the second film. Also, what I loved about the first two movies overall, was that characters mostly just talked, without any obvous conflict. Or in other words, they only conlficted with their circumstances. So the plot was just one flowing dialogue and I loved it, it was simple and realistic in it's own sence. Here, on the other hand, they conflicted with each other, but the conflict wasn't written well, I still don't know what they were arguing about and what was behind all this. Because nothing was. They just wanted to scream at each other, I suppose. Especially Celine. I wish I could unwach this, because of all the negative energy it has vometed on me. If you still haven't, don't.

One gets used to this trend and tolerates it if the rest of the movie is any good. If this is the liberal version of true love then marriage would cease to exist. The only reasonable thing in this movie was that at least it showed the angst that divorce causes when it comes to children.What a mess has been made of marriage by the left and the children harmed by self indulgent characters like these are an example for all to see. If one wants to see true artistry about the complexity of marital relationships and family watch Winter Sleep by the Turkish Director Ceylan.

Loved it very much. It really affected me.I thought I had seen Before Sunset, but after watching this latest Before Midnight, I'm not sure if I ever actually saw the second movie or just read about it. I didn't really remember (or know) what had happened 10 years ago so it took a while for me to get in track, why were they in Greece, whose children were they, did they get married at some point, did they divorce at some point and who? In the beginning there's a long drive where Jesse and Celine babble away, but you can't really say whether they have been married for 10 years or if they're a fairly new couple. Even tho well acted and maybe improvised, I'm not sure how realistic this was. It feels a bit shallow compared to the first movie.Like the first movie, this also consists mostly of talking. There's now a dinner table conversation with more people involved. That too is very well acted and scripted, but still the real relationship between Jesse and Celine is left somewhat cold.The movie then moves to it's finale, where Jesse and Celine are having a parents night out, children taken care by the other guys. They take a long walk again and go to a hotel where they're supposed to spend a romantic evening. But it all goes sour. The latter half of the movie is pretty much arguing that's not exactly fun to watch. At times you feel the situation is fixable, but eventually things go beyond the point of recovery - at least in my mind. They go to territory you don't go to in a normal argument. Things are said that can't be taken back.Still the movie ends in a relatively positive note, only it didn't feel realistic to me and left a very sour taste in my mouth. After all the arguing, I can't see things change back that easily. It's true that many of the events and the arguments preceding are somewhat realistic. What begins quite well in the hotel is quickly turned around by one phone call and a few wrong words. After that it's back to arguing and the mood is gone. That's how it may very well go.Like many have written, it's difficult to agree with Celine. She's just bitter and mean. Jesse on the other hand just keeps trying to crawl back and please her. Where as the first movie was something you'd definitely like to experience yourself as a young adult, this movie is something that you wouldn't want to experience as a forty something couple. There's the difference. It can be argued if this was a realistic movie or not - that depends on the viewer, but I can't see anyone actually wanting to be in the situation Jesse and Celine are in this movie.It's such a shame that a unique trilogy and movie romance without comparison ends in such a bitter way.",

This of course is not the happiest thought in the world, so we turn to films to lighten the mood and bring back the belief of romantic love (which I strongly adhere to).I have adored the beautiful dream-like story of Jesse and Celine ever since I saw Before Sunrise \u2015 meeting on a train in Vienna and taking a leap of faith, falling \"a little bit in love\" as they strolled around the city until morning where they vowed to meet again 6 months later. Of course we learn in Before Sunset that this did not happen, but fate brings them together once more, giving them a final chance at true love.Unfortunately, what I did not expect from Before Midnight was to be watching a couple I had admired for so long constantly argue for at least two thirds of this film, leaving a bitter taste in my mouth as I left the cinema. Agreed, the acting of course was undeniably good and the script was as always clever, funny and a little shocking, but this does not make up for the unsatisfying ending and having to see the couple I loved so much ridicule each other almost to death.Okay, maybe I have seen one too many fairy tales, but for me, watching something like this is completely illogical, especially since the main reason I go to see a movie in the first place is for escapism, not to get a reality check!",

What I can say, however, is that BEFORE MIDNIGHT is a really searching analysis of love in middle age between Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and C\u00e9line (Julie Delpy). Shot in a series of long takes against wonderful Grecian locations, director Richard Linklater explores the psyche of a couple who have spent a long time together, cannot get away from one another yet end up perpetually fighting. The film is a study in (mis-)communication; how words and sentences are perpetually misunderstood by both protagonists as they try to assert their particular points of view. This time the major cause of controversy is whether they should return to the United States to be with Jesse's teenage son Henry (even though they would only see him every other week due to custody arrangements), or whether they should continue to live in Paris with their seven-year-old twins. However the subjects don't really matter; what's more important is the way Linklater's camera unremittingly focuses on their facial expressions, as they experience a variety of emotions ranging from abhorrence to insecurity to loneliness.

Hawke and Delpy are now together, and struggling with the mundanity of raising children and actually living a life together, something that sounded much more romantic when fate and circumstances were keeping them apart. The acting is flawless, and so is the writing. The movie could so easily have become nothing more than two privileged white people moaning about their white person problems, but it instead gets right at the heart of what makes simple day-to-day living, even when nothing major is wrong with your life and even when you can admit that to yourself, so difficult.It doesn't hurt any that the film takes place amidst the gorgeous scenery of Greece.Oscar-winning cinematographer Walter Lasally (\"Zorba the Greek\") makes a brief cameo as a wise old author and an actress named Xenia Kalogeropoulou stops the show with a soliloquy about the melancholy an old woman feels over the memories of her dead husband.Grade: A+",

But instead, I got whiny, adolescents in adult bodies, with dialog cribbed almost entirely from vapid self-help books. Heck, if the author of \"Men Are From Mars, Women Are From Venus\" were listed as one of the screenwriters, I would not have been surprised. This film is actually quite an accomplishment. It's an uber-pretentious, windy, art house movie that actually never says anything of value or importance. It's not even absurdist. It doesn't cover new ground in terms of limning the angst of middle age and thwarted ambition. Instead, it was as if a committee of twenty-something creative writing majors got together and said, \"Hey, let's figure out how forty-year-old married couples think and act. They're all dispirited burnouts, right?\" Where do I start? Let's try the clumsy dialog. If the screenwriter were being paid by the word, I would better understand. But the movie is talk, talk, talk, talk without resolution. It's Waiting For Godot or a Woody Allen movie without the wit. It's Edward Albee without guts. And let's not dignify this as a deep exploration of character, either, for the two main characters are practically templates out of the screen writing academy: The wife fits the clich\u00e9 role of the bitter harpy with thwarted ambition, and the husband is a self-absorbed nebbish. And both of them just babble on endlessly without either listening to the other. What's more, the ending is so glib, it's apparent that the writers painted themselves into a corner and needed a cheap and facile way to extricate the characters. Seriously, the ending would even be an embarrassment to a Katherine Heigl romantic comedy. Lazy, lazy, lazy. In the end, it is a movie that is in love with the sound of its own voice. And although the two leads actually do a competent job with the script, one is never transported in this film. One is always aware that one is watching a movie. Even the incredibly long takes begin to work against it (That being said, kudos to the SteadiCam guy). Because all the ten-minute set pieces do is highlight how little is actually being said in all the blather. So I went to see a grownup movie and, halfway through, started wondering if it was too late to sneak into SuperMan a couple of theaters down. Yes, it was that tedious.",

And they have done exactly that.I would strongly urge fans of these movies to re-watch the first two installments, and then see this. They really do inform one another in rather remarkable ways.TECHNICALLY A SPOILER, BUT IT'S CLEAR THAT IT'S COMING AFTER THE FIRST FEW MINUTES Probably the most important thing that couples do is *fight*, and this movie includes the best, truest, and most honestly portrayed couples fight you will ever see. Each character alternates between insight and obliviousness, between playing fair and striking low blows, between adroitly defusing the tension and needlessly escalating it, and there's no good guy and no bad guy, just two achingly human, real people that we have grown to know so well and root so strongly for.SPOILER FOR WHETHER ANOTHER INSTALLMENT IS PROMISEDUnlike the first two, the movie ends with major unresolved issues between Jesse and Celine (the issues underlying the fight). It's thrilling to consider that the filmmakers will soon be plotting out the next nine years of their lives, including the resolution of those issues, and planning how the next screenplay will reveal what happened in casual dialogue, as they face the next key point in their relationship. 2022 cannot come too soon!",

WTF?!? Where was evidence of almost any self-mastery resultant of self-knowledge in a couple who were extensively ruminating on life, love & relationships in their early '20s? I experienced little to no growth in either @ all; whilst she 'joked' of him, 'Great - so I'm with an American teenager', her own behaviour was no better! Yet they were already out of their teens when they first met, so whassup with this arrested development? Initially rather bored, I became simply dismayed by the way their discussion devolved into an argument with truly toxic 'zingers' delivered from both sides in ways which made my jaw drop = THIS is the best True Lovers can do? Such disrespectful ways of dealing with each others' feelings\u0085I found it difficult to believe, they'd managed to stay together thru wind 'n weather THIS long?! Surely the first tenet of any successful relationship is knowing HOW to disagree - clearly, these two do not\u0085more to the point, too much damage was done in the course of just one discourse (while on an idyllic vacation, to boot!) to make their True Love relationship believable; in fact, THAT is my overall criticism of this movie, i.e. while the first two were thoroughly and effortlessly believable, this third one felt frighteningly contrived by comparison. Really and truly, the only saving Grace of this whole mess was Jesse's summation right at the end regarding the contrast between the fairy tale of true love, and the reality thereof ('THIS is what true love looks like' - or words to that effect); if THAT sentiment could only have been the core and central departure point, the rest might have come together as easily (seemingly) as the other two movies. As-is, it left me disappointed and depressed! ;( (\u0085& presumably @ THIS rate - unless they get into couples counselling toute suite! - 'divorced' by the time the next 9 years rolls around?!)",

The \"Before\" trilogy has been highly recommended by fans of the romance genre as good Valentine's Day viewing, etc. But, having watched all three films in the series, I can say that they were mostly a let-down, and this one was the worst! The two principle characters spend most of the time arguing, and when they aren't arguing, Julie Delpy's character (whom got on my nerves throughout) spent her time making wisecracks meant to knock Ethan Hawke's character down a peg, and at one point, she even tells him she doesn't love him anymore. How is that romantic?!This movie seems to have been made by people who don't believe in romance at all, and barely believe in love. Everything from birth, death, and divorce was talked about in this film, all in a very cold, logical way that left me resentful. In fact, this movie was SOOOO unromantic, that it is discovered in the middle of the film that though the leading characters had been together for years and now share children together, they never bothered to get married, and moreover, Julie Delpy seems to not care about Ethan Hawke's character's relationship with his son (her step-son), instead just interpreting all his worry as him trying to wreck her dreams!This movie is clinical, cold, and bitter- with only an occasional sweet bit of dialogue here and there (along with lots of vulgarities and rudeness).If you are looking for truly romantic films, try \"Room In Rome\" (2010), \"You've Got Mail\" (1998), or \"The Butcher's Wife\" (1991) to make you believe in true love and destiny.

Taking place nine years after the spectacular Before Sunset, Before Midnight is exactly what it looks like when a magical love story's happily ever after begins to show its age. It doesn't have the majesty or the warmth of the previous two movies, as it's instead infused with brutal realism and a more conflicting blend of optimism and pessimism.Written by the same trio of Julie Delpy, Ethan Hawke and the great director Richard Linklater, this third installment continues using the same formula of excellent dialogue and whimsical cinematography combined with flawless acting. Ethan Hawke's best performances have come from this series, as he combines confidence with fragile hidden vulnerability in a way that delivers nothing but sympathy from the audience. And then there's Julie Delpy, whose subtle angst is mixed with an incredible dosage of charm and sexuality that you just won't find in most actresses modern day. They both deserve Oscar nominations, they honestly do.Breathing life into the performances that transforms these characters into seemingly living and breathing people is the breathtaking writing, which never feels forced, never feels sugar-coated, and never feels like it was written first but instead spoken first and then translated into a script. And to top it off we have an accomplished director that has spent nearly two decades making this trilogy giving the movie all the necessary pacing, minimal movement, and breathing room to keep us engaged.In all honesty, I usually can't do films that just focus on dialogue and nothing more. But with the right characters, the right story, and the ability to keep you engaged, keep you guessing, keeps you begging for more, even a simple movie about two people in love just talking can become the most beautiful of films. And Linklater has done it three times with the same two characters\u2014and this will become one of the most underrated accomplishments in the history of motion pictures, I can guarantee it.Before Midnight will make you laugh, will make you cry, will make you think, will make you frustrated, and will leave you discussing everything that you had just witnessed in the previous 108 minutes.

            "review_title": "The thing with feathers",
            "content": "This is a review of \"Before Sunrise\", \"Before Sunset\" and \"Before Midnight\", three films by Richard Linklater.Released in 1995, \"Before Sunrise\" finds Ethan Hawke playing Jesse, a young American who's travelling across Europe. On his way to Vienna he meets Celine (Julie Delpy), a young woman on her way to Paris. From the moment out duo lock eyes, they're drawn to each other. They share a meal, savouring the conversation more than the food, and when they arrive in Vienna, Jesse persuades Celine to keep him company wandering the streets. Thus begins an unforgettable screen romance.Like most of Linklater's films, \"Sunrise\" is both dialogue heavy and boils down to a series of discussions or ruminations on life. Our duo talk incessantly, touching upon subjects which range from language and reincarnation to sexuality and religion. Some of it is cringe-worthy, but for the most part Linklater's dialogue rings true. His banter is casual, natural, lacking in artifice, and we at times feel like voyeurs, eavesdropping on the sort of \"unimportant\" dialogue that most films shy away from. But the film is sexy as well. Celine and Jesse crackle with electricity, and Linklater pays great attention to subtle shifts in body language. There's one scene where Jesse restrains himself from brushing away a stray lock of Celine's hair, and another wonderful moment in a music listening booth where our duo nervously avoid eye contact. Elsewhere the film indulges in numerous long takes, Linklater's gliding camera making the most of some gorgeous European locales, as he dips in and out of romantic alcoves and cosy spaces. Linklater's long steadicam takes lend \"Sunrise\" an \"energy\" and intimacy that many of his other films lack.Released in 2004, Linklater's \"Before Sunset\" is a sequel to 1995's \"Sunrise\". Equally good, the film joins Celine and Jesse almost a decade later. Speaking to both the mind and the heart, it finds our duo still obsessed with the night they first met, fell in love, and then somehow forgot to exchange contact details. This time around Jesse is in Paris to promote his new novel (he's now a writer), and it is Celine who tracks him down. Our couple then embark on an 80 minute chat, the fact that Jesse must leave on an afternoon flight tightening like a hang-man's noose around their conversations. The film then ends with a sequence which packs an emotional wallop.Hawke and Delpy so easily re-inhabit these characters, you have to wonder how much they're based on themselves. Simultaneously dopey and intelligent, their conversations cycle through hilarity, pain and misery. On the downside, both characters are obviously the product of an artist; Celine and Jesse are a couple of unashamed hipsters.Once again Linklater utilises long, uninterrupted takes, his gliding camera capturing vast chunks of banter and beautiful Parisian architecture. A few gentle flashbacks give glimpses of the original film, but we don't really need them. This story stands on its own as a second chance to change fate. And as is typical of Linklater, cinema's chief slacker-philosopher (at least since the death of Hal Ashby), Linklater has his film abstract several profound human truths, placing them all in a series of dialogue driven vignettes. In a way, Jesse and Celine become everyone and everything, and at times represent more than themselves.Released in 2013, \"Before Mightnight\" finds Jesse and Celine as a committed couple. It's been eight years since we last saw them, and they now live in Europe with twin girls of their own. Unsurprisingly, the puppy-love of the first two films has given way to middle-aged weariness, parental responsibility, regret and pragmatism. The film is somber, even pessimistic, and Linklater cleverly introduces several other characters who represent life and love at different stages, most notably an elderly writer and a young couple who conjure up images of Jesse and Celine's own romance almost two decades ago. If \"Sunset\" and \"Sunrise\" evoked Eric Rohmer, or Bresson's \"Four Nights of a Dreamer\", \"Midnight\" recalls Abbas Kiarostami and Rossellini's \"Journey to Italy\". Again dialogue heavy, and again reliant on long takes, the film is colder, harder and more caustic than its predecessors. Our couple now view everything with scepticism, and seem to exude a mood of grim acceptance and resignation. Most of the film's conversation revolve around death, career disappointment, transience, the world ending or technology's negative influences; the rants of a dying generation. At one point Celine even paints a dour image of the future, in which society devolves into \"masturbation and death\". In another, Jesse insists that man is \"99 percent automated\" and even goes so far as to denounce the concept of self-hood. Other conversations mock the way men measure accomplishments, and of course male obsessions with the phallus. Elsewhere an elderly man explains that couples are \"never one person, always two\". Unlike its predecessors, \"Midnight's\" sceptical of romance and even soul-mates. After a wholly contrived argument in a hotel room, a forced segment designed to set up another sequel, our duo then seem to patch up their problems, though you nevertheless suspect that this relationship has reached its end. Expect a possible fourth film to be about loneliness or separation.Early in \"Midnight\", Jesse reveals to us characters in his new book. One character lives in an unending, wondrous present (the very behaviour that brought Jesse and Celine together so many years ago), whilst another views all experiences as being \"second hand\". Jesse later talks about being \"lost in perception\" and introduces us to the \"patron saint of eyesight\", moments which exemplify Celie and Jesse's own anxieties. Both fantasise about different, better futures, and both are unsure of their partner's role in this desired world.8.5/10 \u2013 As strong as its predecessors, though the idea of middle class hipsters incessantly yapping will prove irksome to many.",

It is certainly a film for adults, not only because of the brief nude scene but because the topics covered say a lot to those who are already of a certain age and who have already been through a relationship and at some point were disappointed.What captivates me the most in this trilogy is how the long scenes full of important dialogues develop using all the surrounding scenery to hold our attention to the story, for me it's like entering a parallel world and out of nowhere the movie ends .Ethan and Julie are a show apart the performances are absurdly natural (I don't remember another duo with as much chemistry as this one) at a certain point you believe they are really Jesse and Celine.

            "content": "After loving the first two (and being the same age w/similar life events so not suffering from any adolescence-caused naivety/boredom by a couple decades' shot), two words struck me over and over watching this... 1) TEDIOUS and 2) VAPID. You can have the greatest actors on earth and generic, dreary and forced dialogue won't be suddenly brilliant, insightful, and touching.Great films DO exist where the characters are meandering and where little but dialogue-even strained dialogue as they find themselves having-is there to carry a story. I love clever chatter and waited too long for too little-of 109 minutes less than 15 scattered about were worth keeping in the film! Were it not in a beautiful place, it would have NO worth apart from the younger couple being a bit of a refreshing break from Hawke&Delpy and the brief but brilliant(half-star-rating-improving) scene in the hotel&outside at its restaurant... It felt like they were stroking their egos with zero concern for anyone who might discern quality writing from a few merely \"authentic\" but still overly trite, contrived and flat out boring scenes full of drivel.Personally, I do not watch films to hear conversations legitimately less interesting than talking about laundry. NONE of it was insightful and they both look ragged and washed out INDIVIDUALLY-like he's been in and out of rehab for hard drugs for a decade and she's simply lost both her charm and any acting chops that perhaps were never even there-and I think both CAN act but seemed exhausted by the unoriginal garbage they had to make us believe&give two number of care about-do I want to watch a couple of potential neighbors be washed out, unclever, and unhappy in their marriage or do I want to see them actually problem solve and fire each other up without resorting to what is no better than faking orgasms for a decade-it doesn't actually make you happy so don't, and for goodness' sake don't try to get ten bucks from me so I can watch what felt like \"Before Counseling!\" The only thing I found cute or funny was a moment of \"bimbo\" talk that would be fine if not used to show off how much she hates perceived traits about him to others-which is just pathetic...The other problem is that everything they're discussing is far nearer to what couples in their late 20s go through&as a result it all feels fake and poorly cast, a bit like if you cast Clint Eastwood as a traditional father to a toddler and fifth grader without it being odd ie him trying to pull off 32. They say&look their ages but act like a couple of 28 year olds. Nothing meshes. It is tired, tedious and annoying. Don't waste the nearly two hours this requires-well, unless you want solace for a bad relationship and it'll get you role playing as them or pretending it's you in Greece. There are SO SO MANY better films out there. It should simply have never been produced, not with THIS script. I can't believe Linklater was at all involved let alone in charge-maybe HE needed to be in serious rehab when this was being storyboarded. Such a fabulous producer-I can only guess money trouble equaled pressure for a quick sale. Sad. I'm so glad I checked it out from a library since I'd be legitimately upset if I put my money directly into this when I'd get WAY more satisfaction buying a dozen homeless people a cheap meal or soap&toothpaste etc.",

Those moments that like a photograph within the mind can be held and looked at for years to come.Before Midnight however is like a sharp slap in the face, a reality of what could be if we followed another path.

            "content": "\"Before Midnight\" is the third in a series of spectacular romance films, directed by Richard Linklater. The first film was released in 1995, and the second one came out nine years after the first one. A further nine years later, this long-awaited film was rolled out this May.The story is about an American student, Jesse (Ethan Hawke), who has fallen in love with a French student, Celine (Julie Delpy), on the train to Vienna. The two walk around the town of Vienna until the next morning. Nine years later, Jesse reunites with Celine when he visits a bookshop to promote a book he wrote about their first meeting. They enjoyed a few fleeting hours before his departure.Both \"Before Sunset\" and \"Before Sunrise\" didn't clearly describe how they ended up, which didn't give audiences any expectation of what would happen in the next film. I thought it ended with the previous one, so since I've noticed that they decided to take another sequel, I was looking forward to seeing \"Before Midnight,\" and it filled my imagination.The \"Before\" series is characterized by a long single shots, long conversation, and only the conversation of the two people through most of the stories. Thus, it feels like you are there sitting at a table next to them, listening to their conversation. This film is not exception; a long one shot filled with wit. A romantic love story eighteen years ago. At the reunion nine years ago, Jesse married in the U.S. and has a kid, but their married life wasn't so good. On the other hand Celine was still single. They had to face the reality of their situations. And this time, they are no longer just a romantic - They are both in forties, a relationship cross over America and France, and a reality that Jesse is a married man with a wife and child. They spend the last day of their visiting in Greece where they are invited by fans of his book. I thought it was going to be just painful heartfelt from the reality, however, the ending was better than I expected.They're in their forties. They've become older. It has been eighteen years since their first meeting. Then trying to face the reality of their situation is depicted. Celine has their twin daughters and her body has aged. Jesse is frustrated not to be able to be with his son as a father, negotiation with his ex-wife, and remarriage. It also describes their romantic relationship that they are trying to skim their purity from their reality. I felt like supporting them until in the previous two films because their relationship was depicted from their romantic view. But I don't feel like only agreeing with them this time, since it's more complicated and third party is involved. It makes me realize that it is also the reality.Julie Delpy's acting is conveyed a sensation of tension so well that vents Celine's frustration, while their charming conversation still exist. Among other things, the ending releases all the tension and gives you comfort.\"Before Midnight\" is truly a masterpiece along with \"Before Sunset\" and \"Before Sunrise.\" Personally, I felt like this version has an end and no sequel would occur. Besides, the \"Before\" series would already be lack of titles, so I don't expect the next one. However, I would have no choice but wait patiently if we can see them nine years later on screen.I watched this film at Alamo Drafthouse in Austin. It was a nice cinema, and I'm happy to watch it in the same city in connection with Richard Linklater and Ethan Hawke.",

The story dealt with arguments during marriage, though the fighting was really nasty and this couple should have ended their marriage in a divorce. Arguments do happen within marriage, though the relationship should be considered a partnership. Couples need to be conscious of the fact that fighting too harshly can result in damage being done, and this movie seemed to pretend that any argument can be overcome with flirtation, when there is much more to a romantic partnership than just that.I also did ***not*** appreciate the cooptation of the issue of feminism, where the movie came across as showing it to be a trivial issue that contributes to unnecessary fights within marriage, and feminism should be done away with. I work with women's studies in my career, and if you are going to mention feminism in a film, especially to a wide public audience, get educated about it. Discrimination has a devastating impact on the lives of women worldwide, including domestic violence, sexual assault, human trafficking, workplace discrimination,... unfortunately I could go on... a lot. I did not like how this film made light of the issue of rape, with a joke that women over 35 are less likely to get raped, ha ha, no big deal; it was awful.

Behaving in ways that didn't square with the Celine we know from the first two films, and not to her credit. Believable thoughtful feminist Celine, for example, become stereotypical bitter feminist Celine. And that seems pretty right. I would argue, though, that Before Midnight reduces Jesse and Celine both to flat characters; but only for the fight scene. I've seen each film in the trilogy only once, so I should be cautious in my judgment, but my first impression on seeing this one was that we do see the \"real\" Jesse and Celine for most of it\u2014still chatting away, debating, poking fun at each other, and now, figuring out middle-aged family life together\u2014but in the hotel, and certainly by the end of the fight, they've been transformed into a familiar, almost clich\u00e9d, dysfunctional couple.Not that the real Jesse and Celine shouldn't deal with dysfunction, but if one thing has been established in their on-screen relationship, it's that they have always been able to talk to each other openly and for the most part, honestly. And perhaps more important, listen to each other. It's what makes their falling in love the day they meet believable. But in the hotel, they're simply not there. I can believe Jesse would cheat on Celine and not tell her, but I can't believe that when confronted, he would ignore her question, and respond essentially by accusing her of questioning his commitment. It's familiar, it's understandable, and sadly, it's predictably male. But is it Jesse?I can believe Celine would be bored, or seriously angry even, by Jesse's always having sex the same way, but would it take a fight for Celine to bring it up for the first time? Basically, in the hotel, this is not a communicating couple who love each other but are struggling through mutual feelings of resentment\u2014this is a couple who may love each other, but have spent years bottling their resentment and then when the kids are gone, it explodes, and they're at each other's throats. Contemptuous, totally un-empathetic, and downright mean, both of them. It's like they haven't had a real conversation about their feelings in years. Jesse and Celine?So why? That's why I'm bummed. Whatever the intention\u2014undoubtedly honest and thoughtful\u2014 of the director and actors, I believe they took an extraordinary couple brought together by extraordinary, yet believable, circumstances\u2014in their communication, at least, maybe even a healthy example to follow\u2014and waited as long as possible before revealing them to be actually pretty ordinary after all, and not as special as we thought. And maybe not even to be inspired by. :-(",

            "content": "'BEFORE MIDNIGHT': Four Stars (Out of Five) Director Richard Linklater and actors Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy reteam to tell the continuing story of Jesse and Celine for the third time (following 1995's 'BEFORE SUNRISE' and 2004's 'BEFORE SUNSET'). Linklater wrote the script with Hawke and Delpy (the three also co-wrote the last film) and it once again picks up nine years after the previous film (just as the second film did) and focuses on Jesse and Celine's troubled relationship as they live with their twin daughters in Greece. As with the previous two films the movie is full of long dialogue scenes that seem like you're actually watching two real people talk about life. If that's something you enjoy in a film you'll probably like this movie.The film begins with Jesse (Hawke) and Celine (Delpy) now nine years into their relationship as a couple, living with their twin daughters (Jennifer and Charlotte Prior) in Greece. It's now nine years since they hooked up and conceived their children in the last film and eighteen years after they met on a train for Venice in the original film. Jesse is still a successful writer and Celine is wanting to start a new career in government. Jesse wants to move to Chicago to be with his son Hank (Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick) though, who lives with his mother there (Jesse's ex-wife now). This causes troubles in Jesse and Celine's relationship as she feels like she's being asked to sacrifice her career aspirations so Jesse can be with his son. Many arguments result and follow.The movie is quite painful to watch as the third act contains probably about thirty minutes of non-stop viscous bickering. It's hard to sit through at times but it's still very well done and believable; like a real slice of life. The first two acts have a lot of long and drawn-out dialogue scenes that are much less engaging but just as realistic. I know a lot of people that would be bored to death by this film but I'm sure they would be by the first two as well. This relationship trilogy has a very select group of fans but those fans do love these films. This installment is a lot like the other two in structure but takes place at a very different stage in the two main characters' relationship. It's a lot less magical and touching and more about life's ugliness but it does build to a good conclusion and has a positive message. Fans of the first two films should love it and fans of the genre should like it as well. It's one of those movies that's all about life and moves at a snail's pace but these films are just as important as the more entertaining and faster paced ones in my opinion.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOSZyJXrwyw",

            "content": "Romantic movies don't often warrant sequels. After all, when everything has been wrapped up with a happy ending, there doesn't seem to be much point in revisiting a love story already told. Not so with Before Midnight, Richard Linklater's absolutely delightful addition to what has become a trilogy of tender, intensely romantic films about falling - and staying - in love in the real world.We first met Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and Celine (Julie Delpy) eighteen years ago in Before Sunrise, when they were idealistic young adults who meet by chance on a train bound for Vienna. Theirs is a story of first love, rash and impulsive and unexpectedly deep for how brief it is. Nine years later, their tale is picked up again in Before Sunset, in which the long-separated couple meet and spend a brief afternoon together in Paris. Jesse is now an author promoting a novel inspired by his one short night with Celine. We soon discover that they are both not particularly happy about where they are in life.Before Midnight reprises their story nine years later, and unfolds in much the same style as the first two films. Jesse and Celine talk, bicker, argue and flirt their way across an idyllic European city: this time, they are spending the summer on the sun-washed beaches of Greece with their two beautiful twin girls. Surely this is their happy ending... except it becomes clearer as Jesse and Celine take us on a walking tour of Greece that all is not well between them. While Jesse struggles with separation anxiety over his teenage son from his first marriage, Celine frets about whether to take a government job.What works so wonderfully well about this series of films is the opportunity it affords viewers to accompany Jesse and Celine on their journey through life. The moral of their love story is that there isn't really one happy ending: certainly not the kind that ties up many a more formulaic romantic comedy. While Before Sunrise was soaked in a deeply sweet romanticism, as befitting the first rush of young, impetuous love, Before Sunset and Before Midnight are far grittier and more realistic in their portrayal of a relationship underscored by tremendous depth of feeling and affection - even if the two individuals involved are currently not entirely happy with themselves or each other.As with the first two films, it takes a while for Before Midnight to find its groove. The story is being told, slowly and surely, in the squeeze of a hand or the way Jesse reacts to a joke that Celine takes half a step too far. But it requires patience and emotional investment of its viewers. The lunch table conversation at the beginning of the film is a little dry and arch, and takes too much away from what really makes the trilogy so special: its pair of utterly mismatched characters who are nevertheless perfect for each other.Quite unlike the cookie-cutter protagonists of many a standard rom-com, Jesse and Celine both possess strong, definitive, prickly personalities. They are very real, very smart people with their own silly foibles and irrational desires - people who must compromise and swallow doubts and resentments to make a life together. If the first film was about falling in love and the second about rediscovering it, this third installment is about staying in love. There's a bittersweet joy to watching them lash out at each other, bound as they are by a deep, evident affection that may nevertheless not be enough to carry them through to the end. Both Hawke and Delpy deliver outstanding performances. Like their characters, they have developed fine lines and lost the rosy bloom of youth over the past eighteen years. But beyond looking the part, they function as actors in much the same way as their characters relate to each other: loving, giving, sharing, with a spark and chemistry that defies explanation. Delpy, in particular, bares (almost) all in a memorable scene in a hotel room that manages to be intensely awkward, real and intimate, all at the same time.By the time Jesse and Celine settle down by the sea for the film's final scene, Before Midnight has taken them - and their audience - on an emotional journey both heartbreaking and inspiring. For all the pyrotechnics and special effects that money can buy, nothing really beats the electric charge of a pair of actors thoroughly relishing and giving life to a fantastic script. Before Midnight is one of a very few fine, smart films that manages to make the mundane deeply, truly magical and romantic.",

Celine is truly unlikeable, frustrated and resentful, almost unbearable, how are we supposed to consider this? That this is what we turn into with age? But I don't watch a movie for that!I look for inspiration in a film, quality conversations, ingeniousness, great shots and that special feeling that life is a unique and marvelous gift. This film is lacking all of these. Had Celine \"tried\" a little, for sure she would have found things in her life to be grateful for. But her negativity makes the film lose important points.",

The highlights of the previous movies were a simple yet interesting plot, decent acting and matching location emphasizing the spirit of these movies. You can find all of this in \"Before Midnight\" again, but unfortunately in a very small dose. This small dose (approx. 30 min) is absolutely great but it cannot balance the rest of the movie.Watching first hour of the movie, I got a feeling, I was following a strange reality show about some couples having a nice holiday. From my perspective, the dialogs in that part are just pointless and not funny. The conversation got stuck somewhere between sexual obsession and sentimental trash (e.g. conversation at the table in the villa). Sometimes, I felt that the camera guy had forgot to stop the footage. No wonder, if someone left a theater.The movie got a little bit kick in the second part, though. The scene in the hotel room contains all of those ingredients, I expected from the movie: excellent acting, feeling of every detail in the conversation. This takes approx. 30 min. The final scene at the harbor is quite nice again, but just for 10 min and the movie is over. That's it.A very big disappointment in overall.",

It was two people who initially are enjoying each others company, slowly nipping at other at each other through out the day. It was mostly the woman being very insecure about their whole relationship, asking no win questions, Jumping to conclusions, continuing to bring up the same incident in front of friends...until it becomes a full blown fight at the end of the day.In the end they have a very anti-climatic make-up.

            "content": "Because of the great reviews, I expected a profound film that delved into the emotional life of two, long-married people struggling with children, work, and life. What a mistake! Very superficial story line, where we are tortured into seeing two people bickering through the whole film without feeling connected to why they are so bitter and arguing; except that they are.How many writers do most of us know or people who have the time, money, and luxury to travel back and forth to Europe? I don't know about you, but I can't recall the last time I could afford a vacation or even a motel room for that matter. Conversations in the film are so contrived like the characters that no one can take either the characters or the lines they utter as realistic. Discussions on pop culture, politics, and feminism are discussed on the most superficial levels possible. For example, Celine hates her job, but argues about the importance of a woman having a job, because it's empowering? First of all, most women don't have that luxury; economically they are forced to work. Second, who argues that having a job that you feel exploited and hate is empowering? Gorbachev as an amazing statesman. Really? Wasn't he the charlatan who argued against the affordability of bread, destroyed the Soviet Union, and prostituted himself in Louis Vuitton commercials. If the writer had delved a little into politics beyond the superficial headlines maybe he would have known something about Gorbachev. The only likable scene in this whole film is at a banquet among friends. It is the only time you hear any meaningful or interesting banter and dialogue. Thanks of course to the writer ripping off lines from Bergman's film Private Confessions. My recommendation: don't rent this film unless you are a masochist.",

For those of us 'Before' junkies sitting on the edge of our seats the past near decade wondering will they\u0085or won't they make it happen now finally have our answer. And Linklater also quickly answers the question to those in the audience wondering if there is still a story left to tell.As is the case with the first two films, Before Midnight feels incredibly real. The script, which Linklater co-wrote with the two lead stars Ethan Hawke (Training Day, Sinister) & Julie Delpy (2 Days in New York, Broken Flowers), is nothing short of perfect. The three have found a way to write dialogue that is relatable to every human on the planet. The script is hilarious, but dramatically turns on a dime all while continuing to break the normal rules of Hollywood by being a \"talkie\" with extremely long scenes and minimal camera angles. Most filmmakers couldn't even dream of accomplishing what Linklater and company have perfected for the third straight time.Hawke and Delpy are brilliant and a revelation to watch. They embody Jesse & Celine with a realistic persona not found in many other films today. Whether it's because the two actors helped write their story, or if they've just lived inside these characters for so long is hard to say\u0085but whatever the case\u0085Jesse & Celine may be the most realistic believable characters in the history of American cinema.By showcasing the flaws we all have, Before Midnight isn't always easy to watch, but it's pure honesty makes it the best movie of the year to date. Those looking for a sappy Hollywood love story may not be pleased with the honest reflection of life that the film provides, but fans of Jesse & Celine are sure to be pleased by the latest chapter and excited to see what happens in the next 9 years.

            "content": "The biggest problem with this film, relative to the first two of the trilogy, is the direction and to a lesser extent, the screenplay. Modern directors are infatuated with the hand held camera, long still shots, extreme close-ups and voyeurism. I'm a senior citizen, so I really dislike these four inevitable techniques in modern non-action films. Let's discuss:1. the hand-held camera: People generally observe the world while seated or standing. When we move, our eye and brain damp out the jiggle. The hand-held camera, which is claimed to be more realistic, in fact, is NOT. Some directors use it so much that one can get sea-sick from watching their movies.2. long still shots: By \"long\" I mean in time. This, I suppose, is to make the film more artsy. Hardly, it just makes it more boring. I have no problem with slow films, Cairo Time a recent film I loved comes to mind, but keeping the camera held on a shot with no movement or dialogue, is simply annoying.3. extreme close-ups: I'm sorry, but I find no interest in the pores on an actor's nose. What do these extreme close-ups add? In the theater, they add a headache or literally a pain in the neck as you have to move your head up and down to take it all in.4. voyeurism: Do I really have to see an actor sucking on a woman's nipple? What does this add? Do I really have to see a 45 year-old woman sitting topless for 5 minutes. All this voyeurism adds nothing to the story. There is also audio voyeurism. I know I'm old, but I have never been to a dinner gathering, except in a college fraternity, where penises were constantly discussed.These techniques are used, I assume, to make the film \"art.\" If I want art, I go to the museum. In film, I want a story that makes me laugh or cry or think, or get upset, etc., i.e. hits me emotionally.In addition to these annoyances, unlike the first two, the main characters are not sympathetic. This is not necessarily bad, but in this film they are irrationally unsympathetic. Jessie's sudden obsession with his fatherhood (\"I need to be in my son's life full time...\") is not believable. If this were so, he would not have left the US and be with Celine in Paris. Furthermore, Celine's over reaction is demeaning to women. It portrays the stereotype of the illogical, irrational and hysterical woman. And how does the argument end: OK, let's settle nothing, but go have great sex. This may work for 18 year-olds, but not for 45 year-olds. This movie is grossly overrated. See the first two. The only reason to see this one is to see Greece.",

            "content": "Eighteen years later, and we once again get to look in on the lives of Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and Celine (Julie Delpy) for a day. Richard Linklater is a master of dialogue; \"Before Sunrise\" (1995) and \"Before Sunset\" (2004) frequently cited as examples of the best written romantic dramas in existence. The good news is that \"Before Midnight\" fits in that line. Jesse and Celine have finally found time in their hectic lives to just have a meandering conversation again.This type of filmmaking offers so much opportunity for the evolution of the characters. Allows for insight into the maturation of Jesse and Celine, and especially for those of us who have watched since the beginning, insight into the maturation of ourselves. Regardless of how you feel about the type of people Jesse and Celine have become, the film is still good because it still has to be partially realistic. It has been nine years since we last saw them, and the number of paths for their lives are endless. This is just one of those possibilities.\"Before Midnight\" has a very different feel to the two films that came before it. It's no longer just Jesse and Celine. They have kids and they have friends. The latter of which take up a large portion of the movie. The other big change from the previous films is that the 9 years that we spent apart from them, they didn't spend apart. In both Sunrise and Sunset, Jesse and Celine only saw each other when we saw them. But now they've had nine years together and we haven't. Some of the intimacy is lost.The point of course is that these people are now in their forties. Life changes. Jesse and Celine are no longer growing together, but growing apart. We have a one hour window into a relationship in shambles. Everybody praises these types of films for being realistic. They must feel there is a shortage of them. I liked how sad they were together; their arguments against one another were more biting but also reasonable.Like the previous installments, this one is rated R, but this time it's warranted. Jesse seems to have become even more immature \u2013 talking about sex even more than he did as a 23-year-old American. Perhaps it's the French influence. Celine seems to like have arguments naked. That's definitely the French influence. Maybe in 9 years time, Jesse can move back to his Texan roots. Allow us to explore how people become more like their original selves the longer they spend away from it.",

The Before * series consists of three movies that are in the so small category of romantic movies that are worth seeing. In all of them we watch a slice of the life of two people, interpreted by Ethan Hawke and Julie Delphy, from the moment they meet till the one they are married with children. Their problems are real, not dramatic, and their reactions are as far from normal Hollywood romcoms as you can imagine. That is what makes them great.Before Midnight sees the two protagonists on vacation in Greece, two twin girls in tow, apparently in the most perfect of relationships. That view suddenly changes when resentment and low confidence from both parts explodes, threatening to screw everything up. It is a movie in which very few characters are just talking, not unlike Woody Allen movies, but played in a completely different key note. To sum it up, all of the three movies feel like you are reading a book. That is so rare these days and I have enjoyed every moment of watching.",

Eighteen years since they first met in Vienna, and nine years since their reunion in Paris, Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and C\u00e9line (Golden Globe nominated Julie Delpy) are now a couple, unmarried and parents to twin girls, Jesse is a successful novelist, C\u00e9line is at a career crossroads, considering working for the French government. Jesse is struggling to maintain a relationship with his teenage son Hank (Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick), he lives in Chicago with Jesse's ex-wife (he broke with her following his reunion with C\u00e9line), Hank spends the summer with his father on the Greek Peloponnese peninsula, before being dropped off at the airport to fly home. Jesse and C\u00e9line discuss their concerns about Hank, and then about C\u00e9line's choices for her career, over dinner with friends staying with them they talk more about life and love. Their friends pay for them to have a hotel room to spend the night alone, on the way Jesse and C\u00e9line reminisce about coming together, they remove clothing and consider sex, but then start a fierce argument, expressing fears about their present and future relationship. Among other issues, Jesse wants to move to Chicago to be closer to Hank, C\u00e9line does not like the idea of being far away from her family, in the heat of the moment C\u00e9line tells Jesse she no longer loves him and walks out. C\u00e9line sits alone in the hotel outdoor restaurant, Jesse soon joins her and uses a joke he used earlier, that he is a time traveller from the future, he says he has a letter from her elderly self, describing this night as one of the best of their lives. C\u00e9line is unamused and says their fantasies will never match the imperfect reality, Jesse explains his love for her, saying he does not know what else she could want, after a moment C\u00e9line plays along with Jesse's joke, and the two seem to reconcile their differences and reconnect. Also starring Jennifer Prior as Ella, Charlotte Prior as Nina, Xenia Kalogeropoulou as Natalia, Walter Lassally as Patrick, Ariane Labed as Anna, Yannis Papadopoulos as Achilleas and Athina Rachel Tsangari as Ariadni. Hawke and Delpy still have a great chemistry together, differences of opinion create tension, obviously their personal circumstances have changed as well to make things complicated, but they ultimately still love each other, there are a few other characters along the way as well, unlike the previous two films. This film relies entirely on the relationship of the lovers, played out in relaxed long takes with both everyday discussions and bickering, about love, sex, family, pain and politics, with intelligent banter, sharp humour and emotional truths, obviously it also relies on a well crafted script, it is a great end to a indie trilogy, a worthwhile romantic drama.

I remember watching Before Sunset and then the ending came, and it was the most beautiful feeling I'd ever had watching a film. Words cannot express the kind of instant magic I felt while watching it, and while I was excited about a third film, the perfection of Sunset's ending always put doubt in my head. I avoided any trailers or clips for this film in fear of spoilers, but I still sort of knew where the story would probably be headed. I was sort of right but also sort of wrong, and the film encompasses everything that worked with the first two films to perfection really. The two leads have never been better, and the whole film feels like a journey that's building to something greater. That's unique to this film, and it also means that it's all riding with the last act. I didn't really expect anything specific out of it except for the simple \"Celine and Jesse talking\" concept, but it isn't just that and instead the first two acts help set up that actual concept in the third act. The third act wouldn't work without the first two, and it certainly wouldn't have had the same effect had we not had that history with these two characters and seen how much things have changed (or in reality, how much things haven't really changed). Still, that last act is, sorry to repeat myself, magic. I didn't really expect the ending to drive home how much this relationship really means to me, but it did just that. It's as if my feelings were all contained in one bottle and the ending just triggered a corkscrew to release them all at once. It's the best film of the year, quite easily for me, and it's my favorite film trilogy of all time.",

After two capital cities - Vienna in \"Before Sunrise\" (1995) and Paris in \"Before Sunset\" (2004) - the location this time is the much more bucolic Greek Peloponnese. There are two other major differences: Jesse and Celine have now been married for eight years and have twin daughters, so now we are examining not what could be (\".. Sunrise\") or \"should have been\" (...\"Sunset\") but what has been and is, and they are not the only characters, so we have a lunch scene in which people of various ages with their own experiences of relationships offer very different visions of what it means to be a couple.There has never been a triptych like the \"Before...\" movies and I cannot think of any three linked films that collectively I have admired and enjoyed more. \"...Midnight\" is a triumph for both the director and his two co-writers and stars. What was so wonderful about the first two offerings - the long continuous takes and the witty, engaging conversations - is still there, but the whole story is genuinely developed in a style that makes the central relationship seem utterly real. From painful experience, I can vouchsafe that the arrival of children and the passage of seven or eight years presents real challenges to a relationship and anyone who has sustained a relationship in such conditions will find some of the dialogue almost painfully poignant.As the lights in the cinema came on, I fell into conversation with a couple of similar age to Jesse and Celine in the first film: one a Europan and one an American. I could not help but think about what life would hold for them. As for Jesse and Celine, will we see them again in 2022 in \"Before Midday\" located in Chicago? Really I can't wait that long to meet them again ...",

We did not have mentions of using Skype (though, that is reality these days).But this was necessary, because we needed to know: will they survive, or will the relationship grow cold? We get many answers about the last several years of their lives... and yet, I have to wonder if Linklater is open to a part four (or five or six)?",

This one brings us full circle, brings a bit of closure to the story, if you will. The first movie was about two young people meeting for the first time and having ideas, however far fetched and dumb they might have been, about the world and how love works, etc. But we loved it because people like the idea of love at first sight, meeting your soul mate, and what have you. The second one, well, come on, of course we wondered whatever happened to them. (By the way, Giantpanther, you claim to be a fan but you said they were to meet a year later and it was actually 6 months, but who pays that close attention to the details of a movie, right? A fan, perhaps?) I think people are missing the point with this installment. Life isn't peaches and cream. These two had an instant connection, but they lost touch because they were young and silly. But then they found one another again years later and wanted to make it work so badly, that they re-connected and got back together, with him moving to Europe and raising their kids, which you find out at the beginning of this movie. But the reality is that the more complex the people, especially with equally complex lives, the better the chance that their relationship might have been or might be a complete sham. I think they both hated the idea so much of being apart, that they got back together for being together's sake. But now they argue like every couple ever, and doubt themselves and their partner. Truth is Celine never saw herself settling down and being a housewife and mother, and she was imagining that that was exactly the path she was going to take by Jesse asking her to consider moving to the U.S. And due to this, she acted irrationally throughout the rest of the movie. Big life changing decisions impact relationships...no big mystery there. I loved this one, I thought it was well done and much wittier than Before Sunset, even though in some respects this one was more somber. Kudos to Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy for keeping it real.",

            "content": "Richard Linklater has served up a good number of worthy cinematic items in the past decade including 'School of Rock', 'Fast Food Nation', 'Me and Orson Welles' and 'Bernie'. He also has the two prequels to 'Before Midnight', ''Before Sunrise' and 'Before Sunset', which I have not seen, but hear were pretty good. 'Before Midnight' picks up the story nine years later, with novelist and part-time professor Jesse (Ethan Hawke) dropping off his son at the airport on the Greek Pelopennese peninsula where he's been vacationing with wife C\u00e9line (Julie Delpy) and their two young twin daughters (Seamus Davy-Fitzpatrick is a knockout as Jesse's son sensitive son, Hank, who we meet briefly at the beginning of the film).The unfortunate thing about 'Before Midnight' is that for two-thirds of the film, it violates the screenwriter's canon which is of course, 'show don't tell'. Sure there are films that are dialogue heavy and sometimes they work well, especially in the case of a courtroom drama. But 'Before Midnight' is not a courtroom drama. It's an examination of a relationship between a long-time married couple, possibly coming apart at the seams. But until the gripping conclusion, there is little conflict.Instead, we're treated to a great deal of witty banter between the principals, some of which is quite interesting, but in the end, hardly memorable. To make matters worse, some of these conversations take place in one spot--the worst of which occurs as Jesse and C\u00e9line (along with their two children who hardly play a role at all in the story) drone on and on inside their car, as they drive from the airport, after dropping off Jesse's son. It's maddening to sit there with the camera never shifting an iota, as the two principals converse.Things improve slightly when Jesse and C\u00e9line arrive at the home of a Greek writer friend and there are other adults there, including the writer's son and his wife, who add their two cents regarding life's travails. Perhaps the highlight there is Delpy's seductive Marilyn Monroe impersonation. Later, Jesse and C\u00e9line take a long walk through a tourist spot, ending up inside an ancient Greek Orthodox shrine (there C\u00e9line makes some rather sacrilegious sexual comments which weren't very amusing). 'Before Midnight' finally picks up when Jesse and C\u00e9line return to their hotel room and go at one another. At last the characters seem to find their voice and the conflict becomes apparent. Jesse is accused by C\u00e9line of focusing too much on his son, to the detriment of their relationship. And C\u00e9line in Jesse's eyes is a whiner who seeks approbation as a beleaguered feminist. Clearly the more nuanced portrait of the two is that of C\u00e9line, who really does come off as unreasonable and neurotic. It's only through Jesse's patience that the ship finally is righted and the relationship is restored to a semblance of equilibrium.Clearly 'Before Midnight' is one of the overrated indies of the year. Yes, one must admire the witty repartee between Hawke and Delpy as well as the high intellectual level in most of the dialogue throughout the film. Nonetheless, as noted above, one becomes restless for the central conflict to emerge and overwhelmed by the amount of dialogue. With so many ideas tossed about, it's hard to remember hardly any of them\u2014those who have seen the film more than once, probably could appreciate it more. A healthy balance between all the ideas and the visuals is what 'Before Midnight' really needed. Unfortunately, the film remains top heavy with so much dialogue, that it ends up too heavily weighted toward the intellect, than to the heart.",

            "content": "The third \"before\" of Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke happens before midnight, just nine years after Before Sunset. Jesse and Celine are now living together parenting twin girls. They live in Paris, having vacations in Greece. Jesse tries to stay in touch with his only sun from previous marriage who actually lives with mom in the US. Before Midnight is bit different movie from two previous installments. Both of them were as young and frivolous giddy films alike to their main characters, passionate and impulsive, carrying all characteristic of romantic comedy. But this one is more wise movie showing a middle age relationship between a loving couple, the ups and downs of their love and it gives a brilliant look where a desperate love can come to. Before Midnight brings questions that any couple may come up with. On the one hand they are living a great life. Jesse is a successful writer happily living with Celine. But there is something he is missing. Celine feels like she loses connection with him and destroying a decade relationship for no reason. Movie is very sincere, openly discussing lots of interesting and everyday problems. It actually consists of couple major dialogues that clearly expose whole spirit of plot. There is a dining scene where character discuss their first sexual intercourse or just their sex live and I was surprised how precise, natural and nice each word was. It did not \"scream\" as it happens in most of films. Each and every other dialogue was a masterpiece, very quiet, peaceful and calmly emotional. The last scene in the bedroom which actually last half an hour, just runs very quickly because of beautifully written script.Julie & Ethan wrote the screenplay with director Richard Linklater, and they did it even better then before. Everything in the movie speaks for itself - Delpy and Hawke knew what they were doing. There is no much dramatic action or emotional plays in Before Midnight. On the contrary it's very calm and steady one, however still exposes the emotional bondage between main characters. Julie Delpy gives the best performance compared with two previous. She's great. As if she exactly knows how should Celine look like (well, maybe because she wrote it). Each speech of her is full of pure emotions and sincerity, as though she has lived all those years of Celine, with Jesse. I can make sure that Julie is one of the top contenders in Oscar best actress race. Ethan Hawke's is an fantastic example of good dramatic acting. A man loving a woman of his dreams tries to be a good father to three different children. He really loves the lady he met many many years ago, but also feels obligation towards those who were hurt because of that. I can't make sure predictions about his award year, but he is not bad candidate for trophies at all. If you have a question why I did not rate this movie with 10 stars, I can tell that it is a fair one. But let me tell this: sometimes I get lost in endless discussions and dialogues. Time by time I started getting bored. For example, a car scene just made me want skipping it. An there are few moments like this. Without them, Before Midnight would be perfection and top movie so far.",

            "content": "The nearly-month long period of time I have been indulging in Richard Linklater's utterly remarkable Before trilogy has not only made me more observant on fabled ideas such as life, love, and romance, but it has made me appreciate human connection and relationships more than I have in the past. I've always looked to connect and strike up real, meaningful relationships with those that I've met, but Linklater's Before trilogy has really made me analyze the beauty of the progression of relationships and, often, how feelings for someone can change for both the positive and the negative. It's the kind of film that puts a grandiose idea into perspective by showing you an application, giving you a representation of ideas that only existed as passing thoughts in your head.The original Before Sunrise was a terrific film, cutesy in the best possible way, showing a meet-cute between two young, idealistic souls who feel as if the possibilities of the world are at their fingertips and their connection is one of the many wonderful things in store for them during their lives. Before Sunset caught not only the two performers in a more confident, assured state of mind, but their characters in a place of humble disillusionment. Both quietly feared that their idealism was slipping through their fingertips, which were once seemingly instant sensors to the motor of the world, but they still remained generally optimistic in tone and were pleasantly introspective about themselves. Only one scene saw Delpy's C\u00e9line lash out at Hawke's Jesse and that momentarily made the audience uncomfortable.Before Midnight shows Jesse and C\u00e9line exhausted from the first frame. We see Jesse walking with his son Henry (Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick) to his flight, as he is about to fly from Greece, who is now living in Paris, back home to his mother, Jesse's now ex-wife, in Chicago. We see Jesse has published two books, is tossing around an elaborate, transient idea for the third one, and maintaining a relationship with his love C\u00e9line and their two twin daughters. A dinner with friends turns into an outing where low-key but evident animosity is bread between the value of what Jesse does as a man versus what C\u00e9line does as a women. He comments about her need to shortchange their relationship together, and she remarks how his writer complex makes him more attracted to bimbos than women he can hold a conversation with.The two roam the streets of Greece in a manner that echoes how they used to roam around large, spacious cities with no care in the world and nothing immediate on their mind. They reminisce and fondly recall of old circumstances together and the elephant issue at hand; Jesse wants to be with Henry during the crucial years of high school, which would involve him and C\u00e9line moving to Chicago because Henry moving to Paris is not an option. C\u00e9line doesn't want to do this because her environmental action has just landed her a dream job that requires work in Paris, and the two have clearly been bickering about this plan for quite some time, specifically, the few days after Henry leaves Jesse to return home to his mother.Most of the third act (about a good thirty-five minutes) takes place in a Greek hotel room, with Jesse and C\u00e9line arguing with one another about their plans for Henry, the expected gender roles of both of them, the fact that one shortchanges the other, and just life situations in general. Linklater perfectly executes these scenes so they're not overblown theatrics fogging up human behavior (he exercised such great restraint when profiling Mason's alcoholic stepfather in Boyhood). Yet after spending three films with these characters, watching them fall madly in love with one another and engage in so many romantic, thoughtful encounters, watching them argue is the equivalent of seeing your parents argue when you're a kid.Make no mistake, however; this long, slowburn scene is the epitome of the Before trilogy, alongside Jesse and C\u00e9line's first encounter on a train to Vienna. It indicates that this was a love that was best attended to in small increments rather than long term commitment (or is all love essentially like that?). Jesse and C\u00e9line have spent a great deal of time together, know each other by heart, and are growing restless of the weaker features of one another. Perhaps if they kept their \"nine year\" commitment in tact from their first meeting, maybe they would've gone on to have a stronger love for one another? But wouldn't they still feel like they're missing something or someone in their lives? Before Midnight is as rich of a testament to the human spirit as its predecessors, closing one of the most beautiful trilogies I've ever seen committed to film. Watching these three films has been my emotional movie event of the season, and which each passing installment I'm reminded more and more of why I not only praise Linklater for his ability to commit abstract concepts and relatable characters to film, but film's ability to connect, resonate, and deeply attend to the aforementioned human spirit. The entire Before trilogy is such a tender, affectionate handling of the concept through simplicity itself, so much so that if I encounter someone who doesn't understand the films, or find the beauty in them, all that can simply be said is \"don't think, just watch.\"Read the more complete review on my personal website, http://stevethemovieman.proboards.com",

Perhaps, it is because I didn't have the opportunity to cherish the earlier ones on a big screen. But, I finally made it to this one at it's premiere at the Sydney Film Festival.If you loved Sunrise, felt Sunset, then you would want to live Midnight, as brutal as it is at times.I shall not spoil the specifics of the story because the scenes are the specifics. The general idea is that of a couple in their early forties trying hard to keep the spark alive despite their parental, moral and professional responsibilities taking a toll on their relationship.The inherent sub-themes are: 1. Jesse's craving to be able to be a sufficient father figure to his son from his previous marriage. 2. Celine's confusion regarding her professional endeavours. 3. Life in America vs life in Europe.The way Jesse tries to cope with and repair his past in the form of his son Hank, is extremely heart-wrenching. His literary ambitions take him beyond his imagination and into the realms of his personal crises becoming his true inspirations.Celine, troubled by the ethics and failures of her own ambitious ventures, resorts to pessimism regarding her maternal calibre and marital prospects.Contrary to the previous films, this one has few other characters with relatively more to do and say. Through their respective roles, the supporting cast did considerable justice to the story.As for the lead pair, Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy are yet again at their best, both in the acting and writing departments. They manage to make even the troubles of their respective characters desirable to viewers. They portray ways to deal with relationship issues with their own unique brand of natural cum realistic acting. Special mention - the long uncut scenes were marvellous.But of course, the ultimate glory belongs to the writing trio which further includes the captain himself, Richard Linklater. The ease with which they managed to suck the audiences into such a simple tale of a realistic relationship, is worth a standing ovation - that too, keeping the interest alive and elevating over a span of nearly two decades.Funny, charming, sad, realistic. Before Midnight will stay rooted within the minds of genuine viewers for as long as they shall believe in the power of realistic love.P.S.: Yes, I used the word 'realistic' four times in the review, since that is the USP of the series.",

Then, they got to meet again, slightly more settled (at least what is seen in the outside) yet, having the remorse of their irrationality and misfortunes. Now, we got to see them in their 40s, in another conundrum due to their many decisions that we've seen on or off-screen.What amazed me throughout this trilogy is that, the exact struggles of the characters was mentioned early in the first movie. And, their reflection on these struggles, how they try to cope with them is all in a sync with their personalities.Maybe the things we talk, things we like, where we are in life will change over the time. Maybe we think we evolved. But, deep down we are who we are always.Maybe we think to made the right decisions in our lives. But, we might only see how it affected our lives that day in the future.Most important thing is to being your best selves in that day, and embrace the moment imo.

            "content": "This is the best film of the \"Before\" series. I would give these films a rating of 7, 8, and 9, respectively. Before Midnight is, by far, the most serious of the series and asks some fundamental questions about love, romance, and long-term relationships. For me, the main question asked by everyone in this film was: Does romance endure or is it killed by time and the routine of daily life? Women, as delineated by Julie Delpy's character, Celine, are trapped by their mothering instinct to care for those around them. They both love and resent their children at the same time and feel trapped in their roles as unappreciated caregivers. Men, according to her, are dominated by their desire to procreate. Women worry that they will lose those physical attributes that led their partners to pursue them in the first place. Celine continually questions enduring love in the face of this deterioration. Of course, if she is right, if romance was initially only based on physical attraction, then, women do face a grim future. Men are seen as biological robots, unable to stem their drive to procreate with younger, more attractive females. Indeed, at the beginning of the film, the future of love and sex is discussed and is predicted to culminate in some sort of simulated reality without the need for biological sexual partners at all. In this case, what is the purpose of love and romance? Do they only exist as some biological scam? Is their purpose only to induce a sort of biological temporary insanity that leads us to procreate and continue future generations and the species in general? The answer must be, yes, unless there is some other, for argument's sake, spiritual component to romance that lets those infected with it see beyond aging with all its physical decay. This seems to be the foundation of the debate between the two characters and whether the ending of this film solves this debate, I leave to you.Those familiar with the before films will understand its almost improvisational style, however, it is mainly the acting ability of the two main characters that give it this dimension. In truth, it is a clearly thought out exploration of love in the face of reality, a reality that becomes increasingly challenging with time together and the necessity of caring for children. This is not a film for those looking for a rom-com but for those who are more interested in the deeper meaning of relationships. It is certainly a film that will give you many ideas to ponder and, perhaps, make you reconsider your current role in your relationships.",

            "content": "Until 2013 I had not been familiar with the Before trilogy and upon its nomination for the Best Adapted Screenplay Oscar, Midnight latched on to my watch list and I'm glad it did. I wanted to watch the first two so I could have a chronological order on the story, but unfortunately couldn't and I will try as soon as possible to do so. Despite this setback, this third entry was a fantastic experience, one I hope to have with the other two films. I won't go into much detail on the story, so basically Jesse and Celine, are now a married couple with two children, who are just about finishing their summer vacation in Greece. For me I felt that the relationship Jesse has with his son, Hank, triggers the whole plot. After a complicated divorce, our two leads don't have quite the healthy relationship with Jesse's ex-wife and when Jesse brings up the possibility of moving to the U.S to be close to Hank, just as Celine is about to accept a dream job, complications will surely come into play, and as a couple they must figure out a way to survive. Filled with honesty and a sometimes cynical look at relationships, the Before Midnight script not only complements life, but also what movie scripts are supposed to do: captivate. To offer an example and despite its differences, a script I really enjoyed being brought to the big screen was Pulp Fiction, because I felt it flowed very naturally and combined with Tarantino's style and brilliant performances was a huge cinematic experience. On another note, Before Midnight is a script that isn't stylized, yet with its complexity of themes flows just as naturally and is just as entertaining. I feel like it could have racked up a couple more nods for the Oscars such as acting nominations for the leads and cinematography for the beautiful Greek landscape. Being this such a competitive year I understand, but it kind of feels like a shame for me, at least for now.Rating 9/10",

            "content": "Well, first excuse my writing as English isn't my native tongue. So it's not an indication of how 'educated' or intellectual I am. Second..what Spoiler Alert?? I mean there is no plot to spoil. Which is OK, I Love films with no structure, or the usual storyline. I love Boring films (I enjoyed The Brown Bunny, for example) and I am more into 'artsy' films, long ones, with long takes, etc. But this... is just a bad film that Also happens to be boring and has no point.The dialogs are VERY pretentious. Really? writers get together to talk like that? I think my friends and I had deeper and more meaningful talks in our early 20s.To be honest, I only watched the first 'Before, and that was long time ago. So I wasn't really following the characters and their past. I didn't know Jesse was a writer. When he was discussing his book chapters the beginning of the film, I thought he was talking to some relatives, brother-in-law and his grandpa, or something like that. Like just simple-minded people talking with a hobby writer, dabbling with writing on Sundays. Then the conversation over lunch with the whole group... Really Embarrassing for whoever wrote those lines. Lame and shallow dialogs about sex, modern life, technology. Is this the best they could come up with? \"we always have to make sure it is still there\". Urghh. I think if you talk with a taxi driver, you may get more wisdom than that. And what year is that? 1964? I mean Delpy talking about women failing to achieve anything before 50..? C'Mon. And can she work on her shape a little? My girlfriend who is 40, and a mother of 2 is in great shape, and so are many other women. The film seems to bring together a collection of old clich\u00e9s and stereotypes + some pretentious lame jokes. Trying too hard to appear witty and smart, which usually fails.The acting: although I hated her character, being bitter and whiny for no good reason, but her acting was fine. But Ethan's acting was just irritating. Like a 40 old something trying to act like a teenager. I was always aware of the fact that this guy is an actor and not a real person. it didn't feel natural. and it didn't feel like a 40 year old man. Also, they didn't sound like a 40 year old couple. The conversation in the car from the airport.. the Apple part.. Made me cringe. That's all I can say. And he is definitely not convincing as a writer. He is too lame and simple-minded to be one. Not a man of words, as the Greek man says. But not only for the way he dresses, but for everything he is.The shallow pretentious conversation made me feel like they were targeting 18-25 year old audience. While the 'issues' or themes they Try to tackle (again: Try) would attract a much older audience. And this is maybe among the main problems with this film. I also think it was the conflict for the actors. Trying to keep the charm of the younger couple we saw in the first Before. But they are too old for that, and are supposed to be much more mature.I tried to see One positive aspect of her personality. Couldn't find any. She is very bitter, negative, unhappy, whining not appreciative of him, and you just wonder if she really loves him. Also, why is he still with her? He doesn't seem to appreciate her, and even points it out: No one would put up with her sht for more than a few months- except him. He loves her..but it seems like a love that lacks passion..and reason. Love as a habit. it seems more like an old-fashioned kind of marriage. She is the mother of my kids, we have been married for years, so of course I love her. I may look around and desire other women..but at the end of the day, she is my wife and we will get old together.",

            "content": "I was so happy a few days ago when I saw this movie was scheduled to be shown in my immediate area on the weekend. However, my happiness was quickly subdued today after watching it. Somewhere around the midpoint of the film, it went from grabbing me and having the possibility of being another great movie, to just becoming humdrum, harsh, and fairly whiny.I've read other reviews of this movie describing it to be \"honest\" and \"real\". That it's a true account of what would happen as time went on with this couple. Well, I don't know about anyone else, but I personally didn't fall in love with the previous two movies because of their honesty or realism. I went to lose myself in a romantic fantasy for a short time, and Before Midnight is very far from that. It's like it was a different genre altogether. Something along the lines of turning the Terminator into a musical comedy (well, maybe not that bad, but pretty darned close). If you're going to see it expecting to see a couple in love and longing for what lies ahead, prepare to be disappointed.Yes I thought the writing was good as usual. Delpy and Hawke did a great job with the lines they wrote and were given. The other actors seemed genuine and did a fabulous job. Even the child actors did a super job. The boy was believable, but I wish the twins had a little more dialogue and action (hats off to them for being still, behaved, and \"asleep\" during the 20 minute car ride, they were very cute).However, if I wanted to see and hear conversations from \"real\" couples and how they act after the energy and romance of courtship is over, I would simply look into any of my neighbors' windows at night. The only downside is that I might get arrested for that. As it stands, I just lost a few dollars on the ticket price. There was no mystery or imagination to this movie. For example, in Before Sunrise, you could imagine them making love in the park, there was no need to show it. In Before Sunset, you could imagine them making love in her apartment after he misses the plane, there was no need to show it. In Before Midnight, there is no imagination at all, she pulls down her top, takes off her underwear, and seems to do one quarter of the movie topless. No, it wasn't that long, but it seemed like it. At some point, I was even thinking, \"ok, we get you're topless, now cover up already\". It added nothing to the story, other than saying how blas\u00e9 and loveless their relationship has become, and if that was the point, it frankly didn't make that interesting of a movie. Again, I see hatred and bitterness between \"real\" couples every day, why would I go pay to see the same thing? To be fair, I really didn't like Sunset the first time I saw it either. I thought it lost the charm of Sunrise, however, I quickly learned to love it. Before Midnight might possibly grow on me over time as well, but I certainly don't remember disliking Before Sunset this much. I initially remember it being OK, but just not up to par with the original. However, Before Midnight left me with a feeling of how nasty and cruel couples can be to one another when they supposedly love each other. If the creators' intentions were to make you feel badly after watching their move, well, they succeeded. It's just not something I'd pay for again, and if there happens to be yet another sequel, I would wait to watch it for free. With the combined talent of these three people (Delpy, Hawke, and Linklater), I think they certainly could have come up with something better.",

But after watching sweet and romantic two movies, with two likable, smart and good looking leads, this one is like kick in the guts. While scenes of Greek lands and traveling, as well as everything visually was stunning, Jesse, and especially Celine were not that fun to listen. I loved Celine's character in two first movies so it was a nasty surprise to see her as bitter, angry and resentful woman who seems to hate everything in her life, and instead of doing something to improve it, is just throwing insults at her husband continually. There was not a single kind word, single smile or charming gesture, not even a tiny sparkle in the eye, from her the entire movie, nothing that would made us believe why would Jesse care so much for her. She is all rage, negativity, despise and endless row of picking fights. If Jesse was so bad as we are supposed to believe, then give us something, anything to make us see that! We weren't given single reason for why she would hate him so much. From that lovely girl we saw in first movies, she got so annoying, nasty and negative person, and we were simply not given enough reason to understand why? If she hates him, why doesn't she just leave? If he cares so much, why does he care? She hates his gut, everyone can see that. There wasn't a single kind word she said to him whole movie. She throws him a tiny bone at the end, but even that felt weak and temporary. she is also selfish about his needs to be with his son, she doesn't know what she wants, and she is literally trying to make him feel like crap constantly. From the beginning of the movie when she picks a fight over stupid things like Jesse eating a stupid apple their kid left, which was ridiculous, throughout the whole movie where she humiliated him in front of their friends, and then proceeded to yell, foam, and moan about her life while I still couldn't understand after the whole freaking movie WHY is she so miserable. What was she expecting in marriage and in life? And why blame it all on Jesse? Did he force her in marriage and having kids and having lousy job or whatever? I still don't get it. Most of the time, I just wanted to say \"Oh shut up already!\". JEsse most of the movie acts confused, and out of touch, like he doesn't get it why is she so angry. She is your wife, dude, you lived together for like 8 or so years. Do you even know her? He fights for her attention and tries to ignore all the hate, or honestly is unaware of it which was sad, and looks like he doesn't even understand she hates him. That is, my people, what you are going to watch in this movie, angry woman picking fights and throwing insults and confused husband who is trying for seemingly days of this torture, to calm her down. What did you do to Celine? And no,it's not \"normal life\" if we don't have any real context, in absence of any explanation or context, Celine comes up just as highly unlikable character no one wants to listen, and Jesse seems like a total pushover.

            "review_title": "One-third of a romantic magnum opus",
            "content": "Watching \"Before Midnight,\" one is struck by how shallow and superficial most movies dealing with love and romance truly are.Principal credit goes to writer/director Richard Linklater, who has the uncanny gift for making all the dialogue he writes sound 100% real - given an invaluable assist from a cast of brilliant ad-libbing actors, that is. This talent is something he's demonstrated over and over again in his unique and utterly indispensable longitudinal study in romance: \"Before Sunrise\" (1995), \"Before Sunset\" (2004) and now his piece de resistance, \"Before Midnight.\" The \"Before\" trilogy is similar to the \"Up\" documentary series, only instead of checking into the lives of some actual people every seven years as Michael Apted does, Linklater goes back to the same fictional couple every decade or so to see how it is they're faring. When we first met Celine and Jesse in \"Before Sunrise,\" they were two strangers in their twenties who, after a chance meeting aboard a train, proceeded to spend a romantic, albeit platonic, evening together in Vienna before he headed back to his home in the States and she to her life as a student in Paris. Though they vowed to reunite in six months time, they never actually did so.When, nine years later, they encountered each other again, at a book-signing in Paris, Jesse had become a successful writer, having used his encounter with Celine as fodder for a worldwide best seller, thereby capturing both her and the moment they shared in print forever. In his thirties at this point, Jesse revealed that he was married with a son, but that the marriage was an unhappy one. Celine, an environmental activist, had a boyfriend she rarely saw due to his job as a photojournalist. \"Before Sunset\" faded out on them finally consummating their relationship.As \"Before Midnight\" opens, we learn that Celine and Jesse have indeed become a couple and have twin daughters conceived in their night of passion. Jesse broods over the fact that he is living a continent away from his now-teenaged son , whom he gets to see only during the summer. Meanwhile, Celine, Jesse and the girls are spending their vacation traveling around Greece, staying with friends at a beautiful villa and taking in the sights.If \"Before Midnight\" reminds us of any film, it is Stanley Donen's great 1967 romance \"Two For the Road,\" with Audrey Hepburn and Albert Finney as the long-married couple - also traveling through Europe - who have begun to take the long view of their relationship, examining how love and individuals change, sometimes for the better but often for the worse, over time (with its time-shifting narrative, Donen was able to accomplish in one movie what Linklater takes three to do - not that that in any way diminishes the achievement). Unlike most romantic dramas, which end just as the relationships are starting to become interesting, \"Two for the Road\" and \"Before Midnight\" hurtle bravely on into the future, to a point long after the initial concerns and rituals of courtship and giddy romance have faded and the realities and concerns of a far more prosaic everyday life have come to take their place.Infidelity, the demands of parenthood, the pressures of work and career, the idealism of youth fading into the cynicism and compromises of middle age - all these issues are put under the microscope and brought into sharp focus in \"Before Midnight,\" which clearly shows that Celine and Jesse are not the same people they were when we first met them - nor should we expect them to be. For life is not static, and neither are the people who are constantly being molded and shaped by the experiences it throws at them. The characters here talk about love and relationships with a depth and insight rarely found in even the most profound of personal dramas.Eschewing the plot mechanics and melodramatic contrivance that gum up so many movie romances, \"Before Midnight\" consists mainly of long, often single-take scenes that capture with uncanny accuracy the rhythm and flow of natural conversation. Jesse and Celine know each other so well - have become so comfortably intimate with one another as a couple - that they can talk about a wide range of topics, from the most trivial to the most profound, and not miss a beat, secure in the knowledge that the bond between them is stronger than anything they might express in words. That's how come they are able to emerge intact from a particularly withering half-hour-long argument in a hotel room in which souls are bared and long-simmering grievances are finally brought out into the open.Of course, the series could never be what it has become without the stellar work of Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy, two outstanding actors who have literally come to inhabit these characters over the course of three decades. Together they perfectly embody Linklater's vision of what a real romantic couple looks and sounds like at various stages in their relationship. And it's all enhanced by a lovely musical score by Graham Reynolds that nicely brings out the romantic flavor of the piece.The idea that two distinct and strong-willed individuals can exist both as separate entities and as a couple - and make it work - is the thesis that informs every moment of \"Before Midnight.\" In his series, Linklater has wiped away the gauze that enwraps most movie romances to show us the real and vital thing that beats underneath. And, in so doing, he raises the bar that all future filmmakers, working in the genre from hereon out, will need to try to reach.",

The way they found each other again, the pinball machine moment, their passion, even the fact that he eternalized her with his writing. He was in so much pain that even when he was marrying someone else, he still expected her to show up. And even while married, he never gave up hope he'd find her, and that's why he wrote the book. And now, years later she HATES the book. She always says it wasn't her in that book, she doesn't want to sign it etc. I think there was a reason why in the second movie she couldn't find anybody to marry. She's a deeply troubled person, and he's just a poor romantic who fell in love with her. I think in time she's going to leave him. And I think it's true, she doesn't love him anymore. It's so heartbreaking to see him try to win her in the end, even after she told him she doesn't love him. If the roles were reversed, and he told her that, she'd pack her bags and take the kids with her.",

            "content": "The first time I saw Richard Linklater's Before Sunrise (1995) I was about the same age as the characters in the film. It was also 2008 so the film series Before Sunrise, Before Sunset (2004) and now Before Midnight (2013) had a bit of a headstart on me. The film hit me like a freight train providing a very, very accurate foil for the things I was dealing with. I had just ended a longterm relationship\u0085well she ended it, and I was stuck in an existential funk, unable to really find a proper place in life. Yet through it all I was still optimistic. In essence, Jesse (Ethan Hawke) was me in a nutshell; the fact that he and Celine (Julie Deply) were walking around Vienna where I spent three years of my childhood was another added bonus.Eighteen years after their first encounter and nine years since the last movie Jesse and Celine live in Paris. Before Midnight sets up the situation; the couple is spending the last few days of their Grecian vacation at the summer home of a fellow author. They have twins (Jennifer and Charlotte Prior) and Jesse is seeing off his son from his previous marriage (Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick) who is about to start high school in the States. Jesse is troubled that he hardly ever sees his son and has been fiddling with the idea of moving back stateside. Meanwhile Celine fiddles with the idea of starting a new job in Paris.The film follows roughly the same format as the first two in the series. Jesse and Celine converse and weigh the options they have while enjoying the breathtaking scenery around them. There is more interplay between other characters in this one but most of the dialogue takes place between Jesse and Celine. You would think that things would get tedious after a while yet the dialogue crackles with a stylized realism that keeps you interested in the conversation. It's as if they say all the things you'd say if in a nine year relationship only uttered by two beautiful people who don't stammer as much.I'll admit Before Midnight is probably my least favorite of the trilogy (thus far) not because it's a bad movie; very, very far from it. It's almost too good of a movie in fact. As I have said before, the film series has a headstart on me thus I am not a parent, a career man or even consider myself a full-fledged adult. The conversations to be had in Before Midnight are less the ones I would have and more the ones my parents had when I was younger. To that extent, Before Midnight makes me want to evaluate the man I am becoming.I tried to have my girlfriend sit and watch Before Sunrise. We had to shut it off after twenty minutes as she was bored to tears by a movie consisting of largely dialogue. This is a girl who loved Seven Samurai (1954) so I'm not about to judge her harshly for brushing off what I consider to be arguably the most genuine movie about love. Regardless, I hope that our love stays as lively and as beautiful as that of Jesse and Celine. What happens after a romantic finds what he's looking for and walks slowly into the sunset? Watch Before Midnight.http://www.theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com",

            "content": "I admit I am a huge fan of the Before series. I was eagerly anticipating this movie for many years. Since 2004 to be exact. Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy have hands down the best chemistry in the history of cinema. I am not exaggerating. Their interaction and mannerisms along with the masterfully crafted dialogues should be obligatory material in acting schools.So again this time, when they were on screen they managed to perfectly convey the joys, concerns and frustrations of people (and also couples) in their early 40s, just like they did with the early 20s and early 30s in the other two films. Their acting calibre allows them to stay on the fine line between maturity and insecurity.This leads me to the only issue I have with the film and the reason I gave it a 9. Unlike the previous two installments, a lot of screen time is wasted in conversations with or between third parties. I was simply not interested in what everyone else had to say, this is a movie about Jesse and Celine and how they see life through their own eyes. Thankfully the issue is rectified in the second half, but I still wanted to enjoy our two protagonists a bit more. I could even go as far as saying some parts especially in Patrick's table border to corny and bland, but without using spoilers this may actually be intentional.A side comment: I may not think her role (or any supporting role for that matter) was key to this particular movie but as a Greek it was a delight to see the beloved Xenia Kalogeropoulou again on screen after so many years of absence. She has aged gracefully. Please check her movies, she is an extremely skilled actress. Now in terms of the location, as with the rest of the films, it is really secondary. I'm not sure why they chose Greece in the first place, but in any case Southwestern Peloponnese is a great place to visit and actually using the house of Patrick Leigh Fermor is a fitting homage to the great traveller (the host's name being Patrick surely not a coincidence). As mentioned above, the movie really takes off in the second half, the hotel scene and the very last scene are pure Oscar material (hello Academy, you skipped them twice, it is about time don't you think?). Intense magnetism was emitted from the screen and nobody really wanted this movie to end. I could easily sit a few more hours watching them interact.Once more, thank you Ethan, Julie and Richard for giving us another amazing film. I know I will be revisiting again and again.",

            "content": "Before Midnight (2013): Dir: Richard Linklater / Cast: Ethan Hawke, Julie Delpy, Walter Lassally, Ariane Labed, Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick: Title is a reminder of the Biblical reference of not allowing the day to end with anger still brewing. This is the third in a trilogy that includes Before Sunrise and Before Sunset with Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy still growing apart and together and back again. Set in a stunning Greek atmosphere and opens with Hawke's son boarding a plane back to Chicago where his mother lives. From there it could strike some viewers as unsettling when Richard Linklater shoots extremely long sequences consisting of conversation. There is a long driving sequences, another long dinner sequence, then a long walking sequence. Finally this all comes together at a hotel room where these two bicker. Some viewers will grow weary of Linklater's choice of shooting. Others will appreciate the skill of the two leads who hold it together within an extremely long one take. Structure is stagy but its message ring true for any couples who have been together for years. Hawke and Delpy hold it together with strong performances as a couple discussing their issues. He desires a closer relationship with his son and she resents the idea of moving to Chicago. She is also contemplating a Government job. Seamus Davey-Patrick plays Hawke's son who is seen in the film's opening scene at the airport. While Linklater has been more creative with other films this one sustains a theme many viewers will relate to when it comes to putting issues to rest before midnight. Score: 7 / 10",

            "content": "This third entry is easily less appealing and enjoyable to watch than the previous two films. But that doesn't mean that it is any less significant in its honesty and realism.The first two films saw two romantic people walking the streets of Vienna/Paris and getting to know each other and getting reacquainted Unfortunately, most relationships do not end there. As Eckart Tolle has stated, \"They never bother to explain what comes after, do they?\" Even the late Kobe Bryant once said, \"Fairy tales are nice but they never tell you what happens when Prince Charming ends up on the sofa because he and the wife got into a spat.Hence, the third act of this trilogy: what happens after.Anyone who tells you that relationships are all sunshine and rainbows is a liar. Pure and simple. Relationships are not what you see on the Hallmark Channel. It's funny how we only see the 10% of things and never the 90%.Before Midnight is a look nine years later at Jesse and Celine's relationship. Things have become much more complicated and things are also changing. Gee, sounds like actual life, doesn't it? People are never the same as they were when things started. And, yes, often--more often than people realize--in that change, people grow apart. This isn't a bad thing. It's just reality. It's funny how easily people can recognize when relationships begin, but they seldom ever recognize when they've ended. People ignorantly believe that when a relationship ends, it's a failure. That is religion and society talking. That's not how it actually is.The real meat of the story is in the final third when Jesse and Celine go to a hotel to spend--what they think--a romantic evening. But suddenly, all of the anger, frustrations, insecurities, and issues come roaring to the surface, and the brief moment of romance is quickly dashed. They attempt to talk things out. But as with most couples, neither is very good at listening to each other nor communicating what is really going on. Again, much like real couples in real life. Yes, relationships are work. Hard work.The dialogue is like a sparring session; like a tennis match going back and forth between anger, attempted understanding, frustration, brief moments of empathy, then back to anger again. It's also funny how both characters contradict themselves in their attempt to make the other see and hear what is going on in their lives.In the first film, we're left wondering if they're ever going to see each other again.In the second film, we're left wondering if they finally end up together, and if so, for how long?In this film, we're left wondering if they can survive themselves. Will the relationship last?And that is the poetic beauty of this film and why it's underrated. I can see why most people dislike this one the most out of the three. It's tough and challenging to look at the darker side of relationships because most people are caught up in that 10% that we usually get to see. Nobody wants to look beyond and see the bumps, the ruts, and the challenges that are always present.Before Midnight deserves more props and credit for finally showing us the realistic road and what it invariably looks like. It may not be as entertaining or as romantic, but it is at least as important, if not even more so.",

Ive travelled to Greece and met many Greeks, if anyone listened to someone like Ethan Hawkes character talk rubbish like he did, they would just call this guy a \"M&*^%%$A\" (Greek swear word) and move on.Then there was 20min rambling whilst walking throught the town.And ended up with alot of rambling and the most ridiculous arguement in the hotel room.I dont know why people would watch this movie. So much wasted opportunity to film the country and backdrop. Ethan gets into a fight and falls asleep on the couch, go dance it off at the local tavern zembekiko style. The whole ending was CRINGE. The acting was also cringe. Im giving this 2 stars because they filmed Patrick Leigh Formers house who was a war hero in WW2, by kidnapping a Nazi general in Crete. He dedicated this house for artistis and writers to use.",

            "content": "If a youthful sense of hope informs \"Before Sunrise\" and a wistful sense of regret does the same in \"Before Sunset\", then a begrudging sense of resignation must be the overriding theme of this 2013 romantic drama as director and co-screenwriter Richard Linklater picks up the story of Jesse and Celine 18 years after they first met on a train to Vienna. This time, they are an established couple though tellingly, still not married. Jesse indeed left his loveless marriage after the end of \"Before Sunset\", and the lovers are now in their early forties raising twin girls. For the second time, Linklater wrote the script with co- stars Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy, and together they achieve a level of familiarity with their characters' relationship that makes the incidental story resonate in ways quite unexpected. Unlike the first two films, there is no ticking clock manufactured to provide a need for resolution by the end. Instead, the fate of the couple's relationship is entirely in their hands, and now that we have an emotional investment in the characters, that's what makes this entry more compelling.The movie flows leisurely picking up the particular rhythms of conversations that show how words can become weapons. The story begins at the end of an idyllic Greek vacation where the couple has been staying with friends of various generations. As Jesse puts his now- adolescent son Henry on a plane headed back to Chicago, it becomes clear that his ex-wife didn't take the divorce well and now has full custody of Henry. Jesse shares with Celine his struggle in being so far away from Henry, and they banter about the challenges of parenthood and her indecision around accepting a government job. You would think that the stage they are in their lives would not yield much in the way of romantic sparks, but when they meet their friends for a farewell meal, they return to their familiar selves as they discuss the challenges in making human, much less romantic, connections in the digital age. Their friends decide to treat them to a romantic night at a nearby hotel, and the dialogue comes back to just the two of them. The chemistry between them percolates in a subtle manner as they walk to the hotel stopping to ponder the sunset.Once at the hotel, the friction begins mildly when the front desk clerk, an effusive fan of Jesse's books, insists Celine autograph her copies. Although she obviously served as his inspiration, she had nothing to do with the writing and bristles at the request. Then a phone call from Chicago sets off tensions that had been simmering between the two about the possibility of moving away from Paris to Chicago. Their verbal combat scene has the brutal honesty and up-and-down rhythms that feel more realistic than most such fights depicted on screen, and that's what makes the scene more powerful since things said in the most matter-of- fact way sting with inevitable consequences. Looking understandably worn, Hawke and Delpy know their characters and each other's so well they don't need to sketch out a backstory. We've already seen it, and together with Linklater, they've written it and perhaps will continue to shape their future. The director and actors continue to evolve as much as the characters do. So where will Jesse and Celine as 50-year-olds be? Chicago perhaps\u0085\"Before Tomorrow\" maybe?",

            "content": "We only know Jesse and C\u00e9line for two days in their lives (BEFORE SUNRISE 1995, 8/10; BEFORE SUNSET 2004, 9/10), but as if we have invested too much already, so at the beginning of this third chapter, when we realize that they have been living together for all these 9 years by now and even had two twin girls, is it a truly romantic fairytale comes true or the day-to-day reality has eroded the edges and corners and exhausted their acuity in dissecting what they are really thinking? The triad of Linklater, Delpy and Hawke will present us a most satisfactory delight delving into these two soul mates' current states of mind.Again tracing a one-day journey of the couple in their last day of their summer getaway in Southern Greece, in the morning, they see off Jesse's son Hank in the airport, who has to return to his mother, Jesse's ex-wife, which aggravates Jesse's paternity guilt for being absent in most of Hank's life, elicits an idea to move back to USA with the entire family, while they're driving back from the airport, the discord occurs when C\u00e9line rebuffs the connotation of the unscheduled idea, and a time-bomb is ticking, the first long take in the car signals as a gambit to re-ignite the audience members' coveted interest in their love story. Under the magnificent scenery of this ancient land, their farewell lunch with friends carries a casual spirit but the small talk is overflowing with engaging and emotively touching insights about love from different ages and experiences, Jesse and C\u00e9line are mainly listeners, but Delpy manage to pull off a splendid ad lib mimics a brainless bimbo flirting with Jesse the writer and talking about Romeo and Juliet, so hilarious and this is a patina when they are surrounded with other people. Later, they leave their daughters to friends and head to a hotel since they are treated to have a private evening in a hotel to culminate their last night there (with a couple massage coupon), clearly it is a god-given opportunity for them to express real thoughts without the interference of their children. Meandering in the town, everything is like deja vu, they are like two people deeply in love with each other and the sexual attraction is simmering when they reach the room, but their carnal engagement is interrupted by a pivotal call from Hank, their following t\u00eate-\u00e0- t\u00eate turns sours when C\u00e9line bickers about her sacrifice in the relationship and the frustration of parenting, utters discontent and spurns the prospect of moving to USA, meanwhile Jesse appears to be the calm one, but his passive-aggressive strategy fails to appease her and they begin to blame faults to each other, until C\u00e9line storms out and leaves the deal-breaker \" I don't love you anymore\". From convivial to acrid, it is so spot-on in everyman's world, then the ending plays a nice trick on the ambivalent possibilities of their future, fingers-crossed a fourth one will come another 9 years later and it will be worth the wait. Thumbs up to both Hawke and Delpy's scintillating acting, their resounding rapport and flawless two-hander should have earned some serious awards recognition apart from their effervescent script, good luck for a third time, Delpy could be a dark horse to bag a BEST LEADING ACTRESS nomination, and she is also French, Oscar voters, remember?",

            "content": "The first half of this installment in the series is a little below its high standard, as the dialogue is a tad lackluster and ventures into sex (sometimes improbably) a little too often. The outdoor dinner table scene with three other couples from different generations comes to mind, but is saved a little bit with that last lines from the older woman, remembering her departed husband, which ends with \"Like sunlight, sunset, we appear, we disappear. We are so important to some, but we are just passing through.\"However, the film really picks up when Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy vent the stress and frustration of their characters in that Greek hotel room, where it's absolutely brilliant again. There is a lesson in arguing here as some of the things they say are incredibly hurtful, but there is also such honesty, love, and perseverance, and I think this is what it takes to stay together in a relationship over the long haul. There are also key little moments when either side could simply quit, which mirror earlier turning points, such as when Delpy's character decided to get off the train in the first film. There is a sense of fragility and luck in how these little moments play out, profoundly affecting our lives, but also a sense of strength and direction in accepting the other person, flaws and all, and holding tight. The arc of these characters has such truth to it, the script is excellent, and the acting top-notch. Great ending too. I'd love to see another in 2022!",

As does Jesse's success and artistic career, a topic explored interestingly here in ways that most likely reflect the lives of all the creators and actors involved.We see their pragmatism as a couple, we see their family, we see their connection and we see their disdain and their evolution as people. But only at the end do we see both their hate and their love, often two sides of the same coin for long-term couples. Their love is still there, it's just shifted and adapted to their new lives with all the challenges they now have.I always likes this movie but never connected to it previously, I thought the end was sad, deeply sad, how could two people who love each other say these things to each other? Or feel this way without a total collapse of their relationship? But now, being in a committed, long-term relationship with someone in their 40's, I know that ending well.Besides La La Land, Before Midnight has the most realistic couple fight I've ever seen, it ebbs and flows, and that entire segment harks back to Linklater's little-seen experiment Tape. It's a deep, deep character study and I hope dearly that they make another one and commit to film another era in two people's lives that we rarely see with this clarity and honesty.",

Also, there's not always a closure of things in real life, there are some loose ends or just some dots, similarly you see midnight ending on some dots and not a period or a conclusion, maybe many viewers didn't like that but that's how it is.However, the movie itself is not a great watch unlike it's two predecessors, lacks in dialogues compared to the two.

            "content": "It is time to inform you before the clock strikes twelve (or any time for that matter) that \"Before Midnight\" is one movie that you should not miss out on. The film is the third of a trilogy of the \"Before\" romantic movie franchise that includes \"Before Sunrise\", \"Before Sunset\", and now Midnight. For those of you who did not wake up to Sunrise or ease on to Sunset, please make sure you check them out before going into the Midnight \"all you can love\" movie buffet. The central figures of the franchise are Jesse (played wonderfully again by Ethan Hawke), an intellect writer, and Celine (perfected once more by Julie Delpy), a French environmentalist. For those of you who have not heard of their story \"before\", I will synopsize it. Here it goes, a young Jesse and Celine meet on a Euro train in the mid 90's and had an unforgettable evening in the streets of Vienna while conversing about a plethora of topics while getting to know each other; that is \"Before Sunrise\" in a blink or so. Forward ten years later, Jesse is now a successful writer and Celine a thriving non-profit environmentalist and fate has them reunited in France in one of the stops of Jesse's book tour; hence \"Before Sunset\". Forward 7up on years and we have midnight. In \"Before Midnight\", Jesse & Celine are a full-fledged couple and are no mas \"one time in a decade\" lovers. They live in Paris, and have two twin daughters. Jessie is now an even more successful writer and loves Celine and their daughters, but wrestles with the situation of missing his teen son who resides in the states with Jesse's alcoholic ex-wife. Yes, Jessie did have another girl during Jesse & Celine's decade break from sunrise to sunset. Celine is fed up with the struggles of the non-profit world, so she entertains the thought of linking up with a corporate company. Speaking of links, Director Richard Linklater develops \"Before Midnight\" with a continuum of what made \"Before Sunrise\" and \"Before Sunset\" such delights; insightful conversation, profound emotional disclosures, witty banter, sparkling chemistry, breathtaking scenery, eccentric supporting characters, and so much more. Linklater is due a Best Director Oscar nomination and hopefully it will come no later than next year during Award season. Linklater, Hawke, and Delpy are a trio team of verbal brilliance by mustering up another enchanting & cerebral screenplay to \"Before Midnight\" as they did in \"Before Sunset\", but this one is even better. The scenes between Jesse and Celine in a hotel room disclosing their insecurities, anger, resentments, loneliness, and jealousies were perfectly written; one of the most vigorous dialogues I have ever heard in an elongated movie scene. It will be tough to top this scribe as the Best Screenplay of 2013! But don't quote me on this before I see the rest of the movies coming our way this year. Nevertheless, a Best Adapted Screenplay Oscar nomination is already in the can for Richard, Ethan, and Julie. Speaking of Oscar noms, I think its about time the Academy takes notice of the multi-talented Julie Delpy and nominate her for a Best Actress nomination for her grand thespian effort in \"Before Midnight\". Her multi-dimensional performance as Celine will leave you in a Julie state for a few days. Not to be dismissed, Ethan Hawke delivers another brainy, sharp performance as the scholarly romantic Jesse. He is also deserving of an Oscar nom. \"Before Midnight\" delivers in all aspects in exemplary filmmaking and acting; so I do urge you watch this movie as a morning flick, an afternoon matin\u00e9e, or even better a midnight movie treat. ***** Excellent",

            "content": "Before Midnight is the third in a series of films that started with Before Sunrise in 1995 and Before Sunset in 2004. Now in 2013 we are reintroduced to Celine and Jesse the couple that first fell in love in Before Sunrise and met and rekindled an old flame in Before Sunset. One thing I have really enjoyed about each of the Before films is it's philosophical yet intelligent dialogue. These are not films with a whole lot going on other than great dialogue and character study expressed through strong writing and dialogue. I also give writer/director Richard Linklater a lot of credit for spacing the films out as he has because we get to see these two characters at different stages in their lives and as with anyone and with age so much can happen to us personally with our personalities and the situations we are dealing with. Actors, Ethan Hawke and Julie Deply reprise their roles and also share on the screen writing credit here as they did with 2004's Before Sunset as well. As much as I liked Before Midnight, I would have to say that it is probably my least favourite of the trilogy. I think what I loved so much about the first two films (especially Before Sunset, which I have watched multiple times and it just seems to keep getting better and better) is the chemistry and romance of these two characters. How they once met and fell in love on a train and not knowing if they would ever see each other again, but in Before Sunset, how they can just get up and talk and still have that sense of love and chemistry all those years later as if nothing has ever changed between them, even though it has almost been a decade since they have last seen, or talked to one another. The first two films in the series were light and filled with beautiful European surroundings of where these two characters are and they talk about their love and ask questions about both love, themselves, life and the future. All of which could be dull to some, but because of the fantastic delivery from the actors and the well written dialogue, we often feel like we are right there and we get to care for these two characters and feel a connection to them. The first two films were about romance and making it work and discovering things about one another. I think I enjoyed this magical aspect of the first two films because it felt real and beautiful at the same time. Before Midnight, while I still enjoyed it, does take us on a bit of a different path than the first two films in the series and is what I found to be a much heavier and somewhat darker in tone style than the first two films. I really do not want to give anything away, but as with relationships that have strain, or complications in them, there is a lot of soul searching, self reflecting and trying to figure out love and marriage in this film. At the same time there is also a lot of fighting, and tense and hostile situations between the two characters. Not with violence of course, but with words, which could be equally damaging. I completely understand what the film was trying to do and say with these two young lovers now grown up and facing a crisis in their life, but perhaps that is not what I wanted to see. Call me a deluded optimist if you must, but I was hoping for more of the same from the first two films and just a wonderful and growing connection between these two characters now into their early 40's. I wanted to recapture that innocence and magic of the first time they fell in love and how they were able to start anew again, but most of what I was exposed to was more on the depressing side and instead of being full of magic and charm the film turned out to be a bit of a downer mood wise. Like, I said earlier, I can completely see where the director and actors wanted to take this relationship to the next level and make it feel real because a lot of what they do fight about felt real and what I would assume would be the conversations of most couples when they are in a tense, hostile, or upset state. Maybe, I just personally did not want to see it because I care for these two characters so much that I wanted their marriage to still have that magic and charm with it and that they can still be devoted and hopelessly in love, so to speak. I do commend the film though for trying to make this relationship as real as possible and take it to the next level even if I personally was not prepared for it. My only other complaint is often I felt this time around the dialogue was a little more vulgar and filled with profanity than the first two films and it did not have that classy, or intelligent feel as much as the first two films and at times these characters seemed almost unattractive and ugly. Not in a physical way of course, but because of what they are saying and what they have become. The film still does give us a glimmer of hope and I am still hoping for a fourth round here. If not I will have to remain content on these three films and while I liked Before Midnight, I have to be honest and say that it didn't work for me as well as the previous two, but was a realistic ending and choice, whether I wanted to see that, or not.",

            "content": "Surfacing nine years after the release of Before Sunset, Before Midnight is hopefully the final time we journey into the lives of Jesse & C\u00e9line and just like the previous two chapters, it's an endearing cinematic experience that lives up to the series' legacy, thus bringing Linklater's Before trilogy to a magnificent & immensely satisfying conclusion. In almost all departments of filmmaking, the final chapter is as freshly envisioned, smartly scripted, honestly performed & wonderfully narrated as the last two and in few aspects, manages to surpass them as well.The direction by Richard Linklater is top-notch once again as he makes this story (which shares a relatively similar structure with its predecessors) work extremely well with a rare distinction of no loss in its originality & freshness. The script explores the myriad complications of long-term commitments while also covering problems that generally troubles people in their midlife; problems like marriage woes, career crisis, depleting sex life, increasing boredom, adultery, past regrets or fights & arguments over petty things. And the lush cinematography, tight editing & wonderful music end up infusing flavours of its own into this already impressive storyline.Also, just like the last two times, both Ethan Hawke & Julie Delpy have given a truly mesmerizing, multi-layered & intensely emotional performance as one of cinema's favourite couples, Jesse & C\u00e9line respectively and are at their absolute best in the film's final act, in my opinion. On an overall scale, Before Midnight is an intelligent, absorbing, honest, witty & incredibly entertaining cinema which in the end was truly worth the 9 years wait, is one of the best films of 2013, is one of the best sequels of all time and, along with Before Sunrise & Before Sunset, is one of the best film trilogies in motion picture history.

Furthermore, if you bring a guy to this flick on date night, he can get an eyeful of Julie Delpy angrily yakking to Ethan Hawke for an endless ten minutes with nothing on between her mouth and her waist. This seems to be a habit carried over by Delpy from the 1995 and the 2004 entries in this Richard Linklater trilogy (BEFORE SUNRISE & BEFORE SUNSET).

            "content": "I sincerely believe, an honest conversation between a man and a woman is the purest form of romance. This one is a sequel to the beautiful movies, \"BEFORE SUNRISE\" and \"BEFORE SUNSET\". Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and Celine (Julie Delpy) have grown to their early 40's and they go through the relationship and phase. Celine has twins from the relationship with Jesse. It's Greece and a whole new level of conversation takes up. If \"SUNRISE\" in 1995 made Jesse and Celine meet. \"SUNSET\" in 2004 got them closer by another chance meeting. \"MIDNIGHT\" in 2013 depicts them as they were together since \"SUNSET\".It's a pastiche of romance, their love making, arguments and even silences . There are many conundrums in the talk and they surprised me as ever like the earlier two movies. If in SUNRISE, love blossoms, then in SUNSET it settled down, now in MIDNIGHT it darkens. It's better to talk to crib to argue than to be silent and that's exactly how it is depicted. This is more personal though than the earlier films, but as a \"BEFORE\" franchise fan, I loved their connect and the basis and reasoning of their argument seemed good, though at times kiddish but that's how adults behave. Arguing for petty things. serious for the unimportant and jovial for what they have got already. The cinematography stands great, the art, the costumes, everything is perfect, But it's not for these aspects, I watch this film, it's only for the conversation that the couple have. Kudos, once again to Richard Link later, Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy for having written such lines. For things the talk fluid and simple and connecting. For most in their prime 30's or early 40's this may seem like their daily talk and for those who have not got into a relationship, this is a taste of how things may turn out. But all is fair in Love and that's exactly how this film ends. Richard Linkalter is one of the most underrated directors I believe.OK, now a word before I complete my review, I am appalled by our Indian Film Distributors, they put a date of July 26th for release, then postpone this to August 23rd, while the movie was released long back in March in USA and other parts of Europe. So instead of waiting for a theatrical release, I just downloaded and saw it. I badly wanted to catch this in theaters, but am happy coz I caught it and am so delighted.It's another 5/5 to one of the most beautiful romantic movies ever. Together, this trilogy stands above all others in the Romantic Movies genre and will always be close to my heart.",

Script is probably the best in 2013 so far. If \"Before Midnight\" won't going to be nominated for at least couple of Oscars - shame for the awards. Everything in this movie works, and if you liked the previous two, than you will be in nirvana watching \"Before Midnight\" - it is that good.

            "content": "Conversation movies need substance more than anything. If you're going to listen to people talk for about two hours, they should have something interesting to say. Richard Linklater knows that. His subjects are relevant and there is always a valid point behind his film's reflections. His insight comes from an honest, caring interest about life and love, and he delivers it in a subtle, truthful and intelligent way. Before Midnight, being his most flawed conversation film, is still not an exception in that aspect. It deals with something as relevant as the downfall of love, in a way that defies years and years of Hollywood propaganda about soulmates, half oranges and unrealistic partner expectations. I thank him for that. Evasion movies can be entertaining, but they never tell what happens years after the couple walks into the sunset, Linklater does. Relationships too often fall into poisonous dynamics which seem more unavoidable the more nonsense and bs they are; resentment can accumulate for years; selfishness is always on the menu and the way you perceive your significant other can blur so much that you'll wonder who the hell is that person and why are you together in the first place.My humble interpretation is that \u00a8true\u00a8 in \u00a8true love\u00a8 means real, as in The Matrix. It's happening, it's true, along with the poisonous habits come reconciliation routines, familiarity and care. You can either stay in that relentless circle of love or you can try on your own, and maybe find yet another circle.In Before Midnight, Linklater best accomplishment is to inspire all of that reasoning with a film riddled with flaws, that feels as tired of itself as the couple, as if it was a due paper work you must fill in order to go on with your life, something unpleasant that has to be done rather than delaying it any more. Characters lack layers, their personality malfunctions are hideously exaggerated and their reactions are way too much forced, again, as if the movie itself wanted to get it over with.As in love, it's your choice what part of the circle you want to stay with.",

They summer they are spending in Greece is almost over and Jesse's son is heading back to America. This little event leads to Jesse questioning his decisions in life and leads to trouble in his marriage. In preparation for watching this movie I watched the two previous ones. Before Sunrise was OK but a little slow moving. Before Sunset was better but still nothing amazing. This one is far and away the best of the trilogy and feels the most real. Sunrise is about a chance meeting on a train. Sunset is about reconnecting love after a book tour brings him to the place she is. This one deals with real world issues and finally answers the question of if these two should be together or should they have left it as a one night meeting. I'm sure I'm not the only one to say this but this reminded me of me and my wife and fights we have had. That aspect may have helped me really get into this movie but either way this is the best of the three and I recommend this which is something I can't really say about the other two.

Jesse is also struggling to maintain his relationship with his teenage son, Hank (Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick), who lives in Chicago with Jesse's ex-wife and who, after spending the summer with Jesse and C\u00e9line on the Greek Peloponnese peninsula, is being dropped off at the airport to fly home. Jesse has continued to find success as a novelist, while C\u00e9line is at a career crossroads, considering a job with the French government.Its a treat to watch Celine and Jesse again. Maybe its because of the fact that I watched all three movies within a short time frame, but this didn't have the magic and charm of the first two movies and it has nothing to do with realism. The focus on the other characters was mundane, while the fights that our lead characters, though true to themselves, came off as a plot device more than anything. But, I still enjoyed it a lot and the insight the arguments provided were intriguing since I thought that neither one was wrong or right and it was age and normal routine stuff taking a toll on them this time around. This trilogy is one of the more fascinating cinematic experiments. Richard Linklater's third and final (?) rumination on romance is one of the most mature and realistic depictions of long term relationship. I hope Linklater makes another sequel... in nine years.7/10",

            "content": "In \"Before sunset\" one thing that registered with varying intensity with different audiences was Jessie's mention of his son (aged 2 or 3 then?) who was the only reason for his marriage to stay afloat. I can still remember Ethan Hawke's deeply moving sincerity. \"Before midnight\" picks the story up from there, opening with a scene of Jessie and Hank (now pre-teen or just-teen) at a Greek airport where he sees him off, flying back to the States to his divorced mother, to start high school. Before parting Hank intimates to his dad \"this was the best summer vacation I've ever had\" - at once the most heart-breaking and the most heart-warming scene I've ever seen.After this prologue, \"Before Midnight\" unfolds very much like a symphony. The first movement is Jessie and Celine's car ride, with their angelic little twin daughters in the back seat, back to the idyllic seaside haven where they would spend the last day of this vacation with some very nice people. The second movement depicts the ensuing wonderful time with these people. The third movement offers the closest reminiscence to what we've been waiting for in the last 9 years, Jessie and Celine strolling as they did before, deep in conversations that we hope will continue through a lifetime. The final movement, with titular reference, takes place mainly in a resort hotel room, a romantic final evening that their considerate Greek friends have arranged for them, booking the hotel and baby-sitting the twins.The first movement, in the car driving back from airport to seaside resort, re-acquaints the audience with their old friends of 18 years, filling them in with what had transpired since that wickedly clever ending of \"Before sunset\" \u2013 \"Baby, you're going to miss the plane\". Over the course of the 9 years, some things changed, and some things remained the same. With the ever slightly noticeable ebbs and flows of emotion and nuanced subtleties, we get glimpses of their joys and woes, hopes and fears. The movement ends with the twins in the back seat waking up.The second movement offers something that we have not seen before, other characters that are not just props. Various interactions with three other couples (old, young and their own age; hosts and other guests of this vacation) culminate in a scene of most scintillating conversation over a meal they share.The third movement, as mentioned, is closest to what we have seen and fully expect to enjoy again \u2013 a continuing, life-long conversation, with just the two of them, as they wander almost aimlessly through some of the most beautiful places in Europe. Even if this is the ONLY thing you've come to see, you won't be disappointed. The scene concludes with them finally reaching sea-side, sittin down at a caf\u00e9 to watch sunset. That scene, while beautifully elating, at the same time introduces an ominous note, as Celine watching the sinking sun murmures \"Still there\u0085..still there\u0085..gone\".For the fourth and last movement, critics unanimously praised the wonderful trio (Linklater, Hawke, Delpy) for their courage in breaking out of the cocoon of romance, staring hard reality in the eye, and tackling it. Idealistically romantic audience may not like to face hard reality \u2013 problems in marriage, conflicting career goals, transient infidelity, burdens of daily existence and parental responsibilities - but this last movement is really a gem. As I said in the summary line, a wait of another 9 years is absolutely worthwhile.One final word. The most touching scenes, to me, are the ones when the protagonists involved are not even on the screen together. We see Celine taking a call from Hank from where he is en route in the flights back to The States (he is calling her, not his father), when she greets him with a loving \"Hi sweetie\" and finishes by responding to what he said \"I love you too\". And this is the woman who stole his father from his mother.Some IMDb reviewers are rooting for \"Before Midnight\" for best picture, screenplay, lead actor and lead actress, with which I totally agree. What I would only add is Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick should get at least a nomination for best supporting actor, the brevity of his scene notwithstanding.",

I was curious like everybody else about the story where it ended in the second part. Without a proper confirmation whether it was a happy ending or a sad like as usual. So this movie states that from very beginning itself without holding anything behind.It was a rare trilogy, I even did not know the third movie was in production, all the sudden it is now in digital copy. There are lots of fine elements in the movie to like it, One of those were dialogues. I mean what they talk, about life and others stuffs. The presentation was a bit different than earlier two. The smartest thing they did was adding half a dozen of extra characters to the story in the appropriate timespan. I thought was surprisingly good but for some people it did nor work. The nude scene was unnecessary, for glamour? I don't think so. I thought the movie should have kept open for all age groups like first two.I think this movie series will go on and on for next 30-40 years till both of them dead. If it happens then it will be awesome, probably I'll be old when fourth sees a light. Hope you enjoyed it as much I did or see it if you have not seen yet.8/10",

Ethan has become a successful author, and Celine has been offered what is apparently a high government post in France. They have spent the summer on a glorious Greek island. They should be extremely happy, but they're not.When the film begins, Ethan's son from his first marriage is returning home at the end of summer to be with his mother in Chicago. The dilemma around which the plot revolves is that Ethan would like the family to move to the US so that he can be closer to his son. Celine has no intention of giving up her job and her home to move to Chicago. There is simply no obvious way to make this situation work.The plot of the film is really a series of discussions--actually arguments--between Jesse and Celine as they struggle with their own needs and the needs of their spouse. The dialog rings true, but it's painful to watch and hear.Both actors are attractive. In fact, Julie Delpy is strikingly beautiful. However, at age 43, she no longer has the slender, wand-like figure she had when she was 26 or 35. (In fact, Celine mentions this in the dialog.). So, the actors have aged, just as their characters have aged. We want these two intelligent beautiful people to stay in love, and to work out their problems and be happy. Can they? Will they? I'm not sure.We saw this movie on the large screen, but it will work well enough on DVD. (Some of the great touristic shots of the Greek island will be lost, but the rest will be OK.) The film will stand alone if you haven't seen the two earlier movies. However, it will enhance your enjoyment if you see all three in order.",

It surely needs a lot of innovation and talent, both from the director and actors, to successfully and elegantly tell a story of two lives in the form of three movies, all set 9 years apart, each in the span of a day. Over these 18 years, we feel like we've grown with Jesse and Celine, and their lives are so intimately etched with ours.This part is set in a Greek village, and seems more real and brutally honest. It gives an intrusively intriguing glimpse into the couple's life, nine years into their relationship. We see a happy but disgruntled couple; regrets, kids, hopes, dreams... all these seep in. Sometimes, the depth and intimacy of the their conversations and arguments feel too private for us to even be there.The acting from the two leads is exceptional without a doubt. Hawke and Delphy have worn these characters along the years almost as their second skins. In this part, we see a completely new side. All the pent up regret and rage makes them confront each other with such aggression and sarcasm. Love is not completely lost between them; as long as they're communicating, we still see some kind of hope.The first scene of the movie, where we see Jesse seeing off his son (from first wife) at the airport, and the hotel confrontation scene are exquisitely executed and brilliantly acted. Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick ['The Omen', 'Moonrise Kingdom'], the young actor who plays Jesse's son Hank, is quite talented and surprisingly charming.The movie ends on a pleasing and magical note.

            "content": "We fast forward in the love story of Jesse and Celine. Jesse now lives in Europe and they've had two children together. They're almost at the end of a summer vacation in Greece as Jesse drops off his son (from his previous marriage) to the airport. As they drive back to their vacation cottage, Jesse begins to lament the fact he's missing important moments in his son's life. As they discuss options for addressing this, tensions run high and their relationship is tested in new and unexpected ways.One word constantly came to mind as I watched the final instalment of this trilogy: reality. Some have said that Before Sunrise was unrealistically romantic and hopelessly idealistic. They've also said (and I agreed) that Before Sunset was the better of the two because it offered a sizable dose of reality along with the hope of a more mature romance due to the life experience of the characters. If Before Sunset was a sizable dose on reality, then Before Midnight can be described as a full on punch in the face of it. Much of the naivet\u00e9 of the first two films and characters is absent; in hindsight, this is to be expected. This film is strictly about the nature of a relationship as it's matured and it caught me off guard. I definitely viewed it differently; in a way that it almost seems out of place compared to the other films. Because the first two were so idealistic, this one completely shattered that notion and presented a raw, unfiltered view of being together with someone for such a long time and the inevitable challenges this presents. So much so I was shocked at a number of points as it unfolded and at times, uncomfortable. It seems Richard Linklater intentionally wanted to smash the romance bubble he created earlier in the series (much to my surprise). I've found it really nail down my first impression of this film, because I've seen the others so many times and this one is so different and not quite what I expected; I've always found expectations for a film are crucial in how I judge it. While others have praised this turn in the series, I found the drama slightly over the top. I realize now (after reading other reviews) that this trilogy is very much a personal experience for the viewer; their interpretation of it relies heavily on their own life experience and the position they're currently in a relationship. Maybe I'm just not in the stage of life I need to be in to appreciate this film (I guess I'm somewhere in the Before Sunset stage) or maybe I'm just too idealistic on love. Either way, after my first viewing, I can say I definitely enjoyed the other films more.Now having said that, this is a very good film. The dialogue between Delpy and Hawke remains stellar and their chemistry is undeniable; especially in the scenes where they fight as I found those very convincing. These scenes are clearly some of their best work in the series. The essence of the location in which the film unfolds is captured very well (as was Vienna and Paris in the other films). I especially enjoyed the dialogue and camera work as they walked through the old ruins. The film also presents many thought provoking ideas of how love and attraction change over time through the addition of some new, interesting supporting characters. I really enjoyed that aspect of the film.I found the ending somewhat unsatisfying, but have a strong feeling this is is a film I'll appreciate over time. While not my favourite of the trilogy at this point, this is a must see for fans of the original films and one of the better films I've seen this year. www.themoviesnob.ca@the_movie_snob",

            "content": "Unlike most reviews that seem to be expressing some hope, I believe there is no chance this choreography could, in real life, go on forever. Actually, I believe that, as expressed by C\u00e9line, this summer in Greece would mark the beginning of the end of their relationship. This is even more depressing, as the brilliant, gorgeous Greek light shines on them.The epic dramaturgy - as compared to the classical dramaturgy of the previous \"Before Sunrise/Sunset\" movies dominated by romantic love - exposed in this brilliant film is about the two characters getting somewhat tired of each other, slaving to their kids, and coping with the onset of aging.In such a situation, certain \"pathologies\" increasingly express themselves. In this case, it is C\u00e9line's almost hysterical, childish reactions to Jesse's desperation of having, for all practical purposes, to abandon his son; and her unwise lack of humility with which she is willing to abandon everything.Almost brutally the trio Delpy/Hawke/Linklater exposes C\u00e9line's acquisition of body weight, associated with becoming less physically attractive -- to be sure, C\u00e9line is still more attractive than most women of her generation, but not as eye-catching and mind-boggling as before. C\u00e9line's reaction to \"becoming a fatty\" (remember her remark in the 2nd, Sunset, movie?) is an aggressive stance toward Jesse. Jesse, on the other hand, is still very tied to, and co-dependent on C\u00e9line, and tries hard to fix their relationship with creativity. But he inevitably and ultimately must fail, at least outside of a movie setup.Unfortunately there is no way of fixing Jesse and C\u00e9line's relationship unless C\u00e9line improves her body mass index, and reacts more humbly and less hysterical. Alas, at least in real life, this is very unlikely to happen.So, I am afraid, in the next sequel - if this team continues in some configuration - we might see Jesse and C\u00e9line coping with their separation, and with increasing age and desperation - and ultimately with loneliness.",

            "content": "\"Like sunlight, sunset, we appear, we disappear. We are so important to some, but we are just passing through.\"It has been 18 years since Jesse and Celine first met on a train and had their lives changed with that encounter, as did ours because Linklater, Hawke, and Delpy created one of the most authentic romantic and memorable relationship on film. This is the third film of the franchise and in my opinion it is the best one because it feels even more real than the previous two. The previous films focused more on a romanticized idea of love, but here the tone of the film shifts as we see this couple facing true challenges in their relationship. There is no doubt these two characters love each other deeply, but that doesn't mean their love is perfect. In Before Midnight we are at a stage in Jesse and Celine's relationship where they have some important issues to resolve. Their relationship is on the verge of a breakdown due to several problems they never dealt with until now and have really escalated. The performances are so good that you never feel like you are watching a movie; it is more like a documentary about a couple facing some serious problems in their relationship that they are trying to resolve through communication. I don't think I've seen better dialogues about relationships than I saw in Before Midnight. There were some very emotional moments and overall I thought these 3 films complemented each other very well. Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and Celine (Julie Delpy) have decided to live together after their encounter 9 years ago in Paris. Jesse left his wife and son to live with Celine who immediately got pregnant with twins. In the present the couple is spending time in a vacation home in Greece with a writer who has invited the family to spend the summer with him and his friends. The film opens at the airport where Jesse is saying goodbye to his son, Hank (Seamus Davey Fitzpatrick), who is returning to America after visiting his father. On their way back to their vacation home Jesse discusses with Celine how fast his son has grown and how bad he feels about not being able to be near him during these critical years in his life. Celine doesn't want to return to America because they tried that in the past and it didn't work. She also has a great job opportunity at home, and this minor argument seems to only be the tip of the iceberg in their relationship problems. They are as cute as ever together, but there are still many unresolved issues that really put their relationship on the verge of failure. Despite it all this still is a very romantic film that explores new ground in the Before trilogy. It has been a great deal of pleasure being able to walk alongside this fantastic couple through the different European cities and listening to what these two have to say to each other about love, life, and relationships. They are so good together that it never becomes tiring or tedious to sit through. In this third film I felt like they were at their best together. The arguments felt so real and authentic that it sometimes was uncomfortable to sit through because we really want to see these two work their issues out. Like any other couple they say hurtful things to each other and that really builds the tension in this film because they are so charming together that we really want the two to find a way to resolve their issues as soon as possible. I really loved the ending in this film and thought it was a perfect tie to the first film. It was the best film of the trilogy, but you won't appreciate it as much if you haven't seen the first two movies to fully understand what is at stake here. Before Midnight is one of the year's best films and amongst Linklater's best movies. It is a heartwarming, raw, and funny movie about love and relationships with some terrific performances.",

I can just imagine the experience for those who had seen the three films in real time, like reuniting with old friends after every nine years.In \"Before Midnight,\" Jesse and Celine are now living together with 7 year old twin daughters. They are spending a long vacation in Greece with Jesse's writer friends, and they are at the tail end of that holiday. At this point in their lives, Jesse is saddled with guilt because he wants to spend more time with his son who lives with his mom in Chicago. Celine on the other hand is deciding whether to get back into the work force with an offer she calls her \"dream job.'The couple were given a free night at a beach side hotel on their last night. As the previous two movies went, there was a lot of talking in this film. But the talk here was definitely more mature, from poignant to painful, and every word felt so true.Couples who watch this together will most likely re-examine their own relationships. I am pretty sure many of the things you will hear spoken between Jesse and Celine you have heard in your own conversations with your spouse, specially those who have been married for more than ten years or so. You may even want to watch this by yourself first so you can reflect on your own marriage. The message is so direct to the point and frank, it can be so uncomfortable to hear in its familiarity.The ending again is so open. The audience is invited to give their own ending as before. Director and head writer Richard Linklater succeeds once again in bringing our old friends back to us, as charming and as vital as ever. Ethan Hawke and especially the luminous Julie Delpy shine and enthrall us like always with their natural and realistic performances. Will this be the last chapter of their love story?

And just before the \"Before\" series becomes stale, changes got in motion.In 1995, two young strangers meet on a train and fall in love. Nine years later they reunite. In both films, the romance seemed so enchanting that it was unrealistic. \"Before Midnight\" breaks that rule with Jesse and Celine approaching a mid-life crisis and possibly getting sick of each other.Jesse and Celine live in France with Jesse's son from his previous marriage living with them in the summertime. When he heads back to his mother's Jesse realizes that since he is entering teenage hood that he needs to be in his son's life now more than ever. This leads to our protagonists bickering over living arrangements.They vacation in Greece where some very beautiful shots are taken on the Greek landscape. Best looking of the three movies, easily. We get some throwback to some great conversations but this one actually seems to unfold and go places while the other two didn't.While hearing this intelligent dialogue, we see their marriage crumble before our eyes. But Hollywood must save the day. This look into dark territory is both original and realistic. It also provided a great throwback to Ingmar Bergman's \"Scenes From a Marriage.\" I guess the only thing preventing perfect scores in this series is that each film could have been about 50 minutes and offered us just as much. That's what Bergman did with his miniseries. But \"Before Midnight\" has come the closest to getting a perfect score.I love this series, I love its stars, and I cannot wait for the next entry in 2022.3.5/4",

The movie ends by showing that this is their life until the day they die.Among the trilogy, this is the most casual of all them in dialogue and setting. We are in Greece, and we don't see the beauty of Greece. We see informal gatherings, like the situation where being married can't make you explore a lot. The movie focuses on the conflict regarding Jesse's son from his previous marriage. The central part of this movie was the setup that an argument is bubbling up until the entire third act is a full-on argument. For me, this is a perfect ending to the trilogy. Of course, they end on good terms, but seeing them in a relationship is ordinary. And in most relationships, we question what made them so close well for the Before trilogy. It's the two previous movies.Overall this trilogy is fantastic, and watching them all is a blast. But I recommend monitoring each of them separately. It helps with the immersion.",

Now in their early forties, the pair must deal with the realities of reaching middle-age.Hawke and Delpy are co-screenwriters along with director Richard Linklater. Hawke and Delpy are also in nearly every scene, most of the time being the only two people on screen. A \"talky\" film could be dull in most cases but this super-talented pair are stunning and brilliant in their abilities to bring real life to the screen so well.Whether philosophizing about life over dinner with friends, joking around, looking back on life, concern about the lives of their young children, or having a terrible argument, this film has such depth and truth, it is mesmerizing.The long argument scene is so effective it is easy to switch sides one would take as an observer. The acting and writing are so powerful that way. Also, considering that so many of these long conversation scenes were done in single takes (including a car ride with sleeping kids in the back seat), it is not an exaggeration to call this film a masterpiece.Considering the genius of the two prequels, Before Sunrise and Before Sunset (also very highly recommended), Linklater, Hawke, and Delpy already deserve a special place in film collaboration history.

The second viewing creates the addiction. I felt with all three films that I was a cross between a voyeur and an intellectual fly on the wall. I can understand how so many viewers will scream 'it was boring', All three films have a similar trait of slowly turning the screw and leaving you gently overhanging a precipice in the last scene. No guns, no explosions, no answer but a lot of questions. The realism of the dialogue is at times very unsettling. By the time we get to Before Midnight the characters have twisted and turned over 18 years. Moving from angelic to angst, hope to cynicism, freedom to entrapment. It is so uncomfortable especially when one has been through similar experiences. The parting of the 14 year old and father hits hard as does the sad reference to the supposed 'drunk mother from hell' with usual custody. Of course we should all know that it is never black or white and that is the beauty of this film. I was not initially convinced by the car scene and even felt like I was actually there at the dinner party as an embarrassed guest. They set the film up. By the time we get to the Billie goat walk, you should be hooked and the hotel scene,god that is scary. I am sure that anybody who respects the film will have been there, treading on eggshells, broken glass and avoiding emotional mines. Forget about liking it, the hotel scene is an acting and script masterclass. The symbolism of Celine baring her breasts and then withdrawing them is crucial.Days after seeing the three films I hope you have daydreams, visualisation, questions and flashbacks.

            "content": "One of the initial shots of Before Midnight is not something that has been seen before in the trilogy; the camera swings around to reveal the family that we have been anticipating since 2004, twin daughters sleeping in the backseat. The camera had been mostly static previously, capturing the couple as they walked aimlessly and talked endlessly. The settings, Vienna and Paris, were beautiful and exotic, but they would have fallen in love in any city in the world. It does not look cinematic, and yet that initial shot at once conjures up so many questions of this new chapter of their lives. This time, they vacate in the southern Peloponnese and it is just as stunning, but there is nothing blissful about the experience, and the most riveting scene takes place in a shabby hotel room, where Linklater swaps the iconic medium two-shots that have been pervasive throughout the trilogy, unblinking in their long takes, with shot-reverse-shot, and cuts up the space between the couple as they argue. It is not until the final shot that Linklater really uses the setting, and we dolly back to unveil the shimmering ocean and gorgeous harbour-side twinkling in the night. There is another distinct break from tradition; whereas Sunrise and Sunset almost exclusively featured only Jesse and Celine, madly falling and re-falling in love, Midnight has a cast of other characters, and it is here that it slightly falters. For all the philosophical musing and long-winded anecdotes about love, they feel like ideas and conversations for our main characters, but instead of trimming sensibly, they have been reintroduced into the dialogue of others. It is easy, for example, to compare the wide-eyed, lovestruck experiences of the young couple to another young couple that met on a train all those years ago. And when Xenia Kalogeropoulou heartbreakingly reveals that she is forgetting the little things that her late husband used to do, and how it is like losing him all over again, it feels a lot like Celine's monologue in Sunset, where she ends with one single clear memory: the red in Jesse's beard. These feel less like fully realised supporting characters, and more like younger and older versions of Jesse and Celine. But returning to the pair reveals a deeper and more mature narrative yet. Sunset ended on a magnificent cliffhanger, but we all knew that the heartbreak of the missed opportunity was too great, and that they would not let another chance slip away. They have twin daughters. Celine's accent comes and goes but has noticeably faded. Jesse's novels are now famous enough to be recognised by Greek receptionists (and this creates probably one of the best and more subtle scenes of the movie, where Celine is visibly bothered by being placed in a little box and designated as a character in Jesse's life - I have no doubt that the Madeline version of Celine is fully realised, successful and happy - moreso than Celine anyway). When they rewind time and talk of that fateful train encounter all those years ago, it is startling how different they are now; Jesse hesitates just slightly when asked whether he would act the same way, and it is clear that Celine is no longer that radiant, carefree muse that caught his eye so long ago. And then there is perhaps the finest scene in the trilogy yet, which physically separates the pair within the frame and has them explode over each other's dialogue. There is so much raw emotion that spills from their mouths, but I think it is not overly vicious for the sake of hurting the other person. Like the back and forth pinball conversation in Vienna, it is defensive; they each attempt to explain their own perspective and their own feelings on juggling the various responsibilities of their chaotic lives. It is easy to write an argument and have two characters drown each other out in their anger, but in this case they pounce onto every word, broken promise, illogical leap and change of opinion, and throw it back into each other's faces, trying to gain an edge. Every phrase is twisted and extrapolated to its extreme, all except one; when Jesse confesses that he 'ruined his life' for her singing, it is such a clear opening for Celine to attack and tear down his arguments on how committed he is, but she relents, possibly because she thinks their relationship is still worth saving. He too, does not explode when she hangs those fatal words in the air and admits she does not love him anymore, because he is not so sure he is ready to believe it is over. The previous two films feel like daydreams compared to Midnight. A fresh-faced youthful Jesse described love as an unselfish, giving and beautiful thing. But it is clearly not as easy to say that when juggling such an emotionally painful predicament like their's. In the midst of their argument, there is a moment of such startling and brutal honesty. Celine confronts him with accusations of an affair from long ago (and I am sure that this is not the first time it has been brought up), and Jesse does not outright deny it, but adamantly reaffirms his love and commitment to her. It is so brilliant because we believe his lifelong commitment, but we also know that the affair has happened and has lingered over their relationship ever since. Infidelity is something that is so often treated as a comedic device in movies, but it is so easy to forget that it is a very real thing in many real life relationships. Here, we trust that their bond is strong enough to withstand such an affair, and move on from it. The red in his beard may have vanished long ago, but their love has matured and learned many lessons.",

For ex, Jesse argues that 99% of our self is automated and the Stefanos responds \"it's like my penis, it is a small part of me but it needs a lot of attention\". I mean, really?? And the story about the nurse who recounts her experience about men waking up from a coma to check their penises while women would ask about the loved ones. I don't have anything against sexual jokes but these felt like they were forced into the conversation for cheap laughs. The argument between Jesse and Celine at the hotel room had some moments of deep insight but could use less clich\u00e9s in terms of men-women debate. The writing was impressing at times but felt juvenile and cheap at others. But I think what disappointed me the most was that I didn't feel the love between the two. The feeling that reigned was resentment from both sides and while the film wants us to believe that this is real love as opposed to the romantic sense of it, their love felt so fragile, like it could fall into pieces any time due to built up resentment and anger. I still liked this film overall but it could be better.",

Salute to the excellent scenic glamour and the camera job. There are three major huge scenes in this movie: 1) Car drive of Jesse and Celine with children, 2) dining table talk about married lives of couples and 3) an intimate sequence at the hotel room. The first two scenes are just okay for kids to watch with parential guidance. The third sequence contains nudity so unsuitable for children. Few issues i found includes the concept on feminism is too forced in the movie and I felt too much irritated at the final parts. I felt too much of woody Allen's style repeated again and again.",

            "content": "After the sublime \"Before Sunrise\" and the brilliant \"Before Sunset\", this was a little disappointing. Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy (in particular) were both excellent as ever but I didn't think that the script was nearly as a strong as those of the first two films. The dialogue in the second half of the film didn't seem nearly as finely crafted as in the first two and this film's first half. However, Richard Linklater's direction was excellent. I particularly loved the use of extremely long takes. Jesse and C\u00e9line's conversation in the car, lasting about 13/14 minutes, is one take. The scene was so engrossing that I didn't even notice for the first five minutes!This film was more about real life than the first two but the attitude expressed by the young Greek couple, Achilleas and Anna, was very depressing: they're definitely going to break up at some point and they both accept it as being an inevitability. Now, if you're already miserable with your partner, that's a sensible attitude but they were very happy and in the throws of passion. If that's your attitude, you might as well break up now and spare yourself the future (and perhaps unnecessary) pain. But I'm a hopeless romantic, which is probably a major part of the reason that I adored the first two films as much as I did!Neither Jesse nor C\u00e9line came across smelling like roses during their massive argument during the last half an hour or so - at times, they were both rather annoying - but I thought that most (but not all) of her criticisms of him were more valid than his criticisms of her. Jesse seems rather self-centred in the film, expecting C\u00e9line to be the one to make the sacrifices.While this film was not of the same standard as the previous two, it's still a very good film in its own right and I am really looking forward to the (possible) fourth film in the series. If it follows the pattern, it should be released in 2022. I'm guessing that it will be entitled \"Before Dawn\"! As the three films stand now, they constitute my third favourite trilogy after the \"Back to the Future\" one and the original \"Star Wars\" one, though mainly because of the merits of \"Before Sunrise\" and \"Before Sunset\".",

            "content": "The third film in Richard Linklater's trilogy, after Before Sunrise and Before Sunset, is the most satisfying and complete of the revered series. Most sequels grow stale by resting on the formula of their predecessors. The strength of this trilogy is that each episode, filmed nine years apart since 1995, reflects a new perspective on the changing relationship of its central characters Celine and Jesse. This has prevented the series from losing its essentiality because with each addition the characters and their attitudes to life and each other have changed over time and feel anew.One of the unique aspects of the trilogy is that it is compromised almost solely of dialogue. This is rare today when Hollywood films prefer action and effects over dialogue and character. There are only five or six sequences in Before Midnight, each one comprised simply of characters talking. These conversations are rich, purposely reflecting how relationships are tested by time and conflicting perspectives. While the previous two films merely teased the possibilities of Celine and Jesse's relationship, Midnight reflects the consequences and the regrets they have about their choices. It leads into some huge fireworks but refuses to exchange the depth of the series for pure melodrama. It is still funny, deep and personal, often achingly so in its long and authentic exchanges.Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke reprise their roles as Celine and Jesse, who are now an unmarried couple, with twin girls of their own. Jessie has divorced his wife but is struggling with being separated from his son Hank (Seamus Davey-Patrick). While holidaying in Greece, Jesse and Celine debate the idea about them moving to the US so that they can see Hank more often. Celine is reluctant, considering the possibilities of a job offer instead. Some later discussions talk place in the villa of an elder writer named Patrick (Walter Lassally), who is housing them and some other Greek couples. One of Celine and Jesse's most heated conversations takes place in a hotel room, which tests the increasingly brittle foundations of their relationship.The screenplay by Richard Kelly, Delpy and Hawke draws a complex binary between the speed of time, dwelling on the irreversible events of the past, and fixed perceptions that force one to look too far into the future. The source of Jesse's anguish is not simply his current separation from his son but being divorced from the irreversible years of Hank's life. His plea to move back to the US is fuelled by preempted nostalgia for his son's teenage years: \"If I miss these years, they're never coming back.\" Celine's pessimism stems from a culture clash, believing they won't be happy back in the US, and predicting that this is how people breakup, comparing their relationship to a ticking time bomb. Her conflicting perceptions of time are amplified by her resistance to autograph Jesse's novels, containing semi-autobiographical details about their relationship. There are also brighter, romanticised feelings drawn from loss, with another character reflecting on how they were still able to still see all of their miniscule details of their partner after they had gone. It's suggested that it is important not to love one person but to have a love of life by reflecting on those fleeting moments while you still can.The film's various ruminations on time and space are embodied by Linklater's camera as it lingers over the handsome Mediterranean setting. One of the more amazing scenes is a car ride conversation that is sustained for nearly fifteen minutes without a single cut. The naturalism of the scene is exemplified by the director's insistence that every word of dialogue was written down and not improvised. The duration of the medium shot, framing Jesse and Celine together, demonstrates how they exist in the same spectrum of time but through their bickering they often forget how lucky they are to share the important moments together. Colour and space are used distinctively, with red and green primary tones enriching the vibrancy of the domestic scenes, while in the hotel room the spaces are more contained and the tones drab to infer a claustrophobic tension. As the couple argues, the reverse angle shots and deep lenses fracture and separate their spatiality to remind us of their conflicting beliefs, drawn from perception and nostalgia. Both performances achieve an unbroken magnetism, supplied by the director's willingness to provide his actors with as much time and space possible to invigorate these roles.Although we have seen many films examine relationships, few have analysed the couple via the framework of insightful philosophical musings and with such an intelligent and consistent discourse. How many romantic comedy-dramas are sophisticated enough to have conversations veering from gender roles, the inevitability of death or the dread of spending another fifty years together? The film is about the way time and age have believably shaped the once optimistic and impulsive beliefs of both Celine and Jesse. It is not just a 'boy meets girl' story. Its 'boy meets girl and realises they're going to die someday.' It encompasses all the troubling realities that Hollywood likes to shield from us.",

Sequels, huge-budget action thrillers, probably a few comedies, a few animations, you name it. Richard Linklater's Before Midnight is a sequel, but it's not exactly the sequel that applies to the other characteristics I previously mentioned.Where movies like White House Down and The Lone Ranger blow things up for two hours, Before Midnight is more of an intellectual movie. Before Midnight is an expertly written and acted drama about love. It's the kind of movie that has you listen, rather than just watch.18 years after Jesse and Celine met on a train to Vienna, Jesse and Celine (Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy) have twin girls and are vacationing in Greece. But this time, their trip is a little different. When we first met them, they barely knew each other. Now, they really know each other, and we watch the two interact and slowly fall out of love.Like its predecessor, Before Midnight is co-written by Hawke and Delpy themselves, which just helps with the realism of it all. The script is sharp, and so are the leads, who have obviously grown into much better actors in the past 18 years. Before Midnight is real. It is occasionally funny, and it never feels forced.This is the best reviewed film of the year so far, or at least one of them. But I can't quite call it the best movie of the year. It is one of them, definitely, but it isn't the one. Why? It's simple. It really isn't that much of a movie. All it is is Hawke and Delpy walking around in a beautiful location and talking. But this time their conversations are much better. Before Midnight knows what it's talking about when it comes to love, and I doubt anyone is willing to argue.A-",

There are some differences to the previous installments, namely the first part of the movie is centered around a lunch, echoing the feasts of Ancient Greek theater.The characters have matured, their conversations as well. In hindsight, what began as quasi-artistic scenario of Before Sunrise has obviously been a conscious choice of the authors. Before Midnight is still one long conversation. Yet, it reveals some midlife angst of family people. In the case you're successful enough to afford yourself life in Greece, that is.In any case, i can hardly wait for the next movie that should be released in 2022, if the author follow the previous tempo.",

Many fans of the first two parts resent the third for being a little different, but that's exactly why it's the best for me. Before Midnight is a real, realistic and life film. There is no romance, but that is why there are problems and conflicts. Infatuation has a shelf life, it is fleeting, blurs vision, idealizes, hides the flaws of the other, and emphasizes virtues. True love is for a lifetime, with many struggles, fears, obstacles, bad days, but one goes through it all in communion. As the saying goes, in both good and evil. Acting is also the best from the trilogy, but I think that on the one hand it is expected because the actors themselves are older, more experienced, then they are better. I have to say that Ethan Hawk was great and rich to me, both in talent and visually, the man looks great and I'm confident enough that I can say that without a problem. Julie Delphy is also great in her role, certainly the best actress in the entire trilogy. The conflict is masterfully made because there is no right and wrong side, they both have their arguments and can understand them. Otherwise I think the movies are great connected, a lot of attention was paid to the links and details.",

The story has many elements of our own romance: meeting in Europe, talking our way through darkened streets and trains playing an important side role. Fortunately we avoided the stress of their relationship (ours is 40 years and stronger) so beyond those fleeting intersects their story is not ours. It does, however, go some way in explaining why both of us love these three movies and particularly yesterday's: the third one. I think this movie is a phenomenon; I was continually amazed that Hollywood would financially back a film centred on the relationship of two people who are on camera for the entire film. This film had trains rather than exploding cars, gentleness rather than aggression and intelligent talk rather than interminable shouting. This film was so un-American in that it was built around two people talking to each other for the length of the film. These two people exchanged ideas constantly; they talked about ideas rather than simply talking about the mundaneness of life: what's for dinner, who does the shopping, are we getting a good deal from the tradie, etc. Before Midnight was such an endearing film because it had people talking about the \"glue\" that held their relationship together and this makes the movie a massive cut above others; these people actually have subjects of substance to say to each other. As a viewer you might get tired of this constant dialog but to us it was refreshing. I would recommend that you make every effort to see this film and if you already haven't rent the previous gems so the story gets filled in.",

            "content": "The Before trilogy is a unique piece of cinema that is one of the most enchanted stories I've ever seen, yet I've probably never seen a fictional depiction of love ever expressed so genuinely or realistically. Before Sunrise was not a Box Office smash by any means, being independently made as well, it's kind of shocking that it spawned two sequels. But this is one of the rare times in our society a sequel was put into production because the audience they spoke too wanted more for the intellectual stimulation and embracing romance. It reached to a section of fans and critics ate it up. Thankfully, the team came backing punching the audience more with each film.\"Stupid people talk about people, averagely smart people talk about things, intelligent people talk about ideas.\" This quote has always fascinated me and is held true in each of the Before movies. Topics discussed here is what people should be talking about, not the latest petty gossip in their circle of friends. The key to total connection in a relationship is the talking about the mysteries of the world, human nature, and one's personal beliefs; that's what all three Befores cover beautifully. The trilogy's most pure nature is a collection of conversations between two people developing a romantic relationship through what they learn about each other. The dialogue was so engrossing that the entire first hour flew by and I hadn't written a single note on my legal pad. A movie where practically nothing happens would sound like a bore in theory and could even be a disaster in the wrong hands, but here it captivates the viewer.Each conversation the couple has, I identified with their thoughts; they may have been ideas I had at one time, a conversation I actually had with someone else, or something I've never thought of before that makes total sense about love, life, and personal psyche. This is what a great love story should be. This is what a great movie should be. This is how a great movie representing the building of a romantic relationship should be. The truth is, love means different things to us at different stages of our lives and the different stages of a relationship change the mood of said relationship, which is why all three movies make sense and are necessary.The most complete film of the three. The first two were about wanting of love and a happy life, but Midnight shows how the couple handles the success they wanted. Every couple has their problems, every human beings has their problems, so naturally relationships will always be tested. We never see Jesse and Celine argue in the prior films, but they do erupt here and portray a believable illustration of the later years of a relationship. That's what makes Midnight the most successful of the films, it pushes the envelope of the \"perfect\" movie couple. The conversations in the final film are less about psychologically what they're thinking, but the trials long-term couples face. It's an astounding experience.Rating: 10/10Grade: A+Watching character dive head first into conversations about life has never been so mesmerizing as it is in the Before trilogy. Communication is something lacking in society today, the Before trilogy shows us how a successful relationship is built: through talking. Julie Delpy and John Hawkes are transform into their roles and especially knock their performances over the fence in the last two films. The collaboration between two leading actors and the director, Richard Linklater, writing the later films results in a tightly told story that unfolds without fault. One thing that marks these films different from most lack of cuts within a scene. Many scenes in the Before trilogy run un-interrupted for ten minutes or more. It's very hard thing to do, but it's done with natural grace. With Before Sunrise, Before Sunset, and Before Midnight we feel closer to life, love, and ourselves. The Before trilogy is like a flower, that grew by the seeds of life, and blossoms into love and happiness.",

For those that have seen the two previous films, Before Midnight is a welcomed return to the relationship of Jesse and Celeine. The Before trilogy has always been a romance that has kept the fluff out. They are films that show the realistic, non-idyllic nature of love, and this film is no different. Again we see Jesse and Celeine walking the streets and conversing. In a traditional sense, nothing really happens, but this is not a boring film at all. Director Richard Linklater has such a talent for writing interesting, intelligent and real dialogue, and this dialogue is on showcase here. The conversations in this film are also far funnier than those of the first two films. We have know Jesse and Celeine for as long as they have known one another, since 1994. They know one another frontwards and backwards. Just like any relationship that has lasted this long, they start to become bored with one another and see flaws they did not see before. In the first film, they showed the optimistic nature of youth, in the second film, they began to become more grounded with their growing age, and in this film they have been through the long haul, and are much wiser and mature because of it. They both have real world problems now that they didn't have when they were nineteen. In this film we see the third part of the ever growing and evolving relationship of the two, and Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy play the two characters as well as they ever have before. Before Midnight is a very welcome addition to the now trilogy of films, and I would argue that it is just as good, if not better than the two previous entries. If you are a fan, like myself, there is no doubt you will love this film. If you aren't a fan, come-on seriously, its time to become one.",

I think if it had just focused on one issue then it would've been a much stronger film. i found the beginning to be slow, unnecessary and frankly--boring. That conversation with the three couples around the dinner table I found particularly boring. I mean, I get what Linklater was trying to do. He wanted to show aspects of a relationship from three different age groups. But it just seemed so contrived and perfunctory. I really didn't start to get interested until the hotel room scene. But even that scene didn't seem focused enough. One minute they're making love and the next minute they're yelling at each other. Again, it just seemed so contrived. It just didn't seem to make sense why they decided to argue at that particular time of the day. And it wasn't just any ol' argument--it was a BIG argument!I think BEFORE MIDNIGHT tried to be like an Eric Rohmer film but wasn't as successful. The main problem may have been there wasn't a main point. For example, in SUMMER, the main point was a young woman who tried to go on vacation by herself without feeling lonely. In BOYFRIENDS AND GIRLFRIENDS, the main point was the difficulties of starting a career and a relationship with the right person. But what was the main point of BEFORE MIDNIGHT? A married couple takes a trip to Greece to discuss whether they should move to Chicago or not? That doesn't sound very interesting to me.

He feels that he is missing out on Hank's life and at the same time of loving his life with Celine as he lives in Paris with her and their twin daughters, feels bad for missing out Hank's life. He knows if he went home instead of missing his flight he would be living a miserable life with his now ex-wife.Over dinner with their Greek friends, each friend has a long conversation about something that is all equally interesting to us as the audience. Humours conversations as they parody each other and emotional conversations about life and love. Raised wine glasses as they toast a few times on different subject matters that we would all toast ourselves if we had our own wine glasses.One of the friends, a young couple talk about how they met and stayed in contact even though were far apart which Jesse and Celine were interested in. They said they Skyped and talked loads over it, and even fell asleep on cam together. In other films, a popular culture reference like this would seem forced, but in this film it is relevant. Here we have 41-year-old Jesse and Celine who met in 1994 and re-met in 2003. Nine years of no contact. And then we have this young couple who because of modern technology were able to stay in contact. This reflects how times have changed and how \"Before Sunrise\" could only exist in the time it was made.As Jesse and Celine walk to a hotel suite that their friends have booked for them so they can have a night off and together away from their kids, they both talk deeply about love and life, what they regret and what they do not. As they get to the hotel they start to have sex but are interrupted from a phone call from Hank as he has arrived at the airport. Jesse signals to talk to him but Celine jokingly says 'good luck with your mom before hanging up. Jesse is annoyed that she said this as he feels she shouldn't say this to him, but she says he is old enough and that they have joked before about his mom. His mom is an alcoholic and apparently verbally abusive mother and hates Jesse and Celine. Hank at the airport told Jesse that she hates Daniel more than him, who we presume is her boyfriend. Celine can't stand her and wished that they had Hank to live with them. Jesse suggests that they move to Chicago and to be near him, but will only see him every other weekend and holidays, which Celine feels like is a waste and unfair, even though Jesse was only speaking mostly hypothetically.The couple start to argue, sometimes intense and other times humorously. With these two wonderful characters, who may be the best characters ever created. You can tell how different there are, you can predict each others next act just as they predict what the other person is going to do. You can tell Jesse will be more laid back and Celine will be argumentative while backing herself up. She is scared of change as she has said before and even said she was scared to come on this Greek holiday just in case of a new revolution.The film almost ends on yet another highly ambiguous ending after Celine storms out of the hotel room and doesn't return. Jesse looks around the room at items they almost used. Like wine poured in glasses. A tea Celine made but didn't drink. A messed up bed sheet as they almost had sex. In the previous two films we had similar shots as it reflects on the locations in the film before it ends, I was scared it was going to end here with Jesse alone in the hotel room, I was even prepared to shout out 'oh come on!' if we were left with an open-ended and ambiguous ending like the previous two. But luckily it cuts to Jesse walking up to Celine at a caf\u00e9 outside on a peer. He pretends to be a stranger and chats her up which she doesn't like as she predicts he is being sweet again which will then end up with them loving each other and having sex, which she previously criticised for being always the same.While chatting up Celine, Jesse pretends to be a time traveller Jesse coming back from the future sent by Celine to tell her younger self her life will be fine. He pretends to read a letter from a napkin which she finds ridiculous at first before he tells her straight from his normal self that she pretends that life will be a fairy tale just like their daughters and life isn't like that without a few negative things, and that he loves her unconditionally and accepts every flaw of hers. She starts to cry, then mildly smiles and asks more about this letter. The camera slowly pans back as we see them get along again as Jesse reads Celine the letter from her future self.",

Some of the war-between-men-and- women riffs in an extended dinner party scene may seem dated (\"Was this movie made about sixty years ago?,\" my wife asked), and though the characters have a lot to say about the passage of time and our perceptions of it, there's nothing here as perceptive or as provocative as some of the best stuff in \"Waking Life.\" Otherwise it's all good, with the proviso that I'd recommend watching the first two entries in the \"Before\" series first; it's possible to piece the backstory together, but there's a lot going on in this amazing film, and all three, IMHO, are really worth seeing.",

            "content": "Before Midnight is the last chapter of that wonderful and vastly underrated trilogy named 'before'. And certainly it finished with a golden key. Just like in the others installments, there is a lot of talking, and generally about banal and apparently small things, but that's really what is great about it. After all, 'the minor details are the most important'. The goal of these films is to show life in its minor details, it captures the gestures, the expressions, and as I already said, minor moments of life, like the table conversation in a vacation sunny day, that is apparently a event like any other but tells much more about the story than probably any fight or discussion. A great scene and perhaps the most romantic part of the film come in the end, at the climax, when the couple is discussing about their relationship, under the moon's lightning, at midnight. That scene was one of the greatest that I've seen, or at least, one of the most memorable. That film really impressed me, even more than the previous ones, and I must say it's the best of the whole trilogy. Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy acting are greater than in the other two films, and they dare a lot more than in the last installments. In a short resume, the content in this film has more discussions about sexual life, has more swearing, and in fact, is the 'strongest', if that is the word. But the goal still the same, it shows life how it is, again, if you like films full of details and that don't skip anything, you'll love this film, just like I do. An extremely original, instigating, and well told story. There isn't really that much to talk about the film, it needs to be seen. 9.0/10",

I have watched all three many many times and recently purchased the Criterion box set.\nHas there ever been a more multi talented and approriate trio then Linklater, Hawke and Delpy to bring this trilogy to life. Delpy has written a number of screenplays and directed movies. Hawke has written a number of novels and Linklater is without doubt one of the most original American directors with an interest in European cinema.\nThe dialog is so natural and flowing it's as if we are eavesdropping on Celine and Jessie from 1994 to 2013. These are realistic emotions and dialog and makes the dialog of big time romance movies like Titanic juvenile and laughable.\nThe acting of Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke is so good it doesn't appear that they are acting. I suspect that one of the reasons why is that they wrote the screenplay along with Linklater and parts of Celine and Jessie mirror their real life views on life and love.\nThe motivations and interests of Celine and Jessie maintain a continuity throughout all three films and the real life aging of Delpy and Hawke adds even more realism as they move from a fairytale romance to the reality of long term relationships.\nThe closing scene in Before Sunset which in my opinion is one of the greatest in the history of cinema had Nina Simone singing Just in Time. In Before Midnight their twin daughters are named Nina and Ella. I'm also thinking that Ella was named after Ella Fitzgerald. Isn't this what you would think Celine would name her daughters?",

Maybe, because I am more mature, I was able to realize the subtleties of this work. Before Sunrise was released in 1995 and nine years later Before Sunset (2004) and lastly Before Midnight (2013). The first movie shows the meeting of Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and C\u00e9line (Julie Delpy) on a train going to Vienna. The second movie they encounter in Paris. The third we meet them in Greece. Thus, we can follow a love story about a real relationship.Richard Linklater is considered a talented director of American independent films. Possibly a little remembered by The School of Rock and well-known by Boyhood. The budget for the three movies was $8,200,000. Although the film was produced every nine years; the plot always centered in two characters, which unfolds in a period of the day. In addition, the movie uses extensive dialogues and in some moments the couple is arguing. Impossible not to identify with these moments and not be close to one or both characters. Undoubtedly it is a movie more art than entertainment.I think it's a great movie. Sensitive and intimate in the right way. This allows us to create empathy for the characters.

            "review_title": "Coming full circle",
            "content": "I should start by saying that I might include some spoiler-ish stuff in this review. Nothing major, but I will reference a couple of plot points that, if you are really spoiler adverse, you may want to avoid reading.I loved this movie. I love the whole series, actually. All of them, Before Midnight included, are just so well thought out and acted, not to mention the incredibly gorgeous cinematography. I suppose that it helps that I'm only slightly younger than Ethan Hawke, so many of the life milestones explored in the movies are occurring around the same time in my life, but I think viewers of any age will find a lot to love here. As with the previous two films, Before Midnight is essentially a character piece that plays out as a series of conversations without any real \"action\", so I'll put my standard disclaimer here that if you are an adrenaline junkie kind of person who wants big, exciting, heart-pounding thrill rides, this may not be the film for you.Before Sunrise explored love and youth, Before Sunset the beginning of what I like to refer to as \"true\" adulthood, and Before Midnight brings us to the beginning of middle age and family. On the surface, all three movies explore the relationship between the two main characters, Jesse (Hawke) and Celine (Delpy). But the writing is deep enough that it offers up a slice of something deeper. In Before Sunrise when we meet Jesse and Celine, we get a glimpse into the magic and the foolishness of youth. The existential angst of not knowing who or what we want to become, the wide-eyed idealism that allows us to believe that truly anything is possible, and the extreme honesty of always living in the moment. In Before Sunset we see how age has started to gel us into what we will be, good and bad. We've loved and learned, hurt others and been hurt, and we are more guarded with our heart. And now with Before Midnight we get to explore middle age with Jesse and Celine.And this is where, in a sense, we have come full circle. If Sunrise was partly about Jesse and Celine's youthful honesty, Midnight is about the secrets and fears they are harboring in their hearts. Some viewers might believe that putting \"Midnight\" in the title is apt, as this movie is not about the joy of discovering love, but rather about the difficulty of maintaining it. Still, having experienced some of this myself and having many friends who have gone through it, I guess I would say that I don't feel it's dark so much as just plain old difficult. Love, as it turns out, is a tricky thing.Orson Welles once said \"If you want a happy ending, that depends, of course, on where you stop your story.\" You see, movies and books and even our own fantasies like to think of love as a firework burst. The sky is dark and then, BANG! A beautiful cascade of color and sparks lights up the night as we watch, mouths agape, at the wonder of it all.And that is what love is like, or rather a facet of love. But lasting love, the kind that lasts after the sky has faded again, is a different beast all together. That kind of love is more akin to later in the show when the smoke from previous explosions begins to obscure the sky and some of the bursts are repeats where you say \"Well I've seen that one already.\" And you start to notice that it's getting cold and the bugs are really starting to eat you alive. You start to think that maybe you should pack it up and get back to the car before the crowd starts clogging up the roads and asking \"do we really need to see the rest of this?\"This is where we find Jesse and Celine. Throughout the entire film I never had a moment of doubt about their love for one another, no matter what they were saying. The truth of their feelings was shown with perfect simplicity in the first minutes of the film during a car ride. But the smoke of their lives is beginning to obscure the truth of their feelings. Jesse is grappling with an unpleasant truth that due to choices he's made certain opportunities have gone and will never come back. That he's gained so much in exchange is a fact he's lost sight of, and his regret triggers a deep, almost paralyzing fear in Celine that a happiness so profound she can't even express it could suddenly be taken away from her. Her response might seem odd to some, but for me it was surprisingly honest and human. Sometimes when facing the prospect of losing something very dear to us, our instinct is to get it over with. To make our worst nightmare real so that we don't have to worry about it anymore.What Jesse and Celine need is to hold on and hope. To wait for the smoke to clear so that they can see the next burst and experience that feeling of wonder again. Whether they do or not is, as with the endings of the previous films, left somewhat ambiguous. It is up to the viewer to decide if they saw that last little burst. I have my own opinion, but either way I mostly just hope they keep making these amazing films every nine years or so. I promise I will keep watching; I hope many of you will as well.",

Real time, long shots, conversational dialogue, absence of plot, real locations. The films are one long conversation between two characters but it's just so engaging on a variety of levels. First the performances, which are made with such depth and magnitude. The chemistry between Hawke and Delpy is astonishing. It truly is hard to believe their not in love, although I'm sure there is love between them. They have a mutual respect for one another that really shows. You can feel the tension between them radiating off screen at times which makes the believability unquestionable. The writing is so rich with matter yet so naturalistic and justified. I was amazed that the basis of the trilogy was walking and talking, yet what Celine and Jesse talk about sums up, to me, everything life musters. And then add in the actual story these two characters share and Linklater has captured the complexity of life in a way I've never seen before. It's painfully real. There were so many subtle parallels within the writing which symbolised the 'passing through time' concept. Each scene ignited a sense of wonderment within me, causing me to ponder over my life showing the universal themes buried within the text.I watched the trilogy within 24 hours because I just found the whole piece of work to be utterly refreshing.

The couple is together, have children and have to face the stress and uncertainty of everyday living and figure out a way to keep the love alive. Their fairy tale suddenly got real.Curiously I feel in much the same way about the movie.Despite the great relevance of the themes and brilliant acting I feel like the magic has passed me by in this one. The themes seemed rehashed, the philosophical insights shallow and insignificant, the gender roles a clich\u00e9 bordering on the unbearable, the plot monotonous and the overall perspective of things depressing.Perhaps it is a realistic portrayal and my impression solely a consequence of me growing older and becoming accustomed to a bit of philosophy.

            "content": "Two decades after Richard Linklater's beguiling 1995 romance Before Sunrise and nine years after 2004's equally charming Before Sunset, Ethan Hawke's American writer Jesse and Julie Delpy's French environmentalist Celine are back together in Before Midnight and they are still captivating company for anyone who fell for them during their previous strolls. Now, though, they are no longer footloose bohemians but parents of angelic twin daughters, on the cusp of middle age and facing the issue most movies ignore: how to keep love alive in a long-term relationship.If your idea of a good romance is one that climaxes with a last-minute dash to the airport, then Before Midnight probably won't turn you on. The film begins at an airport - as Jesse says goodbye to his teenage son - and what ensues during the following hundred minutes is deceptively casual - the couple's chatter seemingly improvised but actually carefully scripted by the supremely talented Linklater and put on screen with subtle craft.The movie is basically a three-act play, where the first act has an extraordinary set of single takes in a car ride that features talk of children, careers, and most importantly, aging apples. Up next is an idyllic Peloponnese villa, where Jesse and Celine are stationed with a host of friends. With all of them together, especially at a dinner that I didn't want to end, we hear about different aspects of love. Then comes the final act, where Jesse and Celine are left alone as they go on an evening stroll through the Greek ruins and stone streets to a posh hotel for a romantic night alone. Taking on the familiar walk 'n talk style of the previous films, we're initially brought at ease as the two simply ramble on together about anything and everything, playful and challenging in equal measure. But upon arriving at their room for what should have been an amorous night, a simple phone call is the impetus for what is a nasty, brutal argument that sees them ripping one another to shreds on just about every level. Misunderstandings, neuroses, and pent up frustrations snowball, all but shattering the fairy tale myth of the first two films, as their intimate confidences curdles into acrimony.But if you have been with Jesse and Celine through the slips and stumbles of their romantic journey, then their long, flowing, deceptively gripping conversations ripple with the realities of life. Jesse and Celine, clearly so comfortable in their characters' skin, indulge in intelligent banter, swapping Woody Allen-esque one-liners - nicely snarky, appealingly abrasive. It's been another nine years between films, and if so much has changed in the meantime, the unparalleled chemistry between Hawke and Delpy hasn't slipped even a little. They may be older, a bit wiser, and certainly more wrinkled, but their performances are nothing less than natural throughout. Witnessing their ageing, nagging, toying love on screen is a true privilege.Before Midnight is like an old friend who has grown sharper and saltier with life; and for students of cinema, the film is a master-class in the portrayal of human nature. It's one of the most convincing and charming representations of long-term coupledom you'll ever see - a literary as well as cinematic achievement to cherish!",

Great filming locations lead to a pleasant photography set on the Greek islands. Never gets boring. Only gets interesting! Great to see as a couple, and also amazing to see alone.

            "content": "Before Trilogy has nothing extraordinary to depict. It doesn't features any aliens attacking the planet, or the expensive CGI driving the plot. But it has its own reasons of being every bit as great as it is.As we go through the trilogy, one by one, we see two humans, fairly ordinary, evolve in love and life. First comes the young, enterprising love - full of passionate kisses and endearing moments. Then we move to a wiser and more responsible state of love in the second film. We get insights to career, life choices, and their effects on the characters. The third, and final film of the trilogy - Before Midnight - serves as a conclusive and realistic, tough not ideal, end to 18 years of character portrayals.As individuals move into their 40s, issues regarding children, career, love, and life penetrate the cutaneous layers and gain profoundity. In such transition, even a slight jab on the self-esteem of the partner can turn catastrophic. Before Midnight conveys all this without ever biasing with a character. Camera's neutrality is forever maintained.Like its predecessors, this film too uses long takes, minimalistic editing, and realistic dialogues to enhance our sense of connection with Jesse and Celine. It effectively uses just a single camera take to acquaint the viewers with all the major happenings of the past 9 years. It's so brilliantly written that not for a moment does it feels like a deliberately inserted piece of information.The argument sequence in the hotel is a work of genius. The intensity keeps on fluctuating as we dearly wish the fight to end. The fact that no one seems to have a clear edge over the other, relatively greater cuts in a movie fueled on long takes, insert shots, and a sense of claustrophobia enhance the tension of the sequence.Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy, who have also contributed to the screenplay, just command respect for their performances. Their portrayal of Jesse and Celine transcends what we call acting. Whether they fight or take digs at each other, walk down the streets of Greece or crack jokes, the sense of spontaneity is always there. They never look like acting.Before Midnight is a much heavier and darker film than its predecessors with greater subtext and thematic depth. But in all these turmoils, them being together at the end is beautiful, and that's how the how trilogy is - beautiful.",

It's a couple like any other couple. Jesse, Celine and their girls spend time together in Greece where everything is close to perfect, but at the same time, there are things that both Jesse and Celine are worried about. When we see Jesse and Celine together with their friends, they really have a good time, but that may only be when they are drawing attention from others, and not between themselves. At home, they may spend a lot of time raising their kids, but they don't get any alone time together. When they eventually are together at the hotel room, they begin to think about the negative things, because they have not had enough time to talk about it before. And then it explodes. Their glasses are full, and the problems are swallowing all the good things. The important thing is to solve that fight, where everything seems to fall apart after about 10 years of consistent love. I have a girlfriend I have loved for 8 years now, and I have felt all the things Jesse and Celine have felt. I'm sure most other couples have felt that, too. There are no ups without downs, but you can get through those bad things. The most important thing is the great love - the reason why you two are together, and still need to be. There is always a way. I'm glad Jesse and Celine found their way. I was really nervous of if they were going to break up. But I'm glad they are still the same couple as they were 20 years earlier.",

It's an approach that is probably more suited to the intimate confines of a theatre than to the big screen (and indeed I'm certain that it *would* make excellent theatre), but it still worked pretty well in this movie.There is much to commend. The fine performances of Ethan Hawkes and Julie Delpy make the squabbling couple believable albeit completely infuriating. The dialogue is (thank goodness) well-written if a little pretentious and over-theatrical (told you it would translate well to the theatre). And of course the setting in Greece lends itself effortlessly to the romantic theme.The thing that holds this movie back is that, despite the excellent dialogue, it is actually about nothing more than a domestic row. A row, that if it wasn't set between an American and a Frenchwoman in the southern Peloponnese would be insufferably dull. Domestic rows can make good - yes there it is again - theatre but they've been done many times before and much better by the likes of Pinter, Ibsen and numerous others.Before Midnight could not have been executed better but it is limited by its ambitions.

There are few characters more fully fleshed out and rigorously believable than Jesse and Celine and the naturalism with which the actors write and play these characters has never been more apparent or appreciated.

            "content": "Third installment in Richard Linklater's Before romance trilogy (for lack of an official name), that began with Before Sunrise (1995) and continued with Before Sunset (2004). We revisit the lives of Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and Celine (Julie Delpy), 18 years after their first all too brief encounter in Vienna and nine years after their second equally short sexual interlude in Paris, that left them with twin girls. Now they meet up again in Greece for vacation as an almost genuine family, which causes long simmering emotions to stir, both for good and for bad. Though they agree their life as a semi-divorced couple (they were never married to begin with) with two adorable but ever attention seeking children leaves a lot to be desired \u2013 he has problems dealing with his vicious real ex-wife and connecting to the son he sired on her, while her career is at a crossroads and as a devout feminist, she is bothered by the feeling society wants her to totally give herself to her children instead of being successful \u2013 they do still deeply care for one another as is evident when they visit Greek friends where it seems their love life is the most sweepingly romantic of all of them. However, when they are given a luxurious hotel room for one night, their differences and mutual feelings of lack take over, causing quite an argument between them. This film is quite amazing in that it's basically a few scenes of the two protagonists and a few minor characters engaging in endless conversation about ordinary things, yet it's totally compelling due to the completely believable performances, the fast paced, realistic, and often witty and snappy dialogue and the relatibility of it all as these are totally regular folks experiencing everyday problems. An education in minimalist filmmaking, each scene can take up to 20 minutes with no more editing, music or other movie trickery than needed so you can really flow with these characters. The romantic tone of the piece is underscored with a little help from the beautiful small town Greek settings and landscapes, except for the hotel scene \u2013 which takes place entirely in an ugly, modern, eerily lit boring white room \u2013 which of course is the only location where Jesse's and Celine's relationship turns into bitter strife and mutual rapprochement, until they seem to reconcile at an outdoor restaurant a little while later. The neutral zone between man and woman might as well be a battlefield for dominance, Linklater suggests, but if both parties really care for one another and aim for simple understanding, nothing can stand in the way of true love.",

            "review_title": "A Rare Experience Still Fueled By Spontaneity and Genuineness",
            "content": "Wow, don't you just love it when there's finally a film that actually delivers on or exceeds your expectations? Before Midnight is that movie. I loved (how can I emphasize that more?) the first two (Before Sunrise and Before Sunset) so much so that I just couldn't wait to see the third installment, but there was that roaming thought of whether or not it could actually meet the quality of its predecessors. Frankly, there's so much to love in Before Midnight, and it's definitely one of the most interesting projects in cinematic history where we witness two actors aging together over two decades as each addition is produced nearly ten years after the prior one. It's an extraordinary experiment, and you just fall in love with the characters and acquire deeper knowledge of their complex personalities with every new chapter. The acting is unlike that of any other films, but I'm absolutely picking Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy as one of my favorite, if not my absolute favorite, performances of the year. As usual, their performances are amazingly organic and natural while the chemistry in their relationship is matched by no other. By the time you're finished with all three films (or even finished with one of them), you'd think they're a couple in real life, but they're sadly not. It's not only their words but their physical responses (gestures, emotions, etc.) that create this sense that they truly know each other inside out. Honestly, if I find a woman half as astonishing as Celine, I'd be a lucky and happy man. She's an incredibly cute, intelligent woman with a sexy French accent that makes heavily interesting conversation- what else could be more attractive? Jesse (played by Ethan Hawke) is an equally lovable individual who possesses an equal amount of depth- the intellectual and wise-cracking fellow! There are countless pauses and particular mannerisms that create this natural and realistic atmosphere as if you're actually viewing someone else's life rather than just watching a theatrical production. Now, I don't mean to sound condescending here, but it undoubtedly saddens me to see people (though they're obviously the minority) pan the film simply because it's primarily focused on dialogue/discussion. They're of the mentality that films have to contain consistent action and artificial relationships (that last one is more unintentional, of course), and I extremely hate the traditional mindsets that construct rules on how you write screenplays and structure your plots and stories. If cinema was as great and artistic as it was, there'd be no need for restricting visionaries to what they can and can't do. I believe that rigid standards and rules utterly cannot exist in the realm of art and storytelling. This is why we only encounter a unique and memorable film- any type of story form for that matter- every once in a while. These storytellers honestly don't care about what the bosses expect whether it's introducing a turning point exactly on page 22 in your screenplay or intentionally assembling a three-act film; it's typical, generic, and artificial at this point. With Before Midnight, there's never that hint of artificiality or inclusions of Hollywood archetypes and clich\u00e9s. The viewers are basically transported into other people's lives- fully immersed- and that's essentially what stories are all about: leaving your irritating life to occasionally experience the fun and liveliness of another. The script of this motion picture is so witty and genuine that I never felt boredom out of the constant reliance on talking. Their conversations are frequently fascinating, and I just hope that I can find someone, one day, who talks about various topics, philosophical, psychological or personal, rather than gossip and more bullshit. However, I found it slightly distracting how overloaded the film was with conversations about sex in its first half; it ruined the magic of the first two in a way because Sunrise and Sunset delved into deeper discussions instead of the annoying obsession with orgasms and blowjobs that Hollywood romantic comedies and movies, in general, encompass. On another note, the cinematography can often be overlooked, but these three's excellence also stems from its visual presentation of beautiful European cities like Vienna, Paris, and Greece. You're perfectly welcome to enjoy the spectacular sights of these cities as they walk through them in real-time, debating about another compelling subject. So, when moviegoers complain about the lack of cinematic substance in these films, I can certainly refute by showing them these two sides- an immersive experience within a city, marveling over the numerous landmarks, and intriguing, spontaneous dialogue on the other side- or them both intertwining, more so. As I kept on watching, I never wished for it to end because these vibrant personalities seriously engross you, and in my opinion, the enjoyment received from these films is indescribable. You're laughing along with the characters (whether through their teasing one another or unified laughter following a clever joke) or you're worried about a developing issue in their relationship and what will come of it. In sum, you're sensing these emotions and feelings as they're sensing them. It can't be said enough, but this trilogy is unquestionably a rare feat, and I can't bear to wait another ten years for a sequel (these are one of those films where I hope the series will continue on forever and ever). Once I'm finished with the film, I can't stop thinking about it a day or two after and while I'm remarkably satisfied by the experience, I'm also upset about its conclusion. If only this were a TV series that I could return to every year, but that is unfortunately not the case here. Before Midnight is a must-see, and at the moment, it could very well be my favorite film of the year, no doubt about that. Very rarely do I finally reach a film that feels special, memorable, and fresh. I'm glad Before Midnight was that eventual encounter.",

            "content": "The third part in the acclaimed Before-series of films: Before Midnight. It's one of Hollywood's indie darlings. Anyone familiar with the previous two, will note how relatable and real it all feels. This is the films' main strength and I'm pleased to report the third outing doesn't disappoint in that department nor in many others. This is a very strong movie which is all the more special since it's the third outing in the series. As you know, not many third parts (in trilogies) are particularly good\u0085 The acting is still strong and feels natural, as does the dialogue, and it builds on themes from the other two films in many, interesting ways.Since the previous film ended on a cliffhanger (did Jesse stay with Celine or not?) the first thing you'll want to know is what happened. We see Jesse saying goodbye to his son at an airport. We sense a distance between the two. Jesse then walks outside to\u0085Celine talking on her cell phone. They both get in their car and drive away, but not before the camera pans to show twin daughters asleep in the backseats. We now realize that not only are Jesse and Celine together, but they also have twins in addition to Jesse's son with his ex-wife. As you'd expect, the film follows their relationship for the rest of the day, exploring its highs and lows through endless conversations\u0085and if that sounds boring, then you have never watched a Before-film. These are conversations that are simultaneously mundane and crackling with intelligence at the same time.The people who have watched the other two films will obviously get the better audience experience, since they can note the differences (and similarities) in the way Jesse and Celine act. In Before Sunrise, they possessed the same wit you'll see in Midnight, but they were (hopelessly) romantics at the same time. In Before Sunset, the subject matter darkened a bit. Jesse was married and had a son whereas Celine had a boyfriend. In Midnight, their conversations have stayed the same time and changed simultaneously. They have become able to tease each other more skillfully, having now spent years with each other, and know how to push each other's buttons. There's a scene where Celine notes how Jesse ogles women. She's obviously worried that these are signs that Jesse is not physically attracted to her anymore. Jesse responds by joking with a Spanish (or was it Greek?) accent that he doesn't ogle them, but 'makes love to them with his eyes'. This causes laughter and voil\u00e0, the touchy subject has been skillfully swept under the rug. These kinds of details show that how they converse and what they talk about, has changed. It's ironic that Celine notes at one point that she's missed 'talking' with Jesse: now that there are no more trains or planes that one of them needs to get on, now that they have all the time in the world, the way they've talked has changed and the amount of talking has diminished.There's also a difference in terms of time which has always played a big part in these films. In Sunrise, Jesse and Celine have their own trains to catch and in Sunset, Jesse has a plane to catch. In Midnight, however, this time pressure is non-existent. This doesn't mean that everything's all right now, just that time weighs on Jesse and Celine in different ways: how they feel about growing old together, their fading looks, Jesse's worries about missing his teen son's forming years, since he lives with his ex, etc.The late Roger Ebert noted the following in his overall positive review: \"The exchanges are never less then brilliant, the jokes pop out with unmatched speed and there are no dead silences. Small wonder, then, that Jesse and Celine's conversations don't feel like real life at all. The script is as stylized as that of any classic screwball comedy -- only the zany antics are missing.\" This made me shake my head in amazement for a second: 'Before Midnight\u0085not realistic?' Then I realized of course that films could never truly risk imitating real life, since film is supposed to be a compact version of real life. As Hitchcock famously said: \"Drama is life with the dull bits cut out.\" The dialogue can't be truly realistic, because it would damage the movie. If there were too many casual silences during Jesse and Celine's countless well-constructed arguments, it would take the 'zing' out of it, it would be too real. If they didn't have their jokes ready to go at a moment's notice and instead having them take more time to 'think of' the jokes (like 'real life'), the conversations would lack punch. Ebert is basically saying that real-life arguments have many pit stops, for example where the arguing couple is unable to formulate what they want to say or the many moments when one of them is unwilling to argue. This kind of 'ultimate realism' approach might be the stuff of 8-hour long slice-of-life documentaries, but it wouldn't work in a dramatic, narrative-driven film, simply because it would take too long and it would become boring quickly. A film has to 'compress' the entirety of what's happening. I can see what Ebert is saying and he has a point, but I still find Before Midnight to be highly realistic; if not in terms of conversations, then at least in terms of its many emotional truths about people in long-term relationships.",

The play meandered languidly but inexorably towards a classic male chauvinist - feminist civilized if painful skirmish. There is a backdrop of parental guilt and angst as well as an interweaving of different philosophical points of view to make it really captivating. Just when you think that the script is fizzling out, the elephant in the room suddenly accelerates into a head on argument. The male point of view was presented consistently and credibly true to life. The frustration from continual rebuttal of honest love was exquisitely bitter sweet both when dealing with his son and as well with his partner. The woman questions why she is continually sacrificing her career by hanging on to a traditional ambitious paternalistic man and the different push and pull of duty and love for her and step kids. This is brought to a head with the sudden looming possibility of being forced to throw away a tantalizing job. This flips a resentful defensive feminist bitchiness switch. However the switch keeps wavering and turns out to be a heartfelt cry for help. Wonderful.",

The conversation covers a lot of ground, but mostly, the dialog is about relationships.

There were times when the film began to swing toward \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolfe?\" The film never becomes that kind of sadistic cat and mouse game, but it does become very intensely psychoanalytical.This was a better film than the second one.

An interesting idea, and certainly not so pretentious compared to \"A man and a woman\". Actually, to be honest, I like the director since \"Waking Life\" and now I think to dedicate the next post to that movie. But back to the topic.A bit Fellinian, with infinitely long shots and beautiful dialogues taken at once and placed in beautiful Greece, the film marks uncrossed till now nuances. How hard it is to admit to ourselves confusion, fear and misery, or even admit them to someone else. Crises of aging, maternal and paternal fears. How much creativity and strength is required in order to maintain the magic of attraction. Real things, here I think, slightly exaggerated.Beautiful Greek finale song catches us by the hand and brings us back in the garden of roses surrounding us, planets, foxes, snakes, characters and especially faith and dreams.http://vihrenmitevmovies.blogspot.com/",

            "content": "Before Midnight is the third, and hopefully not last, part of a serial of movies following almost exclusively two people \u2013 Jesse and C\u00e9line \u2013 and the evolution of their romantic relationship. The movies are very realistic, smart, romantic, beautiful and come out every nine years showing us how Jesse and C\u00e9line, and their relationship, have changed. In the first movie, Before Sunrise, they are twenty-year olds who meet on a train, fall in love and spend a night together talking, but decide they won't keep in touch. In Before Sunset they meet, almost by chance, nine years later and the ending is ambiguous \u2013 but it's all explained in Before Midnight.In the beginning of the movie, we find Jesse (Ethan Hawke) at the airport, escorting his son Hank (Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick), who's going back to the USA, where he lives with his mother \u2013 Jesse's ex-wife. Afterwards we learn he's still with C\u00e9line (Julie Delpy), they have twin daughters and live in Paris, but are currently on vacation in Greece. They begin a little fight right away, and later in the movie they realise they're going through a serious crisis, especially since Jesse wants to move to the States to spend more time with his son and C\u00e9line, on the other hand, doesn't want to give up her life in France.Before Midnight has a Woody Allen feel to it: it takes place in a beautiful Mediterranean country, and there are many characters involved in the story, at least in the start. Particularly the scene in which they are all seated at the table, having lunch and talking looks as if it was directed by Woody. Unfortunately, this scene doesn't really work, since those conversations at lunch are badly written \u2013 you can see it's not spontaneous dialogue, it's just script those actors know by heart. And one of the things we love about the Before serial, is that it all looks incredibly spontaneous, as if you were watching two friends walking down the street and talking. This characteristic is lost in the first part of the movie, but is restored later, when our two main characters remain alone. Which inevitably makes me wonder whether the other characters were really necessary, since incorporating new characters greatly differentiates this movie from its predecessors.Still, all those characters managed to make this movie look real: since Jesse and C\u00e9line are now over forty, and have children, they aren't focused exclusively on their relationship and on each other, like they were in the previous movies. Also, the conversation at lunch is interesting, as it provides many different opinions on love, from all age groups. Actually, I consider this movie to be the most realistic of the three: love is no longer exclusively great and romantic, we realise all relationships have problems and take a lot of effort not to fall apart. Before Sunrise was all about infatuation and young, idealistic love. Before Sunset was about people who realise their lives suck and decide to change them while they're still young, thinking they will find perfection in a new relationship. Before Midnight doesn't consider love the solution to all the problems \u2013 people need to really work on their relationships in order to be happy.The climax, during which Jesse and C\u00e9line fight, is beautifully directed and, once again, very realistic. Hawke and Delpy are so good in their roles, you can't help but think they're married in real life, too. Another great thing is that, during their fight, it's very difficult to take sides even though you can identify with the characters. From a strictly technical point of view, the long takes might not be as frequent as in the previous movies, but still make Before Midnight look lovely. While the movie might seem depressing from this review, it actually isn't. Love might not be the solution to all problems, but it certainly helps resolving them when you're in a relationship. But what happens when you're insecure about everything, when memories of your great love are hidden under a big pile of secrets, unspoken words, unresolved arguments, fears, insecurities and ultimately your whole life? It's inevitable we forget our relationships' beginnings and put other people before our partners sometimes, but it's vital that, in the end, we go back to where we started, just to check how we're doing instead of destroying ourselves with irrational fears of abandonment \u2013 and I think that's the movie's message.Rating: 8/10 Read more at http://passpopcorn.wordpress.com/",

I believe in the chance and destine encounters that the world has to offer and I believe in pre destiny. That is how my serious relationships started. Like the couple who met on the train the first time, I, too met an individual in Europe. Our kisses were trapped between the closing of the trains doors. The romance purged and died. But before the death of the relationship, I traveled from Amsterdam to Germany to England to France to Pakistan to Canada. The impact of this quintessential experience broke my compromise, rather always seeking perfection, truth and the ultimate connection. Is there nobility in that? One often settles in a relationship at 40 years old. Would it be better if this couple breaks up? Would it be more honest to destroy the relationship that has all kinds of broken pieces? Or is the reality of the matter, that each individual is already a fragmented self which can no longer, if ever, be able to completely love another? Or is true ultimate love, the full transmission of completeness that restores all components of self to a complete unity, joining two people as one, as in Greek mythology, and the myth of two people cut in half, only to join each other was destiny has re-joint them through the by passing connection.",

You see the thoughts of the main ones that evolved and those that did not, those that still maintain their essence and those that changed through life.What stands out in this film is not only showing the maturity of their love but the conflict and solution that the couple has and that had never been presented in it two predecessors. The way that Linklater, Delpy and Hawke go beyond the screen with their work making the viewer feel close to the story and its characters is very good.A trilogy that shows the evolution of a particular love in 3 stages, where the viewer is free to title these stages.",

            "content": "Of all the three episodes in this sequel, I like this one the best because it is so close to reality. I always consider Before Sunrise and Before Sunset pretentious and a bit boring because of the excess dialogue and lack of action. But Before Midnight is the opposite since all the nagging, testing and sharing are so close to reality in a real couple. This is a movie you can munch and crunch for many times. Julie Deply and Ethan Hawke are perfect in portraying Celine and Jesse, a couple we first met 18 years ago. They are so convincing in playing ordinary husband and wife dealing with daily issues of taking care of kids and doubting each other. It gets a little more complicated because Jesse has a son from a previous marriage from another country and he is not on good terms with his ex-wife. The lines are beautifully and naturally written, flowing flawlessly to bring up their struggles, conflicts and lack of quality communication which lead to a big fight in the hotel triggered by a phone call by Jesse's son.Life is especially tough for Celine who has to give up her career to raise twins (with complicated birth) and then move to live in another country. She had to deal with many problems alone when her author husband is always away for book tours which might/could turn into possible flings/affairs.But life is not easy for Jesse either, as he is torn between spending more time with his son and being with Celine and the twin girls while being away from home on business. Conversing with a woman who constantly asks hypothetical questions and setting you to failure could be frustrating; but it only shows Celine is insecure and all she needs is some assurance. The dining conversation at the Greek writer's house is interesting in showcasing different types of relationships. It paves the way of saying that basically men are selfish and arrogant \u2013 they are preoccupied with their sexual power and career while women care more about their families and sometimes have to give up their career to do that. This theme recurs in the men's conversation under the olive tree while the women cook, their friend's talk on people's reaction from coming from a coma, and the couple's fight in the hotel room recounting past grudges. Excellent script writing.There are two reasons why a couple do not talk: they know each other so well that there is no need for verbal communication; or they are sick of explaining themselves all the time. Most of us fall in the middle. The fact that Jesse and Celine are still fighting and talking is a good sign in the sense that there is still vitality within and between them, although they might not know the best way to resolve their conflicts or reconcile their discrepancies. Perhaps they were too busy to sit down and really share their feelings towards each other on a regular basis. Because if they do, they would have found that they do love each other, perhaps with doubts at times, even though they might not express it in a way the other party feels comfortable. But it is OK. Life is an ever learning process. As long as we are still alive and know we are loved, we need to explore new ways of loving others and showing them. This is exemplified in the last and romantic scene, where a patient Jesse uses his imagination and writing skills to win Celine over. It also echoes and reassures her on what she mentioned during the day of casting doubt on being old together. The setting in beautiful Greece is relaxing and offers a refreshing break from the heavy subjects they occasionally touch on. It also contrasts their hurtful and romantic past. Like Greece, their relationship is filled with history, ruins, romances conflicts, and compromises. But precisely because of these past, they become what they are today. All the intentional and unintentional hurt, with the romance, jokes will become part of our memories. Only with acceptance and understanding our past can we move forward. Like their widow friend realizes, as life progresses, our loved one stays with us even when he passed away. But as time passes, everyone and everything vanishes eventually. We are only visitors on this planet, let's seize the present and enjoy the scenery while we can before midnight sets in",

That two people who have been together for this long would hold such ridiculous conversations as if they just met after getting off a plane is just inane. I enjoyed the first in the series the most, and the second could watch with some enjoyment, but this one I really literally couldn't stand watching for over 30 minutes. This movie is an oxymoron...aimed at over 30's but written like a 18 year old 40 years old. Simply makes no sense. For example, the couple end up in a field after having a dinner with a bunch of 'friends' and philosophise about whether or not they would have gotten off together if they had met on the train now. Who talks about these things?",

But it is really a script for a play, not a movie.A married couple spend almost the whole movie talking about themselves and their relationship. The only breaks from this are the opening few minutes where the husband talks to his son and later when the group of friends talk over dinner. There is some nice scenery and some great shots of a charming Greek town but that is just not enough to make it a movie. Good movies are a bit like life with all the boring parts cut out. This is a bit like life except with the boring parts left in and people talking about the interesting parts. Good movies tell an interesting story by showing the action. This just shows people talking about what could be an interesting story.Before Midnight is a lot like hanging out with someone's parents for an hour and a half and getting too much information - way too much. So unless you are into voyeurism - that is perhaps what makes the foreplay scene really creepy - and feeling like you are in a place where you don't belong, give this one a miss.",

            "content": "As Before Midnight, Sunset, Sunrise are interrelated, it's best to put all 3 three together:Before Midnight (2013)The sequel to Before Sunset and Before Sunrise, the film is a continuation of the story of Jesse and Celine after a further nine years. They've decided to be together after their encounter in the Before Sunset and have kids.This time around, they're on the last few days of a family vacation with their kids in Greece. Jesse worries about his son's wellbeing from his previous failed marriage, which triggers a relationship assessment for the couple after all these years. Once again, the screenplay is written by both the actors themselves and it is astounding. Witty, intelligent, realistic, thought provoking and occasionally humorous, they talked about family issues, work, marriage, the obligations of parenthood, the complexity that lies in long-term commitments, insecurity, struggle of feminism. In the film, Celine's feminist ideas push her to behave in ways we've not seen her do before, many of the romanticism on her have faded away since the first film. Their lives have moved on since then, life is no longer hers alone and she has make some sacrifices for their relationship to work. Their heat argument near the end of the film reveals the hidden tensions in their relationship...the fears, resentments, insecurities, loneliness throughout the years and this reflects a lot of real-life married couple problems. A truly remarkable film that's fascinating to watch. Rating: 9/10Before Sunset (2004)The story of Jesse and Celine continues again after nine years (the film is also made nine years after the first one). They didn't managed to meet each other at the Vienna train station six months after the events of Before Sunrise. Jesse, couldn't forget their fateful encounter, decided to wrote a book about them. This allows Celine to find Jesse at a bookstore in France and their conversation continues again. The dialogue is superb, even more interesting and personal as his time around, they talked about their troubled love life, politics, environmental issues...Throughout the film, they started to show their imperfections, burdened by numerous responsibilities as they talk about the mistakes they made in life and the disappointments that comes with it. The effects of aging are noticeable from their faces. This film is definitely better than the first, because it provides a more unique, personal perspective. The characters have grown and matured throughout the years. From here, it's becoming apparent that these two characters are soul mates and they were meant for each other. Interestingly, the film's dialogue are both written by the actor and actress themselves. One can't help but to assume that the two leads may have actually shared some personal conversations during the making of the film.Rating: 8.5/10Before Sunrise (1995)The story is about a young guy, Jesse and a young girl, Celine randomly meet on a train in Europe and they're both decided to spend the whole night together, talking about life and love in Vienna. As they walk around Vienna the whole night and communicating with each other, sharing their personal life experiences, you can see a deep connection slowly formed between them. The two lead actors, Ethan and Julie, shared a perfect chemistry together on screen.The script for the film is magnificent as the dialogues managed to keep the audience engaged throughout the film.Their conversations about love provides a lot of insights about relationships.They share their views, thoughts, perspectives of anything...and as they speak, you feel that you started to know these characters as well. The film successfully captures the beauty of youthful love, two beautiful people meet in a romantic setting and attracted to each other.Rating: 8/10Overall: Linklater, together with Ethan and Julie, had crafted the one of the best romantic drama trilogy of all time.The films features an in- depth look into the characters, their life experiences and how it affects their love life...of being together.The films allow us to see one woman and one man changes over the course of time. Note: Keep in mind though, the films are dialogue driven and spend most of the time on the conversations between the leads, how they managed to find a connection between them, share their thoughts, views, perspectives, principles in life...If you find that two people communicating is not enjoyable, then it's not recommended to watch the trilogy.But it'll be incredibly rewarding if you do.",

However, Delpy and Hawke seamlessly fall back into the characters that were originally developed nearly 20 years ago. The dialog is fluid and engaging between the co-leads. The long continuous shots also make it seem as if the viewer is walking with the main characters in Greece. I recall that I also thought that the previous movies would sometimes lose steam towards the middle, and this was no different. I must say that Celine's arguments seemed a bit irrational, but I'm curious if my male brain is the cause of that bias. Regardless, it was still a very enjoyable movie and I liked the ambiguous ending that leaves the door open to a potential sequel in the future.",

            "content": "Before Midnight deviates from the romance that was presented in the two preceding movies. It is also the only movie that does not take place in a 24 hour time period. Before Sunrise and Before Sunset were both similar in how they focused on love at first sight and the rekindling of an old romance respectively. This movie starts 9 years after the ending of Before Sunset. Jesse and Celine are married and are living in Paris with two twin daughters. They are on a holiday in Greece where Jesse has to let go of his son, who came to spend his summer there and now has to return to USA. The best thing about the Before Trilogy is that the events that are taking place in the movie don't feel pretentious or fake. Richard Linklater has the gift of directing movies which are incredibly realistic and one reason for that is that the actors are given the freedom to express themselves and hence the emotions are natural. Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy are jointly credited for the screenplay along with the director. Both of them give astounding performances and the changes that have occurred in them is accurately portrayed. The fight scene in the hotel is wonderfully constructed and masterfully executed by Julie Delpy in particular. Well, what we can take away from this movie is that no love story, no matter how romantic it may seem at first, is perfect or immune to a break up. The realism that is shown will surely not make you feel like you are watching a movie, but our own lives that might be unfolding before our eyes.",

            "content": "For the first time after the first two films, in Before Midnight we finally get to see Jesse and Celine actually in a relationship. Ethan Hawke in a press interview on KCRW's The Treatment recalled a behind-the-scenes story of how the steadi-cam operator got upset shooting a scene where Jesse gazes upon a young girl in a bikini, stating that Jesse would never do that to Celine. This to me is particularly noteworthy. As the audience, we feel like we know Jesse and Celine intimately.I'll give you an example. From having watched Jesse and Celine converse for two films now, I love that I am familiar with all their little ticks and peccadilloes. I know Celine hides her face with her long hair when she's uncomfortable and that she hates it when Jesse interrupts her romantic fancies with realism. I know Jesse likes getting his money's worth and often changes the subject when he doesn't want to talk about something. These characters mean something to us, whether we value how real they seem or romanticize their would-be relationship from the last two films. The things they do and say have a more profound effect on us as an audience. Richard Linklater understands this and uses it to his advantage.Never does it feel like Hawke or Delphy are acting. They just are these characters. I don't know if it's because they're the writers of their own dialogue, their mutual camaraderie with each other and director Richard Linklater or all of the above. There's a magic that's still present after all these years. I use the word \"magic\" because I can't pinpoint its mechanics. But when Jesse and Celine get talking, it feels like it's happening right before me.The conversations are the spectacle. On the surface, the characters are just telling interesting stories or giving their 2 cents on a given topic, but the conversations are designed with multiple arcs, callbacks and continually suggest and build character. The group dinner scene is a lot of fun and I found myself wanting to chime in and give my two cents on various topics. The climatic hotel scene is an impressive dialogue set piece, and it accurately captures how couples fight. They're both fighting to stop themselves from having the last word but it just erupts and everything comes out.If you haven't seen the first two, I'd suggest go seeing them first. Before Midnight does work as a standalone film, but watching it standalone will cut off the journey of these two characters. By default, this third film would just mean less. This is a good third movie. I cannot help but see all three films as one story now. I almost don't want to see a fourth film.Unlike a lot of love stories where it concentrates on the pursuit of love, Before Midnight refreshingly focuses on the means to sustaining a relationship. It's never tonally bitter or cynical. The film celebrates love by just presenting the simple truth, which includes the full spectrum of the sour, bitter and sweet. I love that Richard Linklater is using these iconic characters to say something profound about love, relationships and life in your forties. It's a risky move considering where the second film left off, but he accomplished it beautifully and delivered a earnest message. I was scared, touched and at the end I felt like I saw two old friends and learned something.For more reviews, please visit my film blog at http://hkauteur.wordpress.com/",

            "content": "What a beautiful portrayal and fantastic ending to a magnificent couple!!Moving on from being young sweet hearts in Before Sunrise to confused adults in Before Sunset, we now get a taste of experienced and mature lovers.This trilogy is without a doubt the best fictional, but realistic love story ever told in the history of cinema. Considering that the first and second films were about falling in love and confirming that love, the third film is about maintaining that love.Before Midnight is just another day with the beautiful Celine and Jeese. No doubt, nine years on their relationship has had its ups and downs. Even with our most loved ones, we sometimes have difficulties communicating and this can cause undue stress on both people. Before Midnight is about love again, but in this film the love is much deeper as it doesn't evolve from initial spark or long lost lust, but it evolves from resolving differences and conflict. We all have different personalities and to be closest with your romantic partner means there will sometimes be clashes, but in the end love will mean you are each willing to compromise to continue having moments just like that initial spark.Before Midnight can deliver this message with powerhouse performances by both Hawke and Delpy in what is a very believable romantic fairytale, quite possibly the best trilogy about love: what it means to fall in love; to sacrifice for love; and to compromise for love, because love is what inspires true selflessness.",

Apprehension, because \"Before Sunset\" ended on such a perfect note and excitement to able to know more about the characters of Celine and Jesse.This time around, Celine and Jesse are older and understandably less enamored by the notion of everlasting love yet continue to seek it in one another. Their lives are less spontaneous and encumbered by responsibilities that age brings. But what is striking is the sense that as time passes and the novelty wears off, relationships require considerable effort which might not always yield commensurate returns.The film succeeds in capturing this tension and delves deeper into the characters - their insecurities and ambitions, in typical Linklater style, which is neither pretentious nor facile. Not the best of the series, but definitely a worthy addition. 8/10",

With a movie like this, how can we expect the world to be a better place if we teach them love ends... When we have true love, it NEVER FAILS. What a disappointment. I just can not believe I wasted my time watching a movie I found under the romance genre that was highly rated where the couple fights the entire 1 1/2 hours and most of that time, the woman is arguing while topless... Is that to distract the audience from the miserableness of the movie? That was uncalled for. The icing on the cake? Living as a married couple, but were not even considering marriage! What a slap in the face to our Creator!PS - I even created this account to help bring down the ratings... After all, I watched it because it was rated so highly... Ugh. I should have known. Usually the highly rated films are the suckiest! This one proves my point.",

            "content": "given the creative people involved and my past experience with their work, the thought of Before Midnight turning out to be dull and unimaginative has never crossed my mind, especially after the reception it received. the thing with sequels is that a good chunk of them are basically remakes of the original films, driven mostly by popular and commercial demands. in and of themselves, sequels aren't inherently bad, there really just has to be a genuine creative interest and desire to tell another chapter of a story. such is exactly the kind of continuation we have here; a continuation that even enhances its predecessor by making it a part of a larger story.when we meet Jesse and Celine this time around, they are a couple. and as we've come to expect, the experiences of two protagonists take place over a short period of time, the director shows us a day of their holiday in Greece. things seems idyllic on the surface, but as is the nature of relationships, tensions are ever present. it's like a river, it rolls on continuously carrying much of what's good, but presented with certain circumstances, it can dry up to harmful results. or maybe i'm just way off and Sprinsteen's song, The River, has nothing to do with this.The couple wanders through the Greek city on their way to a hotel, talking, being humorous, getting to know each other more and also quarreling. In all three of the films, the conversations between Celine and Jesse is the mainstay and it's what makes the films so appealing and brilliant. It's not so much about what they say as it is the rhythm and their interplay back and forth. It's such a delight to watch. it is a pleasure to see that even if they have aged, they haven't lost their sweet folly and their wry humor, having fun again discussing anything, from regrets to wishes, to the meaning of life.i love it. i fall for moments like in the end, when they're sitting in a small caf\u00e9 table and Jesse begins to improvise a story about how he has come from the future..",

This movie is like How Celine says humans don't confine to one single meaning, they are multiple. A setting sun, for one person would mean happiness because he's just had a great day and he's grateful for this day but to another person it might be depressing because he's unhappy and the sun of joy in his life has set.

What's strange is that when I watch the first one again, I feel like I'm looking at my own youth. This is a very difficult to describe feeling but I am looking forward to another one in 9 years.It must've been challenging for Ethan Hawke to be on screen and talking for entire duration of the movie for all 3 movies. But he and Julie Delpy does it so well. And in each generation of the movie, I like the fact that the conversation changes to relate that age group. The first movie seems corny when I watch it again now at 42 but it certainly didn't seem that way 18 years ago. I can see Jesse and Celine changing and reflect myself from the couple to see how I've changed over the years. This movie is something you would experience rather than just watch.Only downside I'd say is that you probably would have had to watch all 3 films at its release for proper experience.",

            "content": "It's the rarest of things, this. I'm desolate that the \"Before\u0085\" trilogy has come to an end but what an end it is. Richard Linklater's \"Before Midnight\" is the best installment of the three, a darker, funnier follow-up to the first two and a lot more intuitive too. For eighteen years, we've been following the lives of Jesse and Celine, who had first met on a train in '94 when they were young, and we now see them in their early 40s, conflicted and befuddled about what they want from their lives. And from the three movies, we got three perspectives - of twenty year-olds, thirty year-olds and forty year-olds. The conversations never stop delighting, the antics are charmingly jejune and the insights are consummate. We've got to hand it to Linklater for romanticizing a romance, a modern one and an old-fashioned one, with equal zeal in his three movies. The trilogy, which I consider to be one of the greatest of all-time, is a fine example of idealistic cinema. \"Before Midnight\" hasn't got a plot, much like the first two, but it's more personal, more arcane this time. It starts off with Jesse (Ethan Hawke) dropping his son off to the airport, a son from a failed marriage and then heading out to Greece with Celine (Julie Delpy), with whom he has twin daughters, we learn. As the two of them meet the people who invited them to Greece, and then take a walk around Greece to the hotel that's been booked for them, they cogitate on the times they've spent together. \"Before Midnight\" is much more crowded, since it's got more speaking parts, but somehow that idea sticks. We've seen Jesse and Celine, rarely anyone else in the first two, so I believe this one's more evolved. The characters that are new aren't any less fascinating. The discussion during lunch is candid and often funny and it turns bittersweet in the end. Hawke and Delpy also seem to be much more comfortable with their characters, as if they've been living in them for too long, and the conversations now lean towards marriage life and its aggravations. You've got to admit, this one is more romantic than \"Before Sunset\", its predecessor, and the chemistry between the two crackles. The streets of Peloponnese are captured wonderfully by cinematographer Christos Voudouris, who exudes a calm control over the camera and gifts us a lot of eye-candy. And, as always, the writing is remarkable. Linklater, teaming up with Hawke and Delpy, weaves an intricate although searingly honest view on modern romance. The writing in the scene where Jesse and Celine bicker over what they've done for their relationship is startling in its candor. I enjoyed that chinwag so much that I watched it over and over again and still wanted to watch it again. What a wondrous piece of writing! Hawke and Delpy are, once again, spectacular in their roles. They have a certain easiness with each other now, something that wasn't so overt before and they do fine jobs in both departments.I expect \"Before Midnight\" to get an Oscar nod this time around and fill the void that's been there for eighteen years now. If it gets rebuffed again, I'd have to say that that would be an expensive, preposterous snub and an appalling one, too. It's one of the best films of the year so far.",

            "content": "This is the final part of Richard Linklater's relationship trilogy which began with Before Sunrise in 1995, followed by Before Sunset nine years later.Nearly two decades from when they first met, Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and Celine (Julie Delpy) are now a couple living in Europe with twin daughters conceived almost immediately from when they first re-met 9 years ago \u2013 Jesse also has a son from his long-extinct marriage who resides with his mother in Chicago. Whilst both successful in their careers, Celine is somewhat in the shadow of Jesse, a successful novelist.At its very core, the film is essentially a dialogue between the couple as they explore their relationship and where their future lies \u2013 both physically and spiritually.A film of only a few extended acts, it is at its most powerful and engaging when Delpy and Hawke are by themselves with no distractions. One scene of around 20 minutes duration is a single take, a static camera merely the recorder of a conversation between the two as they drive back from the airport having dropped off Jesse's son after a summer vacation.Relatively speaking, the film is less successful when it broadens out and introduces peripheral characters. The scene as they enjoy an al fresco lunch at the writers' retreat where they have been staying for the summer seemed to consist of the other participants merely taking it in turn to give a speech, although it was masquerading as a conversation. That the speeches sometimes bordered on the pompous was, however, quite deliberate on Linklater's part, I'm sure. And the criticism needs to be put in context \u2013 even when not at its best, it is still far superior to most other fare.In total, the film does little more than follow a successful and well-heeled couple as they talk and discuss, sometimes heatedly, their relationship. It centres on first-world problems \u2013 'Do we live in Paris? Do we live in Chicago? Do you believe your successful career to be more important than my successful career?' Were the film made by lesser talents, it might possibly be insufferably maudlin, bordering on self-pity. That it successfully steers well clear from this and presents a completely believable couple, is a testimony to its superior writing, direction and terrific acting from both Delpy and Hawke, both of whom are totally flawless. It draws you to believe that despite their apparent enviable lifestyle, the quest for domestic bliss is classless and every bit as difficult to attain no matter how wealthy you may be.The film is minimalist \u2013 the scenes are long, camera angles rarely vary and the only incidental music is the very occasional tinkling of a completely unobtrusive piano. Everything is geared to have focus on the extensive but never overwhelming dialogue. The linking shots, in fact all the cinematography set outside, capture extremely well Greece's wonderful light.It is doubtless preferable to have seen the earlier two films in this series, but anyone coming new to it should have no problem picking up the story and concept. And they will also, I am sure, then wish to look out the first two segments.All involved in this project, deserve plaudits for embarking on such a long-term venture and seeing it through with such class \u2013 and it oozes class. Richard Linklater, again with Ethan Hawke, currently nears the end of a 12 year project, Boyhood, following the story of a boy growing up with divorced parents. The self-taught Mr Linklater is clearly a film-maker who thinks ahead.",

Those movies were romantic, melancholy and life-affirming. The pair has wonderful chemistry and the two imbue their characters hopes, thoughts and realities like few on-screen pairings have ever done. I enjoyed revisiting the films over a weekend in the nearly 10 years since the last entry in this film series has taken place.This third film continues that - it is expertly directed, written and staged in gorgeous Greece landscapes. And - it maintains the trademark walk-and-talk and talk and talk signature that were the first two films' heralded mise-en-scene.As a viewer, I was impressed with the new film in how the story progressed since we last visited. These are good, interesting and followable-characters. We think we know them. Unfortunately at the same time, the magic and the wistfulness the cast received to make it work comfortable between the two and patience or understanding seems to be in exceedingly short supply.Instead - and kudos to the creative team - this rocked the audience away from expecting a welcome but been-there, done-that sequel pattern.The SPOILER surprise is the couple is actually together now, with twins of their own, and a life their lives are less than perfect.Here is where I disengaged with the film on an entirely personal level. The fights, the yelling and the accusations were very intense and brutal. The acting is so good, that it makes anyone who has lived through this kind of relationship meltdown feel as though they are living through it ALL OVER again. Sitting in my multiplex, I know I did. It made me anxious and sad.BEFORE MIDNIGHT is a completely original and fully-realized film: it's hands-down one of the best movies of 2013. But unlike the two previous installments, I just don't know if I ever want to sit through this one again.It's real, it's actual, and it just skips right over the years of good and anchors itself in what is bad in a relationship.Bring on the 4th movie, folks!",

The first two films in the trilogy (\"Before Sunrise\" and \"Before Sunset\") are two of the best romance films that I have ever seen. Their simplicity and fantastic screen writing have made them modern classics in the world of cinema. In the first film we are introduced to two characters, Jessie, played by Ethan Hawke and Celine, played by Julie Delpy. They meet by circumstance whilst on a train heading to Vienna. After sparking up a conversation and quickly developing a bond, they decide to cancel their prior engagements and spend a night together in Vienna where they have conversations about life, world issues, love and so on. They spend a perfect night together, but the next day are forced to go their separate ways. Although, before leaving they promise to each other that they will meet in Vienna again in six months, they don't\u0085 In the second film we see Jessie in Paris nine years later, now an accomplished writer. He has written a book depicting the events of that night with Celine in Vienna. During an interview in the famous bookstore \"Shakespeare and Company\" Celine stops by to congratulate Jessie's success. Much like in the first film, the two immediately create a bond, but this time spend a day together. In the final scene of the film, it is implied that Jessie stays with Celine in Paris despite now also being married and having a family. This leads us to the events of \"Before Midnight\". In the opening shot of the film we again see Jessie nine years later, dropping his son off at the airport after spending his summer with him in Greece. His son, Hank lives with his mother in the United States, who remains vindictive towards Jessie after he (you guessed it) left her for Celine. Jessie and Celine now have two twin daughters and are living a seemingly fulfilled life. They are staying with a famous writer who's beautiful villa sits on a peak next to the Mediterranean sea. Their vacation is coming to an end, so a Greek couple who they have befriended have rented them a room in a fancy hotel for a romantic night. After deciding to walk to the hotel, they start having the classic conversations that we all know so well.I will start of by saying that this is not only the best film in the trilogy, but the best film that I have seen this year so far. The conversations in \"Before Midnight\" feel a lot more mature than they did in the first film, as do the characters. The long shots and beautiful scenery reminded me how great the first two films were and made me love this one even more. Hawke and Delpy are great as always and the supporting cast is full of charmingly comical characters. Hawke's, Linklater's and Delpy's impeccable screenplay creates fresh new topics of discussion and is undoubtedly the film's greatest strong point. Jessie and Celine's love story is very heartfelt and does not come off as cheesy or clich\u00e9d. They go through their hardships, but in the end remember what is truly important. A great cinematic experience and a great love story. With the help of the smooth direction and fantastic acting, \"Before Midnight\" manages to perfectly pull off the conversations between the two main characters. They are at times philosophical, but just like the story, don't come off as cheesy.\"Before Midnight\" is a treat for the eyes as well as an all around great movie. It builds off of the previous films to create the perfect ending to a trilogy. Whilst being fluffy and heartfelt, it does not feel cheap for one moment. The screenplay is perfect and the actors are great. What can I say? It's a must see film.",

Its absolutely wonderful that Linklater and co. have managed to make these characters live on over the course of three decades, and in doing so they have left a distinct mark on the world of independent film. One thing that puzzled me before I even started the film was, why Before Midnight? Was it implying that one of them had to leave before the end of the day? And boy, I hoped that wasn't the case.This film, much like the other two, does not hold back in portraying these multi-dimensional characters in such an honest way. Here we are exposed to the entire spectrum of the relationship between these two characters, from their most romantic moments to their most wise observations. But just how honest could a story like this be told if we weren't exposed to the darker side of it all.?The realistic side, where relationships and commitment aren't all hunky-dory. Jesse and Celine are married with twin daughters and are in their early 40s. If this were a true fairy tale we wouldn't worry about them. But this isn't a fairy tale, and it may as well be real life.Everything about this film relies on the performances of its main characters, but luckily Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy absolutely nail it and give what may be the finest work of both of their careers. They make the material completely work, from beginning to end. They make us laugh and they both charm us much like they have before. They can fill our hearts, break them and put them back together in a single conversation, and that is true chemistry. Films of this nature only dream of capturing what they manage to capture here.All of that being said, this film is the most difficult to endure. For reasons I will not mention, both the characters and the audience are being tested with this film, mostly with choices and how our choices effect the lives we create for ourselves. We want nothing more than these two to work it out because they have that magic that some of us only dream of getting. And even they realize that keeping it together over the course of a lifetime is no easy task, for the walks of life like their jobs and their children only complicate what was once a much more simple matter.At the end of it all, Before Midnight is a film with a lot to say. It is full of delight and charm and emotion and connection as well as agreement and disagreement. My only hope is that we can revisit Jesse and Celine in nine more years to see where they are. It doesn't matter if they're in a good place or in a bad place, if you've seen the previous two films, you're in for the long haul with these characters. I think Mr. Linklater, Ms. Delpy and Mr. Hawke are as well, for not only have they created two fantastic and loving films, they hit a home run with this beautiful and mature third film, and continue to leave us fully satisfied yet also wanting more.",

The setting is idyllic: great scenery, great food, and interesting people.

That is exactly the first act of movie is about which sets a base for the coming acts. But in the climax it gets a little formulaic and that is why I gave it 9 stars.Unlike other two movies the conflict that is introduced here is not time it's disagreement of wife and husband over moving to Chicago. The audience will wonder if they are going to split throughout the movie and they wait for the moment of eruption. And that is achieved in just two scenes.After watching all the three movies my feeling is that they are liking books except if u watch a book instead of reading them.",

While sharing certain characteristics, each film is unique and worthwhile in their own right, but taken as a whole, this trilogy is something truly special. Some say that they are the best films about love and romantic relationships ever made, and they just might be. The series follows Jesse and Celine through the years. Jesse is an American traveling through Europe when he meets a French girl who is on her way home to Paris. They get to talking and Linklater's camera follows their conversation throughout the rest of that single day as the two fall in love. And every nine years, we revisit the couple at a different stage of life. Because of the time between the films we get the unique experience of watching two characters age, retaining the core of their personality, but taking on greater complexity as the years pass. The first film is about embracing the moment and forging a genuine human connection. The second film, Before Sunset, is about the regret of missed opportunities and the need to be true to yourself. The third film, Before Midnight, is about the consequences of actually getting what you want. Each film utilizes long takes which pull the audience deeply into the dialogue heavy narrative, and the fantastic performances by Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy belie the fact that they're actually acting. These magical films are not to be missed.",

Never get bore of this. In fact, it gets even lovelier every time I watch it.The whole movie, including the earlier two, revolves around two lovers (Jesse & Celine) and their continuous chit-chats. These talks between them are so amazing and it's not very filmy ones, and that's the best part of it. It's like a rhythm which goes on and on and on... and it is beautiful to see these two lovers chat in such a lovely way. You'll enjoy watching them talk.One of the really good scenes from the movie was the chat at the dining table among these 2 lovers and their friends and couple of older ones. Certain good learning are also in it.Towards the very end of the movie, Jesse, even after a very bad fight with Celine, goes to her and tries his best to make her laugh - win her back again, while Celine still being adamant refuse to be listened to, but Jesse doesn't give up until the very end but then Celine understands the practicality of the situation they are in and she smiles and love restores. :)The moral of the movie which I found most useful, was to, never let go of your true lover no matter what happens, especially not out of some silly fight and anger, coz at the end you're one to lose. Try to be happy with the little little things that makes are life a wholesome...\"If you want true love, then this is it, this is real life, it's not perfect but it's real, if you can't see it then you're blind.\" - Jesse to Celine.",

I had held off watching the film for a long time because what I loved about Before Sunrise and Sunset was the idea of these two characters who love each other but are not really \"together.\" That had always provided me this excitement and I knew in Before Midnight, the two would be having lives together. However, after watching it today, I can say it is actually my favourite one of the three.The reason is simple. It is so RAW and REAL. It is refreshing to watch those uplifting and funny romance comedies but sometimes, you really need a film like this to bring you down to Earth and wonder about the \"real\" life and love in real life. The film is beautiful in that it portrays both sides to the story. Normally in films, you find yourself relating to the character who's of the same gender. However, in this film, I could understand both sides and found myself \"witnessing\" human relationship as it happened. The hotel scene had me entranced. I could see myself in it (from my past experiences) and I could see myself in it also in the future. The ending.. was just heartbreaking and touching at the same time. It is a masterpiece. The setting, the atmosphere and the connection... everything was done perfectly. Thank you Richard Linklater for a wonderful piece of art that had me enlightened and wondering more about life and its meaning. Brilliant acting by Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy too.",

I never saw the first two films of this trilogy and I don't think I needed to. The film stood on its own as a relevant coming of middle age film. This is a dialog film and the dialog spoke to me. Smart lines commented on marriage (or lack thereof), parenthood, divorce, careers, and aging amidst the pressures of modernity. Nothing seemed forced in this film. The actors brilliantly portrayed their characters in extended scenes and shots of conversation. This is difficult to achieve because the editor can't fix a missed line or camera mistake with a cut to something else. Ethan Hawke, Julie Delpy, and director Linklater pulled off this technique with resounding skill which resulted in beautiful natural expression. All this juxtaposed to the beautiful sights and sounds of Greece. Next chance I have, I'm going! Did the Greek National Tourism Department have a hand in this production?",

He has to use his best creative writing to keep her, so they are going back to the hotel room to make love and reconnect for the time being, till the next fight!She is not like a baboon who knows, instinctively, how to nurture a baby. She does not have that natural maternal instinct and so takes care of her husband and twins with resentment, because it does not come easily or naturally to her and she resents it because it is work, not pleasure! She wants to do something with her life, as if what she is doing is not good enough!Looking back, I realize that she was the one who missed meeting Jesse at the train in six months. Her grandmother's funeral was not a good enough excuse!He had to spend years writing a book about their meeting and romance to attract her, to find her in Paris, which he did, and it worked, and he eventually wooed her into marrying him, or was the marriage necessitated by her pregnancy?In the last movie they are offset between the older couple and the younger couple. They are vacationing in Greece as a gift by the great Greek writer, who philosophizes about love and time and commitment. He is married forever and wants to mingle his ashes with those of his wife. The young couple reject commitment and true love, deep love. They are not ready for that, maybe never will. They are just enjoying the moment, that is good enough. They don't have to get married or populate the earth. They are into themselves and today, and what will be will be, happy go lucky.Our couple is in between the older couple and the younger couple and have their own conflicts, like he feels guilty about being away from his son, and she resents his 'status' and fame. She does not want him to be the dominant one, and he himself does not want to be the the dominant one. It is clear that he will do anything for her, but now she doesn't love him anymore, and tells him he's a lousy lover. That does not faze him.I ended up feeling she does not deserve him and I would think he would be destroyed by the things she says and how she acts, describing their lovemaking (she always calls it 'fucking!') Kissie kissie titty titty pussy snoring. How awful! How can he live with that? How can he ever make love again? But they are going to do it and we will see what happens in another nine years!",

It was great to watch Celine & Jesse finally together but more than anything I appreciate the fact that both of them have been shown matured in terms of their personality too apart from their age. It is really great how Linklater has so beautifully narrated two lives in just three films, in less than 300 minutes. And more than that their state of relationship has changed over the specific period of time. Set in Greece, once again cinematography is eye-catching but I lost in long walks and never-ending conversations. The experience was as refreshing as the one with Vienna. Moreover, the film deals with relationship problems at middle ages. Celine and Jesse are also faced with troubles just like any other couple. It shows even such an ideal couple also has to face certain problems.However, it once again ends beautifully with a sweet note. There might be another film nine years later or might not be. But I have no complains if this is the end. Because it is a perfect end note of this journey and yet so open. These are one of the few films which are personally bound with me.",

            "content": "Before Midnight is the third installment of the ongoing love story between American Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and French Celine (Julie Delpy). First was 1995's Before Sunrise, in which the characters meet at age 23 and spend a blissful night wandering the streets of Vienna, talking endlessly and falling in love.Then, in 2004's Before Sunset, the couple reconnects for the first time since Vienna. They spend an evening wandering the streets of Paris, talking, of course, and discovering that Celine never found true love, Jesse is unhappily married (with a young son), and they probably shouldn't have parted nine years ago.Now, in Before Midnight, Jesse and Celine are 41 years old, living together in Paris and raising their twin daughters. We catch them at the tail end of a summer holiday in Greece. Jesse's 14-year-old son has just returned to Chicago, where he lives with his mother, and it quickly becomes clear, through more witty and winding conversation, that married life (or at least common-law marriage) has tested the strength of Jesse and Celine's commitment to one another.All the Before films have their charms and merits, and feature exceptional writing, acting and cinematography. But each one is more substantial than the last, and with good reason. The first is about falling in love; it should be the most frothy and fun. The second is about deciding whether to give the relationship a go. And the third is about trying to make good on that decision.It makes sense that Before Midnight is the one that sticks with you the longest and packs the biggest punch. Eighteen years in, and with more than one night's memories to build on, Jesse and Celine's story is weighted down by much more baggage, but it's richer because of it.There are moments in each of the movies that carried over for me through the years. In Before Sunrise, there's Jesse and Celine's make-believe phone call in a restaurant, or Delpy's perfectly delivered performance at the pinball machine, when Celine steals the conversation while staying totally focused on her game.In Before Sunset, the ending sealed the deal for me. It was so leading and provocative, you didn't need to see what was coming next. The film faded out on a fabulous note of anticipation.In Before Midnight, it's the lengthy conversation in a hotel room that left a lasting impression. The scene plays like a microcosm of Jesse and Celine's relationship. They take turns dodging and tackling feelings of comfort, love, resentment, inadequacy, verbally waltzing through the bitter and the sweet and back again in the space of minutes, sometimes only even seconds. It's an incredibly poignant look at married life, and so real and fluid that you almost forget you're watching a performance.I don't know of any other films, or even television shows, that present live-action characters over the span of 18 years. It's very special to be able to see these snapshots of Jesse and Celine's life, presented in near-real time and taken as the actors age. It creates the magical sense that these characters really exist; that, rather than catching a movie, you're actually catching up with old friends you don't see often enough. (There's even that trippy encounter you had several years back in Linklater's rotoscoped wonder, Waking Life.) The Before experience is even more special given that the snapshots are so well executed.Like its predecessors, Before Midnight has a hopeful but open-ended finish. Perhaps nine more years down the road, we'll be treated to another day, or night, or few hours, in the lives of Jesse and Celine. Here's hoping.",

Jesse continues his career as writer alternating with a job as a teacher and Celine faces several dilemmas about her work as an environmentalist. During their summer vacation in Greece, in which Jesse's eldest son (who resides in the United States) joins, what seems to be a respite from the routine of daily life, becomes a test their relationship. The endearing characters created in 1995 by Richard Linklater for Before Sunrise return to continue discussing life and its ups and downs, but this time away from the aura of idealism and romanticism present in both Sunrise and its sequel Before Sunset, to show what's usually unseen or is reflected superficially in most American productions: what happens in the lives of the protagonists after choosing to be together? And life itself is exactly what happens: marriage, children, work and all the responsibility they carry, and how often dilute the dreams and ambitions of youth and early adulthood. True to the style of its predecessors, Before Midnight plunges us into the world of Jesse and Celine through their talks, with dialogs loaded in this occasion with uncertainty about the future, much irony and even some regret and frustration for the past and the missed opportunities, as can be seen in the now famous hotel scene, in which a simple comment triggers a wave of complaints and repressed anger that comes to the surface. A moment somewhat uncomfortable to witness for the audience given its enormous realism. But it is not all tragedy and broken dreams, since the exceptional script by Linklater with Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy (for which they received an Oscar nomination) has the ability to make us see that despite everything, there's still between Jesse and Celine, but maybe not with the intensity as when they met in Vienna almost 2 decades ago. And that love, like everything else, changes over time, either for good or bad, it can become a great affection or great boredom, all depends on how one learns to handle it. The success of this trilogy created by Linklater can (and should) also be attributed to Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy, who over 18 years have grown in the same way as their characters. Needless to say that at this point they own and become Jesse and Celine in such an organic and natural way that sometimes gives the impression of watching a documentary on human relationships instead of a fictional story. Especially in Midnight both deliver the best performances of their careers so far; Hawke retains the same boyish charm as Jesse, but this time exposes his more vulnerable side admirably; Delpy gives Celine more neurosis than usual and while she's a little less sympathetic than in the past, all the anger that has been building for so long is completely understandable. With Before Midnight, Richard Linklater confirms his status as one of the most invigorating filmmakers of American cinema nowadays, from which we can just wait to see whether Jesse and Celine continue discussing life in a continuation of what might be called one of the most complete film trilogies made in years (and maybe decades).",

            "content": "I saw the first 2 in this series a long time ago, and having enjoyed them, I eagerly anticipated watching this in theaters for months. I went to theaters with a hunger for insight into relationships, tension as I vicariously experience the struggles of the characters, followed by a cathartic breakthrough. So what happened it? I came away liking, but not loving, it. There are things about this film everyone will like, such as the enchanting scenery, the idyllic ambiance of the Greek village/town in which much of it is set, and the authentic-seeming Greeks in supporting roles. I was impressed at how real the dialog between Jesse and Celine seems to be. I felt at times I was watching a real- life couple, which couldn't be more different from watching Hollywood films (which seem to be scripted by audience consensus of how men and women should talk to each other in movies). The 2 main characters are so at ease with each other, it's uncanny. Realize that the main thing this film shoots for is reality, as much as that can be achieved against the ridiculously postcard perfect backdrop of Grecian seaside. The first 2 films were romantic; this film is not a romance. Jesse/Ethan did not sweep me off my feet and I didn't want to be Celine. At times, I was annoyed with the 2 characters for not being more tender with each other; at times they seemed to bite each other, and defense mechanisms seemed to be at work. (Part of me enjoys that Hollywood script.) But I like the open- and whole-hearted, vulnerable, one million percent intensely romantic movie moments, so this is less a critique of the movie, and more a reflection of me. The film did make me wonder, is this the best there is after years of being with the one you love? It seems alright/nice, but is this worth making a movie about? Jesse & Celine, who fell in love instantly and who have gained countless fans cheering them on, settled into middle-aged mediocrity, sniping at each other and resorting to juvenile sarcasm/defensiveness when they feel unsure about the other, insecure about self? And what's with all the vulgar humor? As a fan of Woody Allen and When Harry met Sally, I admit I'm partial to a certain brand of wit and humor. That is, irony based on accurate observations about life, and less so vulgarity or sarcastic insults. I wasn't offended by the vulgarity, just somewhere between neutral to put off a little. Then again, since the aim of the film is reality, I have to concede that some people don't have wit, only vulgarity/sarcasm. But since this is the movies too, isn't the aim to please? The film could do a better job of portraying reality in a way we would more thoroughly enjoy, instead of giving us binoculars into the lives of a fairly interesting couple that we have caught at crucial moments, allowing us to hear dialog which is most revealing of who they are as a pair.The movie is full of surprises, and 1 insight I did come away with is how unstable the surface of a relationship can be, while the core itself may or may not be stable. It's easy to see the surface but not the core. The real question in this movie is, Are Jesse and Celine sustainable in middle-age? We all know that we want something sustainable; thus it is an important question for those who have cared about this movie couple for the last 2 movies. The movie pushes many boundaries in dialog; it is a movie for people who like talking, are interested in the meaning of conversation and how we use words in a 100 different ways to constantly alter how we relate to a person we are close to. So many times the audience gasped because of all the times a character said something that violated what we hold sacred and proper to caring for the heart of a person with whom we are close. By the end of the movie I was touched. And so glad I saw it. However, the movie does end very abruptly, and it is not a cathartic nor dramatic film. Like I said, it's reality. If you want heart-thumping drama and tears, watch Gladiator instead.",

            "content": "It seems that most of the people who are downvoting this movie are doing so because they were expecting a different movie. The truth is that I was as well. I would much rather see more romance and less fighting. Well, this is where a lot of relationships go, unfortunately. I wanted to give this movie a 6 because I did not want to witness such toxicity, but the truth is that the movie was brilliantly done. It felt more real than most love stories. Seriously, how well do you know someone after spending one day together? Isn't it possible that one or two seemingly magical days can skew your view of someone? This seems to be the story of two people who fell in love a little too hard, a little too early. What is also evident is that they both changed a lot during this time. The most troubling aspect is that Celine went from being someone who believed in reincarnation and magic to becoming a closed-minded cynic who no longer believed in much, particularly a fairytale romance. What happened to her? Jesse had changed too, but he still believed in that fairytale romance. He truly wanted to be with her and to love her with all his heart. You wonder if they would still be together today. Well, I wouldn't lay any bets. That ball is totally and completely in Celine's court. I wasn't going to ramble on about this in this manner, but I guess this should tell you that this movie truly leaves an impression. I want to see it again. The two leads did an absolutely phenomenal job and they also co-wrote the movie, which is just brilliantly written. That dialogue is unbelievably well constructed. It all flowed so well.",

            "content": "Before Midnight (6/13)Among the blockbuster movies lighting up & drowning out the Multiplexes is the small-budget, low-key Before Midnight. There are so many delights to experience with the characters. Sipping wine with friends at a beautiful villa adjourning the Mediterranean Coast on a lovely summer evening; discussing what matters, like career, family, relationships, past mistakes, the joys and pitfalls of relationships; characters who are appealing & attractive but with depth & substance. What else? Two gorgeous twin girls; an awkward but realistic conversation between a teenager and his estranged dad; explorations of how the tiniest of comments made off-handedly can be misinterpreted and lead to major crises for partners in a relationship. Ethan Hawke & Julia Delpy have great chemistry together on screen; each must decide if what they have is worth saving, or if moving on without the other would be better for each to fulfill their goals. Listening to snippets of spoken French adds to the film's authenticity. Each must deal with their guilts, Ethan for being an absent father, & Julia for abandoning her career to be with Ethan. What doesn't work? Some early dialog involves trivial issues that almost seem like filler, but quickly turns more meaningful. The pacing can be unusually slow at times, so much so that the movie would probably work just as well as a play where conversation taking center stage would be expected. While I did not see the first two parts of this trilogy, that was no disadvantage in enjoying this movie. There's certainly room for another in the series. Shall we call it After Midnight?",

Essentially a series of conversational set pieces, one an argument, heavily centred on the main characters Jesse and Celine, the film's strengths lie in its hyperreal dialogue and the depiction of a volatile relationship between two intelligent, emotional people. Interestingly, both I and the person with whom I watched this film felt we hadn't enjoyed it that much when it finished. However, 45 minutes later we realised we had been discussing it intensely without a break. Any film capable of that has something going for it.If you're looking for action, plot or sweet romance in a film probably this one isn't for you. If you want something about relationships that's realistic and thought-provoking, probably it is. Lastly, Julie Delphy's performance as Celine is superb and Ethan Hawke is a good counterfoil.",

            "content": "In Before Midnight and the two earlier films in this trilogy: Before Sunrise and Before Sunset, there comes a moment where the reality that what you're watching a film fades and you begin to accept that this is just two people in love spending time with one another. Perhaps it's the lack of cuts as well as drawn out dialogue scenes that subvert the subconscious knowledge that edits are a part of the cinematic language. The realism could also be attributed to Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke having played these characters twice already and hence thoroughly understanding their inner workings leading to a real continuity of how they behave scene to scene. Whatever it is, Before Midnight is one of those films that feel decidedly unfilm-like and because of this, is able to engage the viewer on a level that one doesn't usually allow films to do.After hearing of the announcement of this project I was skeptical of what more could be said on the subject of these two characters that hadn't already been thoroughly interrogated in the previous two entries. The film examines the couple 7 years after the events of the second film and fleshes out what happens after the initial thrill of young love has faded and the realities of married life (well, a civil union something or other) come to the fore. And although the film is is structurally the same as the two other films in that they are really just a small collection of long conversations, a strong case is made that these two characters still have a lot of things to say that are worth hearing.This is a film that's hard to fault and is in many ways superior to the previous two films in the series. The improvement comes primarily from the two actors continuing to understand how these characters' tick as well as Linklater improving as a writer and as a director in how he stages the scenes. I could take issue with sometimes feeling that the dialogue is too clever and long winded to be realistic or that I still don't really buy that Ethan Hawke as an author, but these are minor quibbles for a film that was a joy to watch. I'd recommend watching the first two films before watching this, but if you can't, whatever I'm not going to tell you how to live your life.",

As other reviewers have noted, it's almost like we've seen the actual chemistry between Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy evolve over the years, as the acting is so natural, and they seem to hit all the real-world relationship issues on the head. Having gone through recent struggles in my own relationship, the emotions were especially hard-hitting and accurate for me. In Jesse, I saw a lot of myself - trying to be so calculated and rational about thoughts and decisions, all the while Celine is drowning there in front of him. It's all very real. I'm not positive that others who have not seen the other two movies, while not exactly a prerequisite, will have a grasp on the bigger spectrum of their relationship, but I don't think it hinders the story - though to be sure the moment the movie faded in I knew precisely who the boy was, and what they were doing at the airport.Overall, I give 'Before Midnight' the same high marks as the other two, and perhaps even above and beyond for really bringing a very real authenticity to the screen, of the labors of love, and two movie characters whom I absolutely adore.",

This third film really reflects how you have to think realistically but still have to maintain a sense of romance between 2 lovebirds. I like how the depiction of James and Celine who are no longer young, when they are adults, there will be more misery than happiness, but that's what love means, how these 2 characters try to find a way from all problems.I always made mezmerise from the acting and chemistry of Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy. they managed to maintain the quality of their character's connection even though it was 20 years from the first film. The dialogue given here is certainly very complex from the previous films. I like how Linklater can develop these 2 characters very far and well even though it only consists of 3 films, with a distance of 9 years as of the film.",

Life, even with your soul mates, does not guarantee worry-free or problem-free. There are still lots of sacrifices that need to be made. There are bound to be dissapointments, blaming and betrayal. Despite of all of these, as you grow old and mature, you understand no relationship is perfect. You yourself and your partner is no perfect either. It is the committment to the relationship and to the family, the embracing and acceptance of the other's flaws and shortcomings that sustains the relationship in the midst of all temaptations, and changes.At the end of the movie, Jesse said, \"This is not perfect. but this real\". The Before-trilogy shows us the true picture of the evolution of a relationship. It may start with a strong chemistry and connection that puts out heads in the clouds. But at the end, it is our own hard effort that keeps it alive.This is why I love the Before-trilog. I can truly relate to evey bit of it.",

It is life itself, honest without concealing. When we saw Jesse and Celine as lovers with their in-depth discussions, well , in Before Midnight they are parents. They had their problems, they have children and all this day to day life is reflected in the movie. It looks like you are watching your own story, so real, so honest and with problems which occur in a 10 years marriage . Of course, being that honest and real, treating problems which you recognize can just be the reason for some not to like the movie. Personally I love it and when leaving the theater, and afterwards, you keep on that smile on you face, you talk about it.Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy are actors who are normally not in movies I like, but they are just fantastic in this trilogy. Not one remark on them, outstanding. The movie seems short, although it is one dialog. It is not boring at all. Of course there are no action shots, no thriller, nothing of that sort. It is a movie to pay attention to the dialogs and the situation. May be not that advisable to see shortly after a lunch or dinner and not recommended for strictly Action movie lovers. You should see the movie in OV ( Original Version without dubbing ) due to the different languages used. Anyway, I don't think there is a better version of a movie then the original one.",

While it is safe to assume that Jesse and Celine still love each other, they are no longer in the exciting first stages of love. They have been together for almost ten years and the film explores their emotions that have accumulated over time. They have regrets. Regrets of dreams that were not chased and of words that were not said.The film builds to a confrontation in a hotel room that happens to be one of the most powerful and impressive scenes I've seen in cinema for a while. Brutal, funny, heartbreaking and honest. The equivalent of a bare-knuckle boxing match, Jesse and Celine decide to spill the beans on everything that they dislike about each other. Everything comes together beautifully. Staging, direction and performances working together for a tough scene, made all the more brutal by the desire we have for them to stay together.The aforementioned regrets and confrontation aside, Before Midnight still manages to be quite funny. Discussions on gender expectations, faithfulness, parenthood and sex provide some hilarious observations that many will be able to connect with. This is what ultimately makes the film work. Adults of all ages will be able to find a truth to hold on to. Neither Jesse or Celine is made out to be the bad-guy, which serves the film well. It's like eavesdropping on a couple's argument and being able to see both sides equally.In terms of performances, it will be hard to find others this year that match the ones delivered by Hawke and Delpy. Both actors are exceptional, holding the audience through some incredibly long takes. It must be terrifying to act out very long sequences of dialogue while trying to keep it looking natural and spontaneous, but they succeed admirably.Before Midnight can be painful, and at times brutal, in its attempt to give us an honest exploration of this relationship, but it still manages to be very romantic and quite funny. Richard Linklater and company have crafted a simple masterpiece here, providing insight and emotion in equal measure.www.thereelword.net",

I WAS invested & a part of that r/ship, I was an active participant with all the feelings & emotional roller coaster ride that a long term r/ship at a crossroads can create inside you. We've followed this romance & r/ship for 18 years, so anything lesser in the direction & handling of this would have been a disaster. But the finale (if it is that) was just incredible & almost surreal. Bravo to Linklater, bravo to all the stars.9/10 for last hour (with a couple 10/10 moments in the conversation); 6/10 for the 1st 40mins, so 8/10 overall. Can't wait for when the couple are almost 50, which is where my wife & I are - I dealy hope Hawke & Delpy are around to do at least 1 more, to give all of us middle-aged going on old couples a look into our recent past & what could have been, what may be & perhaps what is.

The dialogues are still witty and funny as always. Brilliant performance of Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy! It did not look like they were acting at all. It's more like I was observing the real scenes, real argument, and I felt deeply engaged to them. I particularly like the hotel scene where their conversation flows so realistically and greatly reflects mindsets of men and women. (Though Celine is a bit too feminist. ;) ) I love the ending of this film as much as the ending of Before Sunset, which I regard as the best ending a film could ever have.

She gives in.... to be what she did not want to be. Servant, wife, tool. Maybe an unhappy ending would have more been more solid. A few of the lines in the movie I had to look up for their origin.

I think that the first 45 minutes were really boring and passed by waiting the movie to start the main subject. The stories of the other people at the dinner were not interesting and too long. The car scene which they travel to their hotels with the twins sleeping at the back was too long that made me feel uncomfortable. Since it shows us how beautiful the nature of Greece is I think people tend to like it. I mean if the movie was set in a regular city with no sea, beach and such authentic factors the rating of the movie would be less. Also Celine was presented more like a hysterical, nervous and irrational woman but in the first 2 movies she was not like that. But I must admit that the performances of both actors were really good.

I loved it but I understand why many didn't so this review is for all of those who walked out, didn't get it, were bored senseless or were just 'disappointed' by this film. Firstly, I should say that I saw the previous two films in the last week (for the first time) and read a lot of negative reviews on here about the third film so was prepared to be disappointed. I think this is quite important because how many times have we gone to the cinema full of expectation and been disappointed and how many times have we gone expecting nothing and been pleasantly surprised? There's only one person to blame for that (or to be thankful for?) and I think a lot of people fell into the trap of expecting something amazing (it has an 8 rating so MUST be very good) and left frustrated for reasons I will explain.We all see things differently but that doesn't mean we can't change our opinions on something. I've watched things that people I respect have said was 'sooooo good' and been left dumbfounded. I went back to them to say \"what the hell? It was terrible, it was boring, all he did was complain for half an hour, where's the comedy in that?\" and was told \"yeah, I thought that at first and then I got it, give it time\". I then went back and watched the same episode again and the penny dropped, this time I loved it (Curb Your Enthusiasm). I've done that with music as well, only liked one track, the rest were poor. After playing it a dozen times, I loved all the other tracks but had gone off the one I first liked (Elvis Costello, My Aim Is True). These are two two examples where my initial thoughts/reactions were later completely changed...by myself!So this is my advice for all those that didn't get it. What you mustn't do:Do not see this movie WITHOUT seeing the first two. Anybody watching this movie based on the 8 review here without seeing the first two will sit down expecting to be entertained and will wonder what the hell they have walked into. It will make no sense at all and will bore you to tears.Do not see this movie having remembered how good the first two were, go and watch them again. This is slightly harder to explain. The films cover a period of 18 years and whilst the characters have aged in that time, so have you and that is actually quite important. A film you watched at 23 may seem very different to you at 41. For example, one of my favourite films is Chariots of Fire and when I was younger, I loved the Harold Abraham's character. I could identify with the young man, fighting against the system and recognise his desire to win at all costs. As I grew older I saw that I started to tire of his youthful exuberance and found myself agreeing more with the more thoughtful and respectful Eric Liddell. What I thought at 23 has changed as I've grown older (as Jesse also mentions) and maybe one of the reasons I 'get' this film is that I am now a forty something man, married with kids, ran my own business, separated, got back together, lived abroad etc and can associate a lot of what happens on screen with my own experiences. Maybe for younger people all they see is Jesse and C\u00e9line constantly arguing but I didn't see it that way at all. To me they were just having in- depth discussions (something I wished I'd had more of) whilst demonstrating that on some levels, we never really grow up and are always searching for something.Do not go to see this movie expecting it to be a continuation of the love story from the first two. How could it be? They had one day together in 1995 and another in 2004 and the final scene leaves you in no doubt that they will finally get together... and that's the end of the fairy-tale. In most Hollywood movies, it ends with the two protagonists falling into each other's arms and as the screen fades we are left telling ourselves \"...and they lived happily ever after\". That's the dream, the fantasy, it's what we've come to expect, almost demand but the reality is, when the screen fades we get real life, we get...Before Midnight. I'm not sure this film will appeal to those under 40 who are looking for a love story or a happy ending as it's not a 'standalone' film. Each film is as important as the next and must be seen together to fully understand Jesse and Celine. All three films are magnificent works of art that set the bar ridiculously high for others to follow. The first gives you the dream, the second the chance to make amends and the third takes the possibility of the 'happy ever after' and gives you the reality of it.

            "content": "I was riveted from start to finish. The composition is artful and just as beguiling as Before Sunrise. In Before Sunrise, I found some of the scenes uncomfortable because of the emotional intimacy and accompanying bashfulness of the characters. To me this demonstrated the strength of the script, the composition and, of course, the acting. In Before Midnight, you get that same 'fly on the wall' feeling of intrusion but minus the innocence. Instead, you get to see the parts of relationships (perhaps even similar to yours)that (should) always happen in private and are rarely explored in as much depth as this on the silver screen. I feel like these films acknowledge the truth about people's experience of true love, with that rare follow through that is usually missing from the usual Hollywood ending. In Before Sunrise 'he' talks about how he'd like to make a film documentary of 24 hours in ordinary people's lives. All three of the trilogy are exactly that, and, I feel that this is the most insightful of the three, though less idealistically romantic. I felt privileged to be able to follow these characters, warts and all, through the various stages of their relationship. Despite the fabulous dialogue and excellent character portrayals, I wager many who see this film will understand the events differently as wide scope is left for interpretation and we are not spoon fed the characters' real motivations. This makes it a rich, intellectual and emotional film. Simply stunning and a real treat. *SPOILER* Some people have directed criticism at Julie Delpy for 'arguing at length with her breasts on display' and made remarks about her 'age'. Frankly, I think it adds to the honesty. Who hasn't had a blazing row in the buff before now? And also, the point at which she covers up marks a severe increase on the hostility of the argument, therefore a valid tool for portrayal. Regarding her age? She's in pretty good nick actually, but where do people get off making those remarks, anyhow?",

            "content": "After watching the first movie Before Sunrise (1995) I kinda fell in love with the characters. Their youth, naive thoughts, free minds, open hearts. They were talking about their fears and hopes for the future in a way that made feel somewhat uncomfortable for the brutal honesty but still relieved by the fact that nothing was kept a secret. Nothing romanticized. There were some quotes that got right in to my heart like a knife, making me terrified. Thoughts I've had but never wanted to admit. Like in the pub were Jesse tells Celine that \"I kind of see this all love as this, escape for two people who don't know how to be alone. People always talk about how love is this totally unselfish, giving thing, but if you think about it, there's nothing more selfish.\" So, I followed by watching Before Sunset (2004) and liked it. I was impressed by the love they shared but still having the ability to live their life without each other. Celine not showing up at the train station was a big mystery for me, since I thought she was the hopeless romantic. The twist surprised me, but made me question this as a true love story. Over all the movie was good, and the end made me feel like, well, maybe there is something more to it. Before Midnight turned to be a movie about something completely different, about a life of searching for something that could never be found. To me It's about two people looking for a life they will never find, ending up being lonely with each other. Especially when it comes to Celine, who seems to doubt her love for Jesse more and more during the third film. Jesse on the other hand, seems to get deeper into the relationship every time he opens his mouth to speak, although there's not much space left for him in Before Midnight (completely occupied by Celine) It's something that really scares me when she suddenly starts to panic over how her life turned out. This is a trilogy that contains answers to questions you never dare to ask. It gives you hope, it steals hope. Gave me butterflies and panic at the same time. It's hard to tell if the life and relationship of Jesse and Celine is everything i dream of or everything I fear.",

However, in Boyhood and Nebraska in particular, there were deep surprises and twists that gradually unfold (I very much recommend these two).However, with Before Midnight, I was just completely bored.(Now I like it.)I hate at first watched more than half the movie waiting for it to \"begin.\" It just seemed to drone on and on. Eventually I started skipping parts until I just watched the concluding few minutes. A dysfunctional marriage I thought, so what.However, the next day there were a few lines in the ending that left me curious. I backed up to when the fight (argument/middle of hotel room scene) really began. A lot poured and I watched it to its end, quite engrossed. Great acting. At that point I re-watched the dinner with guests scene and the walk up to the chapel. It was hugely more meaningful and rich having understood what was really underneath.This time I felt moved. So I would highly recommend the movie, but this advise--you need to watch it twice.",

Before Midnight is so simple yet so complex, the Before series is an accomplishment for Julie Delpy, Ethan Hawke and Richard Linklater. It makes you feel a range of relatable emotions.

However with that being said Before Midnight ends with another great note, and hopefully it's conclusive movement in a trilogy.It has definitely been a great contemporary romance, as well as a true definition to realist film making. The takes are long, and the actors perform well in these static shots situated in one of so little places (mounted on the front of a car, etc). Again the film was more of character study over the ambitious plot points that push any blockbuster film. Not much happens but rather the development of a relationship, which is ultimately satisfying to watch for where it has gone over the years since we last seen the two characters.I'll admit that I generally don't like Ethan Hawk but in this film (as well as the previous two in the series) he has performed.This is one of those films you could batch with the independent fanfare films, so don't expect crane shots or other cinematographic maneuvers that will simply drop kick your visual expectations. It is what it is visually, it's a realist film where form is neglected to the point of invisibility, and as a result you witness the characters in all there glory without the (often necessary) satisfaction of great cinematography and / or (for the masses) special effects.Enjoy this film with the love in your life, and you won't regret it.",

            "content": "I've been struggling to decide what I think of this movie...I thought the first two were great; I liked them even more the 2nd time I saw them. Both can be described as two people falling in love, as told through cleverly written but believable dialog.The third one decided to go down a darker alley of \"realism\" by showing us how even a fairy tale-ish couple can end up wringing each other's throats. I have to agree with another review I read: it almost played out like a list of ways how NOT to argue with your partner. It was just barely saved at the end by showing us one important method for recovering from an argument (having a sense of humor), but all in all it was a bit of a downer to see the lovebirds from the previous 2 movies in this bickering state.And I should add that for me personally, the whole scene with the dinner table conversations was a tiny bit annoying - too many different personalities sort of vying for attention, each trying to be more biting or clever than the last person, none quite convincing to me. I found myself thinking \"hey, we don't CARE about you people - let's get back to Jesse and Celine please!\" One could of course argue that the scene was about how they interacted with others and each other, bla bla bla...but in the end I didn't care much for the other characters.I also caught myself thinking that Celine had become extremely bitter and aggressive, and I felt more sorry for Jesse than for her. She came across as almost inconsolable and intolerable. What a drama queen...I wonder if this was intended, or if it's somehow influenced by Linklater's personal view of women (or some woman).I'm giving the movie a 7/10 strictly because it was generally very well played, and because the interactions between Jesse and Celine were very believable, even if less charming than they used to be. But it loses 1-2 points for breaking the mold defined by the previous movies and being less cheery. YES, I just wrote that! I actually think the charm of the 1st two movies was in their ability to create a genuinely romantic mood through believable and interesting dialog. Before Midnight shattered this dreamworld, and its appeal now lies purely in the cinematic aspects - but in the end it's just not as much fun to watch a couple squabble as to seduce each other.Hoping for a more cheerful continuation in a few years!",

The two lead characters converse about philosophy, nostalgia and what ifs\u0085for the most part.

It felt as though we were peering in, on a day in their lives, rather than cutting between scenes, it was authentically done. It made me want to grab my loved ones and head to a hot country and walk through fields with our only our minds for entertainment. I will now proceed to watch the previous 2 films. In case I haven't mentioned it and you wish to know, it could be considered a tale about love, but it is no 'For Lovers Only', instead this film is about compromise, wishful thoughts and the woes of life.PS, I forgot to mention the actress Julie Delpy has this 'normal' look about her, as in she looks real and not fake, not like all the other actresses, and I felt like some applause should be given her.",

Once more Richard Linklater make us explore the meaning of the true love and the difficulties that life can bring us with love, he achieved to direct a wonderful movie by presenting the beautiful places of Greece. The screenplay is absolutely amazing and very realistic, Richard Linklater, Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke achieved to present to us with their screenplay the meaning of true love and how their magical romance that we saw in Before Sunrise and in Before Sunset concludes to a usual marriage with its own problem that many people deal with in their daily life and they still struggling to find back their true love that they may have lost during their marriage. The cast of the movie is one more time excellent, Julie Delpy is better than any other time, she gives a flawless performance that should lead her to the Academy Awards. Ethan Hawke is also very good in his role and the rest of the cast did a great job, especially the great (well know for her movies back in '60s in Greece) Xenia Kalogeropoulou gives a sweet, touching performance that will remain in our memories. The soundtrack is also amazing, the song ''Gia ena tango'' sung by Haris Alexiou (one of the best singers in Greece) gives a sweet melody to the movie. Now, i can say that the trilogy (Before Sunrise,Before Sunset,Before Midnight) is the best trilogy ever made. Before Midnight totally deserves an Oscar nomination for Best Adapted Screenplay and a nomination for Best Leading Actress (Julie Delpy) and why not a nomination for Best Motion Picture. It is difficult to believe that the love story of Jesse and Celine ends with that movie, because these movies taught us many true things, like that even a romance that we think that it could only exist in movies, it can become a usual story like the marriages we meet every day with its own problems, but also with its own moments of happiness and with this movie we can understand the meaning of true love and the meaning of the family. To sum up, we have cried and we have felt the moments of happiness of the romance of Jesse and Celine and we hope that in another 9 years we will see another movie of their love and their family.",

It's hard to believe this is a guy who spent so many years living in Europe. He did settle in as the movie progressed, probably because the scenes are 1/1 with Delpy.As for her, I've always found her very attractive, but not this character. I do know that in her case it's great acting on her part. The both deliver top notch performances in the final scene.I give it a 10 for the setting. I've never seen another major movie shot in the Peloponese and the fact that they use the house built by author and British war hero Patrick Leigh Fermor was a pleasant surprise.Overall the story was raw and very true to life when it comes to long-term relationships and family. The conflict and bickering was sometimes very tough to watch if only because it was so real. Delpy's character did seem to me to be a little too petty and resentful and that hit a nerve, so I do understand some of the other reviews. But I'm a fan of reality in film.

Plus, people don't endlessly converse. They sit in quiet. They go off on chores, often separately. And they don't talk about the same issues endlessly, over 20 years. It was exhausting and at the same time, the conversation was clich\u00e9-ridden to the max. Lastly, Greece is still beautiful, but it is suffering mightily -- yet for all we know, it's still pastoral, home to modestly wealthy people living in beautiful retirement settings. We still know nothing about the main characters' respective homes in Chicago and Paris, except what little they tell us. All in all, much ado about nothing.The format has grown thin as the film's characters and its audience have grown older. The scripted conversation hasn't matured. It hasn't become more sophisticated or more real. It's still two 20somethings working out their youthful angst, only 20 years later with kids involved (somewhat, their presence almost ghostly). Plus, everyone in the Western developed world can remember with warmth their first loves and the disappointments, but not their 40s. Those were less certain times. The characters' predicaments are not necessarily our own in that period. I couldn't get into those portrayed in the film.Still, the lengthy film was over quickly enough, which is a tribute to the reality of the conversation per se.

And the Joana's question can be considered the summary of this movie: what happens after a happy ending. In some sense, several romantic movies create a mythology of quick and highly intense love, able to fulfill every space and solve any difference, simplifying the real long term challenges that will appear in the long road.When the director faced the challenge of telling what comes next in Before Midnight, he decided to follow the same and successful approach of the previous chapter: make the movie nine years after the last one, both in the movie and in the real world. This technique enables not only to have truly older characters, but also to exploit their maturity, life experience and world view.This movie shows us the real beauty of love, challenging the long road of the life; the friction and wear in the relations; the balance between our expectations and egoism against our generosity and impulse to share the experience of life. There is no final answer, no absolute right position and this leads to the question of acceptance or resignation, as well placed by Tim Lott.How love fights in the shades of human poverty is the beauty of this movie.

The first one was awash with the ecstasy of tuning with someone so deeply and heartily whereas the following was reconnecting after nine years. The similarity in this two movies is their encounters were fortuitous,like strangers. When something is sudden,it inevitably brings some excitement and suspense. But the third movie,the last one of the 'Before Trilogy', Before Midnight, compared with the precedings, presents a fairly mundane story devoid of the ensured excitements of suddenness, which turns out to be its speciality as well. This time Jesse and Celine are no longer strangers. They are a married couple living in Paris,with a pair of twin girls. When we actually get what we desired for so long, there remains no room for romanticizing things in our brain provoked by feel-good hormones. Then starts the real journey on the rough patch of the real world. The same Celine and Jesse are here who were immersed in deep philosophical discussions on the streets of Vienna. They are still laughing, making fun and surprising each other. Celine has gained some weight whilst the reddish tint on Jesse's beard has gaily immigrated to the cheeks of their girls. It's not like they are any less adorable or sweet,it's just they have grown out of the naivety that is commonly celebrated in rom-coms. In the other films, they could assume probably what was going on in the other person's head. But the conversations of this films appears such as they've already completed PhD and Post-Doc's on one another. Which is proved by their 'lethal' participation in conjugal quarrels, when they specialize in on which moment on which point to hit, on which aches to scratch so that the other one can be left speechless. Now, their conversations don't contain nerdy larger-than-life philosophical stuffs, rather the reflection of past mistakes and daily complexities including the future of Jesse's son from the previous marriage or Celine's job. They fight on those issues and importantly, reconcile. With the succession of the previous two, 'Before Midnight' could have been highly romanticized as the cheesy climax of the whole series. But it would lack then the vital two factors of the whole series-naturalness and authenticity. With the merger of this two virtues, Before Midnight thoroughly complements the whole series. Otherwise, as a separate singular film it wouldn't create this much appeal.",

There were hints before during the walk that looked more like they were dating rather than dating for many years. The feeling that they don't know each other is obvious to me, actors playing roles. They have a bit of chemistry but not married chemistry for sure. That is essential in this movie. I like the philosophical concepts addressed but I can't go beyond that.",

I didn't know this was a sequel at all, or rather, I didn't even know there is Jesse and Celine, what is the movie all about. We caught the movie for a silly reason, because we thought the local production we wanted to support \"The Girl In Pinafore\" is screening already.. but oops, it's not up yet! Haha...Love it totally! If you yearn for true love, this is it! Cruel but realistic, which is also why, you will feel moved by their dialogues and acting, and feel like crying!! I didn't really weep like there's no tomorrow, coz it's not sadness I'm feeling, it's more like tears rolling in your eyes, but they do not drop... \u6211\u662f\u611f\u52d5\u5566\uff01 Now, what I want to do is, to catch Before Sunrise and Before Sunset too!!!!

The writers could put the couple speaking for three hours straight in the same location and I would still love the movie. In the end I felt like it hadn't had an ending. I couldn't forgive a betrayal. And they both got along too much well for my taste. The location was also divine.

Now here we are in 2003, in what it appears to be the end of this trilogy. The once young couple has grown older and is still madly in love. What I really like about this movie is the simplicity. People are always looking for the extraordinary in everything and they forget how surprising daily life can be. They forget about the magic of an ordinary conversation, when you talk about nothing and everything at the same time. They forget about the real connection between two persons. This is what this movie is about. Sharing simple things, arguing about life and time and changes, but still be together in finding a solution. It shows how to hold on and hold tight, tolerate, find a common language that makes everything easier.I wasn't expecting this third movie about Jesse and Celine, and I was really curious. One thing I can tell : I wasn't expecting this. The characters were more mature, and the lines more interesting. I also liked the supporting characters's part and the place it was set. This movie showed us their real life as a couple. You don't 'want to miss it, but if you haven't, start with the first ones.",

Maybe not. They did leave it open-ended, much like the other two films, but I don't know what they would even title a 4th movie: Before 3am? I have to say as much as I liked this movie though, I cant say that I have a favorite of any of the three. They are all incredibly unique in their own ways. The first one I loved for the premise about uncertainty for ones future. The second one I loved for the ending: \"You are going to miss your plane\"....\"I know.\" **roll credits**.

My love of that film means that I consider the trilogy to be one of the best if not the best in film history. However, at the very least, it now has competition. Richard Linklater's Before Trilogy is a thing of beauty, in every meaning of the word. I watched Before Sunrise (1996) and Before Sunset (2004) very swiftly in succession, but I left it a while before watching the climax to the trilogy simply because I didn't want the magic of watching the trilogy for the first time to end.  Set nine years after the cliffhanger ending of Sunset, Jesse and Celine are now a couple living in Pars, as well as being Father and Mother to twin girls. We join them at a tiny Greek airport; they are in Greece on vacation. To explain why they are at the airport (neither of them are travelling) would be to give away a plot point that knocked me for six, and if you haven't seen it yet, I urge you to not look up any details of the plot before you do. Celine and Jesse return to their idyllic vacation for the last night, and friends have booked a hotel room for both of them for the night while they look after the twins. They reminisce about their lives and their relationship, discussing what's to come and what past choices might have led to different outcomes. It's great just to just be in the prescence of these two again, but as someone who has gone through a marriage break up since I saw the last film, a lot of the disagreements and issues hit home; the difference is of course is that this isn't real; Linklater can choose how this ends either way. At one point Jesse has been pushing the point that he might like to move back to America (I won't say why) and although he tries to argue the point that Celine and the twins are his priority, and would always put them first, Celine suggests that what he means is \"Do this or I will resent you for the rest of our lives.\" If that is Jesse's meaning, it is of course not fair on Celine, even though the reason for moving to America is built on an exceptionally sturdy platform. But it's about compromise, and what you ultimately want; despite the fact that they're not married, Jesse and Celine are as committed as any married couple should be, but Before Midnight shows you how difficult that commitment can be, in an exceptionally beautiful yet absorbing and heartfelt way. The location is luscious, complimenting the script and characters to the hilt. Of course the performances are superb, Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy are well versed in these two characters already; but it really feels like they're as invested in these characters as we are, and the performances show it. Hawke is used to this sort of aging over time accomplishment from Linklater, he was part of a similar process for Linklater's Boyhood (2014). The Before Trilogy is Linklater's crowning achievement for me though, and that's saying something considering his output. If you haven't seen any of them, I envy you.",

They also have such a different way of experiencing the world, and they never felt right for each other. They're both the most pretentious and self centred characters I've ever seen, but Celine completely took the mantle of the least likeable character by the last movie. Jesse opened up to her, asked her to be a friend for 2 seconds, told her that being away from his son was destroying him, and she brushed him off for being dramatic, and tried to say that he was just trying to blame her. She is the exact type of person that I eradicate from my life. Honestly, if you think that Celine is remotely right at the end I don't what to say. She is so manipulative, and always ends up the victim of something. Always manages to forget the advantages in life. She is insufferable, and made the movie unwatchable.

There's more competition compared to the originality of the film's predecessors with its use of more frank dialogue, going back decades, as well as a greater frequency of sappy dialogue. A lot of this criticism stems from the fact that I saw Bergman's Scenes From a Marriage a few weeks back, and that's a hard bar to clear for the genre. Still, there is plenty of great writing in the film's second half, particularly the climactic hotel room fight and the subsequent reconciliation. (4/5)",

Before Midnight, the 3rd installment, is still convo-focused but it's introduced other actors/actresses and it's refreshing.\n\nThese were my predictions that I wrote when I had to stop watching the movie for adequately valid reasons:\n\n\"I feel like something uncomfortable in either Jesse or Celine will start brewing or be aggravated, and be one of the focal points of the movie which will lead to the conclusion. I'm already making assumptions and it's only 1/4 the movie. I'm interested in this 3rd movie. Maybe the plot will be simpler than that (my prev assumption) and conversations will still drive it.\" I was kind of right. \ud83d\ude01\n\nI honestly found Celine very off-putting in this movie. Neurotic, egoistic. Usually in movies i think, it's the guy who's bad (maybe I'm wrong), but it feels like they switched roles on this one. The guy is the rational, calm one. Their story is truly a great example why it's probably better if couples live-in before getting married so they can assess/reflect if they're really a good match or if it's worth all the trouble down the road.\n\nIn the end, the movie offered a compelling perspective about HOPE and what it means to be a romantic. Despite the seemingly insurmountable challenges surrounding them and the terrible fight they just had, Jesse upped his game and showed that he was still the romantic, sensitive guy that Celine met 18 years ago in the train in Vienna. Celine made a quick decision to help save the relationship by a curious question, resorting to her playful side and doing her usual role-playing fashion.\n\nHawke and Delpy were credited as screenwriters in this 3rd installment, Before Midnight, and the previous, Before Sunset. Performance is so stunning, so natural, well-paced, annoying but witty and realistic despite the incredibly/admirably long takes.\n\nBefore Midnight is one of those romantic movies that offers a pragmatic view on love. An appropriate approach to bourgeois, aged romance. My other rating is an 8/10, also due to my intermittent watch. Highly recommend to watch all the trilogy from the start.",

As does Jesse's success and artistic career, a topic explored interestingly here in ways that most likely reflect the lives of all the creators and actors involved.\n\nWe see their pragmatism as a couple, we see their family, we see their connection and we see their disdain and their evolution as people. But only at the end do we see both their hate and their love, often two sides of the same coin for long-term couples. Their love is still there, it's just shifted and adapted to their new lives with all the challenges they now have.\n\nI always likes this movie but never connected to it previously, I thought the end was sad, deeply sad, how could two people who love each other say these things to each other? Or feel this way without a total collapse of their relationship? But now, being in a committed, long-term relationship with someone in their 40's, I know that ending well. \n\nBesides La La Land, Before Midnight has the most realistic couple fight I've ever seen, it ebbs and flows, and that entire segment harks back to Linklater's little-seen experiment Tape. It's a deep, deep character study and I hope dearly that they make another one and commit to film another era in two people's lives that we rarely see with this clarity and honesty.",

            "content": "I feel almost disappointed in myself for not loving this film the way I love Before Sunrise (1995) and Before Sunset (2004). Maybe it was just that I aspire to the dramatic, romantic early stages of romance where people are young and beautiful and presenting the best parts of themselves but I found this film to be forced in many parts and the character of Celine to be hard to relate to. The location of Greece is of course beautiful and it was pleasant seeing Ariane Labed in a non-Yorgos Lanthimos film but I felt that neither of these elements were used particularly well and the writing didn't feel as natural or as endearing as in the previous film. It still had it's great moments but when I consider how perfect it's predecessors are I can't help feeling disappointed.\n\nWe meet Jesse, Ethan Hawke, and Celine, Julie Delpy, 18 years after they first met in Vienna and they now reside in Paris with their twin daughters, Ella and Nina, while Jesse's son Hank lives in Chicago. The two are on holiday in Greece and after Jesse places his son on a plane home and they leave their daughters with other caretakers to enjoy a few days on their own. They visit the house of a friend and talk to a young couple who are experiencing similar emotions to those they had felt and then retire to a rented hotel. They have an argument about whether Jesse wants to prevent Celine from further pursuing his career as he wants to move back to America to be closer to his son and we see love after a long time together can be hard but rewarding.\n\nThe best parts of the film were the early discussions between Jesse and Celine when they reminisce about the time when Celine was pregnant and the various flaws they have identified in one another. This felt like what a couple in a long term relationship would genuinely talk like and the clear love that the two still hold for one another was clear even as they criticize each other. The issue at the center of the argument also felt contemporary and you could feel sympathy for both sides of the argument as you want to see Celine professionally succeed but also understand Jesse's obvious desire to be a better father to his son. The execution of the argument wasn't great but the bare bones and some of the dialogue were great and there is a novelty to seeing characters I love attempt to have sex and then have a huge argument.\n\nThe major issue I had with this film was how forced parts of it felt, unlike the first two films where all of the interactions felt very natural and unforced while still being polished here it all felt contrived. The dinner table scene with their friends in particular was shot like it was part of one of those Sky travel shows that jumps around from character to character far too quickly and all of the laughter and furtive glances felt so uncomfortable. The argument also felt a little too staged as each actor gets a moment to yell and scream about whatever issue they have but the dramatic close ups reminded me of a Lifetime original not a Richard Linklater film. Delpy's performance and the writing of Celine was the other big issue because she is not sympathetic and Delpy's one note delivery leaves her looking like a wet blanket not a woman with relatable marital issues.\nDelpy has never been a great actress but in the previous films her presence alone is enough, here she is asked to make a difficult character likable and she fails.\n\nThis film is still much better than most of the schlock out there and I would definitely recommend this film to most people to finish the trilogy and spend more time with these characters that we have grown to love. I wanted something different than what Linklater set out to make and that's a problem not with the film but with me as an audience member. I hear there is going to be a fourth film and I am still really looking forward to that if it does happen.",

Both actors did a superb job of playing the role of selfish moral relativists adrift on the sea of post-industrial godless consumerism.

It carries the same humanness of the previous Before movies (Sunrise and Sunset), but unlike the previous two which have more universal human emotional appeal, Before Midnight steps a bit farther into the realm of The Crazy. Therefore, it may feel quite foreign, uncomfortable, incomprehensible, and more, for those who don't have as much (or more) of The Crazy within themselves. It's not surprising that there was a lot more discourse on how good the movie was, since it didn't ring as true for as many people.\n\nSince it's nominated for Adapted Screenplay (the \"adapted\" coming from the fact that it's based on characters which have appeared in other media, namely the two prequels), this is more or less a good thing: it engages fully with the range of human language, is beautifully set and blocked by these two actors which we know are... intimate with each other (spoilers!), and carries a weight that's hard to find in most movies. But, it's also less resounding: it doesn't remind us of ourselves as much as the previous movies, it isn't as romantic (in fact, it's barely romantic), and I would assert (as others have before me), that it takes a happy ending over a real ending. That, especially as the last taste of a pie which was generally quite delicious, is disappointing.\n\nInitially I loved the screenplay, and I still think it's strong. But, it's not an Oscar winner in my book. It's a necessary part of a movie education (mostly because Before Sunrise and Before Sunset are crucial, and you won't be able to finish the latter without watching Before Midnight), but that's about as far as I'd go.",

I've really liked Linklater's other two Before movies, but this one might be my favorite. The other two were definitely not mainstream tripe, but I really feel like this one was the most mature. Call it the most mature out of a very mature trilogy. This is a wise film, and masterfully made. Its deep meditations on love, life, families, and so on, are so intelligently presented; whether you agree with them or not. This is what will spark conversation after the movie! The themes are so well-explored that you WANT to talk about them at the end of it, and the conclusion that the movie ends up at is not contrived in any way, and is honestly very realistic whilst being ever-so optimistic. This movie feels SO real. Every conversation had me invested, and when they bickered or really argued I got anxious because of how real and on-edge it made me feel. Frankly, it reminded me of people I know, which put me even more on-edge. The dialogue, these performances, the long takes; all of it is beautiful. And if I can link this to my Boyhood review (and further make my point there), this movie and Boyhood are both great on a technical scale, of course, but this one made me feel. Boyhood didn't. That's the difference for me. But in closing, this is a great movie that will spark conversation about love and commitment for years to come.

They turn the tropes into something refreshing, much needed for their respective genres. The second movie uses what was great about the predecessor, for the creation of a cinematic masterpiece. The third movie finishes unfinished business, with satisfying results amid surprisingly weak moments. And much like Return of the Jedi, Before Midnight is the only film in the series that would struggle to stand on its own. The characters have grown older, wiser, and at the brink of midlife crises. A common theme in the trilogy is that Hawke and Delpy have open, non-judgmental, thought-provoking conversations, yet struggle to communicate how they feel in a direct manner. Before Midnight highlights the dark side to this. What if they actually need to be away from each other? More fruit for thought, only this time, it's at the expense of the same level of interest that was attained in previous movies. I don't believe it was bound to happen, but nevertheless, expect some of the usual relationship conflicts and miscommunication in most other romance films. Hawke and Delpy's commitment to their roles makes up for that greatly, and it's not that I don't believe the conflict on screen. Linklater's take on romance is refreshingly in touch with reality. I just had to make more of an effort to care, this time around.",

It focuses mainly on the messiness of real relationships and how even the purest of love stories often has an ugly and cynical side that can resurface and manifest itself at any moment. Jealousy, depression, anxiety, idealism, deception, regret, communication, facades, broken families, contentment, and perseverance all take center stage as the film discusses its central question: does true love fade? The film benefits from its use of different perspectives from a limited, albeit diversely aged, cast in the opening act, and these dinnertime debates serve as the foundation of the sparkling yet heart wrenching discussions and fights of the leads. Nonetheless, the malicious words and seemingly endless despair and pathos of the evolving conversation serve to beautifully juxtapose the film's wonderfully affecting, sentimental, and optimistic closing scene that provides a touching callback to Before Sunrise.",

It's Ethan Hawke's Jesse and Julie Delpy's C\u00e9line another nine years later, this time vacationing in Greece, but they're different now. The idealistic nature of the two completely unrelated souls that were seemingly meant to cross paths in Richard Linklater's Before Sunrise is gone, and taking its place is are two reflective, troubled souls. This kind of somber storytelling was introduced in Before Sunset, sandwiched in between Sunrise and Midnight, but the latter pushes it even further. All seems well at first, with Jesse and C\u00e9line engaging in the same kind of intellectual conversations, and ultra long takes of course (one take involving a long car ride is particularly impressive), Linklater has seemingly perfected, but problems slowly but surely arise as this 18 year relationship begins to take its toll on our protagonists. It results in a tense standoff between the two characters that makes them, and us as viewers too, question if this relationship was truly meant to be. It's absolutely heartbreaking and truly bittersweet, and the film as a whole is most likely Linklater's most mature outing to date.\n\nThe Greek setting seems to mirror this relationship rather well. It's an undeniably beautiful sight to behold, even despite its age. Perhaps it was more beautiful in the past, but like all things, age has taken its toll, and it's not quite the same as it once was. Maybe this is just all coincidence, but don't put it past someone as intelligent and philosophical as Richard Linklater.",

            "content": "The contentious debate has been raging for decades--what is the great movie trilogy of all time? Is it the original Star Wars? Indiana Jones? Lord of the Rings? For me, the answer has always been Richard Linklater's \"Before\" trilogy. Composed of three films (\"Before Sunrise,\" \"Before Sunset,\" and \"Before Midnight\") each shot ten years apart, this trilogy tells the story of American Jesse and French Celine as they meet, fall in love, lose touch for a decade, reconnect, and eventually stay together and have two children in what is probably one of the greatest and most honest cinematic love stories of all time.\n\nAll three of these films are pretty fantastic, but \"Before Midnight\" has always been my personal favorite. While \"Sunrise\" focuses on the hopeful innocence and idealism of young love and \"Sunset\" is about the excitement of rekindling an old flame, by the events of \"Midnight,\" Jesse and Celine have been together for almost ten years, and are beginning to realize that every day of a relationship is not like the one magical night they shared in Vienna almost two decades ago. This allows \"Midnight\" to be the most textured film of the bunch--not only does it explore the good parts of romantic love, but also the resentment, doubt, and sacrifice that become part of any long term relationship.\n\nWhat makes \"Midnight\" such a great film is its realism. Jesse and Celine are not characters, but people. Hawke and Delpy realize their roles so fully that you actually believe the two have spent the last ten years together, and so much of their history is implied without having to be spoken aloud or explained through exposition. When they argue (and they do), it is an argument composed of little wounds and slights that have accumulated over the years, all pouring forth at once. They fight dirty and say things they don't mean, and if you've ever been in a long-term relationship, you'll cringe, because you've probably said the exact same things at some point.\n\nI'm probably making it seem like by \"Before Midnight,\" Jesse and Celine have become bitter, loveless, and old, but this isn't true at all. The two still love each other deeply, even if they themselves can't see it at times. The nervous, jittery, talking at a-mile-a-minute infatuation they felt for each other in the first two films has dissipated of course, but it has been replaced by something more real and honest--a deep comfortability and contentedness that comes with time. Theirs is a relationship built more off friendship and deep mutual respect than anything else. Even when they fight, it is still obvious they care for one another, and every time they can't help delivering a particularly cruel barb, you can see they regret it. They are both deeply flawed, conflicted people, but they're both trying hard to be better.\n\nThe film is technically masterful as well. The cinematography is nothing too fancy, relying more on the stunning beauty of coastal Greece to provide a pleasing visual aesthetic rather than any sort of artsy camera work, but the long, extended shots definitely add to the natural, flowing dialogue as Jesse and Celine walk the quaint Grecian streets. The film's score is beautiful as well, and for the first time, I realized that it contains musical echoes of the waltz Celine sings at the end of \"Sunset,\" which is a nice throwback.\n\nTo me, \"Before Midnight\" is practically flawless, but I do realize that not everyone would appreciate similarly. Like many of Linklater's other films, \"Midnight\" is almost 100% dialogue and zero plot. Celine and Jesse wander from dinner to the beach to the streets of Greece, but if you're waiting for some major event to happen, don't hold your breath. The film breaks many rules of traditional cinema, and if you're someone who who is particularly fond of tidy narratives and black-and-white endings, you might not get as much out of this film as some. That being said, don't let that turn you away from this film, because if I deter even a single person from watching it in this review, I will be a failure.\n\nOn a closing note and as a bit of an aside, I will say that I really see the \"Before\" trilogy as one long, extended movie, best viewed one after the other, or at least in within two or three days of each other. This is the way I've watched them every single time. Each film is packed with so much nuance, and it would be a shame to forget something because you watched the films six months apart. So the next time you're thinking about marathoning the Star Wars original trilogy for the six millionth time, put it down and marathon the \"Before\" trilogy instead. You won't regret it.",

Before Midnight may of course be the only romantic film that believes that the concept of soul mate and long term commitment are simply sugar coated lies. Although I wish to disbelieve in it, I am given a vivid account of the fact that it is true. Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy give standout performances as always.

I think this one could be boiled down to less than half a dozen scenes in total, where every one tells a completely different story and shows a different side of these lovable characters.\n\nThe scene where they were driving just shows a couple that's been together for a little while having fun, driving around, reminiscing, and just enjoying the moment. The scene where Jesse discusses his idea for the next book gives a look into what kind of person he is and what he does for a living. It only took two decades, but we see how an individual's career is ever changing and doesn't have predetermine achievable milestones. The lunch table scene was probably my favorite. It was a conversation that touched on physical attraction, emotional connection, young love, loved that transcends death, the rise of AI in computing technology, literature and so much more. Set in a beautiful atmosphere where I would love to spend a summer, it was a group of individuals I would have loved to dine with. The scene where they walked through the city gave me hope. It showed that relationships aren't so bad if you put a bit of effort into them. However, the last scene ruined it all. It was tough to watch and hit really close to home, where a lot of the debates are ones I've seen myself growing up.\n\nI love that the tone and the characters remain the same but the themes change. It shows that we, as people, never really change, but it is only what we're concerned with around us that's mutable. Our view and perspective of the world may develop and become more well grounded, but for the most part it is still the same. Jesse was a horny teenager in 1994, 2003 and 2012. At first he had no worries and no plans, then he had a bad marriage with a kid and a best seller, and eventually he moved on to two marriages, established as an author, but still a horny teenager. Celine was always a crazy political feminist/activist, and nothing changed. The only difference is that she simply had more responsibilities and shit to deal with after the twins were born. \n\nIf not for the very last scene, I'd have a very difficult time letting go of the movie, but it's relieving to see that they found a way to reconnect and reignite the flame of passion from almost two decades ago.

            "content": "I wasn't crazy about the first 1/3 of this movie as there were too many ancillary characters (including the children) that \"muddied the waters\" a bit.  I get that they were a necessity for catching up on the happenings of the past 9 years and establishing the current state of everything, but nevertheless I wasn't nearly as engaged as I had been throughout the first 2 films.\n\nHowever, once they leave the dinner party for their \"adult night\" away from the kids, we get back to the energy that was apparent in the first two films - except it is through an opposing lens from the other films as they are now a long-standing couple with real problems rather than two hopeful souls who desire to be together more than anything.  And, with that, comes entirely different conversational tones and topics; but they are able to maintain the give-and-take banter and energy present in the other films.  The topics just happen to be of a much more negative and volatile nature as the pendulum has swung from trying to figure out how to BE together to trying to figure out how to STAY together with all the deep seeded and resentful problems that have festered for years and are now erupting to the surface in one fell swoop.  And, it is very fascinating and comes off very real.  The last few minutes puts the viewer on the edge of his or her seat with a \"will they/won't they\" question of a different variety as Linklater, Hawke, and Delpy expertly raises the stakes and tangibly puts the entire relationship (and consequently the retrospective importance of the first two films) in major jeopardy.  A  very good end to one of the best trilogies not only in its genre, but any genre.\n\nGrade = 8/10",

If the first two are the butterflies in the stomach, this one is about the petty frustrations of daily lives that keep them from having that much dreamed of \"happy ever after.\" The same two passionate, idealistic people now have to deal with frustrations and life decisions and responsibilities and even infidelities.

I was young at that time and had my own distant relationships in the past, I was a lost hope and a romantic thinking that the story in the movie is exactly what will end up happening to me. The ending in that film made me feel empty and sad but in a tragic way because it is always sad to say goodbye specially when you think you have met your soul mate and for reasons beyond your control you can not be with them. \n\nThen I watched Before Sunset and it made me happy, the ending left us with a possible hope for both characters. It was like the will it happen? Would it be so bad if he ends up staying with her and leaving his wife? Surely that is the wrong thing to do? You just don't know what is wrong and what is right yet you feel happy because after their first meeting they finally got the chance to see each other again and would you really let go of your first ever love again?\n\nBefore Midnight is a sad story. It is sad because it probably relates to most relationships of today. In the first films you have hope, happiness, innocent love, being together forever moments and what not. This movie is grown up, it is reality and you can tell from the body language from the beginning of the film that this won't be a sweet romantic day like their last two films. This is the truth, they are now parents and have gone past the 'honeymoon' phase which we all do. I grew up as a kid thinking people end up together forever because my grandparents had been married for so many years, my parents too and so were most if not all my family and I had that idea in my head that romance never dies and that if you meet your soul mate and the one that makes your heart melt then surely nothing can go wrong. This movie makes you realise that all that is an innocent young persons thinking and it hurts. It is such a great film, one that made me feel so sad inside afterword but yet again left me with some hope that they would work things out possibly. The saddest part is that they will never feel the same way they did when they first met, or when they met again and no matter how hard they will try that will always be a memory. It is just the sad truth about life, we all go through it and we all go past it. Once again Ethan and Julie were immense, the conversations flow and you feel like you are with them through out the movie just like the last two, You forget that these two people are acting and once they have that fight your heart breaks and you know and feel what is coming, the memories of the first two films come crushing down and you realise that the truth, real life, is not such a nice place after all.",

Once again Richard Linklater hits on such a real level. Where as the first two movies seemed only full of happiness and joy, this last one touched on this aspect however, half way through the film  it took a deep turn. This couple has been romanticized throughout the first two movies that to see them at such odds with each other made for a great third movie. This movie depicts real adult couples with real struggles and how to balance what everyone wants in life. Linklater quite nicely again uses elongated scenes that truly make the viewer feel like a fly on a wall of this random couple's hotel room. It does not feel like a film, but actual lives put to screen. The constant bickering and perfect tense changes is almost painful to watch and fascinating at the same time. This entry in my opinion puts Hawke's Jesse in the spotlight as the hero as Celine seems to be unnecessarily causing most of the battles between the two. That leads me to the only negative of this film which is its re-watchability factor. Before Sunrise does a great job as I do see myself watching it several times in the future. I wish I could say the same for Before Midnight however, the second part of this film consists of practically one stretched out scene which is made up of almost seventy percent a fight. Although true and real to the characters and relationships themselves, it may just be too much to swallow a second time around. The first film was so much fun where this one is slightly on the heavier side. I do still consider it a must watch for fans of Richard Linklater, Ethan Hawke, and this series of films.",

And even though Hawke is a loyal, easy-going stay-at-home dad, he still believes fairies will wipe his pee off the toilet seat.\n\nI saw this movie last night in a budget cinema in a working-class neighbourhood. I heard men laugh triumphantly after Hawke would sensitively and rationally, as he put it, scold Delpy. He saw anger as a negative. She saw it as a necessity. She was inspired when her children demonstrated outbursts of anger. But Hawke has the privilege of being content. Women in the audience didn't laugh quite as hard when Delpy counter-scolded Hawke.\n\nTwo covered Islamic girls sat beside me and from their laughter I could tell they enjoyed and even related to the gender and cultural conflicts waged between the two characters. (There was an sufficient amount of American-bashing from Ms. Delpy.) But did they agree with Delpy's feminist thesis? Were they prepared to stand up to their religious and patriarchal authority figures in their household and in their community at large? Would they take to the streets and burn their hijabs along with their bras? Or was the message ironic to them? A cautionary tale of a western woman's stubborn but doomed battle for equality?\n\nAnd after 50 years and counting, I wonder.",

            "content": "9 more years later, Linklater, Hawke and Delpy returned for another demonstration of emotional heft in the third film of the \"Before...\" series. It is not a trilogy, nor is it the end. What we have here is another evolution of the relationship between two people which has now been twice examined in the form of film. This is the constant. Once again it is the people that change, but also the world around them. Every film in the series is set whenever it is filmed. However long ago the last film was released, we have had as much time pass as the characters.\n\nWhile there is a cycle to this, Before Midnight shows that the progression of life does not follow that particular pattern. Before Midnight is again made in the same style to Before Sunrise and Before Sunset, but is inherently a very different film. It much fiercer and more broad than the first two. We have secondary characters for a start, who all get their own chance to join in on the conversation and deliver their wisdoms. The world of Celine and Jesse (once again superbly represented by Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke), which has been so insulated from our point of view, was now expanding to reveal their interactions with other people.\n\nBefore Midnight does manage to maintain the standards of the first two films, making this one of the most brilliant and consistent trilogies of all time. If anything, some of the scenes have even extended in length, one of the hallmarks of the earlier films. The film is set in Greece, but as the people get older, the setting seems to play less and less a part in proceedings.\n\nEverything flows really naturally, there is no contrived dialogue used to introduce backing story or plot points. Everything is presented in its own time, and the audience is given the credit to discern what is happening for themselves. Sometimes this aren't quite clear because we haven't been given enough information. Such is life. The film is a window into the lives of two people we have come to know very well. What is outside the window is not relevant, but it is present, because it affects what is happening on screen.\n\nThe more you see the more you realise it has become a piece of art. We can all gaze at it and feel effected in different ways. We compare ourselves to it or we get a glimpse at our future. Each film is a firm marker in these people's lives, and we can look at where we are and place it in relation to these films. Because Jesse and Celine are just a couple who have lived a life dictated by themselves as much as they can. In that people can see themselves. Then, now, tomorrow.\n\nCoda: In what is probably not the final film of the series, Before Midnight continues to be just as fascinating and insightful, but also adds a big dose of intensity not seen before. A real triumph.\n\nRead more at rabsi1.weebly.com/film/",

It's certainly the most intense of the trilogy, focusing heavily on the conflict between these two characters after years of being together.  It's the hardest to watch of the three, because the problems between the two feel so real.  That's the beauty of the \"Before\" trilogy.  It's a simple concept, but it feels completely authentic.

It still has the humor, in fact Julie Delpy imitation of a bimbo was the most laugh I have had in the series but the arguments between the couple while interesting and fresh is sad.  Also it does have some dull moments, the pacing was not as good as the previous installments and it is the lengthiest movie of the trilogy.

            "content": "Mixed feelings about this movie, the third of Richard Linklater's trilogy.  \n\nThe trilogy started in 1995 with Before Sunrise, continued in 2004 with Before Sunset and now, another nine years later, we have Before Midnight.  The movies follow the lives and love of Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and Celine (Julie Delpy), with the span in years between movies reflecting the spans in their lives.  We are getting snapshots of their lives, at nine-year intervals.\n\nBefore Sunrise was OK, but not great.  Really a dressed-up romantic drama, just with a more realistic and original plot and more subtle direction than your average romance movie.\n\nBefore Sunset was the pick of the bunch.  Rather than just a snapshot, it relates, through their dialogue, all the happenings in the last nine years of their lives, and demonstrates how much each of them were key in the other's life.  It had more of a complete story and more character development.\n\nBefore Midnight now picks up with them together, with their two kids, holidaying in Greece.  Like the first two, it is very dialogue-intensive.  Like the first two (especially Before Sunrise) the dialogue can be a big negative at times: pretentious, navel-gazing stuff.\n\nHowever, on the plus side, we get to see how relationships end up.  Romantic dramas tend to end with the couple walking off into the sunset, very much in love, blissfully happy and without a care in the world.  They never cover all the unromantic, even irritating, stuff that comes after it: kids, domestic life, mundanity.  This does.\n\nOn the downside, there is a reason this is never covered: it's boring, even annoying.  Who wants to see a bitter, very protracted argument between husband and wife?  Or people discussing domestic stuff?  \n\nThus, a two-edged sword.\n\nSo, kudos to Richard Linklater for the concept of these movies and for not shying away from the less glamorous domestic years in a relationship.  However, the domestic years aren't very entertaining to watch...",

Greece is one of the best places for lovers of discourses of philosophical nature, and where people can engage and learn about multi-cultural differences. Their life appears as if it was picturesquely drawn. They have never anticipated that their relationship would last to the very present.\nTwin daughters are sleeping in the back, whereas they embark on conversations about their existential life romantically, as they always do. Everyone writes one's life with one's own notions, expressing the moments one passes through. They listen carefully to each other, though frequently conflicts invade their discussions, but in a smooth manner. They wholeheartedly accept one another's individualistic nature, and appreciate the way their relationship is shaped.\nThey are old now, but not that old. Early forty partnerships are considered old for being vibrant. An authentic partnership is filled with real understanding, true passion, deep conversation, high appreciation and love. Perhaps, love is the most important factor here, but love, with all its powerful impetus, cannot stand alone, no matter how it's defined or perceived. It has to be embraced with enthusiastic components.\nAccording to Nietzsche, love doesn't make relationships last, but friendship does. I will have to agree with Nietzsche on that, as love is inextricably subjective. Most love for their sake, and their partners reciprocate. Partners love what they love about their partners. They love what they perceive who their partners are. Accordingly, they are more of self-lovers, rather than being true lovers. Relationships survive that way, but not for a long time, and they're inclined to collapse.\nNevertheless, friendship is what people seek in others. Friendship is defined by bonding willingly. Its core meaning lies in the flowing of unstructured but meaningful words. It's about being satisfied with the other, accepting who they truly are and who they choose to be, without attempting to re-mold them the way we like. Thence, Nietzsche must be right about placing friendship in relationships of sustainable character.\nWith that said, conversations can go in an opposite direction. No matter how couples understand and respect one another, conversations go rhetorically very often. Jesse and Celine knew that, and they were not always in accordance. Things go wrong sometimes, and lead to breakup. However, resorting to empathy, breaking through other's feelings and tolerating them, what forfend foreseen unpleasant endings.\nThe film presents ideas on sexual intercourse during a gathering lunch, and treats the topic from different angles. Each states one's perspectives and preferences, based on their experiences and circumstances. They come to consensual conclusion that sexual delight for both partners is conducive to healthy relationships.\nRichard Linklater, the director and the co-writer, ends his dramatically remarkable trilogy in a way that cannot be missed. Romanticism flows within the inescapable realities, even in most flawless scenarios. That is how the perfect match goes by their lives in \"Before Midnight\". Jesse and Celine would never end their deep stroll discussions unless they die together.",

It is not as depressing as it sounds, however. Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy still manages to string some laughs, along with the highly clever dialogue, and Linklater still is king (With the help of his two tremendous actors, in their best performances yet) at doing these really long scenes that feel improvised and spontaneous. The trilogy closes, again, magically in Before Midnight. It's a solid film, if at times dour, but it still is uplifting feeling how we growed with this characters.",

Addressing the problems of the last film, Jesse worries about the distance between him and his son, about how much his ex-wife loathes him, and his own shortcomings as a father and a writer. Celine works constantly and worries about their life in Europe and how they adjusted to their marital woes. They argue, bicker, and yet love each other unequivocally, showing the audience that yes things get rough, and sometimes you want to quit, but in the end love is malleable and never-ending in its simplicity.

While you are watching the film, you wish that Celine would take a chill pill and enjoy her night away with her long time boyfriend and father of her girls. However, I understand that when the moment comes where you are finally alone with your spouse after years of caring for the house, spouse and kids, you are too tired and too stressed and too bitter to just let it all go and have fun for the night. You need to process everything that has gone on in the relationship that you didn't have time to acknowledge. There were a lot of issues that had been swept under the carpet until this one night that we catch up with Jesse and Celine. I felt like I was in between them watching their tennis match, with my head going back and forth between the characters.

The technique to attract audiences by dialogue is consistent with the previous works.

If you have watched Jesse and Celine in the first two films, you have watched a pair of young people fall in love, then grow up and reconnect and decide they want to be together.  Here, with Before Midnight, we see what became and what is likely to become of that situation, as it does when any two people decide to be together.  These two know each other.  They know what the other likes and dislikes.  They know each other's idiosyncrasies.  They also know how to push each other's buttons.  We see them do all of this.  What was once a sweet couple of young people discovering love in each other's arms is now a couple enduring the hardship of having a family in difficult circumstances.  We see how they both compliment one another while also seeing how easily they can erupt towards the other.  It's that raw, tense balance that this film relies on and does so perfectly, as no other film about couples does.  Like the other two \"Before\" films, the dialogue and scenery is wonderful, but here there is an edge to the situation because we aren't sure if this couple we've fallen in love with feel the same way about each other anymore.  In the end though, as Jesse talks to Celine about what things could be like in their 80s, we can't help but hope that a fourth film will catch up with them when they get there.  The Before Trilogy, if it remains only a trilogy, is one of cinema's finest, and Before Midnight caps it off beautifully.",

Love is all, love is able to come together and at the same time, break all connections. 'Before Midnight' is simply touching. I Recommend and recommend again it to anyone who hasn't watched.

            "content": "If there's anything to be learned from Richard Linklater's Before trilogy, it's that romance movies don't have to be chick flicks. I've sat through three movies of people \"just talking\" now, and that's the kind of thing that would bore fans of The Notebook to tears. Fuck 'em. If you want a beautiful, poetic, and funny love story for the modern era, this trilogy is where you should turn to. And this final chapter, which some could probably argue is the best of the three, is an utterly dazzling showcase of why both critics and audiences have come to like these movies so much. Hawke and Delpy need to take a bow, because they've just finished portraying two of the most achingly realistic and human characters ever put to film. \r\n\r\nBefore Midnight starts off kind of rough, I must admit. The film takes place in Greece, where Hawke and Delpy have been visiting a writer's house for the summer. They aren't married, but Hawke separated from his wife to be with her and they have two kids, twin girls. The structure of this film is slightly different from the others, in that it actually has scene cuts. Before Sunrise had only one serious time jump, and Before Sunset didn't have any, but I suppose that Linklater figured that, this being the grand finale, things should be shaken up a bit.\r\n\r\nThat works to a point. This film's story is far different from the other two, in that Hawke and Delpy are no longer lovers doomed to be apart but are instead together and growing more and more tired of each other by the minute. By reformatting the film's classic style, Linklater tells us from the get-go that we shouldn't expect the same thing over again. However, I have a few complaints, the first being the inclusion of the other writer characters. There is a scene at the beginning of this movie where Hawke and Delpy sit down to dinner with six other people (this comes as a shock to me solely because they barely interact with other characters throughout the other films), and talk about life and love. This scene was insufferably pretentious, and the dialogue felt forced and expository, but as soon as the two of them got away from the other characters, this movie got amazing... FAST.\r\n\r\nI would love to give exact quotes from the argument that Delpy and Hawke have in their tiny hotel room as evidence of how great the writing in this movie is, but I'm afraid that doing so would rob the movie of its humorous and emotional punch when it's actually viewed. All I can say is that these two had better be dating in real life, because nobody should be able to act this good. While watching them bicker, I stopped being aware of the fact that I was watching a movie. That's how immersive the dialogue in this film is. Linklater slightly compromises the film's edginess, however, by focusing more on Ethan Hawke's character than Delpy's. Perhaps it's just because I'm a dude, but I can't imagine anyone watching this argument and taking her side, mainly because she's out of her fucking gourd. This turned him into more of the main character than having the two of them share that role. Not really a complaint, just more of an observation.\r\n\r\nBut the place where this movie succeeds is the same place where the other films did-- in its portrayal of life as both funny and heartbreaking, often in equal measures. Even in life's most bitter moments, Hawke's character can find a silver lining. And that's another great thing about this film: It finally completes the character arcs begun in Before Sunrise. Remember way back in the day when I said Hawke was a romantic disguised as a cynic and Delpy was the exact reverse? Well, in their forties, they've stopped pretending. And as they try to adjust to that new reality, they piss each other off. The main message of these movies, I think, is that love is something worth working for (as weird as it sounds coming from the most cynical reviewer this side of the Mississippi). Things never work out like you want them to. So it's best to face that disappointment with someone else.\r\n\r\nFinal Score for Before Midnight: 8/10 stars. This movie is engaging, wonderfully filmed, impeccably acted, and remarkably written. Despite the fact that a lot of its opening scenes are somewhat less inspired than I had been led to expect from a Linklater film, but any faults are soon made up for by a series of scenes that will truly knock your socks off. Some have said that Linklater could possibly make a fourth installment, as he hasn't really said that he's calling it quits yet, but I personally hope he doesn't. He's left these characters off right where he should have. I hope it worked out well for them.",

No words can describe how much I loved this film. In fact this is probably my favourite out of the three. I loved the fact that they were together and had kids and I loved (this maybe weird) the fact that they were acting like a married couple now, they were arguing. They were experiencing problems that come with long term commitments. In the last two films it was very much just simple talking about life. This is more intimate and I love it because at times I feared for their relationship. This is a PERFECT way to end or start a new set of films and I just cannot wait to see these characters again.

Both are visiting beautiful Greece because Jesse is a writer and is an invited guest for another self acclaimed writer who happens to live around the area.  And if viewers are ever curious what it would be like if both of them stayed together, this movie is going to show it which is no different than any other relationship since most couples argue all the time. We don't get to see that until sometime near the end, and it's defined as putting two eons together since their personas are almost identical, but at the same time still have respect for one other.  The things they argue about is what other people argue about too, and without the occasional childish violent physical confrontations we are so accustomed into seeing often in films, it's always nice to see them act on a civilized level, leaving with a conclusion with an anticipation for a possible fourth.\r\n\r\n3 out of 4 stars",

Linklater's penchant for dividing people into two distinct groups, rebels and sell-outs, wanes when he focuses on Jesse and Celine, and the characters have more depth, more intellectual spark, more remarkable conflicts than any of Linklater's other characters.  Their conflicts are remarkably real, and the reflections on life and relationships more poignant than most of what we see in modern romances.  The plot - and there is a plot to these films - builds organically, borne out of reasonable assertions by both characters; no one is demonized in these films even if there is conflict.  The film's climax is touching, heartfelt, and moving.\nThe film's drawback is similar to its strengths.  After all, we're so used to quick cuts, shallow multiplots, and scenes that get in, get out, and leave nothing fully explored that it takes a long period of adjustment before we can fully appreciated what Linklater does with these characters.\nEthan Hawke and Julie Delpy have the type of chemistry that is rarely captured on film, but I suppose that acting these parts for almost twenty years has its advantages.\nOverall, Before Midnight might be the strongest film of the \"Before\" trilogy, but it's hard to make that determination as each is precious in itself.",

Jesse and Celine are now in their 40's, vacationing in Greece with their twin girls whilst Jesse's thoughts are mostly occupied on spending more time with his son and a custody battle with his ex-wife. \nLike the previous two films, the film is very conversation focused, with a number of one-set scenes lasting 10-20 minutes each, all peppered with realistic dialogue and characters, culminating in Jesse and Celine having a rare break from their girls for an evening of romance which is on the verge of ruin by the notion that their fairytale love story is in peril. \nBoth Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy are fantastic, just as they were in the previous two films and you can't help but feel for both characters standpoints on a crisis which has the potential to tear them apart.\nAll in all, this is a brilliant trilogy of a love affair which spans three decades.",

It still looks great with the Greek scenery being lovely. The first act and the ending are also quite sweet. However that entire middle section that was occupied by that horrendous, never-ending argument between the two was unbearably difficult to watch, and not in a good way. The way the film paints Celine as this horribly toxic woman, the capital C*NT to be honest, is frustrating as it's so unlike her, and thus it felt very unrealistic in the context of this character and this trilogy. The movie betrays its most important character and it also betrays its purpose. This trilogy was never about realism, but about once in a life time, cinematic romance, and we only see glimpses of that long-lost spark in this very hateful, problematically toxic film.",

I suppose that it was time for a dose of the real world for Jesse and Celine, but you never want to see such a perfect love story fall on hard times.  But that's why this film enhanced the series instead of being the forgettable final chapter that ruined the entire thing: the relationship continues to evolve.  Once again, Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy act with such effortless and natural delivery of the script that it feels candid and real.  Every relationship falls on hard times, even the ones that seem to be perfect.  While this story is incredibly depressing, it also carries a message of hope.  The screenplay has been nominated for an Oscar but aside from the fight scene, I don't think that it is nearly as good as \"Before Sunset.\"  Granted, this could be a result of my personal emotions as I don't enjoy hearing this relationship fall apart instead of the actual quality of the script.  But it's so great to have the Academy recognize these films once again.  The most amazing part of the series is that it is more than just a few chapters of a story.  We are watching two characters grow old together, from a couple of young twenty-somethings to middle-aged parents.  The question on everybody's mind is the same: \"Where will this couple find themselves nine years from now?\"  We can only pray that Hawke, Delpy, and director Richard Linklater will have the desire to further one of the most unique viewing experiences that you will ever see as it unfolds over DECADES in real time.",

Linklater, Delpy, and Hawke have both reinvinted the format of the \"Before\" series, while expanding the depth of the characters, and created a captivating third (and possibly final) installment in the franchise. This time we find Jesse and Celine have committed to each other, and their romantic passions might have dulled but there's a level of intimacy that permeates every scene in this film that is contagious.\n\nWhat makes Before Midnight so great is that we know these characters in and out by now, and watching whether or not this \"love at first sight\" could last is something fascinating. Delpy and Hawke are still magnificent performers, especially in these roles, and we love to watch them bicker and fight as much as we love to see them poke fun at each other. \n\nNow, Jesse and Celine aren't dealing with the ideals and fantasies of youth, but are actually in the thick of real adult life, dealing with tough and complicated issues like marriage and raising children in the midst of broken families. The conversations aren't easy, but they aren't shallow either. And Linklater and crew don't shy away from getting into the darkness of these characters.\n\nAll of that being said, the film isn't heavy all the time, there's a lot of fun here, especially if you love watching the chemistry between these characters. The best parts of the film belong to Jesse and Celine when they're alone. They are goofy in a way that seems realistic, even if it might be slightly annoying (aren't we all slightly annoying with our spouses?). Hawke and Delpy make us fall in love with these characters every time they embody them, and this film is no exception.\n\nA lot of the credit goes to Linklater, who is a master storyteller. He refuses to insert himself into the story by using long continuous takes that allow us to feel like we are peering into these conversations. He keeps all of the focus on Delpy and Hawke. Instead of setting the characters against spectacular landscapes, Delpy and Hawke spend a majority of the film in a hotel. This makes the film much less about the grandeur and magic of young love, and keeps everything much more intimate, even if less sparkling, like love feels as it develops.\n\nIt's a remarkable film, and a fitting conclusion for a great series.",

You know how reality shows are famous for orchestrating events to the point where there is very little resemblance to actual reality? That's because a lot of reality is extremely boring to watch! So a movie where, literally, nothing of consequence occurs is about as exciting as sitting at work filing papers, or bickering with my own wife. This film got an Oscar nomination for Writing, and I suppose that's because they had to write 2 hours worth of non-stop dialogue. The characters in this film just talk and don't do much of anything else other than take a drink, walk from one room to the next, or in the most extreme cases shut a door. Wow, I'm riveted! Sure the dialogue is occasionally more deep and brooding than you might hear around your house on the average day, but it's still mind-numbingly boring (and frankly the more intellectual moments of dialogue just felt forced and out of place.) Countless times while watching this film I found myself spacing out and thinking about other things. It gave me a great opportunity to finish up a few crossword puzzles, since I knew I wouldn't miss anything by looking away from the screen.\n\nI'm not even going to waste words writing about the cast. They are all playing characters so bland and uninteresting, that I can't see any acting skill behind it. I'm sure it takes a lot of special training to feign driving while talking about some scenic spot you're NOT going to visit. Yes, there was at least 5 minutes of dialogue about a place they don't go. The biggest crime of this film is that countless times the characters would talk about books they're planning on writing or books they've read, and every single one of them have plotlines that would be infinitely more dynamic on film...yet they created this. They didn't need to waste celluloid to capture this, they could have just made a podcast or an audio recording. Even then it would be sleep-inducing, but it might make a nice alternative to those thunderstorm recordings that are so popular. I distinctly remember hearing a director in the audio commentary of another film saying \"Don't waste time saying it, if you can show it.\" In other words talking about some interesting event in the past isn't nearly as effective as just showing it in flashback. This film seemed to take the exact opposite approach, \"Don't bother showing it, just say it.\" Most movie-makers dread working in the expository dialogue, but the makers of Before Midnight decided to make an entire film out of only expository dialogue. This is an utter disaster and fails to even fit my definition of a movie, but if the sominex isn't working, it might be just what you need.",

More a sort of smooth, horrifyingly realistic, never-ending conversation, this is a challenging delivery seems boring from the first sight, but later grows into a philosophic take on modern love and couple relationships.\n\nBefore Midnight is definitely not a movie for the broad audience. Extremely slow, it challenges with probably the longest car conversation, the longest lunch scene and the longest late afternoon-evening walk that you would ever watch. There is no particular direction of the story; it seems as if director Richard Lindklater has let his leading actors Julie Delpi and Ethan Hawke be themselves in their roles of a modern couple. It is true that in terms of pacing and a story build-up, Before Midnight is almost unbearable movie for those unfamiliar with Richard Lindklater's previous installments: Before Sunset and Before Sunrise. However, for the rest, this movie is a fascinating example how a movie could be made out of stunningly natural dialogues between two brilliant actors and a topic that is so close to many of us.\n\nThe way Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpi talk, the natural flow of conversation between them leads to an elegant and strikingly authentic e exchange of thoughts and believes about love in a long-term relationship, lifetime commitment, divorce, unfulfilled career ambitions, compromises and infidelity. All of this is not served in an easy to absorb way and in fact the longer time passes after the final credits, the more similarities one would find between this story and his/her life.\nIn conclusion, Before Midnight will not be enjoyed by regular movie-goers, but by those looking for a challenge. A challenge which despite all difficulties is completely rewarding.",

            "content": "Embarrassing, yes, but I am WAY behind in catching up to one of 2013's best films, BEFORE MIDNIGHT.  Released last May, I was lucky enough to see it last week with co-star/co-writer (and now Academy Award nominee) Julie Delpy in attendance.  For those unaware, BEFORE MIDNIGHT is the 3rd film in a series about a couple (played by Delpy and Ethan Hawke) which began with BEFORE SUNRISE (1995) and continued with BEFORE SUNSET (2004).  Celine and Jesse meet on a train in Austria and spend a glorious evening walking and talking around Vienna.  Pledging to meet up a year later but failing to do so, the 2nd film sees them reuniting under entirely different circumstances.  The latest film catches up with the pair, adding many layers to their story.  \n\nRichard Linklater, who co-wrote the films with his leads, has essentially given the world his version of the Michael Apted documentary classic series which started with 7 UP.  Reuniting with Celine and Jesse every 9 years feels like checking in on old friends, seeing if the blueprint of their relationship was mapped out on their very first day, or if they unexpectedly evolved.  BEFORE MIDNIGHT gives us both.  Believe me, these films are an acquired taste, but fans of intelligent dialogue, layered characters, and bold cinematic choices will find much to celebrate here.\n\nI won't spoil any plot points in this review, but as an ardent fan of this now-trilogy, I can say that the deeper this trio goes, the more fulfilling the results.  Deceptively simple and very talky, filled with beautiful vistas and people, it would be easy to dismiss BEFORE MIDNIGHT as a boring travelogue.  Set in Greece, Celine and Jesse find themselves at a crossroads leading to one epic argument.  After a beautiful prologue at an airport, in which we are shown an unexpected person who tugs at Jesse's heart, Linklater and co. give us a remarkable 14 minute single take scene of Celine and Jesse talking in a car.  The breadth of their conversation, the narrative arc within the scene, the highly engaging acting left me stunned.\n\nYes, we experience the beauty of Greece, much like we saw Vienna and Paris in the previous installments, and yes, things grow more and more contained as the story moves along, but despite these schematics, our three filmmakers have wisely chosen to peel back the onion to reveal real pain and hurt feelings.  Delpy and Hawke are so strong, I believed every moment.  Delpy manages the tricky task of bridging the gap between rage and deep affection, while Hawke's character must recognize that being the voice of reason doesn't always make him right.  Looking at Hawke, it's easy to dismiss him as an aging surfer dude, but I love how intelligent they've written his author character.  Delpy, for her part, eschews all vanity and really lets us see the literal and figurative naked self.  These are blazing, fully alive performances.  \n\nLike its predecessors, BEFORE MIDNIGHT ends on yet another sublime moment.  As the camera pulls back on a scene, I cried, knowing I may not see them again until 2021.  Celine and Jesse will be missed.\n\nTheir accomplishments have been grossly overlooked, but I'm thrilled they're finally being recognized as screenwriters. Their process surprised me.  I figured Delpy and Hawke would improvise in front of Linklater, who would take all the notes.  Instead, Delpy told us that all three wrote everything and not just their own parts.  The film, in fact, was not improvised at all, sticking to every word, \"down to every comma\", said Delpy. \n\nAt the screening, one audience member asked Delpy why her character had to be so angry and bitter when Hawke's character is the perfect guy.  Without missing a beat, Delpy responded, \"I think you've seen too many Jennifer Aniston movies.\"  She made me a fan for life.",

It is also important to review \"Midnight\" in context with the other two films (\"Before Sunset\" and \"Before Sunrise\"), because honestly, is there any other way?\n\nWhile the previous films is about finding love in the wilderness and knowing the one you're with, this film is about \"staying in love\" which one could argue is the more important part. This is a story about a couple who knows everything and anything about each other. Needless to say, love is palpable in the air but people changes and dynamic shifts. \"Midnight\", with all its charms and flaws, is an interesting dissertation of the evolution of love. It is also a friendly reminder that in the end, nothing hurts more than true love. warning: Depending you(r mood?) the movie can either be enlightening, or soulcrushing, or both in the same amount.\n\n\nP.S. (SPOILER alert): my personal fan theory is that Celine is actually pregnant, which explains how she acts in the end a bit.",

I know that this film, just like its predecessors and almost any film by Woody Allen, has been highly praised by film critics and cinephiles alike, but I cannot feel it at all, really can't - I want some silence, I want their eyes, and not their mouths, to talk, I want to see gentle gestures towards each others, not sinister and utterly abusive comments. Funny enough, the most impressive image of this film to me might be Julie Delpy's bare boobs - watching the scene I suddenly remembered that hers are the first ... \"cinema boobs\" I saw on my computer - from a poor quality VCD, VCD indeed!, of \"An American Werewolf in Paris\". At that time she was only 28, even younger than me-of-today, and although the boobs still somehow look the same, in a flash of thought I felt so old in this fast-forward stream of time. That's may be one of the feelings that the film-makers, and the actors, wanted to share with audience like me, but the lengthy and tiring talks really killed off any germ of such emotions, in my opinion.",

They are in their middle ages and now parents to twins. Hawke and Delpy play their characters well with the just right amount of chemistry.\n\nThe film is broken down into a handful of 15 - 20 minute conversational episodes. These conversation pieces take them through a wide range of subjects including their trials and tribulations, career choices, regrets, love, marriage and sacrifices, among others. Infused with the just the right amount of subtle humor, it presents both the gender sides of the argument while taking that very delicate step of staying in the middle and not taking sides as to who is right or wrong.\n\nThe writing credits are shared by Linklater, Hawke and Delpy and all three rightfully captures this particular stage in a couple's life. If there is one takeaway from the film, it would be that going through life with someone will always not be perfect. But honesty and openness is one way to get through those trying times.",

It didn't happen. I can't really remember what they talked about now, but 10 years later they met again in Before Sunset, with the film now co-written by Hawke and Delpy.  In line with other time-based serial films (typically documentaries, like 7-Up), we return to this pair in Before Midnight.  However, now they are married and in their early 40s with two kids and they fight all the time.  Indeed, their discourse is like an emotional rollercoaster, with some ideas poking through, but instead more of a clash of two strong personalities who need to compromise to make a relationship work.  For anyone who is married, much of this is likely to be familiar (perhaps reassuringly so) but not exactly fun to watch.  We'll see where they're at in another 9 or 10 years.",

Right quick, I like these films and all, but seriously, how did they end up making a trilogy out of this? It's not like the day-long misadventures that Hawke has been through in this series are as intensely eventful as the one day Hawke shared with Denzel Washington. It's amazing how it's been eighteen years, and someone is just now getting around to associating these films that star Ethan Hawke and span about a day, at the longest, to \"Training Day\", probably because all of the black people who play a big role in the cult following behind \"Training Day\" aren't seeing these films, and the white people who play... the only role in the cult following behind the \"Before\" trilogy forgot that Hawke was in \"Training Day\" when they gave Washington all of his praise for being black. You can call racism all you want, you brainwashed drones of liberal media (Hey, Washington is awesome in \"Training Day\", but Russell Crowe raised quite the standard in \"A Beautiful Mind\", the Oscar bait of 2001), but an independent drama about people just talking for a little over an hour-and-a-half sounds like it would be right up the alley of the super-white, super-liberal art snobs. I've been joking about how pretentious-sounding these films' titles have been since (Insert a broad-chested, nasally breathy dialect, with a hint of a guffaw, here) \"Before Sunrise\", and they're still about as entertaining as they can be with their natural shortcomings, as well as common consequential shortcomings that can even be found here.\r\n\r\nWell, \"Before Sunset\" only got uneven, and even then, it only hit inconsistencies when the film got so carried away with realistic dialogue that conversations swiftly shifted topics, whereas with this film, plot, while still thin, has several distinct segments that storytelling jars between, due to its sticking with each segment for way too long. This series has always been draggy, and it always should have been a little bit, as it has always just about walking and talking, yet every one of these installments, including this one, still gets a little too repetitious for its own good, even in the context of an intentionally limp plot. Richard Linklater's, Julie Delpy's and Ethan Hawke's script is as well-done as any of these films' screenplays, and such sharpness compensates for questionable structuring enough to bring this particular effort deepest into the brink of rewarding, yet whether it be because of the focal unevenness or simply because dragging is, in fact, worse than ever, this film feels like the most overdrawn \"Before\" installment yet, and that makes it even easier to detect natural shortcomings that, to be fair, were always going to be just about impossible to deny. There's a little bit more going on in this plot concept, and the additional meat, however limited, challenges the emphases on natural shortcomings enough for the final product to reach the border of rewarding that the predecessors couldn't quite see, but at the end of the day, this story concept is still generally not much more than people simply interacting, so if there is a narrative, then it's minimalist something fierce, with only so much dynamicity and conflict, no matter how much Linklater tries to throw a little meat onto this drama's bones. A hint of charming ambition has been prominent throughout every one of these installments, and with more ambition comes more inspiration to drive this effort a little bit further than either of its predecessors, but at the same time, the sheer sense of passion that Linklater pumps into most every scene in this film results in some particularly questionable ideas for unconventional storytelling that thin out a potentially particularly meaty story concept. If nothing else, Linklater's palpable heart makes it even easier to feel out the places in which this film does not meet Linklater's expectations, and while this film is a little bit better than I expected, given that its predecessors have been decent, but underwhelming, particularly uneven focus and pacing behind a still relatively thin story concept result in yet another relatively underwhelming drama. That being said, for every near-great shortcoming, there is a strength that, while maybe not great, endears considerably, at least aesthetically.\r\n\r\nGraham Reynolds' score is underused, just as the soundtracks of both predecessors have been underused, but musicality is utilized more than ever this time around, with a tastefully tender, modern classical heart that captures the tasteful tone of this film about as much as Christos Voudouris' cinematography, which is not as gorgeously emphatic on sparse lighting as Lee Daniel's cinematography was in \"Before Sunset\", but is still well-defined in its beautifully capturing scenery that is beautiful enough on its own. This particular European adventure with Jesse and C\u00e9line is as celebratory as ever of its environment, which is as beautiful as ever, with a vibrant Greek landscape that is richly diverse, but consistent in its gorgeousness. Stylistic tastefulness and immersive scenery played pretty big roles in making the predecessors so endearing, so it makes sense that this film is partly so much better than its predecessors because it is even more stylistically tasteful and even more immersive with its focus on a gorgeous setting, offering the aesthetic some worthy treats to help win you over, and not without the help of a solid cast. yet I was also impressed with how much more they play up the supporting cast, albeit for only a little while, but enough to expand on the onslaught of startlingly charming charisma and chemistry that Hawke and Delpy establish pretty firmly on their own, and even get a greater feel for the dynamic human depths of this dramatic saga. Whether it be the humblingly elder Xenia Kalogeropoulou and Walter Lassally, or the charmingly middle-aged Panos Koronis and the Athina Rachel Tsangari, or the beautiful and young Yiannis Papadopoulos and Ariane Labed (Hotter Marion Cotillard is all that needs to be said about Labed, who I am most certainly hoping to see more of), most everyone in the supporting cast, for the limited time they're present, mark reflections in the maturing process of a relationship and the changes in the interpretation of a relationship throughout the generations that have made up the primary thematic core of this entire saga, so the supporting cast adds a good deal to this drama's depth, on top of being thoroughly charismatic, with dynamite chemistry, and is therefore instrumental in making this film even more endearing than its predecessors. Written by Hawke and Delpy, as well as Richard Linklater, this film's script seems more draggy and is decidedly more uneven than the predecessors' scripts, with some forced exposition and even the occasional convention, but it's still one of the better scripts of 2013, and possibly the best script in the \"Before\" trilogy, offering intelligent subject matter and sharper humor within dialogue to sustain entertainment value through the dragging, sometimes broken by drops of compellingly genuine conflict that Linklater enriches with thoughtful directorial storytelling. Finding glimpses of the rewarding film that I've wanted out of this series since it began makes me really wish that this film could have been more consistent in its focus, pacing and overall impact, but those glimpses are still plentiful enough to bring the final product to the brink of rewarding, and while that's not close enough to make a strong drama, fine style, wit and charm, as well as some emotional bite, make the final product the relative best in the \"Before\" saga.\r\n\r\nOverall, inconsistencies in focus are greater than ever, and inconsistencies in pacing are as great as they've even been in this series, while natural shortcomings to a thin, talkative narrative concept, backed by a sense of overambition, secure the final product as underwhelming, but tasteful score work and cinematography, stunningly immersive settings, strong performances and chemistry, and a sharp, relatively well-layered script prove to be enough to make \"Before Midnight\" a worthy, borderline rewarding return to a classic modern love story, in spite of the limitations that have always been there.\r\n\r\n2.75/5 - Decent",

The young teenager often pops out from Jesse--perhaps as a reminder of what their love was. But, much similar to reality, things have to be grounded and Celine represents that aspect. They now endure the true conflicts of life; after all, they are finally together. The ending, unlike the other two, doesn't end on an optimistic note but leaves the characters on a pragmatic and difficult road--but most importantly the same road, together.",

They've decided to be together after their encounter in the Before Sunset and have kids.This time around, they're on the last few days of a family vacation with their kids in Greece. Jesse worries about his son's wellbeing from his previous failed marriage, which triggers a relationship assessment for the couple after all these years. Once again, the screenplay is written by both the actors themselves and it is astounding. Witty, intelligent, realistic, thought provoking and occasionally humourous, they talked about family issues, work, marriage, the obligations of parenthood, the complexity that lies in long-term commitments, insecurity, struggle of feminism. In the film, Celine's feminist ideas push her to behave in ways we've not seen her do before, many of the romanticism on her have faded away since the first film. Their lives have moved on since then, life is no longer hers alone and she has make some sacrifices for their relationship to work. Their heat argument near the end of the film reveals the hidden tensions in their relationship...the fears, resentments, insecurities, loneliness throughout the years and this reflects a lot of real-life married couple problems. A truly remarkable film that's fascinating to watch.  \n\nRating: 9/10\n\n\nBefore Sunset (2004)\n\nThe story of Jesse and Celine continues again after nine years (the film is also made nine years after the first one). They didn't managed to meet each other at the Vienna train station six months after the events of Before Sunrise. Jesse, couldn't forget their fateful encounter, decided to wrote a book about them. This allows Celine to find Jesse at a bookstore in France and their conversation continues again. The dialogue is superb, even more interesting and personal as his time around, they talked about their troubled love life, politics, environmental issues...Throughout the film, they started to show their imperfections, burdened by numerous responsibilities as they talk about the mistakes they made in life and the disappointments that comes with it. The effects of aging are noticeable from their faces. This film is definitely better than the first, because it provides a more unique, personal perspective. The characters have grown and matured throughout the years. From here, it's becoming apparent that these two characters are soul mates and they were meant for each other. Interestingly, the film's dialogue are both written by the actor and actress themselves. One can't help but to assume that the two leads may have actually shared some personal conversations during the making of the film.\n\nRating: 8.5/10\n\n\nBefore Sunrise (1995)\n\nThe story is about a young guy, Jesse and a young girl, Celine randomly meet on a train in Europe and they're both decided to spend the whole night together, talking about life and love in Vienna. As they walk around Vienna the whole night and communicating with each other, sharing their personal life experiences, you can see a deep connection slowly formed between them. The two lead actors, Ethan and Julie, shared a perfect chemistry together on screen.The script for the film is magnificient as the dialogues managed to keep the audience engaged throughout the film.Their conversations about love provides a lot of insights about relationships.They share their views, thoughts, perspectives of anything...and as they speak, you feel that you started to know these characters as well. The film successfully captures the beauty of youthful love, two beautiful people meet in a romantic setting and attracted to each other.\n\nRating: 8/10\n\n\nOverall: Linklater, together with Ethan and Julie, had crafted the one of the best romantic drama trilogy of all time.The films features an in-depth look into the characters, their life experiences and how it affects their love life...of being together.The films allow us to see one woman and one man changes over the course of time. \n\nNote: Keep in mind though, the films are dialogue driven and spend most of the time on the conversations between the leads, how they managed to find a connection between them, share their thoughts, views, perspectives, principles in life...If you find that two people communicating is not enjoyable, then it's not recommended to watch the trilogy.But it'll be incredibly rewarding if you do.",

Consider the long car ride Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and Celine (Julie Delpy) share towards the beginning of the film: It's a (nearly) thirteen minute scene without any cuts. This allows for their conversation to develop naturally, and it also gives us a chance to absorb Jesse and Celine - to catch up with them. It's been 9 years since we last saw Jesse and Celine and they are now married with twin daughters. What was once a series of playful discussions of a limitless future has become realities of the present. There are still many discussions of the future, but the \"limitless\" future is coming to an end; the new discussions of the future are about real problems - problems that could cause any relationship to shatter. But this is Jesse and Celine. They know each other better than they know themselves. Right? \n\"Before Midnight\" takes place at the end of a wonderful summer (Jesse's son called it the \"best summer\" of his life before Jesse sent him back to the United States to live with his mother). Jesse and Celine (and their two daughters and Jesse's son) spent the summer in Greece with friends. We can assume they've spent the entire summer embracing each other in the warmth of their love and the Greece sun. But with summer coming to an end, Jesse and Celine (and their married friends) question what makes love work (and what makes love real). In this scene we see characters who could have been plucked from a Woody Allen script. There are many insights shared about love and existentialisms that could make you question whether or not you believe in true love. The rest of the movie will test Jesse and Celine to see if they, in fact, have true love.\nTheir love is put to the test with intense conversations. It's almost as if they're letting go of any bottled-up resentment in one night. They find themselves in a hotel room (thanks to a gift from their friends) with the hopes of spending an intimate night together (followed by a couples massage). As they are getting ready to make love, they begin to talk. At first, Jesse and Celine are shot in close-ups, and we feel more intimate with them, too. Gradually, however, Jesse and Celine are shot further and further away from each other - until they are in separate rooms. In fact, the doorway which physically separates them is seen in the foreground of each shot of Jesse and Celine (which makes them feel even further away). That doorway serves as a net in a tennis match, and we watch as Jesse and Celine takes shots back and forth. \nThey say that communication is key to the success of any relationship. \"Before Midnight\" shows how communication can be both a strong and detrimental component to any relationship. In an age of explosions, superhero movies, and gross-out movies, it's a nice welcome to study people in real situations who use their words to solve their problems.",

They delve into the same issues that they've confronted throughout the three films as well as dealing with getting older and the complexities of their lives now.

            "content": "This film, the third entry of the perhaps unlikely trilogy that started with Before Sunrise and Before Sunset, is every bit as excellent as its two predecessors. It's kind of amazing that three movies with this simple a concept have managed to be as unique and compelling as they are, but somehow Richard Linklater, Ethan Hawke, and Julie Delpy just keep pulling it off. This movie does seem like a natural end-point for the series, but I would be interested if they somehow released a fourth film nine years from now. (I wonder what they would call it - Before 4 A.M.?)\n\nThe premise is simple and elegant: each movie shows us a single day in the lives of Jesse (Hawke) and Celine (Delpy). In the first movie, they were strangers who met on a train and started to fall in love, but parted ways with a promise to meet again in one year; in the second, they ran into each other again after Jesse had written a book about their one-day acquaintance. Now, eighteen years after they first met, Jesse and Celine are married with children. The movie follows the last day of their vacation to Greece, and shows how the years and work of marriage have worn on them.\n\nHawke and Delpy seem to know these characters extraordinarily well, and to have thought out all the little details of their lives. It probably helps that the two of them actually helped write this film and the previous one, along with Linklater. Linklater directs this movie with quite a number of very long takes centering on conversations between the couple; one shot in particular in which the characters talk while driving must last at least ten minutes. The combined effect of the long takes and Hawke and Delpy's performances is to make the movie totally immersive - you forget about the usual artifice of movies and feel like you're just watching these two live their lives. It all works at least as well here as it did before. The movie has occasional moments of humor, but they're never forced - the humor always arises quite naturally from the characters. \n\nIf you liked the first two films, this one does not disappoint. If you haven't seen them, now would be a good time to start.",

It's been nearly 20 years since the first movie debuted at the Sundance Film Festival (where all have premiered).  With three films spread out, the characters feel like old friends who we catch up with every so often.\r\n\r\nIt's been several years since we've met up with Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and Celine (Julia Delpy).  After their meetings in the past, they are now together as a couple, yet their lives have not become less complicated.  They results of the decisions and sacrifices they have made come back to catch up with them as they vacation in southern Greece.\r\n\r\nThe dialogue is smart and sharp and feels almost like we are listening to a real life couple as they talk about mundane things and argue about the future.  It's very keen and I think the best in the series.  Maybe we will see them again in ten years or so.\r\n\r\nOne of 2013's best films.\r\n\r\n[img]http://content8.flixster.com/rtmovie/99/49/99490_gal.jpg[/img]",

Every time I do something, I think of what he would say: \"Well its cold today, wear a scarf.\" But lately I've been forgetting little things. He's sort of fading and I'm starting to forget him and it's like losing him again. Sometimes, I make myself remember every detail of his face - the exact color of his eyes, his lips, his teeth, the texture of his skin, his hair - that was all gone by the time he went. And sometimes, not always, but sometimes I can actually see him. It is as if a cloud moves away and there he is. I could almost touch him, but then the real world rushes in, and he vanishes again. For a while, I did this every morning, when the sun was not too bright outside because the sun somehow makes him vanish. He appears and he disappears like a sunrise or sunset, anything so ephemeral. Just like our life - we appear and we disappear and we are so important to some, but, we are just passing through.\"",

Having not seen the previous two installments in this trilogy, I won't, of course, be able to compare this one to those ones. But I can say, having seen this one, I am very interested in checking out those two. This a raw, real, superbly acted, emotional powerhouse of a film. And being a 110% straight man, I can say that this is probably one of the best and most important movies about love, marriage, commitment, and real relationships to ever come out. It's just so real. The acting by Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke is some of the best of the year and some of the best of each of their careers. Their chemistry together is amazing. They actually seem like they would be husband and wife in real life. They are so real and believable together, it's crazy. When the two of them get into the big argument near the end, you can't help but not feel for their characters. It's one of the strongest scenes in a romance movie ever portrayed on screen and the argument seems weirdly real. It's like the two forgot they were on camera, and we're having a real fight. The directing by Richard Linklater is also amazing. Each conversation, argument, small talk these characters have or between other characters is captured perfectly. It's feels almost like \"sensitive\" however you want to call it. You can clearly tell it was made with patience and depth, and wasn't rushed. The director took his time with making the movie and it pays off. Also, the screenplay, I believe is truly Oscar-Worthy. Now, this is a dialogue driven film, and about every scene in the movie is talking between two characters or a whole table of them. And, not that that's a bad thing, because it isn't. Having the script be very well written doesn't make the dialogue seem like an over used element or feel corny because it worked well with the movie. It's original, emotional, raw and real, and just amazing. It should most definitely be nominated for the Oscar, if not win it. Before Midnight is an amazing, important, very emotional, raw, real, sweet film with career best performances from Delpy and Hawke, outstanding direction, and an oscar winning screenplay, that will soon become a classic in the romance genre and should be essential to see for everybody involved in a relationship. Before Midnight is one of the absolute best films of the year and is very recommended.",

Essentially a common law couple with competing and conflicting interests and demands, Celine and Jesse try to renew their love with the children while on holiday in Greece.   \n\nThe environment, as in the two previous films, serves as an important contrast and highlighter of their relationship.  Whereas the romance of old world Vienna drew them together and ignited sparks, the modern Paris bore witness to the complications of adulthood and their divergent life paths, and Greece with its old world charm serves as an antagonist and a spur to the renewal of their love and commitment to each other.\n\nEach of the three films have adult issues and subjects but Before Midnight is the more notable for its visible depiction of their romantic relationship, nudity is involved and mostly on the part of Delpy, and so the film series is a most adult look at different times in a relationship.  10/10\n\nIf you were unable to see this in cinema then I recommend searching online for a copy of the dvd or blue-ray, going to an actual store such as Walmart or, if possible, renting it from a video store or from Red Box machines which may be located at your local Walmart.",

The film's dialogue was fast-paced and clever, full of golden quips, charming anecdotes and enlightening ideas, it was like watching an old Tracy-Hepburn film, Delpy and Hawke had an undeniable and unique chemistry. It was just electric! Then the second film, \"Before Sunset\" was just as charming and as exhilarating. It had all the same familiar feelings from the first film that you fell in-love with and I didn't even minded that the two characters were essentially having an affair. I wanted so much to fall in-love with this film too, all over again, but it just didn't have the same magic the first two films had. Granted, this was still a really good film, Delpy and Hawke still make a very dynamic duo, their chemistry is still as explosive as in the first two films but this movie just didn't have the same manic and languid vibe the first two did. I guess every child loves hearing how their parents fell-in love but like all kids they hate seeing their parents fight and there was just too much negative energy in this movie, it was really upsetting, but understandably the natural stage of Jesse's and Celine's relationship and in the end...well, let's say the ending was satisfying.

The triad of Linklater, Delpy and Hawke will present us a most satisfactory delight delving into these two soul mates' current states of mind.\n\nAgain tracing a one-day journey of the couple in their last day of their summer getaway in Southern Greece, in the morning, they see off Jesse's son Hank in the airport, who has to return to his mother, Jesse's ex-wife, which aggravates Jesse's paternity guilt for being absent in most of Hank's life, elicits an idea to move back to USA with the entire family, while they're driving back from the airport, the discord occurs when C\u00e9line rebuffs the connotation of the unscheduled idea, and a time-bomb is ticking, the first long take in the car signals as a gambit to re-ignite the audience members' coveted interest in their love story. \n\nUnder the magnificent scenery of this ancient land, their farewell lunch with friends carries a casual spirit but the small talk is overflowing with engaging and emotively touching insights about love from different ages and experiences, Jesse and C\u00e9line are mainly listeners, but Delpy manage to pull off a splendid ad lib mimics a brainless bimbo flirting with Jesse the writer and talking about Romeo and Juliet, so hilarious and this is a patina when they are surrounded with other people. \n\nLater, they leave their daughters to friends and head to a hotel since they are treated to have a private evening in a hotel to culminate their last night there (with a couple massage coupon), clearly it is a god-given opportunity for them to express real thoughts without the interference of their children. Meandering in the town, everything is like deja vu, they are like two people deeply in love with each other and the sexual attraction is simmering when they reach the room, but their carnal engagement is interrupted by a pivotal call from Hank, their following t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate turns sours when C\u00e9line bickers about her sacrifice in the relationship and the frustration of parenting, utters discontent and spurns the prospect of moving to USA, meanwhile Jesse appears to be the calm one, but his passive-aggressive strategy fails to appease her and they begin to blame faults to each other, until C\u00e9line storms out and leaves the deal-breaker \" I don't love you anymore\". From convivial to acrid, it is so spot-on in everyman's world, then the ending plays a nice trick on the ambivalent possibilities of their future, fingers-crossed a fourth one will come another 9 years later and it will be worth the wait. \n\nThumbs up to both Hawke and Delpy's scintillating acting, their resounding rapport and flawless two-hander should have earned some serious awards recognition apart from their effervescent script, good luck for a third time, Delpy could be a dark horse to bag a BEST LEADING ACTRESS nomination, and she is also French, Oscar voters, remember?",

The acting is unsurprisingly outstanding, with Hawke and Delpy matching each other yard for yard and effortlessly switching between subjects concerning philosophy, their family, and their lives going forward. The last 1/3 of the movie is very unlike what has happened in the series, and as a result it feels like a breath of fresh air.

The third in the \"Before\" trilogy, this is a re-visitation of the same couple (Ethan Hawke, Julie Delpy), further down the line in their relationship, with a very different vibe, as it is has been almost two decades since their first tryst.  Now I have never seen the original Before Sunrise, although I've heard nothing but good things, and I do like Before Sunset, although it has been years since I saw it last.  From what I remember, this is an entirely different maturity level, as these feel like real problems you would face in a long running relationship; you fall in love, have kids... now what?  The chemistry featured here truly gives you the feeling that these two characters have spent the last twenty years together, and you can tell exactly what is brewing just beneath the surface.  This movie is almost entirely conversation driven, and you really get wrapped in to these two fascinating differing points of view.  The dialogue is hyper-realistic, and these feel like very real people, as they are two, well rounded characters that are easy to relate to.  Before Midnight reminds me of another movie that came out this year, Blue Jasmine: while it is undeniably quality, it reaches a point where it just gets straight up unpleasant to sit through.  This isn't for everybody, but it is insightful to long term relationships, and for that, it is worth checking out.",

All three movies follow the same two characters (Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy) at three points in their lives, and in 9 year intervals: the first when they meet, the second when they are reunited, and the last when their relationship may (or may not?) be falling apart.  This is the last and is definitely the most realistic and poignant of the three.  This film stutters at the beginning, unlike the first two, which plunge right in.  It's a full 45 minutes before the crux of the movie even starts.  It's wasted time and I would have rated the film much more highly if that first part had been trimmed.  But once it gets going, it gets real, and real fast.  The brilliance of these movies, specifically this one, is how the viewer can so easily identify with both of them - we have all been each of them at different points in our lives.  Hawke and Delpy are entirely natural together, you'd swear they were really a couple.  Even though the exchanges between the two get pretty bleak, the film doesn't lose its sense of hope for the future, which is what has defined all three movies.  And the scenery is gorgeous!!!  Note to the viewer:  these movies are entirely focused on conversations between the two main characters, so if you're not into that kind of movie, you may not enjoy it.  But if you are interested in character pieces that delve into the ins and outs of real relationships, all three of these movies deserve a watch.  (For reference, I gave Before Sunrise 90% and Before Sunset 70%).",

Hawke and Delpy simply \"wear\" their roles in such natural way, that it's almost impossible to feel that this is just a performance. \r\nThe setting of a picturesque area in South Greece, develops further the romanticism of the story told. \r\nIt's exciting to realize how these characters grew and developed their relationship especially when they had to go through such difficult phases. \r\nSo yes, that's a formula of a film invented back in 1994 with extensive dialogues set in beautiful romantic scenery but it all works since each film's theme covers a different phase of the couple's relationship. That's actually what makes this whole trilogy all so \"functional\", believable and interesting altogether.\r\nI understand that this film might be the last of its line but I wouldn't mind at all if I hear that the same crew started working for yet another instalment in 10 years time from now. \r\nAnd from what they've managed so far, I feel confident that they could guarantee the same quality and satisfaction in a future collaboration. So why not then?",

            "content": "Richard Linklater has created a series--the now \"Before\" trilogy--that seems almost incomprehensible. How someone can take two people having nothing but philosophical ruminations about life and turn that into a critically successful film series, is simply amazing. Surely those characters must prove to be interesting and fleshed-out, with substantial things to say about whatever they have to talk about. And Celine and Jesse are as interesting as ever.\n\nNow, in their forties and far from being carefree, Celine and Jesse's conversations have changed from romantic ideologies of love and relationships (from the first film) to the pitfalls and trappings of commitment--cautions that were explored in Sunset more so than Sunrise, but are fully engaged here in Midnight.\n\nAnd what conversations are raised! As with the previous instalments, Midnight is a series of vignettes in a day of the life of Celine and Jesse. Within these vignettes we get a sense of the their life, their mentality, ambitions, desires, and needs, but we also see the cynical, the pessimistic side of them as well. It is with the latter that surfaces much more within this third instalment. Without giving too much away (though, I very well may have done just that) this is where the main conflict arises. And what follows is a humourous, yet achingly painful couple hours with Celine and Jesse.\n\nAs usual, we get a masterful display of dialogue and the chemistry between the leads has not cooled. And the film's explorations take us into a more sombre direction. So melancholic becomes Before Midnight, that sometimes it turns into an achingly beautiful experience that forces us to accept all facets of life, and of the people whom we love dearly. Whether those facets are things we enjoy and want, or the opposite, Before Midnight tackles both in a natural and honest fashion. \n\nIf there is one thing that anyone takes away from Midnight, is that it isn't filled with pretension. Not at all. This is a film that seems more like glimpse into Celine and Jesse's life (as with the previous films). Everything comes off as genuine and relevant, that it would be challenging to find anyone not being able to relate to the ideas and musings the characters have on-screen. Their dialogues often mirror that of our own feelings. It is this connection between the two characters that we have with ourselves. We watch these people who are so in tune with themselves and it leads us to examine our own actions, beliefs and  Self. We come to unravel the mystery that is our own consciousness much like Jesse, Celine, and their peers do while we watch them. We are have our own \"Before\" experiences, they are simply internal dialogues.\n\nThat is what I find so beautiful about this film and this series. \n\n10/10",

Nine years later, they have another reason to talk: the past nine years. I still respect that the films are nine years apart, and that they are basically watchable with just dialogue, but the writing clearly shows through in this one because the conversation does not seem natural.\n\nThe movie is supposed to show the natural progress of a couple over time. Smitten with each other in the first movie, glad to see each other in the second movie, and finally a couple that has been together and is experiencing the ups and downs of a relationship. That would be great if it were not all so contrived. The dialogue seemed scripted, and the setting was something few couples will ever experience. Six weeks in Greece so he can work on his novel? Unlikely story but leave a message and I'll call you back.\n\nStill, not a terrible movie. They say some interesting things.

At some points I was convinced that there wasn't even a script and actors Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy were just talking naturally with each other. It's that good. Midnight is the third part in Richard Linklater's \"Before\" trilogy and sees author Jessie going on a Greek vacation with Celine and their twin daughters. The scenes and the takes are very long, and conversations about relationships,love, life, sex and family are constantly being debated and analyzed. It's never pretentious and we come to understand the various point of views that the characters are presenting to us. My only complaint is that it could have used with a bit more humor to help distract from the super long shots, but that aside it's a very real look at relationships and other films in the romance genre should take note at the real humanity that's on display here.",

Whereas the first two explored themes of love, life, philosophy, free will, and direction, Before Midnight takes a more serious, almost darker tone, devoid of much of the charm that made the first two so enjoyable. The result is almost a two hour argument, with characters that have undeniably changed, with no sense of enchantment. It's not a bad film in the least, yet not necessarily always enjoyable.\n\n\nMy reservations with Before Midnight in large part stem from its dialogue. As is the case with all three films, the scenes in Before Midnight are very long and feature long dialogue exchanges. In this film, the conversations, like the people, seemed overly negative, over-sexualized, and almost whiney. One can rightly say that such is the change in characters, yet the exchanges never seemed to evolve. The film felt like one big drawn out argument, albeit a well written and well acted one. \n\n\nThe actors are all great, with the chemistry between Hawke and Delpy being just as tremendous as it was previously. The difference is that neither character is especially as likeable, especially true of Delpy, who's almost grating in her incessant self-righteous whining. The direction, however, does take a step back. The first two films incorporated the scenery so nicely and kinetically so as to make the film flow seamlessly, with Before Midnight, however, it feels much more stagnate and confined, despite their being plenty of opportunities for amazing cinematography.\n\n\nAn interesting piece, but devoid of the magic of its predecessors. \n\n\n3/5 Stars",

The concept alone is genius and the commitment of all the parties involved is remarkable. Imagine, the third part was made 18 years after the first movie. The first two movies are among the best romantic films ever produced in my book, but the third installment is apparently where things start to go wrong, and it is excruciating to watch. This is an uncompromisingly raw look at life and relationships and, in my experience, a pretty fucking accurate one.\n\nThe authentic performances are the selling point as always. Delpy and Hawke have unquestionable chemistry and the characters feel extremely real. There are some amazingly long, uncut scenes that are just a marvel to watch, as the actors are so comfortable in their roles by now that you never think you are watching a movie.\n\nThat is also what makes it hurt so much to watch. If you have been on this amazing journey with these imaginary people as I have, you can't help but feel their pain when you see where they have ended up. It also makes you think about your own stupid shit if you are at all a thoughtful person and have ever toyed with the idea of trying to be a better person. For these reasons, this is my least favorite of the three, because it has none of the hope and promise of the first two. This one is simply quite a downer.\n\nI can't think that there will ever be a third movie in the series, but I certainly hope there will. I would eagerly watch a film about these characters every ten years. If Linklater would somehow manage to make movies until the characters are in their seventies, it would be the greatest cinematic accomplishment of maybe ever, simply because of the actual real-life time it would take and the scope of life it would portray. Even now, at three films, I would claim this series as one of the defining motion picture experiences of modern era.\n\nIf you have never seen any of these movies, do yourself a gigantic favor and watch them all in a row. I wish I could have that experience, but I had to wait ten years for every sequel. And they are still amazing.",

And although love for a time is a tale that is full of excitment and amazing experiences, its also about conflict and resolution, irrational emotions and swaying perspectives, but in the end love is a choice, it is a choice to love someone by choice and effort rather then what they can do for you, its a outward action of effection and patiance, where the goal is to give not to recieve...

Linklater is a filmmaker of many prodigious gifts, but perhaps his best ability might be the finely-tuned awareness of when to let go and get out of the way.  Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke give absolutely astounding performances.  It's one of those rare, miraculous moments in cinema that you completely forget these charming, flawed, and deeply intriguing people are actually actors in costumes.

I get so caught up in the hulabaloo of film making that it doesn't become apparent to me until I see a Gondry, a Tarantino or in this case a Linklater. \nI love Linklater films, but what I love about Richard Linklater films is also what I hate about them as contradicting as that sounds. His style really shines when he has the right formula, which to me, consists of taking his signature debating/real life/conversational style and adding the fluff of film making to it. For example, I hate Slacker, I seriously cannot express how much I loathe that movie, his signature mark is there, yet the formula is completely wrong. All these stories intersecting with no meaning, no purpose, leading us utterly nowhere, it's an entire waste of time. Yet a film like Suburbia, which has the same general disposition as Slacker; works. It consists of interesting characters that debate their existence whilst intertwining with each other and ultimately taking us on a journey as every film is supposed to do. \nWhich is why Before Midnight works so well, the formula has no flaws whatsoever, it's quite possibly the best Linklater thus far (and this is coming from someone who created a drinking game to the movie Dazed and Confused). As a fan of the first two films, I was very skeptical that Midnight would not be as good as the first two, however Celine and Jesse are just as endearing as before except they are more rough around the edges, their passion and spark is not shining as bright as it once was. \nIn true Linklater fashion it's an entirely talking piece with elongated shots and mild editing. The fight in the hotel room is what I considered the climax and it's the most comedic part of the film, intentionally and unintentionally. This isn't a movie about star crossed lovers, it's a film about two people who have been together for too long and are at their breaking point. He's testing Jesse and Celine's relationship and as sad as that sounds, it really works. \nBeing as I saw this movie awhile ago and I've had this draft sitting here forever: I can't elaborate on all the little quips that I was initially going to. I highly recommend this movie (especially if you've seen the first two films).",

Afterwards, we get a glimpse of their idyllic holidays with Jesse's friends in South Peloponnese. Although the scene during lunch with their friends is good, I wish there were more scenes with Jesse and C\u00e9line on their own such as the parts when they come back from the airport or the ending in the hotel room. In my opinion, it is during these scenes that the relationship between the characters and the actors is the best. I felt the scene when Jesse speaks about his next book with his friends was unnecessary. On the contrary, the ending is too short : after their clash in the hotel room, I felt Jesse wins back C\u00e9line's heart too easily/quickly. I would have prefered a longer ending or having to wait a few years until the next movie to know whether Jesse got C\u00e9line back (and gave her one of these nights she still remembers at 82).",

It is unheard of in today's money-hungry industry that films with such meager financial return(s) would be given the honor and respect once-given to films worthy of yesteryear's \"trilogy tribute\" as nearly anything (today) can become a film trilogy IF it makes some money and can sell Happy Meals. That this trilogy was made as it has done neither is a testament to the quality of the films, the filmmaker (Richard Linklater - Dazed and Confused, A Scanner Darkly) and his talented cast and collaborators (who helped co-write both sequels) as well as the incredibly loyal fan base of the \"Before\" films.  The films as a whole are somewhat special and comparing them to other rom-coms and relationship dramedies would be like comparing apples to oranges as these Before films focus almost solely upon two realistic characters and their relationship with ONE another with very few outside distractions, distortions or cinematically manufactured dysfunctions.  The simple story began in 1995 when Jesse (Ethan Hawke - Training Day, Gattaca) -- a young American travelling through the heart of Europe -- met Celine (Julie Delpy - The Hoax, Broken Flowers) an intellectual Parisian beauty who captivated Jesse's mind as the pair spent a perfect evening together knowing they'd most likely never meet again as their paths in life had already been set and this \"one night stand\" of stimulating conversation was their reprieve of what came next in each of their respective lives.  The story continued in Paris nine years later when they encountered one another on the European leg of his book tour and it concludes nearly 20 years after it all began on a beautiful Greek isle as the pair -- again talk and talk and talk -- of their life together and what it has meant to each of their individual lives.  There is heart and humor and fear and frustration as well as some anger and misunderstanding on top of both respect and resentment in their story ... and it is these layers that make Jesse and Celine's story so authentic, engrossing and moving.  The three films are VERY talk-centric and those who would rather watch film as opposed to listening or hearing it most likely will not care for these.  This film will also mean (very) little to anybody who has not seen the previous two; but the back story is not needed for one see an unbelievable chemistry between two stars who have believably matured before our very eyes.  Delpy and Hawke KNOW their characters and it shows.  They and Linklater KNOW what their audience wants ... and they've given it to us.  Piece by piece the films are each good; but all together they are great.",

Shot more beautifully than the first two films, the final instalment in this trilogy is a work of picture perfect art that is not just one of the best films of 2013, but one of the best romance films I have ever seen, along with the first. \"Before Sunset\" kind of takes you in a direction and leaves you with a bunch of questions, which is why it is my least favourite, but as a continuous story, this is a PERFECT trilogy of films.

More a sort of smooth, horrifyingly realistic, never-ending conversation, this is a challenging delivery seems boring from the first sight, but later grows into a philosophic take on modern love and couple relationships.\nBefore Midnight is definitely not a movie for the broad audience. Extremely slow, it challenges with probably the longest car conversation, the longest lunch scene and the longest late afternoon-evening walk that you would ever watch. There is no particular direction of the story; it seems as if director Richard Lindklater has let his leading actors Julie Delpi and Ethan Hawke be themselves in their roles of a modern couple. It is true that in terms of pacing and a story build-up, Before Midnight is almost unbearable movie for those unfamiliar with Richard Lindklater's previous installments: Before Sunset and Before Sunrise. However, for the rest, this movie is a fascinating example how a movie could be made out of stunningly natural dialogues between two brilliant actors and a topic that is so close to many of us.\nThe way Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpi talk, the natural flow of conversation between them leads to an elegant and strikingly authentic e exchange of thoughts and believes about love in a long-term relationship, lifetime commitment, divorce, unfulfilled career ambitions, compromises and infidelity. All of this is not served in an easy to absorb way and in fact the longer time passes after the final credits, the more similarities one would find between this story and his/her life. \nIn conclusion, Before Midnight will not be enjoyed by regular movie-goers, but by those looking for a challenge. A challenge which despite all difficulties is completely rewarding.",

            "content": "Recently I watched the movie Before Midnight, a 2013 romantic drama film that acts as the third film in a series that includes Before Sunrise and Before Sunset. I haven't actually seen the predecessors to this movie and to be honest, I didn't know about them until Before Midnight came out. Usually, I'm not much of a fan of the romantic genre but I was tempted to check out this film because of the exceptionally high ratings it received on Rotten Tomatoes and Metacritic.\n\nIt isn't necessary to have seen the first two movies to understand the plot of the movie. That isn't to say that it is unattached from its predecessors, but the movie does a good job at bringing you up to speed with the events that happened in the first movies and the resulting issues that are being faced. Without giving away too much detail, the film is essentially a dialogue between the two main characters, Celine and Jesse, about various perspectives on love and life. There are occasional scenes of other characters bringing their unique viewpoints in a continuous stream of conversations. They reminisce about the events of their life (paying regard to the previous movies) and contemplate their future together.\n\nHow interesting can it be to listen to two people talking throughout a 109 minute film? The answer: very, surprisingly. The conversations shared were deeply engaging, and Julie Delpy (Celine) and Ethan Hawke (Jesse) were mesmerising to watch on screen. This movie felt more honest, and so distinct from any other \"romantic\" film I've seen. This seems to be an insight into the aftermath of a happy ending. The couple fall in love, have children, and well, what happens next? They explore the nature of long-term relationships and their expectations and fears for what lies ahead. I can certainly see this movie attracting an older audience because of the disconnection that could be felt with issues that younger people haven't experienced. However, I enjoyed the insight I received into mature issues and perspectives that I never considered before.\n\nOn top of that, the setting pays a nice compliment to the conversations that are held throughout the movie. The protagonists spend the majority of the time walking and pass by beautiful landscapes of Greece, making the movie a joy to watch. This film is minimalistic, which proved to be very effective. Despite some of the heavier topics brought up in the movie, there was a surprising amount of humour which provided a perfect balance. While this film may be more suitable for older audiences, I believe the movie is very well done and a unique take on the idea of \"romance\".\n\nhttp://thevaultpublication.com/2014/01/03/before-midnight/",

Once again Linklater uses long, continuous takes of conversation between Jesse and Celine that feel improvised and original, showing us that love can and does exist, but relationships are not always perfect. 'Before Midnight', as well as its two predecessors 'Before Sunrise' and 'Before Sunset', should definitely not be missed. This is the best film of the summer.",

            "content": "The third and long-awaited installment of the Before sunrise-before sunset has graced our screens, some 17 years after Jesse and C\u00e9line fortuitously meet in a Paris-bound train and embark on what is one of the most compelling romantic adventures of modern cinema. \n\nIronically similar to the characters n the upcoming book Jesse is toying with in his mind who go through life experiencing a constant sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, the audience could be forgiven for having the same feeling. 'On ne change pas use equipe qui gagne' C\u00e9line quipped, and 'Before Midnight' certainly does not. \nWith the exception of a smattering of couples obviously intended to symbolize the main couple's past and future stages of life together, the film essentially focuses on Jesse and C\u00e9line talking at and to each other, exploring their relationship for better or - as it seems - for worse. \n\nOn the up side - the chemistry between the two main characters is (still) undeniable. It constitutes the soul of the film, and helps to get the audience through some of the self-indulgently long one-take conversations the two labour through (count the 14 minutes during the continuous take in the front seat of a car). At times this viewer was left wishing the director had chosen to placate/indulge/divert the audience away from the monotony of the conversation through some aesthetic bribery, alas very little of the splendor of the Greek island they are staying on is shown. \n\nThe actors play their respective roles to perfection. Hawke is spot on as the supposedly messy and sexually monotonous husband, still unbelievably in love but struggling with the upheaval of his life in Paris and the growing emotional distance from his rapidly maturing son; Delphy's role is true to character, and after so many of her emotional and shill outbursts you could be forgiven for wondering how Jesse keeps the strength to stay in the same room as her. His description of her as the mayor of crazy town is no exaggeration, and is just one of the superlative comments needed to carry the more than slightly affected conversation along. \n\nBefore Midnight tells exactly the story it should of a couple facing the reality of monogamous life as parents in their forties. Like Jesse and C\u00e9line themselves, it is not as subtly passionate as Before Sunrise, nor as achingly promising as Before Sunset. They, like the sun, have perhaps seen their brightest years, and the melancholy and nostalgia of this edition, despite its faults, captures this reality. \n\nThe twin girls the couple have are merely extras, a pity since we never get a sense of the importance of the fact that this couple are now parents too, and the importance of this in their relationship.\n\nThe years between leaving your parents' home and having kids are the only true years of freedom that you will know, says Jesse at one point. It seems as if Jesse and C\u00e9line have come by and passed their years of freedom and leave us pondering whether they were just passing through each other's lives, or whether the fairy tale can somehow come true. This question mark at the end will surely see fans of the first two films queuing to see part four in ten years' time. I'll be in the line too.",

It is just amazing how he turns up every 10 years with Jesse & Celine just talking & creates a very beautiful movie.Jesse & Celine are now married. Now both of them have real world problems they didn't have when they were nineteen. They keep on talking about life, their future, past, long term commitment, etc. Unlike its predecessors it has a scene wherein they talk with other people, all of whom have their own theories on relationship & life. But Jesse wants them to move back to Chicago so that he could spend time with his son. Now that's the issue. This leads to an argument which gets bitter.The 30 minute argument scene is like a real slice of life, exceptionally well done. In the build up to the scene you can see how they know that the issue will come up & how Jesse tries to bring it up in a way that he can have upper hand in the argument, but Celine tries to somehow ignore it but then she knows that it is inevitable so she starts doing the same. The way they argue is true to the character development throughout the series.  In between the argument Celine says \"Here we go you always play the part of one & only rational one, & I am the irrational, emotional hormone crazy one because I have emotions\". She has always aggressively fought. She as Jesse describes her thinks anger as a positive human emotion. But Jesse is laid back about it as he said 20 year back \" if I could just accept the fact that my life is supposed to be difficult then I might not get so pissed-off about it . \"\n\n The whole thing is classic.\n Excellent acting, excellent direction. In pure critical terms I will put the Before trilogy at the very top, even above LOTR & TDK or any trilogy for that matter. Hope they make another in next 10 years",

            "content": "Before Midnight is one of those movies that once it's over, I sit there in silence contemplating all that just transpired before my eyes, breath a deep sigh of satisfaction, smile and stretch my limbs out and relax back into my own reality. Films like this are so good and so expertly made that when looking back at the whole experience, you don't regret one second of your time you put into watching it and once it's over it's an effort to settle back into reality once again. Pulled together, this is a beautiful, rich, deeply thought provoking and deeply moving motion picture that doesn't come around often enough. It's at times charming, funny, sad, suspenseful, unsettling and for those reasons and many more, very memorable. Yet for the vast majority of its running length, it centres around two characters walking around talking to one another. It takes filmmakers and actors of immense talent and skill to make something as seemingly mundane as two people talking completely compelling and involving for almost 2 hours, and that's exactly what happens here.\n\nOf course Before Midnight didn't just come out of nowhere to grace us with its magnificence. This is the third film of a series that started all the way back in 1995 with a little film called Before Sunrise, written and directed by Richard Linklater and starring Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy. It told the short but sweet story of how two young adults, complete strangers to one another, start up a conversation on a train into Venice and decide to alight at Venice and spend the day there together, just out of curiosity. The result was an intimate, fresh take on fleeting romances, of how two people can find one another through the randomness of life and find ways of connecting through the power of conversation and circumstance, resulting in them ultimately falling for one another. What made the film so unique, at least for me, was that the entire film concentrated on these two characters strolling through Venice, talking about a broad range of subject material, gradually falling in love with one another, and that was the whole film. There were no other characters, no main story to push things forward, no real sense of conflict either. And you know what, it worked. Experiencing those two interacting with one another and opening their hearts and minds to each other was fascinating, running the gamut of human emotion and experience, all through the power conversation. The characters were likable, although at times maybe a bit pretentious and annoying in the way they opinions ran riot at times, but that's all part of the human experience and getting to know someone; there are always things we like and don't like about everyone, and it's that sense of honesty and intimacy about human relationships that made that film special.\n\nMade as a one off, the same team decided to come back again 9 years later with Before Sunset, which takes place more or less in real time for the characters Jesse and Celine, who have spent the time apart, never seeing each other again after their day in Venice all those years ago despite promising that they would. The film finds both characters having moved on, in fact in relationships and full time jobs. They happen to meet each other again in Paris, where Jesse has published a book about that night in Venice. The book draws Celine's attention and she appears at a book signing in Paris. From there, the same action as the first movie takes place; the characters wonder around Paris talking, catching up on their lives and discussing other things too. It may look the same, but the tone and the intentions are completely different. Unlike the first where everything was new, exciting and almost magical, full of hope for the future, now things have begun to move forward, life's responsibilities have emerged and regret has set in about what was left behind. Before Sunset was a lot edgier than the last movie because of this source of conflict from regret that has arisen between the two characters. But it still had some of the magic from the first as the two rekindle their spark once again after almost a decade apart. Ultimately the ending was just as open ended as the last, with us unsure of where the couple would go next.\n\nWith Before Midnight, we get the answer as another 9 years later, we find Jesse and Celine are still together, and have been since we last saw them, now with kids of their own and living in Paris. The film opens with Jesse saying goodbye at the airport to his 14 year old son from his last marriage, who he now shares during summers and other holidays. It turns out his son was spending the summer with his father in Greece, where Jesse, Celine and their twin daughters have gone for a vacation on invitation from a prestigious writer Jesse met through his own work. They're staying at a summer home with two other couples, before then moving to a hotel room for just the two of them for the night. And as is the case with all these movies, from a plot point of view there's nothing more to be said.\n\nLike Sunset was edgier than Sunrise, Midnight ups the conflict even further as the two characters have now spent almost a decade with one another, managing a family, managing their own jobs and managing each other. Practicality has set in, the burden of adult responsibility has finally taken its hold and it may seem that keeping the relationship going may be too much work than its worth. We find that those moments of spontaneous, playful conversation that we enjoyed from the first two films aren't as prevalent anymore, something which the characters themselves point out. Instead the conversations are now spiked with a sense of wariness about where their lives are headed, what sacrifices they've had to make to stay together, what further sacrifices need to be made to keep each other happy and whether any of it is ultimately worth it. There are two sequences that stand out the most to me in Before Midnight. The first is a meal that Jesse and Celine have with the rest of their fellow tenants. Here, besides the principle duo, we get 3 couples interacting with one another, each one from a certain stage of a relationship. We get the first loves, the middle age with kids and lastly the widowed. Through these we get a fascinating insight into how people's perceptions and they're interactions with loved ones changes over time, and the contrast with theirs weighs heavy on Jesse and Celine, who in amongst the conversation and its various tangents, mindfully soak in what did, has and may become of them. It's a brilliant scene, one that's both full of funny interactions and thoughtful ones.\n\nMore impressive than this scene, however, is the hotel room sequence, where we see a middle age couple go through a roller coaster of emotions as they try to make sense of their current situation and dissect what needs to be done next. The way the conversation seems to constantly ebb and flow between moments of intimacy, quiet, joy and outright frustration and anger is startling, and always feels natural. You're kept guessing all the way through as to where these two are going and it got quite suspenseful at times, which considering that all I was doing was simply watching two people in a hotel room the whole time is an incredible achievement. What makes it all even more engaging is how real it feels. These people are dealing with things that we've all gone through, or have yet to go through and more importantly, they're dealing with it in a way that makes sense and is so convincing that you'll start reflecting on your own thoughts and experiences, and that's the mark of a great film; one that can make you empathise with characters as if we were those characters.\n\nMajor praise is due to all involved, but especially the three people that started it all. Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy basically are these characters by now and they settle right into them like gloves. The performances are amazingly nuanced and detailed, with forceful, obvious moments interweaving with fleeting expressions, eye movements and body language that give away exactly what the character thinks without saying a word. For those who've followed these movies that sensation of being inside the character's minds is enhanced. After all these years, they're both clearly playing the same characters, but the passage of time weighs heavy on their shoulders and that balancing act between familiarity and change is handled perfectly. The writing is extraordinary. Prolonged conversation in a film has never been as engaging, except maybe in a Tarrantino film. The way characters relate to one another, the way they move from one point in the conversation to another is almost poetic in how elegantly it flows, but at the same time doesn't lose its grip on reality. Richard Linklater has written and directed all three movies, the first being co-wrote by Kim Krizan. The last two, however, have had considerable input from Hawke and Delpy, both of whom get co-writing credits in Sunset and Midnight. In a way that extra input from the actors makes the dialogue sound a little more improvised and natural. It just shows how much the actors can contribute to a script when they know the characters so well.\n\nLinklater's direction is unobtrusive but still very controlled and tactile. In all three films he's mainly just stepped back and allowed the actors to perform and the shots often linger for long, uncut stretches to let the dialogue flow. Editing is used sparingly but when it is, it's to emphasise important moments of character and emotion. The same can be said of lighting and space. The colour pallet in particular was interesting, mainly due to the passage of time as it starts in the day and ends, surprisingly, just before midnight, and the various colours that punctuate each scene in a way reflect the mood that's been struck. Space is used as a means to portray emotional distancing really nicely in a few scenes (characters moving closer and further away to display their perception of one another) plus it also allows the surrounding environment to come into play, something that all three films have integrated with subtlety. They've all taken place in beautiful, European surroundings; the first in Venice, the second in Paris and the third in Greece and the sense of place is always felt, and keeps the film's world rooted and prevents things from becoming monotonous as the surroundings add an external element to the characters journey.\n\nBefore Sunrise, Sunset and Midnight are unique, special films in their intimate exploration of relationships, particularly at different stages of one in particular. How beneficial is it that we have a writing, directing and acting team that has been able to stay through this journey all the way. If I had to pick a preferred film out of the three, it'd have to be this one. I think the more abrasive nature of the relationship makes things far more interesting, as you don't know where things are going to end up, which is a big deal as these characters have so much behind them and so much to lose. Saying that though, each of the three movies has a unique feel and tone that reveals something different about the characters involved while pushing them forward, which means the three movies are not interchangeable. Sure, they all deal with universal ideas and issues that can be appreciated on their own, but to get the most out of these movies you have to watch them all in sequence, just to see how the journey begins and progresses. I won't say end because this film's ending, once again, is open ended, so there's a strong chance they may revisit these characters again, perhaps in another 9 years, maybe more, whenever the next major period in a relationship occurs. It'll be amazing if they do; gives me one more thing to look forward to in the future.",

I went into \"Before Midnight\" with a confident expectation of adding a third Richard Linklater film to that list, and I was not disappointed.\n\nEthan Hawke and Julie Delpy have lost none of the charm that made me fall in love, and sometimes, frustration with their characters while managing to truly capture the passing of time and the inevitable changes every relationship goes through. This isn't all walking and talking through Greece with the one true love of their lives at their side, though there are moments of this, but rather a real world look at a relationship built on the foundation of a fairy tale. How does that fairy tale hold up after years of being together? When does musing aloud on fate, relationships, art, etc. turn from charming to annoying?\n\nThis third act explores time, the concept of marriage, parenting, commitment, sex, faithfulness and, most poignantly, the struggle to manage those things against the backdrop of life whereas the first acts really focused on love against the backdrop of, well, love.   \n\nA little more rough around the edges, a little less romance, a little less musing, a lot more truth, \"Before Midnight\" makes me believe even more in these two characters. I appreciate the chance to actually be able to age with them, to see these well-crafted roles move, in real time, from sunrise to sunset, all the way towards their own midnight. I can only hope nine years from now Delpy, Hawke, and Linklater are around to keep these rich characters in my life. \"After Sunrise\" would be a fitting title, don't you agree?",

Maybe I've never heard people talk like that in real life, but maybe I've simply never met such interesting and intelligent people.

The film is an absolute marvel, showcasing the very best dialogue and capturing the sheer essence of acting brilliance from stars Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy. Director Richard Linklater has also created the crowning work of his directorial career, showing incredible restraint and focus on two characters that still feel just as new and fresh as the day we met them. The film opens with a near fifteen minute take that gets its hook into you and never lets up. It's a cinematic sensation. The film is breathtakingly accurate and precise in capturing the love and relationship of couples, it will and should be studied by film schools and writers for years to come. Linklater bares his soul, frame after frame, showing confidence of his own idiosyncratic vision of this story and being as accessible to even the youngest of people.

Another thing is that, these actors, Hawke and Delpy brings these characters as if they're iconic movie couples for the last time.

From love you can call the first which seems to be grander than life at that time, goes to the one when you think you either doubt or master the term love itself, and finally to the one that prevails when your life [and your body] is no longer pretty. The \"BEFORE\" trilogy wonderfully explores them all.\n\nWhat's called the \"BEFORE\" trilogy is the three movies entitled BEFORE SUNRISE [1995], BEFORE SUNSET [2004] dan BEFORE MIDNIGHT [2013]. These three movies are made possible by three people, the Director Richard Linklater, the Actor Ethan Hawke and the Actress Julie Delpy, who co-write the movies together [except for the first one where Ethan and Julie are only acting]. I don't really know how they do it technically, but all I can personally say for them is that they must be the best team in making a movie imitation from real life. You will feel connected to these movies. Not to the characters or to the stories, but merely to the conversations, which is a lot! So, if you're not a big fan of listening to what characters are talking in a movie, then these movies will put you asleep in five minutes, guaranteed. But if you have a keen interest in life [not only, but mostly about, love], then these ones will feed your hunger head and touch your tender heart.\n\nThroughout the trilogy, the movies follow the two main characters, Jesse and Celine. A boy and a girl in the first movie, who become a man and a woman in the last one. That's exactly what they are as characters, no more and no less, simply male and female. What they do for living doesn't really matter, and even in their fourty with a son and a twin daughters, they're not referred to as a husband and a wife. It's interesting, actually. \n\nOne more thing we should aware about these movies is that all of them are made in approximately real-time storyline. In the first movie, it happens from an afternoon to the next morning in Vienna. The second one is set in around two hours of one afternoon in Paris. And the third one is within several hours of an evening in Greece. Yes, they're all located in those beautiful places in Europe. Maybe they deliberately compensate the high effort of your ear with a few beauty shots for your eyes.",

The acting by Hawke and Delpy is superb if not flawless. Every scene is believable. Every reaction real. Every dialogue entertaining, insightful and meaningful. The screenplay is brilliant. Both Delpy and Hawke deserve nominations for best actress and actor. Linklater for best director. The three of them for best adapted screenplay. I hope they sweep but that is highly unlikely because it is such a small budget film grossing less than $10 million and that just usually isn't the Academy's style.\n\n\nWhile I recognize that artistically this is the best of the three and was more engaged in this film than the other two (I gave it a higher rating) , it is challenging for it to be my favorite. When it comes to the depiction of life and what life can truly be, Before Sunset is my favorite. Before Sunrise is about hope of what romance could be.  Before Sunset is about what romance could have been but then in the last ten minutes is rescued by the hope of what romance could be again but a bit more maturely than its prequel. The third is about the reality of what romance is. True romance.True life. Reality. Facts - not fiction. But true romance nonetheless.\n\nThe three films together are a treasure. A gift given to us by Robert Linklater, Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy. I cheer them for it because they did it for art and hopefully the joy of their craft.",

They are vacationing and it has now been over 20 years since they first met. He has a son with his ex-wife and two beautiful blond daughters with Celine. \n\nThey are at a crossroads in their life and it is played out like a story that has everything intricate that life really does hold true. The romance, the pain during a fight, the truth told to each other, the lies withheld from each other's past, and the love that binds their relationship together that might save it all. \n\nThe whole movie is a great reminder of why I fell in love with Before Sunrise and Before Sunset. And here we are in Before Midnight, and I'm as consumed as ever. Such a great script and both are brilliant actors with the edge to Julie Delpy for just living this character to its point of resounding vulnerability.",

            "content": "Conversation makes a comeback this July. Nearly a couple of decades after Richard Linklater and Kim Krizan penned a beautiful romance about two strangers spending a day in Vienna before exchanging parting notes, and almost a decade after its sequel, where the protagonists met and spent a day in Paris, comes the third installment, Before Midnight.\n \n\n \nLike Before Sunset, the movie first helps clear state of inquisitiveness created by the previous installment. Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and Celine (Julie Delpy) are now a couple and parents to twin daughters (conceived on the same night, they spent in Before Sunset). Jesse also has a teenage son, Hank, from his divorced marriage. He is trying hard to find an arrangement for him to be able to spend more time with him.\n \n\n \nAs with previous films, this one too has some great uninterrupted conversational scenes that run into double digit minutes. The first one (14 minutes) happens while the couple is driving in a car, after dropping Hank at the airport (going to visit his mother). The second one (multiple camera shot) happens as a dinner conversation where, they are joined by three couples- same age group as them, twenties something and an elderly man (grandfather to the guy in twenties) joined by his friend. They admire and share different perspectives of being together in a relationship, how things may have changed with technology, what keeps romance alive and what kills it. The third act, a very tricky one, involves the fight, man vs woman equations, priorities and sacrifices and almost threatens to kill their relationship.\n \n\n \nWith a minimalist plot like the previous films, the film is powerfully driven by performances by the leads. It almost seems like Hawke and Delpy have been these characters for last twenty years. The conversations seem to be their conversations (literally may be, as Linklater roped in both to pen this one down, like previous installment). The characters owning the lines make the performances easy, natural and very effective. One would feel thoroughly engaged, a bit lesser in the final act maybe because of the clich\u00e9d man vs woman debate. But you still can't get the bug off, that may have bitten you, when you would have watched Before Sunrise and Before Sunset. The fans of the series would be grateful to Linklater, Ethan and Delpy to come up with this edition and for once, not to leave the audience gaping for clues to what would have happened as an epilogue to the film.\nThis is one of the best sequels, and unarguably the best romantic drama trilogy (hard to find any other in the category).\n \n \n4.25/5",

The film is directed with restraint and excellence with a great use of long takes and wide shots, like you're watching two people and set against a beautiful back drop of Greece that is captured to perfection.

Both \"Sunrise\" and \"Sunset\" eventually feel like a race against the clock as Celine (Julie Delpy) and Jesse (Ethan Hawke) have their last fleeting moments together and we're unsure of how or if they'll say goodbye when the timer hits zero. Before Midnight never reaches that point. At the start of the movie, it's revealed that Jesse left his wife to be with Celine and that they've been together for nearly ten years, having plenty of conversations about life and love that were never caught on film. The time structure is also less rigid, while \"Sunrise\" covered an afternoon's worth of time and \"Sunset\" only about an hour's worth, Before Midnight follows a full days worth of activities and has a large ensemble cast that make sure that Celine and Jesse don't spend every waking moment together. So where's the tension this time around? In a move that's both obvious and fitting, Celine and Jesse's conflict is with each other this time around. As they argue over their love life, Jesse's relationship with his son from a previous marriage and if they're going  to move back to the U.S., we see a new side of these characters, a side full of anger and doubt. At times it seems like Linklater is giving us front row seats to the deconstruction of the romantic myth of true love but relationships and their arguments are never that black-and-white. Love is hurtful, messy and subtle something that Before Midnight captures beautifully. The best film of 2013.",

The continuing story of Jesse and Celine now together nearly a decade.  They have kids and step-kids and are vacationing one Summer in Greece.  Like all real couples, they love, make love, bicker, dwell on their children and fight - and they both know how to strike close to the nerve.  Their confrontations are uncomfortable, but frank and true.  I remember in Frances Ha, she liked to \"play fight\" - that's Hollywood couple fight, but here, we have 18 years vested and they are family.  We wish for a fairy tale happiness, but the film does not draw easy conclusions.  That's real, that's life.  But, keep in mind, it's funny, sweet, romantic with moments of truth not usually heard on film.  It's as though we eavesdrop on a middle age couple as they go over the good and bad moments of their lives - the jealousy, suspicions and plans/fears of the future.  Richard Linklater has crafted an exquisite, smart film with his co-stars Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy.  I would love to visit Jesse and Celine in another 5-10 years to see the progression of their lives whether they are together or not would be of interest!",

It surely needs a lot of innovation and talent, both from the director and actors, to successfully and elegantly tell a story of two lives in the form of three movies, all set 9 years apart, each in the span of a day. Over these 18 years, we feel like we've grown with Jesse and Celine, and their lives are so intimately etched with ours.\n\nThis part is set in a Greek village, and seems more real and brutally honest. It gives an intrusively intriguing glimpse into the couple's life, nine years into their relationship. We see a happy but disgruntled couple; regrets, kids, hopes, dreams... all these seep in. Sometimes, the depth and intimacy of the their conversations and arguments feel too private for us to even be there.\n\nThe acting from the two leads is exceptional without a doubt. Hawke and Dephy have worn these characters along the years almost as their second skins. In this part, we see a completely new side. All the pent up regret and rage makes them confront each other with such aggression and sarcasm. Love is not completely lost between them; as long as they're communicating, we still see some kind of hope.\n\nThe first scene of the movie, where we see Jesse seeing off his son (from first wife) at the airport, and the hotel confrontation scene are exquisitely executed and brilliantly acted. Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick ['The Omen', 'Moonrise Kingdom'], the young actor who plays Jesse's son Hank, is quite talented and surprisingly charming.\n\nThe movie ends on a pleasing and magical note. \nAn unforgettable and unmatched love trilogy.",

I really loved the ending in this film and thought it was a perfect tie to the first film. It was the best film of the trilogy, but you won't appreciate it as much if you haven't seen the first two movies to fully understand what is at stake here. Before Midnight is one of the year's best films and amongst Linklater's best movies. It is a heartwarming, raw, and funny movie about love and relationships with some terrific performances.",

Now, our heroes are stuck in the middle age crisis, as much of us are, and they are more true to themselves than in any other stage.\nLinklater, Delphy and Hawke gave us the most powerful, insightful, funny and brutally real conversation between a couple that cinema has offered in almost 20 years, if not ever.\nThis is a movie about life. A real life. The final act, the conversation between Jesse and Celine in a hotel room, is as powerful and realistic as it happens in real life between a man and a woman that have had a long relationship. \nThoughtful, funny, sexy, bittersweet and brutally honest, Before Midnight is full of outstanding performances, ideas, moments and the feeling that we are watching something that summer cinema has been incapable of giving us for a long time: life at 24 frames per second.",

Once more Richard Linklater make us explore the meaning of the true love and the difficulties that life can bring us with love, he achieved to direct a wonderful movie by presenting the beautiful places of Greece. The screenplay is absolutely amazing and very realistic, Richard Linklater, Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke achieved to present to us with their screenplay the meaning of true love and how their magical romance that we saw in Before Sunrise and in Before Sunset concludes to a usual marriage with its own problem that many people deal with in their daily life and they still struggling to find back their true love that they may have lost during their marriage. The cast of the movie is one more time excellent, Julie Delpy is better than any other time, she gives a flawless performance that should lead her to the Academy Awards. Ethan Hawke is also very good in his role and the rest of the cast did a great job, especially the great (well know for her movies back in '60s in Greece) Xenia Kalogeropoulou gives a sweet, touching performance that will remain in our memories. The soundtrack is also amazing, the song ''Gia ena tango'' sung by Haris Alexiou (one of the best singers in Greece) gives a sweet melody to the movie. Now, i can say that the trilogy (Before Sunrise,Before Sunset,Before Midnight) is the best trilogy ever made. Before Midnight totally deserves an Oscar nomination for Best Adapted Screenplay and a nomination for Best Leading Actress (Julie Delpy) and why not a nomination for Best Motion Picture. It is difficult to believe that the love story of Jesse and Celine ends with that movie, because these movies taught us many true things, like that even a romance that we think that it could only exist in movies, it can become a usual story like the marriages we meet every day with its own problems, but also with its own moments of happiness and with this movie we can understand the meaning of true love and the meaning of the family. To sum up, we have cried and we have felt the moments of happiness of the romance of Jesse and Celine and we hope that in another 9 years we will see another movie of their love and their family.",

The story of this movie is that it takes place years after the second film and Jesse and Celine are together and there on vacation with there two kids and while there on vacation they learn more about each other and they learn not only what it takes to be in a relationship but they also learn on what it takes to be a good parent. The main reason why I love these movies so much is because there so realistic and when I watch them I feel like I'm listenting to real people, it doesn't ever feel like I'm watching a movie it feels like I'm watching two people talk about each others lives. What really makes these movies work is the strong performances that both Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy give. Also the writing in these films are almost perfect, the dialogue is perfect and the characters are so likeable. So, did this movie have terrific writing and top notch performances by its two leads? Of course it did! Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy still have incredible chemistry with each other and the conversations they have in this movie are so compelling and realistic that I had no choice to give this movie a perfect rating. Richard Linklater directs this movie for a third time and once again he pulls it off really well. So, the writing in this movie was top notch, the acting was top notch, the direction was top notch and the editing was top notch, so what else can I say this movie was top notch.",

Others have praised this for its \"realistic\" depiction of a mature married relationship but this is certainly no relationship that anyone would want to emulate.  Julie Delpy's Celine , in particular, is a nauseating cocktail of paranoia, passive aggression and Euro-trash elitism. Ethan Hawke has the more sympathetic role but largely just acts as the straight man for Celine's provocations.

            "content": "At first we get only hints of the storm to come.  Jessie's concern as he watches his son Hank board a plane for the U.S (Hank is returning to his normal life with Jessie's ex-wife, far, far away).  Celine struggling to justify her decision to take up an employment opportunity she doesn't really want in a workplace (government) that is anathema to her.  Back at the bucolic ocean-side Greek villa where they have been spending the summer, the pair have dinner with friends and fellow guests, discussing life and relationships and how these things change and endure (or don't endure) over time.  These friends have rented a hotel room for Jessie and Celine to spend the night and refuse to humour the couple when they protest.  They will go there, they will be alone together (no kids!), they will have fun.  End of story.\n \nAs they saunter towards the hotel Jessie and Celine realise that they haven't talked - really talked - to each other for a long time, not since the birth of their twin daughters five years ago; too much to arrange, too much to cope with, too much real-life.  Five years is a long time to stay silent, especially for this couple (as anyone who has seen 'Before Sunrise' and 'Before Sunset' will know); there must be a lot to catch up on, a lot of thoughts and feelings (and resentments?) that have never been shared.  When they reach the hotel room they, and we, quickly learn how much they haven't been saying to each other.\n \nThe conversation morphs into argument and then bitter recrimination, the emotions and sentiments become more raw, more brutal.  It's not pretty.  It may be a relationship in its death throes...\n \n'Before Midnight' is transfixing, every bit as absorbing as its gorgeous predecessors.  The spellbinding dialogue is painfully truthful, often devilishly funny and is delivered, as always, with peerless class by Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke.  They now inhabit these characters so fully that it can be difficult to believe that Jessie and Celine don't actually exist out there somewhere, that we're watching mere figments of Delpy, Hawke and director Richard Linklater's imaginations.  But they're drawn with such intelligence, clarity, verve and skill that we have no choice but to believe in them.\n \nBut the movie also breaks with the traditions established by its two predecessors; it's more acerbic, more biting, more uncomfortable.  Although the first half of 'Before Midnight' is redolent of the golden glow that suffused 'Before Sunrise' and 'Before Sunset', that glow soon fades - replaced by the unforgiving light of the increasingly claustrophobic hotel room - and we realise that we are watching a tough and truthful movie about what happens when infatuation and love are no longer novelties, when the responsibilities and pressures of a 'relationship' become its chief defining characteristic, when passion by itself may no longer be enough.  As an audience we are pulling for Jessie and Celine to navigate their way through their personal minefield, and we are mesmerised in part because we understand that where this pair are concerned there are no guarantees.\n \nI couldn't look away, and the time galloped by (the film felt an entire hour shorter than its 109 minutes).  In terms of filmmaking quality, this is as good as sequel-making gets, forming a fitting capstone(?) to this unique treasure of a trilogy.  It's not perfect; we spend a little too much time with extraneous, less-interesting characters and there is the occasional line of dialogue that is more for the benefit of the audience than the characters.  But if 'Before Midnight' isn't quite as perfectly formed as it's sublime predecessor 'Before Sunset', then perhaps - considering the dented state of Jessie and Celine's continuing romance - that's completely appropriate.",

This movie is literally one long conversation between a married couple whose once intense and passionate relationship has fizzled out because of work, traveling, and the task of raising their kids. There's an impressive long take where they talk and walk through an entire neighborhood with no cuts in the filming. But other than a few crafty, clever comebacks/punch lines, this movie's vehicle (a flowing, unraveling dialogue) wears out its welcome when your realize that you're stuck eavesdropping on a married couple's conversation. The whole time, I thought to myself, \"I've been in better conversations and arguments than this!\" I'm baffled by the fact that this movie received high ratings from both critics and users - maybe there's not enough communication or discussion in their lives. Maybe instead of texting, they should all argue a little more lol. If the two Before movies are anything like this one, I will forgive myself for having watched this one before the others.

            "content": "It is time to inform you before the clock strikes twelve (or any time for that matter) that \"Before Midnight\" is one movie that you should not miss out on. The film is the third of a trilogy of the \"Before\" romantic movie franchise that includes \"Before Sunrise\", \"Before Sunset\", and now Midnight. For those of you who did not wake up to Sunrise or ease on to Sunset, please make sure you check them out before going into to the Midnight \"all you can love\" movie buffet. The central figures of the franchise are Jesse (played wonderfully again by Ethan Hawke), an intellect writer, and Celine (perfected once more by Julie Delpy), a French environmentalist. For those of you who have not heard of their story \"before\", I will synopsize it. Here it goes, a young Jesse and Celine meet on a Euro train in the mid 90's and had an unforgettable evening in the streets of Vienna while conversing about a plethora of topics while getting to know each other; that is \"Before Sunrise\" in a blink or so. Forward ten years later, Jesse is now a successful writer and Celine a thriving non-profit environmentalist and fate has them reunited in France in one of the stops of Jesse's book tour; hence \"Before Sunset\". Forward 7up on years and we have midnight. In \"Before Midnight\", Jesse & Celine are a full-fledged couple and are no mas \"one time in a decade\" lovers. They live in Paris, and have two twin daughters. Jessie is now an even more successful writer and loves Celine and their daughters, but wrestles with the situation of missing his teen son who resides in the states with Jesse's alcoholic ex-wife. Yes, Jessie did have another girl during Jesse & Celine's decade break from sunrise to sunset. Celine is fed up with the struggles of the non-profit world, so she entertains the thought of linking up with a corporate company. Speaking of links, Director Richard Linklater develops \"Before Midnight\" with a continuum of what made \"Before Sunrise\" and \"Before Sunset\" such delights; insightful conversation, profound emotional disclosures, witty banter, sparkling chemistry, breathtaking scenery, eccentric supporting characters, and so much more. Linklater is due a Best Director Oscar nomination and hopefully it will come no later than next year during Award season. Linklater, Hawke, and Delpy are a trio team of verbal brilliance by mustering up another enchanting & cerebral screenplay to \"Before Midnight\" as they did in \"Before Sunset\", but this one is even better. The scenes between Jesse and Celine in a hotel room disclosing their insecurities, anger, resentments, loneliness, and jealousies were perfectly written; one of the most vigorous dialogues I have ever heard in an elongated movie scene. It will be tough to top this scribe as the Best Screenplay of 2013! But don't quote me on this before I see the rest of the movies coming our way this year. Nevertheless, a Best Adapted Screenplay Oscar nomination is already in the can for Richard, Ethan, and Julie. Speaking of Oscar noms, I think its about time the Academy takes notice of the multi-talented Julie Delpy and nominate her for a Best Actress nomination for her grand thespian effort in \"Before Midnight\". Her multi-dimensional performance as Celine will leave you in a Julie state for a few days. Not to be dismissed, Ethan Hawke delivers another brainy, sharp performance as the scholarly romantic Jesse. He is also deserving of an Oscar nom. \"Before Midnight\" delivers in all aspects in exemplary filmmaking and acting; so I do urge you watch this movie as a morning flick, an afternoon matin\u00e9e, or even better a midnight movie treat.\n ***** Excellent",

            "content": "I can remember in 2004 when there seemed to be an unsettling amount of nervousness and excitement leading up to the premiere of Before Sunset. I was seventeen at the time and had not become as well acquainted with indie films or smaller, art house projects that were gaining recognition which in turn meant I had not seen the original film that spawned this follow-up nine years later. Even though I heard a lot about Before Sunset that year and recognized Ethan Hawke from countless other movies I never made it around to seeing what all the fuss was about. I still had not at the beginning of this year and then I began to hear that same level of unique excitement that started to build when it was rumored that director Richard Linklater and both Hawke and co-star Julie Delpy were hard at work scouting locations for a third installment in their relationship evaluation trilogy. As it turned out the stars and director weren't simply looking for locations, but had indeed shot the third installment and as I now try to expose myself to as many facets of film as possible I felt a responsibility to catch up on what I was missing and what everyone else was talking about. This has led to an experience where I've come to know Hawke's Jesse and Delpy's Celine over a matter of two decades in less than a few weeks. It is at some level unnerving as you can literally see the way in which people age and relationships change, while it isn't until this latest installment, Before Midnight, that we get to see the effects of these characters having been in a relationship for some time now. The fact this film would exist might confirm what eventually happened after the cliffhanger at the end of Before Sunset as I assume Linklater and his crew would realize they couldn't repeat themselves by simply having Jesse and Celine meet up for a few hours and catch up with one another again. Lucky for us, this is true in that Jesse never caught that plane and instead stayed and started a family with Celine which has now evolved into a much more recognizable relationship than the type of fantasy, star crossed lovers ordeal the first two films presented. I understand the appeal of these films and have truly come to feel as if I know these people which is good considering the content of the conversations they have this time around.  \n\nread the whole review at www.reviewsfromabed.com",

The acting class comes from Julie Delpy who commands the screen. She's fantastic. Ethan Hawke lets her do her thing just as his Jesse lets her Celine talk and talk and get mad and crazy. The script is excellent, and gives us everything we need to know (and what we don't need to know) to be on the edge following their discussion about what to do with their lives. To me he should win the argument, but she has very valid points as well. It doesn't matter though, seeing them go over it, just like that Greek sunset they look amazed at, is delightful, and, even if sad at times because of what might happen, a pleasure to watch.",

It follows the same formula that has made the other 2 just amazing movies. It's one day in the lives of Jesse(Ethan Hawke) and Celine(Julie Delpy). It picks up nine years after \"Sunset\" when they are on vacation in Greece. They are still together with twin daughters , and Jesse wants to move back to the U.S. to be closer to his son from a previous marriage. From there the movie is those two walking and talking trying to rekindle their romance, and ultimately things come to a head as the emotions that bubble under the surface rise up. There is a lot of arguing in this movie and at first you are like \"nooo!\", but by the end you realize that this is a very realistic look at their relationship. This is exactly how couples are, and exactly how these two would be spending their lives with each other. It's a fantastic movie than fans of the previous films will love. Hawke and Delpy have the best chemistry I've ever seen in a series of romantic type movies(although this isn't a very romantic movie). I love how each movie is separated by 9 years. It really helps this franchise stand apart and be something truly unique in a sea of movies that are exactly the same. I sincerely hope in 9 years we get a fourth movie, because I cannot wait to see where these two go next. Great third installment, of a great series of films. Check all three of them out if you haven't.",

Of course, it's almost critical that the audience have seen the ridiculously engrossing first two films in this verite series...almost. This continuation of the tale speaks with such authenticity that anybody can easily fall into the fabric. The conversations ring truest when the focus telescopes onto the one on one dynamic, but the supporting players in this tale certainly provide a fascinating perspective beyond simply husband and wife, coloring outside the lines of a rocky marriage. The 3rd act proves a gut-punch at times, but this only stems from the fact that it feels so heart-tuggingly and heart-wrenchingly real?the ultimate tip of the cap to all involved and the filmgoers who have loyally been flies on the wall of this rewarding journey.\r\n\r\nIn this R-rated drama set nearly two decades since Before Sunrise, we now find Jesse (Hawke) and Celine (Delpy) in their early 40's, navigating marriage, children, and their careers on a vacation in Greece.\r\n\r\nGranted, none of this would be possible without director Richard Linklater?s unobtrusive walk-and-talk camerawork, engaging script that leaves the actors room to breathe, and awe-inspiring vision overall in birthing this series. Having watched these characters develop into (almost) personal friends of yours over 20 years, Hawke and Delpy are so convincing that it truly feels like a documentary. And yes, that?s the point?a point the Before series still hammers home well even in the weaker scenes.\r\n\r\nBottom line: Midnight 'n' Fairest.",

Let's just say this is one fine picture and one of the year's saving graces for me.  This has been a less than stellar year for film especially for film that I'm anticipating.  Before Midnight is the third film in the ongoing story of Jesse and Celine, the adorable couple who met on a train in Paris during Before Sunrise.  Before Sunrise is one of my all-time favorite films.  Its sequel, Before Sunset was okay but in my opinion it lacked the magic of the first film.  It just felt more of the same and frankly rote.  This third film is spectacular and matches Before Sunrise but in a completely different way.  This time around Jesse and Celine have married and are raising two lovely daughters, but there is trouble in paradise, and it looks as though they may not stay together.  There is a climactic fight in this film that blows away any action packed climax seen in this year's blockbusters - it feels raw, realistic, and wounding.  This film feels like life -- this film is art.",

The dialogue is flawless, and Julie Delpy gives the best performance of her career - Academy Award nomination worthy. At times in the film, you can tell even Ethan Hawke is in awe. Last year we had the screen duo from 'amour,' and this year Hawke/Delpy should be recognized for giving a performance just as real and fantastic. The 'Before' series is no longer just a love story, it should be shown in schools all over the world for educational purposes, of what it's like after the happy ending.",

This is the third film in what is, SO FAR (I'm thinking this may continue) a trilogy of films chronicling the relationship between Celine (Julie Delpy) and Jesse (Ethan Hawke) that started in \"Before Sunrise\" and continued to \"Before Sunset\", both films I absolutely loved. This time, they're living together, they have twin girls and are middle-aged. Like the first two films, the film is basically entirely conversations but thanks to the great script, acting and direction, holds your attention and engages you throughout. Having seen these two characters \"grow up\" so to speak before our eyes and all the many ups and downs of their relationship, one can't help but hold onto to their every word and seem like we already know them as people. The film does not shy away from harsh realities and real-life issues yet still manages to be sweet, funny and romantic which makes the romance MORE romantic/",

After spending two previous films that have spanned almost two decades with these characters, a certain gravitas and weight is in everything they say and do. You truly care about the choices they contemplate and the decisions they may make.

What I felt instead, was like a fly on the wall of some of my own break-ups (even though the script left it open for Jesse n Celine) and I could have gone the rest of my life not living through those fights again. If the writers wanted this leg of their venture to be more real in contrast with current society, mission accomplished. Personally, I prefer romantic love stories to be just that, no matter how 'in left field' a happy ending may be. I will not be adding this 3rd movie to my 'Before' series as I feel it 'overshadows' the Sunrise/Sunset duo I fell in love with all those years ago.",

            "content": "Jessie (Ethan Hawke) and Celine (Julie Delpy) met on a Vienna-bound train in 1995's \"Before Sunrise\".  They reunited briefly in Paris in 2004's \"Before Sunset\". And now, in the third (and hopefully last) film of what's currently a trilogy, they're coupled-up 40-somethings spending the summer in Greece with their twin seven-year-old daughters.\r\n\r\nAs the film begins, Jessie is seeing off his 14-year-old son at the airport. The kid lives in Chicago with his mother (Jessie's ex-wife); Jessie and his new family live in Paris. Jesse is yakking away but the kid pretty much refuses to engage.  Once this little preamble is over, the movie begins in earnest. Little did I know it would be all downhill from here.\r\n\r\nAct I: The Interminable Car Ride from the Airport. As the twins snooze in the back seat, Jessie and Celine have an incredibly boring conversation about, among other things, a rejected wind farm proposal and whether or not Celine should take a new job.  They both seem to fancy themselves as being far more clever than they actually are in addition to being in love with the sound of their own voices.  At one point, I started to fear that the entire movie would take place in the car, kind of like a mobile \"My Dinner with Andre\" but with people who aren't even remotely interesting.  As relieved as I was when they finally arrived at their destination, the next scene wasn't much of an improvement. \r\n\r\nAct II: The Pretentious Writer's Discussion group. While the women stuff tomatoes in the kitchen, Jessie, a writer with three successful books under his belt, bounces ideas for his new novel off some male contemporaries.  As convoluted as his book sounds - a bunch of characters with mental glitches all watch \"On the Waterfront\" in different eras - he gets enough encouragement to keep blabbing on about it until dinner time.\r\n\r\nAct III: The Hackneyed Dinner Scene.  Four couples sitting outside.  Good food.  Plenty of wine.  And an endless supply of 70's-era male-bashing.  Fortunately, the party ends early as Jesse and Celine are heading to a hotel for a romantic kid-free night.\r\n\r\nAct IV:  The Long Walk to the Hotel. \"If you met me on a train today\", Celine asks, \"would you still talk to me, even though I've turned into a fat ass middle-aged mom**?\" \"Well if you met ME on a train today\", Jesse responds, \"would you still get off with me even though I've grown into a sleazy little weasel-face who never shaves or washes his hair?\" \"You know\", says Celine, \"I can't remember the last time we were able to really talk like this.\" Really, Celine? You can't remember? All you two have done the entire movie is talk. Shutting up is the thing that you shouldn't be able to remember.\r\n\r\nAct V: The Gloves Come Off.  Jessie and Celine are in the hotel. Making out.  Second base. Phone rings. Argument ensues. Things turn nasty. REALLY nasty.  Painful to sit through. Do these people even LIKE each other? \r\n\r\nWhy did this movie get such rave reviews? I like talky movies, I really do, but not pretentious, self-absorbed, humorless blathering. Not listening to people spewing seven years of suppressed venom, hell-bent on hurting each other. \r\n\r\nMy vague recollection is that I liked these characters in the first two films; not so in this one. I was put off by Jessie's smugness almost from the get-go, and by end, Celine has turned into a full-blown raving harpy.  Unlikable characters, worn-out gender stereotypes, stale dialogue...what, besides the gorgeous cinematography, am I supposed to like here?\r\n\r\n**Lest I'm accused of misogyny, Celine really does refer to herself as a \"fat ass middle-aged mom\".  Jessie, on the other hand, never actually describes himself as a \"sleazy little weasel-face\".  The description, nonetheless, is quite apt.",

They all go about talking about live, love and sex around a dinner table in a very \"Before-esque\" fashion, but the truth is that the only characters I'm interested in are Jesse and Celine, not Jesse and Celine plus their other 6 friends. I want to hear about what the main 2 characters have to say, not what the whole 8-people group has to say.\n\nSo through that first half of the film I was nervously sitting on my hands thinking \"when will all these people leave so we can finally focus on Jesse and Celine?!?!\"\n\nAnyway, during the second half of the film, the plot goes back to what \"Before\" has always been about: Jesse, Celine and their deep-yet-snappy conversations... GREAT, I thought for a moment...\n\nBut there's a problem: the overall tone of the conversation has shifted from previous \"Before\" films because the nature of their very relation has also shifted: This is not a platonic love story anymore - this is now an average Joe and Jenny marriage, with all its mundane mid-life frustrations: looking after the children, boring sex, unsatisfying jobs, etc.\n\nAs a result, their conversation takes a VERY sour turn, specially from Celine's side about how unsatisfied she is, how many compromises she's been forced to make, etc. She comes out rather whinny, hysteric and unnecessarily annoying, while Jesse looks like a castrated wimp who tries hard (and fails) to joint all the dots in this life: his son, his marriage, his carrier, etc. The whole thing smalls like \"every couple's marriage\".\n\nAnd THAT is, in my opinion, the core reason as of why I didn't like this 3rd installments: I used to love Jesse and Celine because their relationship was PLATONIC, idealistic, youthful, utterly romantic yet never fulfilled. You see, the whole premise around the \"Before\" saga is about two soul mates who, for whatever reason, never quite make it to fully close the circle. That springs the audience to imagine how great it would have been if they eventually come together, whether they'd turn into the perfect couple, whether some day they'll be united forever, etc. You know, the typical pondering you go about in a platonic love story. HOWEVER, in Before Midnight, that platonic love turns into an normal marriage (with all its typical downsides) and the mystery fades away, leaving the audience thinking... \"oh crap, I never imaged these guys wouldn't have made it in the end\".\n\nBefore Midnight portrays no love fairytale like the Before Sunrise, and it portrays no optimistic hope like Before Sunset. Instead, it portrays the crude reality of a middle-aged couple that has been together for a decade and how the typical mundane marriage problems begin to take a bitter toll on their relationship.\n\nI think I enjoyed the old \"platonic love\" theme better...",

            "content": "Being an avid fan of director Richard Linklater and his previous two instalments I had high hopes for this, the third in his \"Before...\" Romantic drama trilogy and as ever he did not disappoint, the film was just as engaging and beautifully written as the last two (helped by in part by his scripting partners Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy). The film picks up with Jesse (Hawke) and Celine (Delpy) now married some 9 years after we last saw them wandering the streets of Paris, they now have twin girls as well and have settled into a seemingly blissful family life. However tensions mount under the veneer of this seemingly perfect existence when at the start of the film we see Jesse dropping off his teenage son from a previous relationship at the airport. It is this moment that sets the tone for things to come, as Jesse feels he is losing his connection with his son on account of him living in Chicago with his estranged ex wife and Jesse having carved out a life and a family with Celine in France. The film takes place in Greece during the last day of a family vacation and unlike the previous two films director Linklater throws into the mix an eclectic range of new characters that show up to offer their tales of love and life lived all the while Jesse and Celine caught up in the centre of their own issues which namely spans from them having lived the last nine years as a married couple with children. As ever the script writing is first rate, beautifully capturing a relationship that has taken them from the whirlwind fantasy encounter on a train to the culture soaked streets of Paris and now the stunning vistas and landscapes of Greece. Theirs is a relationship that Celine believes has went stale through having spend so many years together, she still yearns to make a difference in the world and actually help everyone but herself in the process, her impending decision to take a new job, albeit one Jesse believes she will hate being at the foreground of their discussions this time around. Jesse is still the writing and we learn that he has penned three books, two of which based on his encounter and life with Celine (much to her annoyment). He is still at heart the hopeless romantic although a somewhat jaded one at best, seeking to live out his life with Celine as depicted in one of his novels. Celine however is very much grounded in the life of a domestic housewife and equally as annoyed about it as well. Tensions bubble away as these issues find their way to the surface and both Jesse and Celine are forced up to the possibility of a life without one another and to question whether they are still truly content to live out their lives together. The film beautifully conveys the sense of time these two have known one another and of a relationship that may have peeked at family life, the writing is searingly  honest and open. Unflinching in its depiction of family life full stop. Highlighting perfectly the fears and drama that comes hand in parcel with having a family. Hawke and Delpy  are as engaging as ever, the roles so familiar to them now the chemistry is electric. The genius of this series of films lies in the open and honest depiction of a relationship that spans near 18 years, we have seen the best and worst of both Jesse and Celine and it's the writing that keeps each encounter as fresh as ever. We feel apart of what they have. Truly it's like Eve's dropping on a conversation between a couple that have known each other for years, the writing is real and honest. No frothy sugar coated romance here, simply a romance that has turned into a relationship that has grounded itself in reality and stood the test of time. It's beautiful to watch and as engaging as ever. Will there be a forth encounter for Jesse and Celine? No idea, but on the strength of this third act, lets hope so. The film leaving us on another will they won't they conclusion. Let hope they do.",

It's more of the same in all the best ways, with the characters' natural progression since we last saw them easily conveyed through behavior and dialogue. Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy have great chemistry once again, reminding you why you cared to follow these characters to begin with in Before Sunrise. It is at times really funny, deeply heartfelt and intense, and moving, and it stands as an extraordinary justification for sequels in this constantly expanding market of franchises. It doesn't have a perfect ending like Before Sunset, but Before Midnight ends very logically all the same, and it's another day worth spending with Jesse and Celine.",

It had drama but it also had comedy.It had fights but it also had love. It felt real but it also felt like a dream. Almost in every scene one could easily detect the above. I've already seen it twice in the cinema and I could watch it again. The only thing that might bother people -not me- is the fact that each scene lasts a few minutes and therefore there aren't many different locations shown. So one may feel tired watching it because it really focuses on the dialogue and the acting. Thus one could say that the script would suit more a theatrical play. To that I respond : In that case, we would never have the chance to watch the sunset or get inside the little medieval church or stand by the beautiful waters.

            "content": "Wow, don't you just love it when there's finally a film that actually delivers on or exceeds your expectations?  Before Midnight is that movie.  I loved (how can I emphasize that more?) the first two (Before Sunrise and Before Sunset) so much so that I just couldn't wait to see the third installment, but there was that roaming thought of whether or not it could actually meet the quality of its predecessors.  Frankly, there's so much to love in Before Midnight, and it's definitely one of the most interesting projects in cinematic history where we witness two actors aging together over two decades as each addition is produced nearly ten years after the prior one.  It's an extraordinary experiment, and you just fall in love with the characters and acquire deeper knowledge of their complex personalities with every new chapter.  \n\n            The acting is unlike that of any other films, but I'm absolutely picking Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy as one of my favorite, if not my absolute favorite, performances of the year.  As usual, their performances are amazingly organic and natural while the chemistry in their relationship is matched by no other.  By the time you're finished with all three films (or even finished with one of them), you'd think they're a couple in real life, but they're sadly not.  It's not only their words but their physical responses (gestures, emotions, etc.) that create this sense that they truly know each other inside out.  Honestly, if I find a woman half as astonishing as Celine, I'd be a lucky and happy man.  She's an incredibly cute, intelligent woman with a sexy French accent that makes heavily interesting conversation- what else could be more attractive?  Jesse (played by Ethan Hawke) is an equally lovable individual who possesses an equal amount of depth- the intellectual and wise-cracking fellow!  There are countless pauses and particular mannerisms that create this natural and realistic atmosphere as if you're actually viewing someone else's life rather than just watching a theatrical production.   \n\n             Now, I don't mean to sound condescending here, but it undoubtedly saddens me to see people (though they're obviously the minority) pan the film simply because it's primarily focused on dialogue/discussion.  They're of the mentality that films have to contain consistent action and artificial relationships (that last one is more unintentional, of course), and I extremely hate the traditional mindsets that construct rules on how you write screenplays and structure your plots and stories.  If cinema was as great and artistic as it was, there'd be no need for restricting visionaries to what they can and can't do.  I believe that rigid standards and rules utterly cannot exist in the realm of art and storytelling.  This is why we only encounter a unique and memorable film- any type of story form for that matter- every once in a while.  These storytellers honestly don't care about what the bosses expect whether it's introducing a turning point exactly on page 22 in your screenplay or intentionally assembling a three-act film; it's typical, generic, and artificial at this point.  With Before Midnight, there's never that hint of artificiality or inclusions of Hollywood archetypes and clich\u00e9s.  The viewers are basically transported into other people's lives- fully immersed- and that's essentially what stories are all about: leaving your irritating life to occasionally experience the fun and liveliness of another.  \n\n            The script of this motion picture is so witty and genuine that I never felt boredom out of the constant reliance on talking.  Their conversations are frequently fascinating, and I just hope that I can find someone, one day, who talks about various topics, philosophical, psychological or personal, rather than gossip and more bullshit.  However, I found it slightly distracting how overloaded the film was with conversations about sex in its first half; it ruined the magic of the first two in a way (but that's obviously too strong of a word) because Sunrise and Sunset delved into deeper discussions instead of the annoying obsession with orgasms and blowjobs that Hollywood romantic comedies and movies, in general, encompass.  \n\n           On another note, the cinematography can often be overlooked, but these three's excellence also stems from its visual presentation of beautiful European cities like Vienna, Paris, and Greece.  You're perfectly welcome to enjoy the spectacular sights of these cities as they walk through them in real-time, debating about another compelling subject.  So, when moviegoers complain about the lack of cinematic substance in these films, I can certainly refute by showing them these two sides- an immersive experience within a city, marveling over the numerous landmarks, and intriguing, spontaneous dialogue on the other side- or them both intertwining, more so.  In addition, the authenticity of the film is greatly enhanced by the effective use of long takes (some lasting well over ten minutes) with that real-time factor in mind.  As I kept on watching, I never wished for it to end because these vibrant personalities seriously engross you, and in my opinion, the enjoyment received from these films is indescribable.  You're laughing along with the characters (whether through their teasing one another or unified laughter following a clever joke) or you're worried about a developing issue in their relationship and what will come of it.  In sum, you're sensing these emotions and feelings as they're sensing them.  \n\n            It can't be said enough, but this trilogy is unquestionably a rare feat, and I can't bear to wait another ten years for a sequel (these are one of those films where I hope the series will continue on forever and ever).  Once I'm finished with the film, I can't stop thinking about it a day or two after and while I'm remarkably satisfied by the experience, I'm also upset about its conclusion.  If only this were a TV series that I could return to every year, but that is unfortunately not the case here.  Before Midnight is a must-see, and at the moment, it could very well be my favorite film of the year, no doubt about that.  Very rarely do I finally reach a film that feels special, memorable, and fresh.  I'm glad Before Midnight was that eventual encounter.",

The direction from Richard Linklater is yet again spectacular and the acting from Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy are once more perfection. Whereas the first two films, I believe, were largely optimistic, this one does paint quite a sad portrait of love as you age. Yet, in many respects, I think it is still a beautiful picture. It is a film that shows difficulties in relationships and leaves nothing out. However, the way in which it walks it back and shows the tender moments in the aftermath of war, it illustrates that though it can be messy and hurt, love is worth fighting for and the blood, sweat, and tears, spent in the pursuit of it are not in vein. For this, Before Midnight is the best of the trilogy, though they are hard to separate, since all three are such great films.

It's not necessary to see the first two movies to follow Before Midnight.  The movie features long takes (sometimes not cutting for 10 minutes at a time) the story takes place over a day, and dialogue and naturalistic acting are paramount.  There's a complexity to their characters and relationship that refuses to fully romanticize or demonize them.  It's something of a realist romance in (deliberate) contrast the beautiful settings.  Careful viewers will notice a handful of ironies that ground the romance in reality.  I won't give examples here, or go into the details that keep me from giving this a 9 or 10 as many critics do.  The movie is the proverbial breath of fresh air, though.  I'd say that the main weakness of the movie stems from its strengths, in that when artists set out to make something so true to human nature (as opposed to fluffier rom coms or Nicholas Sparks movies) it's easy to hear the (few) false notes that are played.

The film picks up nine yearsBefore Midnight is, of course, the third (and not necessarily final) film in Richard Linklater, Ethan Hawke, and Julie Delpy's winsome, organic, intimate series that follows the stories of lovers Jesse and Celine. The film picks up nine years after the ambiguous ending of Before Sunset and    well, you're not interested in the plot. Jesse and Celine are together, of course, because how could the film exist otherwise?\r And what, really, can I say? Was there any doubt that I would gush about this film before I even set eyes on its beautiful opening shot: a throwaway close-up of Ethan Hawke's Jesse and his son, Hank's, shoes? Call me a biased reviewer. Maybe I'm doing it wrong by allowing this film to be the third act of a singular, indivisible story. The truth is, it was going to take a disaster of tremendous proportions for me to not love this film. I can say with absolute certainty that such was not the case. As far as judgment rendered goes, there's a pretty simple rubric. Have you seen the first two films? If not, go see them now. There is absolutely zero reason to watch Midnight out of context, even if it does stand strong as an independent entity. Now, did you love the first two films? If not, you should probably kill yourself with robotic haste, so bleak is the world you must inhabit. If you've seen both Sunrise and Sunset and are still breathing, you will see this film. You will almost assuredly love it. Few things in the world are so simple and so certain.\r Instead, I'll waste everyone's time by drawing some fairly moot and humble and utterly small comparisons between the three films.\r Sunrise is the most unapologetically romantic film of the series, as is to be expected. Midnight ranks a close second, however, due to a level of passion and tenacity that was understated in Sunset. Where Sunrise basks in the warm afterglow of the fading day and the comfortable fabric of young love, and where Sunset is more about two individuals coming to terms with their own lives in relation to each other, Midnight is about the sundering chaos of a binary star system, two supergiants pulling and pushing on each other, bound in an endless dance of growth, destruction, and renewal. Midnight is by far the most intense of the three films; Sunrise is warm, Sunset is cool, and Midnight spans the daring gamut from lukewarm comfort into a nuclear firestorm. Sunrise is all about possibility, where these two people might ever go. Sunset is about evaluation, the strange and complicated states they're suspended in. Midnight is about both the past and the future, looking to both with remorse and hopefulness, and not with the intellectual and emotional curiosity of Sunset but with pinned resignation and patience and pity and an entirely different kind of hope.\r Before Midnight is a powerful film. In comparison (and by no means diminishing the potency of the other two films),Sunrise is a carefree frolic through the grass, Sunset is a careful dance of courtship between two experienced partners, and Midnight is a  bare knuckle brawl of devastating emotional honesty that is only possible between two people who have known each other for so many years and therefore possess the arsenal to really hurt both their partners and themselves. It is the biggest film of the three in scope; it introduces what may almost amount to a supporting cast, and in the first act, I almost feared that the focus of the film had unraveled a bit. But by the halfway point, we have returned to the relationship at the core of this (so far) trilogy. But it also spans the largest portion of the emotional gamut; it doesn't deal as heavily in the ethereal idealism of the first film or the calculated sophistication of the second, but runs all the bases and spreads further outward and onward, exploring new emotions and histories and anything else that's ripe for the picking. Midnight is also the funniest of the three; with cruelty there is the merciful counterbalance of humor, made all the more wry and sharper by the irony and acridity that surrounds it.\r There is little else to say about what Midnight accomplishes without ruining the film. This is by far the most plot-dependent of the three films (though still not very), and there are emotional surprises to be had along the way. It is the most beautiful of the three films, especially in its opening act, and especially in a scene filmed at a group dinner that uses light so expertly and beautifully that it is numbing in its sheer visual skill.\r It is also the messiest of the films. Sunset remains the closest of the three to perfection. Sunrise had some of the unsteady hand of a young auteur, but Midnight sometimes strays by way of its own ambition, a quality that the first two, especially Sunrise were too cool to have. It lacks the almost calculated efficiency of Sunset but is a more daring film, one that renews my love of these two souls, one that has me counting the days until we may revisit their lives again",

I was floored and thought about both of these movies for a few days after. Considering how much I enjoyed Linklater's other films (Slacker, Waking Life, Scanner Darkly), I don't know how I missed these.\r Luckily, I didn't have to wait 9 years to see Before Midnight... because it's easily the best in the series.\r Throughout the first two films, you see a romantic relationship blossom, but they are not without complications and turmoil. Remember the mystic in the first one? How they both had a different impression and had a minor fight over it? This trend clearly grows in their relationship over time, as Before Midnight isn't the idyllic paradise we might expect. Within the first 10 minutes, a minor fight breaks out. Through the course of the film, tensions grow. This isn't without charming moments where we see romance and love, but it's not the near perfect encounters we're used to.\r While the film breaks our expectation, it also simultaneously meets it perfectly. We may be jarred by the change of tone, but through its honesty and brutality, the story that's delivered is nothing short of perfect. The arc that we see Celine and Jesse take is convincingly real and compelling, sad and happy, heartbreaking and heartwarming.\r Celine acts crazy and Jesse acts distant, and both have their valid and invalid concerns, desires, and complaints. Some may argue that Celine acts unreasonable, but this isn't a story about a perfect life. It's a story about a real one. Sometimes, people act unreasonable, unable to express themselves coherently, and raising their hackles in defense at any opposition. It may take a couple days and viewings to totally understand and see all the layers involved in this couple's life, but that understanding is rewarded when the whole thing comes together and you see both sides clearer than either of the characters do.\r If this ends up being the final chapter in this story, it would be a fitting end. This series is beautiful and honest, and shouldn't be missed. Before Midnight stands, in my mind, as the best of the trilogy.",

What follows that initialStarting with Before Sunrise in 1995, the Before Trilogy has been the perfect anti blockbuster saga that depicts the lives of two people who just happen to find each other sitting on a train heading to Vienna. What follows that initial meeting is nothing short of magical. Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and his wife Celeste (Julie Delpy) and their twin girls are vacationing at a writers retreat in Greece and for their last night they have been treated to a night exploring a small Greek town together, one that highlights each of their insecurities, hopes, dreams and inner most thoughts, thoughts that could bring this epic romance to an end. Before Midnight seems like an apt conclusion to this revelatory series as it is not only the best of the bunch but it's surely one of the best films of the year. The film doesn't shy away from the fears and relationship problems that hit people in their forties as they re-examine their lives. Midnight is the darkest of the three films but that only adds to the experience as the film exhibits a wealth of emotion established over three days of these peoples lives. A cracking romp, it's funny, intelligent and never once leaves you questioning what time it is. Even for someone unclear of Jesse and Celeste's history, Before Midnight is a detailed and personal film written by people who love these characters and want as many other people to do so too. The main reason its works as a film is because it involves you in a persons life that almost everyone can relate to in some way or another as Jesse comments on social dynamics and Celeste complains about the vulgarity of men you can associate with them in a way few films manage. As the film draws to a close the film leads into an anti-establishment climax as these characters shift and respond to things in a beautiful and painfully real way. While everything comes crashing down for these two you might see something you didn't want to see in yourself or you might glance upon the films ending and feel a glimmer of hope for these two and maybe by extension yourself.",

Once more Richard Linklater make us explore the meaning of the true love and the difficulties that life can bring us with love, he achieved to direct a wonderful movie by presenting the beautiful places of Greece. The screenplay is absolutely amazing and very realistic, Richard Linklater, Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke achieved to present to us with their screenplay the meaning of true love and how their magical romance that we saw in Before Sunrise and in Before Sunset concludes to a usual marriage with its own problem that many people deal with in their daily life and they still struggling to find back their true love that they may have lost during their marriage. The cast of the movie is one more time excellent, Julie Delpy is better than any other time, she gives a flawless performance that should lead her to the Academy Awards. Ethan Hawke is also very good in his role and the rest of the cast did a great job, especially the great (well know for her movies back in '60s in Greece) Xenia Kalogeropoulou gives a sweet, touching performance that will remain in our memories. The soundtrack is also amazing, the song ''Gia ena tango'' sung by Haris Alexiou (one of the best singers in Greece) gives a sweet melody to the movie. Now, i can say that the trilogy (Before Sunrise,Before Sunset,Before Midnight) is the best trilogy ever made. Before Midnight totally deserves an Oscar nomination for Best Adapted Screenplay and a nomination for Best Leading Actress (Julie Delpy) and why not a nomination for Best Motion Picture. It is difficult to believe that the love story of Jesse and Celine ends with that movie, because these movies taught us many true things, like that even a romance that we think that it could only exist in movies, it can become a usual story like the marriages we meet every day with its own problems, but also with its own moments of happiness and with this movie we can understand the meaning of true love and the meaning of the family. To sum up, we have cried and we have felt the moments of happiness of the romance of Jesse and Celine and we hope that in another 9 years we will see another movie of their love and their family.",

This third installment is surely more dramatic and closer to a 'regular movie.' There's lots of walking and talking (and driving and talking) in long long long takes, which I love, but there are also quite a few other characters in an earlier scene, which I enjoyed, and quite a fight between the two main characters, which I enjoyed, but which also made the film feel a little less of a piece with the prior two. I'm just mentioning qualities, not saying they were better or worse.\r But I have criticism. The film ends too abruptly. The previous film ended abruptly, but it was perfect as it marked a huge turning point. This fim ended merely in the eye of the storm, not at a truly significant moment. They created a bigger movie than they had space for, and one that didn't fit the walking/talking near real-time conceit of the series. But rather than follow through on that very different film, giving it what it  needed on its own terms, they merely cut it short to keep in step with the series' style. Not satisfying for me. I just got hints of the movie they restrained themselves from actually making.\r Also, in Before Sunrise the two had just met; in Before Sunset they saw each other for the first time since that one-day affair in Before Sunrise. BUT in this film they've been together steadily for nine years and yet it doesn't feel that way. Yes there's the ex-wife and his son. But it didn't feel authentic. It felt put on. Either the writing didn't get at it well, or the acting didn't bring it across, or a little of both. I've been with my wife for one year, and I could make a gesture or utter a phrase that would have no meaning for anyone else, but she would know exactly what that phrase or gesture was about, and respond accordingly. There was none of that in this movie. Everything, including all the stuff going to the history of the past 9 years with this couple, was spelled out too much. When you do that the audience understands, but does not believe. You lose authenticity.\r I've seen this done well in films. A gesture or suggestion or word, evokes a response that the audience does not comprehend in granular literal detail, but they get the KIND of thing that's going on. That he has struck a nerve going to some past indiscretion of hers. Or she has said a key word that brings on an old guilt trip he's had laid on him by her time and again. When it is not all spelled out in expository fashion, but we get the gist, that works better. It feels more real. The first two movies did not have to handle this issue because the couple had no history that we had not seen on screen. This one should have handled the issue, but it didn't. So my suspension of disbelief was not quite as complete. Granted this is a nitpicky detail, but it can mark the difference between a good movie or good actor, and great movie or great actor. This film fell squarely on the \"good\" side of the fence, not the \"great\" partly for this reason.\r My other criticism goes to the sex. Yes sex. I have nothing against sex scenes normally. Angelina Jolie and Mr. Bandares in the DVD version (not the screen version) of that movie where she plays a mail order bride, naked and grinding explicitly on the bed while the camera watches from above? Go to it, I say! But this movie is very different and it did not work. The two are going to have a fight so, I imagine in order to make the fight seem like a bigger change and more dramatic, they put the two into a very cozy romantic situation just before the fight. And that situation involves Ethan sucking on Julie's breasts, her nipples. Not suggested or simulated but Mr. Hawke gets down and dirty right in front of your face, sucking, pulling, and basically giving any infant in the audience a tutorial on basic survival skills.\r This failed to generate that cozy warm feeling of intimacy for me as a viewer. Instead it made me feel uncomfortable, as if I was getting TMI and was a third wheel in the room and should leave them alone. So I'm sitting their squirming and clearing my throat (hoping they'll notice I'm there and stop) rather than feeling the warm cozy intimacy they are feeling. I just kept thinking, these two actors are friends in real life, good friends but still, they are just friends. Which makes this sooooo awkward. And they're continuing to have their chatty chat while this is going on! Which almost makes it hilarious if it wasn't so weird!\r All of this said, I enjoyed the film. It's darker, much more so than than the previous two. It's also a slighter film where a more involved film was called for. But what was on the screen (sans nipple sucking)   though it was not enough  I did enjoy.",

These three things make thought possible. Gravity can be love, caring, attraction, repulsion. Repetition can be cycles, seasons, habits, the basis of truth, waves. And energy can be any kind of energy.\rAs for the scene at the table, a computer can play chess because chess is math and the language of math is fixed. A computer can't use language like us because language is affixed to being-in-the-world. Computers don't have being-in-the-world. Computers only have energy and repetition.

We all get dragged through our parents\u2019 lives,\u201d says Celine, a Frenchwoman whose raw intelligence is only matched by her impulsive emotions. Jesse, a writer and Celine\u2019s common-law husband, offers this: \u201cIf we were ever going to truly know each other, we\u2019d probably have to get to know ourselves better first.\u201d Jesse and Celine are played by Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy, and they have been for almost 20 years. The characters were first introduced in the charming 1995 romance Before Sunrise, as students who meet on a train and spend the night ambling through Vienna, talking of what is past, or passing, or to come. Nine years later, in Before Sunset, Jesse is giving a reading at Paris\u2019s Shakespeare and Company bookshop, and Celine comes to see him. Another peripatetic conversation follows, but did Jesse miss his plane back to his wife and child in New York? Nine more years and we have an answer in Before Midnight. Jesse and Celine are living in Paris, parents to twin eight-year-old girls. In the long opening scene (all the scenes are long, and perfectly so) Jesse is at the Kalamata airport saying goodbye to his son, who has spent part of his summer vacation with them in southern Greece. There are only a few more scenes in the movie. Jesse and Celine drive back to their vacation spot, a writer\u2019s retreat presided over by a congenial old man. (He\u2019s played by 86-year-old Oscar-winning cinematographer Walter Lassally in his acting debut!) They chat with friends before and during dinner. They walk to a nearby hotel, where their hosts have given them the luxury of a night away from the kids. They have a fight, and in the midst of Jesse\u2019s apology, the movie ends. Will they make it through another nine years? As with real-life couples, no one knows. Writer/director Richard Linklater is no George Lucas, with a carefully (or perhaps not-so-carefully) plotted trilogy of trilogies. He and co-writers Hawke and Delpy make this stuff up as they go. For the fans, it almost makes sense to imagine Jesse and Celine as a couple you\u2019ve lost touch with. With luck, you\u2019ll hear from them again one day, bringing you up to date on their lives. It\u2019s instructive to note, however, that while Before Midnight doesn\u2019t end on a cliffhanging note, it\u2019s also open to interpretation. I think the characters will muddle through into old age together; others will tell you they give the relationship another six months, tops. The characters feel so real that the kind of foibles that might normally be charged to the actor or filmmaker instead feel like faults of the characters. It drove me mad that Jesse always has half his shirt untucked, but apparently that\u2019s just Jesse. And when Celine raises her voice and drops her IQ to tease her mate by pretending to be a bimbo, it made me realize what an actress she is. Almost as good as Julie Delpy. An old woman talks about how the memory of her dead husband was always strongest in the morning, before the sun made it fade. Someone else describes the differing reactions of male and female coma patients upon awakening. In other ways, it\u2019s refreshingly on par. Linklater has a new cinematographer in Christos Voudouris, but the camera still finds ways to unobtrusively jog alongside the protagonists, and it knows when to just be still. Given that more than 10 minutes of the film takes place in the front seat of a car, and at least that much in a smallish hotel suite, Linklater makes great use of minimal space and available light. It all adds up to a wondrous third meeting, with concomitantly higher expectations for the fourth. Some critics have argued that Linklater and company should quit while they\u2019re ahead, but the same was said of the last film, and it\u2019s a good thing that road was not taken. I leave you with two scenes to ponder. In one, the couple playfully contemplates their mortality, calculating how much longer they would have to stay together to match the record of Jesse\u2019s recently deceased grandparents. In another, the fragility of time passing is caught by the rays of the sun, sinking toward the horizon as they watch from a seaside restaurant.",

While theI am a huge fan of Richard Linklater\u2019s \u2018Before\u2019 Films, and the third installment, \u2018Before Midnight\u2019, met my high expectations. We saw the inception of Jesse and Celine\u2019s relationship, and have made a few brief visits ever since. While the first two films flirted with certain romanticism, whether it be chance encounter or the existence of a soul mate, this one was much darker in its approach. It does away with some of the fanciful aspects of a relationship and chooses to engage in some of the harsher sides of it. Yes, the relationship is in jeopardy as Jesse\u2019s (well played by Ethan Hawke) desire to be with his son in the States conflicts with Celine\u2019s opportunity to take a job in government. This is only the beginning, as their conflicts lead to more arguments; and all this ultimately leads to insight into the true state of their relationship. The performances were very naturalistic which is probably one the most defining aspects of these films, the collaboration between Linklater and our two stars (who also co-wrote the script) are spot on; and Julie Delpy has never been better as Celine; she channels an even more manic behavior into the character, this time around. To say that this film is about people talking is only telling a third... no, a tenth of the story. The conversations between our characters were witty, absorbing and gives great perspectives into the complexities of love and marriage. Jesse and Celine\u2019s now troubled relationship started from the page, and with that said the screenplay was simply exquisite, and is worthy of at least a nomination next Oscar season. This is a fine film that (possibly) concludes an excellent trilogy.",

But it is the dialogue that captures the audience and makes the film so worthwhile. The actors really do become their characters and though it might seem tedious on paper, the watching of these verbal exchanges is as engrossing and captivating as any action or musical film might seek to achieve.

Nine years later in \u201cBefore Sunset\u201d Jesse, now a married man, has written a best selling book about that evening with Celine, and is in Paris on a book tour. They had lost contact with each other and now 9 years later Celine comes to the Parisian  bookstore where he is making an appearance, and Jesse doesn\u2019t make the plane he was suppose to leave on and they spend the day and evening walking and talking in Paris. We learn that he is now married and has a son while she is an environmentalist with a boyfriend she doesn\u2019t see very often. The ending is ambiguous and there wasn\u2019t talk of a third film.\r This film in the series opens with Jesse taking his son Hank to the airport after the latter spent the summer with Jesse, Celine and their twin daughters. It has been 18 years since they first met and are now a couple living together, Jesse having divorced his wife, continued his career as a writer while Celine is being tempted by a job which she thinks she could get involved in. Jesse is thinking about he and Celine returning to America so he could be closer to his son but hasn\u2019t discussed it with her yet.\r There are three outstanding scenes that will stay with you with the first being when Celine and Jesse are at a dinner, given by the host of the writer\u2019s retreat that they had spent the summer, and their friends. The talk among the six touches a bit on the couple\u2019s problems but what lies underneath comes out later. One of the couples, as a present, leased a hotel room and a massage for two and volunteered to sit the twins. The second outstanding scene is the walk through town that  Jesse and Celine take to the hotel. It is the scene that evening in the hotel where they, especially Celine, go at each other that makes the film. It is the accumulation of their life together and what makes it work and what is pulling it apart.\r In this chapter in the story Ethan Hawke shines like he has never in any other picture including the two prequels to \u201cBefore Midnight\u201d. Whereas Julie Delpy seemed to be the center of the Sunrise and Sunset movies Hawke walks away with this one though each gets equal time and Delpy spends time exposing her breasts in the most natural way.\r The director Richard Linklater, who also wrote the screenplay with Hawke and Delpy, draws us into the film, let\u2019s us see that the couple really love each other but have problems as most couples do. The Greek Peloponnese peninsula  looks as romantic as it should be adding to the feel of the movie. Will there be a fourth film in 2022 so we can see if this couple will live happily ever after or?",

Not as good as its predecessors, Midnight is so talky that one wishes at times that someone would take a breath. Basically consisting of five major scenes, the airport and car journey sequences see the film off to a promising start only to have it falter in the next, a dinner, which is without question the worst part of the film. Negative reaction sets in here due to bad supporting actors and irritating writing which, whilst trying to be profound one moment and frivolous the next, is just annoying. The heart of the film takes place in a hotel room where disappointments, criticism and recriminations come to the fore. It is in this approximately 40 minute sequence that the film really comes alive demonstrating that despite all attempts to the contrary long term relationships do become jaded and always need to be worked on. Delpy and, especially, Hawke excel here. They inhabit their characters like a second skin and Midnight rises to the expected level which the first hour fails to attain.",

I followed them from their first meeting 20 years ago and I am still not tired with them. As I expected, this instalment is a great movie, both as stand-alone and as the third part of the series.\r In this chapter, Jesse and Celine deal with the inevitable problems and disappointments of approaching middle age. They are both still very attractive and well-articulated, but now they carry the burden of responsibilities and are starting to consider the idea of their final demise.\r This time they walk and talk in Greece, during the last day of a six-week holiday.  Their first conversation takes place while they drive back to their friend's house. They talk about the burden of parenthood, work problems and relocating to the US. No flirting, but still excellently executed. The second long conversation is at dinner, with their friends. It touches several subjects, among which the different perception of love, according to your age. Since the age of their friends varies from early 20s to late 60s, the conversation is very compelling.\r Then Jesse and Celine walk to their hotel, where their friends insisted they stay to get one night of privacy and romance. We understand clearly that nowadays they hardly ever have conversations that are not utilitarian, which makes the situation very realistic. Once they reach the hotel, drama ensues in the shape of a major argument.\r Anybody who quarrelled with a loved one will undoubtedly admire the skilled way in which the argument is presented: the anger about trivial matters, the resentment about past events, the illogical change of topics\u2026. During this exchange their national idiosyncrasies are exploited in a subtle, yet funny way (Celine cannot pronounce an English word, etc\u2026). But no matter how bad things get with them, I still hope they will stick together and will transform their passionate love into a mature feeling.",

The triad of Linklater, Delpy and Hawke will present us a most satisfactory delight delving into these two soul mates\u2019 current states of mind.\r Again tracing a one-day journey of the couple in their last day of their summer getaway in Southern Greece, in the morning, they see off Jesse\u2019s son Hank in the airport, who has to return to his mother, Jesse\u2019s ex-wife, which aggravates Jesse\u2019s paternity guilt for being absent in most of Hank\u2019s life, elicits an idea to move back to USA with the entire family, while they\u2019re driving back from the airport, the discord occurs when C\u00e9line rebuffs the connotation of the unscheduled idea, and a time-bomb is ticking, the first long take in the car signals as a gambit to re-ignite the audience members\u2019 coveted interest in their love story.\r Under the magnificent scenery of this ancient land, their farewell lunch with friends carries a casual spirit but the small talk is overflowing with engaging and emotively touching insights about love from different ages and experiences, Jesse and C\u00e9line are mainly listeners, but Delpy manage to pull off a splendid ad lib mimics a brainless bimbo flirting with Jesse the writer and talking about Romeo and Juliet, so hilarious and this is a patina when they are surrounded with other people.\r Later, they leave their daughters to friends and head to a hotel since they are treated to have a private evening in a hotel to culminate their last night there (with a couple massage coupon), clearly it is a god-given opportunity for them to express real thoughts without the interference of their children. Meandering in the town, everything is like deja vu, they are like two people deeply in love with each other and the sexual attraction is simmering when they reach the room, but their carnal engagement is interrupted by a pivotal call from Hank, their following t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate turns sours when C\u00e9line bickers about her sacrifice in the relationship and the frustration of parenting, utters discontent and spurns the prospect of moving to USA, meanwhile Jesse appears to be the calm one, but his passive-aggressive strategy fails to appease her and they begin to blame faults to each other, until C\u00e9line storms out and leaves the deal-breaker  I don\u2019t love you anymore\u201d. From convivial to acrid, it is so spot-on in everyman\u2019s world, then the ending plays a nice trick on the ambivalent possibilities of their future, fingers-crossed a fourth one will come another 9 years later and it will be worth the wait.\r Thumbs up to both Hawke and Delpy\u2019s scintillating acting, their resounding rapport and flawless two-hander should have earned some serious awards recognition apart from their effervescent script, good luck for a third time, Delpy could be a dark horse to bag a BEST LEADING ACTRESS nomination, and she is also French, Oscar voters, remember?",

Midnight has a more realistic look to it. In terms of the picture, it is not better or worst looking than the first two, it is just different--intentional different, I think.\r This is the best written film. The most romantic, I think. It was easy for the two characters to fall in love in the first movie. They were young, experimental, and free. In the second movie, they have been disappointed by love, but the desire was still there and the biggest huddle they had to leap was the institute of marriage. This movie may seem depressing and full of hateful speech, but these are my arguments that this is the most romantic movie of all three.\r 1. Celine is trying to make herself fall out of love with Jessie, and she is trying to make Jessie fall out of love with her. She says at one point that Jessie bread does not have the same color it had when he was young. If you remember, she mentioned in sunrise that this was one of her favorite physical feature of him. In her mind, she is trying to construct arguments that would let her reach the conclusion that she does not love him anymore. This is one of her arguments to herself. Jessie rebutted. Then she tries to argue that Jessie hinders her spirit to be a strong independent women. Jessie rebutted. However, leaving France is the one thing Celine will not do. This is not because she hates the United States so much. It is because, by going back to America, to Celine, Jessie admitting that he made a mistake nine years earlier. Celine does not want their love and their life and their children to be a mistake in Jessie's mind. This is why she does not let Jessie talks to her son on the phone, she would like to avoid the topic altogether, but it is eating away at him.\r 2. What is in question is not the fact that they love each other and that they want to be together, it is the fact that they are facing the biggest huddle in their relationship: \"I **** up my whole life because of you.\" That is not what a women wants to hear, but in respects to his son, that statement is absolutely true. He choose Celine over his family back in America. Celine knows it is true, and she knows it does not means Jessie does not love her, but the only way she will admit it ( \"it\" being the fact that She and her daughters are Jessie's biggest mistake and biggest regret in regards to his son). How does a mother admit that her children and herself is a father's mistake, well she has to convince herself that she does not love him.\r Of course this is art, and many other possible explanations of this movie are plausible. However, when I first seen the movie I felt the same way as many other fans. I felt like it was dark, and depressing, and I felt Celine was being unreasonable harsh. But if we were to truly ponder what Jessie is asking Celine to do, the fact that she is even considering it, is a testament to how strong and powerful their love is and has always been. This is the most romantic movie because the huddle they have to jump to maintain their love  is taller than it was in the first two movies.\r A few comments on the ending. Yes, as one user suggested, it ended in \"the eye of the storm.\" I'm not sure that is a bad thing. However, the last conversation I felt was very important. Did Celine surrender? I think when she broke into the character of the \"stupid, simple girl\" that Jessie is suppose to want, it represented the most heartbreaking moment of the series. Heartbreakingly sad, or heartbreakingly romantic. This movie gives you the chance to pick. Best Three American romance movies ever.\r How did 12 Years a Slave win best screenplay? Go pick up a history book and read, you will have the same experience as watching 12 years a Slave--beautiful looking movie, but no new twist to the same story. That is another issue.",

And she's on fire! Poor Ethan Hawke. He can barely hold his own and keep stride with her. Delpy reminds us why old-school feminist rage is still so important and relevant. And even though Hawke is a loyal, easy-going stay-at-home dad, he still believes fairies will wipe his pee off the toilet seat.\r I saw this movie last night in a budget cinema in a working-class neighbourhood. I heard men laugh triumphantly after Hawke would sensitively and rationally, as he put it, scold Delpy. He saw anger as a negative. She saw it as a necessity. She was inspired when her children demonstrated outbursts of anger. But Hawke has the privilege of being content. Women in the audience didn't laugh quite as hard when Delpy counter-scolded Hawke.\r Two covered Islamic girls sat beside me and from their laughter I could tell they enjoyed and even related to the gender and cultural conflicts waged between the two characters. (There was an sufficient amount of American-bashing from Ms. Delpy.) But did they agree with Delpy's feminist thesis? Were they prepared to stand up to their religious and patriarchal authority figures in their household and in their community at large? Would they take to the streets and burn their hijabs along with their bras? Or was the message ironic to them? A cautionary tale of a western woman's stubborn but doomed battle for equality?\r And after 50 years and counting, I wonder.",

Without any surprise we attend to another particular movie. As in the prequel we follow Jesse and C\u00e9line wandering while questioning each other, showcasing their numerous reflections about their lives, their children, their first encounter and their strange romance story.They are way more mature than before, more adults in a certain way and we can feel what it costs to be that way. They remain touching as always and it is almost impossible not to feel empathy for them. But what is new in their story is that we witness their respective limits. We see them cross what seems to be a major crisis. While watching them fight for what seemed like an hour to me was quite disturbing and uncomfortable, I can admit that it helps shape their identity as a couple and as two distinct people. I also disliked the fact that this opus was more focus on sex than the others.If I found the ending very easy and kind of pathetic the succession of events leading to it remains very interesting. With this trilogy we followed two characters more developped than many other movie characters. Amazing. It clearly deserves its 'Must see' label according to me.",

However, it is still a thoughtful watch and it has a nice tone to it, as did the other 2 films. Its not especially overly sentimental, its a philosophical watch of sorts but this one features more in the way of arguments/disagreements. Its disappointing to see how Jesse and Celine have become, disillusioned I suppose. However, the script is certainly decent and I enjoyed the scenes showcasing the Greek oudoors - its a lovely setting and the characters have plenty to talk about, its just not as perhaps romantic or hopeful as in previous films, which is part of what I liked about them. It seems weird to say that, in as much as I wouldn't think of myself as an especially big romantic film fan as such. However, it wouldn't be fair to say there's no positive side at all present in this film but I won't elaborate, so as not to provide any spoilers. Its not entirely a simple plot line but its still a good watch. I especially enjoyed the scene featuring the two main characters and (I assume) friends and relatives around a dinner table outdoors, enjoying a (I assume) Greek lunch while discussing a number of interesting topics. It manages to be quite an atmospheric watch, as the previous 2 films were and indeed I liked the Greek music played while the credits rolled.If your a fan of the previous 2 films then I would recommend this but if your not especially keen on dialogue focused films then you may be better to leave this.",

The acting was incredibly superb, and out of all the three films, this one has the most powerful performance from the two main casts. The production design was great, and the cinematography captivates the viewers with its beautiful shots of southern Greece. The writing was a bit jumpy, as the story goes forward in time and leaves the viewers imagining and guessing what happened in between, and there are little bits of lost info. But overall, this film is definitely the best in the series so far, and I always thought that Richard Linklater could not top the first film anymore. Additional props to the soundtrack.",

As does Jesse's success and artistic career, a topic explored interestingly here in ways that most likely reflect the lives of all the creators and actors involved.We see their pragmatism as a couple, we see their family, we see their connection and we see their disdain and their evolution as people. But only at the end do we see both their hate and their love, often two sides of the same coin for long-term couples. Their love is still there, it's just shifted and adapted to their new lives with all the challenges they now have.I always likes this movie but never connected to it previously, I thought the end was sad, deeply sad, how could two people who love each other say these things to each other? Or feel this way without a total collapse of their relationship? But now, being in a committed, long-term relationship with someone in their 40's, I know that ending well. Besides La La Land, Before Midnight has the most realistic couple fight I've ever seen, it ebbs and flows, and that entire segment harks back to Linklater's little-seen experiment Tape. It's a deep, deep character study and I hope dearly that they make another one and commit to film another era in two people's lives that we rarely see with this clarity and honesty.",
