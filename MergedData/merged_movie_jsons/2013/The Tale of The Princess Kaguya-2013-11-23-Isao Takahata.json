            "content": "The Tale of Princess Kaguya was certainly a story that I was fully intrigued with. Because of its limited release in theaters, it wasn't easy trying to find it, but when I finally caught it at a local art house theater, I was further interested in the story that had yet to unfold. Since it was based on the centuries-old Japanese folktale, I know it has been told differently many times by various writers in literature, theater, even film. Nevertheless, I had to check out Studio Ghibli's take on the classic story.It's about an elder bamboo cutter named Okina who discovers a young, tiny girl in a bamboo shoot and decides to adopt her as his own along with his loving wife Ona. As years progress, the tiny girl begins to grow rapidly to normal size like the other children of their village, eventually having to leave since her adoptive parents decide to have her raised among the nobles. From there, she is given the name \"Princess Kaguya\" and things become further complicated when so much is offered to her so suddenly.When comparing this movie to past Studio Ghibli efforts, it's obvious that the animation style is nothing like its preceding films. And with studio founder Hayao Miyazaki having stepped down and no involvement with this current project, I have to say it's a drastic, yet vibrant change in what Studio Ghibli is widely known for. I loved the story and it had an ending that was rather heartwarming and enough to tug anyone's heartstrings. With the English dub voice of Kaguya done gracefully by Chloe Grace-Moretz (Let Me In, Carrie, If I Stay), she actually stands out well as the title character, like it wasn't forced. The animation technique was rather intricate, but it was reminiscent of an old Japanese art painting I've once studied about in Art History classes at my local college. American animation studios have believed traditional 2-D to be a dying art form in the film industry these days, but I can tell Japan does not acknowledge it in that way at all, whether it's TV or film. The concept I started believing for the entire film felt like \"a timeless painting\" and it's quite a stroke of genius, in my opinion.The music and underscore of Joe Hisaishi has left me engaged that it flows evenly well with the scenes as they play out. But most notably, director Isao Takahata really stepped up following his involvements with titles like \"Kiki's Delivery Service,\" \"My Neighbor The Yamadas,\" and even the touching \"Grave of the Fireflies.\" This entire movie has earned its rightful place in the Studio Ghibli library. This is another example of a Ghibli film where you don't have to be an avid Japanese Anime fan to enjoy it, what matters is that such themes existed in various genres, not just in one medium or one genre alone.",

            "content": "One of Studio Ghibli's last feature films before the legendary animation studio went on an indefinite break, The Tale of the Princess Kaguya is Isao Takahata's first picture in over 15 years and happens to be an eloquently narrated, gorgeously animated & patiently paced cinema that attempts to bring on screen one of the oldest tales in Japanese folklore.The Tale of the Princess Kaguya tells the story of its titular character who was found in a bamboo shoot by a bamboo cutter who, believing her to be a divine presence, brings her home to his wife. Although this mysterious tiny girl grows rapidly into a young lady, dazzling all who encounters her, she eventually is left with no alternative but to confront her own fate.Co-written & directed by Isao Takahata (best known for Grave of the Fireflies), this tale is crafted with precision care & elegance plus how all of it is animated brings an artistic vibe of its own. The use of colour palette, sketch-like animation & minimalist approach leaves a lasting impression, the voice performances are spot-on while Joe Hisaishi's score nicely compliments the whole narrative.The Tale of the Princess Kaguya also covers the various restraints women find themselves in every facet of life, no matter what society they happen to be part of, and exposes that without preaching. However, its 137 minutes of runtime feels a tad too long, the final act is stretched, and although its creativity is undeniably impressive, the whole story kind of lacks that immersive element, much like Takahata's earlier works.On an overall scale, The Tale of the Princess Kaguya brims with some truly astonishing images and is another winning marvel from the acclaimed studio. It's aesthetically pleasing, artistically fulfilling & emotionally gripping and there are going to be many who will have nothing but endless praise for the manner in which this ancient Japanese folklore is illustrated on the film canvas. As for me, I do admire a number of things about Takahata's latest but don't feel any love for it. Still, I've no qualms in recommending it to anyone for it is worthy of a broader audience.",

            "review_title": "A Triumph",
            "content": "With the exception of the energetic The Lego Movie, this year has been a disappointment for the animated genre. What a relief then it is that Isao Takahata's (Grave of the Fireflies) new film is a triumphant success. Based on a 10th century Japanese folktale, The Tale of Princess Kaguya is a bittersweet coming of age story. Our protagonist is Kaguya-hime who is discovered as a baby in a bamboo stalk by an old peasant man. He and his childless wife raise her as their own, providing the best they can as she rapidly ages. While her mother is fearful of change and just wants a comfortable life for her adopted daughter, her father envisions great things. He sees Kaguya as part of a divine plan and after fine clothes and gold come shooting out of bamboo stalks he concludes that the heavens want her to become a proper princess. He assumes this is the best way to make his daughter happy instead of asking her what she wants. A sharply observed feminist critique of traditional Japanese culture as well as a cautionary tale of the burdens we place on our children, The Tale of Princess Kaguya has a wealth of complex themes and archetypes hidden beneath the surface of its fairly straight- forward story. This is one of the rare films that are both easily accessible to a young audience and one that film students can write thesis papers on. The final word should be reserved for Studio Ghibli's animation. The style used invokes something between impressionist paintings and water-colours while employing a muted palette. Ghibli moves away from traditional anime and the results are breathtaking. The hand drawn frames could each stand alone as a portrait and yet the film feels fluid. At times the animation blurs into expressionism; the brush strokes matching the characters inner- turmoil. Easily the best animated film of the year, it's a must see for fans of the genre. Luckily North America will get a theatrical release; the English-dubbed version will be out October 17 and will star Chloe Grace Moretz as Kaguya.",

            "content": "I liked this to a good extent, and my rating goes up because of the last 15 minutes, which are so magnificent. Those last several minutes and the first act are truly brilliant, but for some reason, the film sort of lost me in its middle and a little more than that. Not completely lost me, but it did get a little too much and it got to less interesting overall. I can't say I completely agree with the critical acclaim it's gotten, but I think it's a good, sometimes very good, film, definitely made stronger because of certain scenes. The sound mixing here is incredible, and the voice acting (in its original language) is pretty fantastic as well. Overall, still recommended but with reservations, yeah.",

            "content": "I've already watched this film 3 times! I was deeply moved and couldn't stop crying every time.I believe that \"Princess Kaguya\" is the best Ghibli film in the past 10 years because of the beautiful hand-drawn animation and touching story.Japanese audience and critics are also very positive for this film, compared to other Ghilbi films.Hayao Miyazaki is a genius but his recent films are always controversial since \"Haul's Moving Castle\".One of the reason is that he relies on his imagination and makes light of a script. That's why quite a few people can't fully understand his recent films and sometimes blame them. (\"The Wind Rises\" was a tragedy in this meaning.)Isao Takahata, the director of \"Princess Kaguya\", is a very good director known for \"The Grave of Firefly\" but not so active since \"My neighbor the Yamada\". His philosophy is very different from that of Hayao Miyazaki. Isao Takahata thinks the scenario is very important and he prefers realism to fantasy. \"Princess Kaguya\" is based on the Japanese oldest folklore \"The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter\". But Isao Takahata transforms it into a universal humanistic story by describing Princess Kaguya as a realistic girl.This film contains many fantastic scenes and they play as good eye candies. But the brilliantly illustrated life and emotions of the heroine is the most important part in this film. And that's what the director wants us to try to sympathize.The beautiful and artistic style of this animation is suitable for this theme. Because this apparently unfinished animation gives us the room to imagine by ourselves.Isao Takahata says, \"The animations tend to deprive children of their own imagination by pushing them someone else's fantasy. We have to make another animation which let them imagine by themselves\".I can't wait to see the responses from the worldwide audience! Hope you will like this film too!",

            "review_title": "It looks lovely",
            "content": "\"The Tale of Princess Kaguya\" is a very, very familiar story in Japan. It's from a story that is a thousand years old, \"The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter\". And, since it's a classic, there have been many movie versions of the story. Because of this, I was quite familiar with this, as I'd already seen \"Princess From the Moon\"--a 1987 live-action version. Unlike the other six versions of the story that I was able to find, this one is animated and it comes from Studio Ghibli--the same people who make the Miyazaki films, though this one is from Isao Takahata.For the most part, the story you see in the film is the old tale. One day, a poor woodcutter slices into a stalk of bamboo and finds a beautiful thumb-size child. Since he and his wife are childless and have always wanted one, they are overjoyed with the discovery and raise the child. However, the same fortune that brought them the baby also rewarded them with gold when the woodcutter chopped additional bamboo. And, oddly, the child grows to normal size and becomes a lady in practically no time at all. Soon they are rich and able to give their girl the life of a princess and she's taught all manners and customs that a proper lady would need. However, it's obvious that young Princess Kaguya isn't happy in this life, as courtier after courtier come for her hand and she simply isn't interested. So, she gives them impossible tasks to complete before she'd agree to marry any of them. When they all fail, the Emperor himself comes to court her but she rebuffs him--mostly because she knows her time on Earth is drawing to a close. Where all this goes next, you'll find out if you watch the movie.The animation for this movie is quite lovely--with a nice look that appears as if the film was made with colored pencils and watercolors. While it's more minimalistic than you'd usually find in a Ghibli film, it looks very appropriate to the Medieval Japanese period. In fact, the look of the film is the best thing about the movie. The story, as you probably noticed above, is odd--especially to non-Japanese audiences. The ending, is even odder, by the way. But the film still could have worked despite the unusual story. However, I found the pacing to be too slow and I noticed my attention waning from time to time. Not surprisingly, it's the longest film released by Ghibli to date. Had they trimmed about 15 to 20 minutes and removed the plot involving the poor boyfriend (which was not in the original story), I think the film would have worked better for me. Worth seeing for a very patient audience who is looking for something very different--otherwise a strange sort of picture that probably would offer little appeal to kids and folks wanting something light and Disney-like.By the way, although I was not bowled over by this film, it has been nominated for the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature. My vote is for \"The Box Trolls\"...a film which managed to combine both artistry and an excellent original story.",

It's probably the most beautiful movie I've ever seen and it is equally as good, if not even better as spirited away and princess mononoke. The story is wonderfully told and it has some extremely sad moments. But probably the best thing about this movie is the breath taking animation. It's just incredibly beautiful and just so unique that you just won't forget it. As always for a Ghibli movie the movie has an eye for detail and you just feel the passion which was put into this movie. This movie was one of the best anime I have ever seen and probably also one of the best movies I have ever seen.",

            "review_title": "animation of the decade",
            "content": "The animation masterpiece of the decade. Takahata is going out on top. The fabled north American distribution deal between Disney and Studio Ghibli (apparently) applies only to the works of Myazaki; north American distribution of this is being handled by GKIDS. So the heavyweight marketing of Pixar/Disney isn't behind it. But don't be fooled by its \"art-house\" distribution or its relative obscurity - this is a really big deal.It's an \"epic\", having taken eight years to produce and clocking in at well over two hours. I haven't seen the words \"production committee\" in credits since 'Akira' - that means it was too big for any one normal producer, so several companies had to form a \"consortium\": Studio Ghibli itself, a TV network, a foreign corporation, a movie studio, and three others. And the animation work itself was so large that parts of it were farmed out to _nine_ other studios.There are two versions: an English dub of the soundtrack with most things written in English characters (although in general dubs suck, animation is often an exception); and a Japanese soundtrack with written English subtitles and most things (including virtually all the credits) written in Japanese characters. If the names of the voice actors you hear sound vaguely familiar, that's the English dub version. In fact, if you're viewing this in a theater, unless the theater is pretty sophisticated, you won't even have a choice - you'll see only the English dub version. And that's okay.You get what you're used to from Studio Ghibli: powerful and independent women characters, a strong bond with the natural world, seamless switches back and forth between reality and fantasy, rootedness in tradition and folklore, and the music of Joe Hisaishi. Add to that some themes I associate specifically with Takahata: portrayals of \"reality\" even when it's quite sad, nostalgia, an acceptance and open portrayal of the concept of the \"cycle of life\", and ambivalence toward tradition and especially patriarchy (respecting and illustrating the good, while at the same time poking fun at the bad). Finally add a new twist I haven't seen in animation before: whole scenes where all the dialog, the visuals, and even the music, point to one interpretation ...only to recast the whole thing in a different light at the end to reach a totally unexpected conclusion.The animation is 2D and very intricate, but still appears hand-drawn. Outlines vary in thickness and density, and colored areas don't always reach exactly to an outline. It could be computer-drawn (as many apparently hand-drawn animations actually are these days) only if the computer made an awful lot of \"mistakes\". Interestingly, the figures and the backgrounds look exactly the same (not different styles of animation as is often the case). It's all colored with pastels. The end result looks somewhat as though 'My Neighbors the Yamadas' had been used as starting sketches which were then finished.I thought my evaluation of \"hand drawn\" was vindicated when a whole screenful of the end credits was occupied with the names of all the in-betweeners. But then just a bit later the whole screen was again filled with one category of names, this time all the digital ink and painters. Sometimes what you'd expect to be computer-generated is in fact clearly hand drawn, as when shadows move just a bit awkwardly between the beginning and the end of a scene. Other times the effect really seems computer-generated, as when a character is seen in a side closeup crashing through vegetation with lots and lots of branches flying much faster than anyone could draw them, or as when there's a cross-fade between scenes. I could never even guess though how it had been done when occasionally I could see what was behind a bit of translucent cloth.",

But not only the scenery was stunning; the characters were drawn in detail, making them look realistic and closer to a real person. The story was nice as well. The description made it look like the story of Thumbelina or something, but it's not. I think it's based on a folklore Japanese tale, but I'm not sure. Still, it was very interesting, and had this rustic vibe, with the moon princess being sent to earth to live among the humans. The fantasy element is there, however, the story contains some real human emotions and situations, with manly the love for the countryside life and the family bond to overpower any other story of romance or magical kingdoms. So, 8 out of 10.",

By using traditional animation (although I need notice some computerize layouts),The Japanese have done it again with their personal approach to the detail of animation you can only get from 2D.Adding to my enjoyment, this English adaption of the film includes the voice talent of Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz as the princess, who I've become a fan of.

The motion picture is not only based on the famous Japanese folktale but also a story about Takahata's own retirement and vision of death. Behind the facade of a girl that grows up to become a princess and eventually leave earth for the moon, is the author's own perceptions about the cycles of life, happiness, disappointments and afterlife. It's also a message about family values, and the lapses of time and age. The tale of princess Kaguya is probably my favorite Ghibli movie visually-wise. The water colors, reminiscent of ancient Chinese ink and brush techniques are masterfully used here, and bring out all the emotions from the movie's main protagonists. It really doesn't get any better than this. From the landscape canvas of rural Japan, to the magnificent character artwork, everything moves fluidly. The story is both hopeful and tragic, and the excellent dialogue adds up to it. The soundtrack from Joe Hisaishi is masterful and the Japanese voice overs are absolutely brilliant. To summarize without giving away too many details, this 140 min animated picture is a masterpiece from all angles, one of Studio Ghibli's finest releases and arguably one of the greatest animated movies ever made.",

            "content": "The first thing to note about this film is the beauty of it. Just about all of the scenes of this film could be viewed in a museum which is saying something itself. If anything, watch the film for the portrayal of a young woman and the amazing visuals.The film begins with a bamboo cutter finding a girl inside the light of a bamboo. The girl grows exponentially and she grows with the plot, going from baby to young adult way quicker than expected.The first portion of the film is concentrated when she is much younger, (around the age of maybe 1-12?). Her playfulness with Sutemaru and the other children is quite an enjoyable portion of the film. As with many of Studio Ghibli's work, especially Totoro, the film is able to portray her life in a way many studios even without animation cannot.The other half is concentrated on her moving to the capital and becoming a princess. Unlike the ideals of films in the US, she does not seem to want to become one, but instead wants to be with Sutemaru and the others. It's a refreshing change from the Disney Princess motif where beauty, richness, and a love is what is needed. Her life is transformed, eventually by Sagami, a lady who turns her into well, a princess. She is eventually approached by suitors and others.I will not mention the ending of the film as well, I wasn't as big a fan of it. The big revelation is as shocking to the audience as it is surprising. I knew of part of the plot through Okami but the way it was portrayed was a little too in your face. The actual ending itself is odd, with many of the people in the theater (at IFC) scratching their heads and thinking, \"That is it and what was that?\" Also, I was wondering when the film was going to end. It slows down to a crawl but then speeds up to such a speed that it almost becomes silly.I also wasn't as a big a fan of the father (Okina) through the later parts of the film. His transformation into a man of power/wealth is a bit too severe and one-sided. I preferred his wife (Oina) as she still shows the love and playfulness of them back in the village.I preferred the plot of the first 4/5ths of the film than the other 1/5th in short. The film is excellent but the plot wears down on itself and by the end, it is harder to care and more think that it is just an odd piece of filming. The movie gets an 8.5...but probably would be closer to an 8 or 7.5 if the graphics/music weren't nearly as amazing as they are. I'm rounding it down for this reason.",

The plot:Chopping bamboo, Sanuki no Miyatsuko a bamboo shoot and finds a baby girl growing inside it! Believing her to be a miracle,Sanuki and his wife decide to raise the girl as their own.Giving her the name \"Princess\" the Miyatsuko's soon find their daughter to grow at an abnormal speed,as she develops a close friendship with Sutemaru,a fellow child in the village.Cutting bamboo one day, Miyatsuko cuts into bamboo shoots of gold. Taking this as a sign that their daughter really is a \"princess\",the parents tear her away from the village,and take her to live in a Palace. Christened with the name Princess Kaguya,Kaguya decides to give all of the men who want her hand in marriage impossible challenges,as Kaguya looks to her past in the nights sky. View on the film:Based on the 10th century Japanese folklore tale The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter,co-writer/(along with Riko Sakaguchi) director Isao Takahata paints the tale with exquisite water colours,giving the title a haunting atmosphere of being a fading memory. Taking the brave step of not filling every inch of the frame with a constant stream of action, Takahata expertly uses space to give the film an extraordinary poetic quality,with the royal ruby colours Kaguya is surrounded by being unable to replace the lush greens and blues of the flowers in Kaguya's former village. Currently the longest movie to come from Studio Ghibli,the screenplay by Takahata & Sakaguchi brilliantly use the time to meditate on the emotional bond Kaguya has to her childhood home,which sails off into a devastating, melancholy final,where Kaguya's parents find their daughter to grow away from them.

            "content": "I can look back to a few experiences that completely changed the way that I watch movies; one of these is the first time that I saw Stanley Kubrick's 1968 masterpiece 2001: A Space Oddysey, which showed me the purest example of film as an art form that I had ever seen. I saw it not too long after I graduated high school and had never experienced a movie that expressed complex and confusing thoughts in the way that it did nor in such a visually stunning way. The film went beyond conventional narrative and filmmaking to deliver something entirely new to me.In a similar manner, The Tale of the Princess Kaguya represents a level of artistry that I had never before seen in an animated feature. From the brilliant mind of Studio Ghibli's lesser-known co- founder Isao Takahata (Grave of the Fireflies, Only Yesterday), the film is an adaptation of Japan's oldest folk tale, The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter. It tells the story of a strange girl (Asakura/Moretz) who is discovered inside a bamboo stalk and who shoots through her childhood at a rapid pace. Her adoptive parents (Chii/Caan, Miyamoto/Steenburgen) bring her into the city, where she is groomed as a noblewoman and comes to be widely sought after for her beauty.The Tale of the Princess Kaguya is simply gorgeous; its visual style combines watercolor painting and charcoal sketching to create something that is entirely its own. Personal and often unnecessary care is given to the smallest details, such as a toddler crawling after a frog or the princess casually putting her hair up. The character and quality of the animation even change with the tone of the story, most noticeably in one instance in which the princess' despair completely overwhelms her. As the world is stripped away and sound is simplified to almost nothing, the scene so perfectly expresses the character's personality and mood and presents such a perfect image of her story that to me, it fully represents the reasons that animation exists as a medium. Because there are no live actors or sets and no real world in which the filmmakers must do their work, the artists are free to fully express themselves as artists, without the constraints of the real world. Rather than use animation to simply bring color to a bland story as many animators are wont to do, the creators here use the deep story and visuals to produce situations and imagery that would otherwise be impossible to create. The movie spends much of its run time grounded firmly in reality \u2013 sometimes uncomfortably so \u2013 but at its most powerful, it extends far beyond what live action can achieve.The film is also thematically rich, particularly exploring the societal roles of Japanese women at the time depicted. When she is no longer allowed to live her simple life around her childhood friends, her life becomes dedicated to presenting herself as beautiful and submissive to the world. She is instructed to sit still and to look pretty, never mind the fact that she is often hidden from view. She is whisked away to be married as soon as she reaches puberty and is told by both the men and women around that a rich husband will be the source of her greatest happiness.Kaguya herself is a wonderful character to watch. She is at times one of the happiest people you could imagine but at others one of the saddest. After all, she started walking over the course of a day and grew into the body of a teenager in less than a year's time. Her innocence is shown as a blessing and a curse, and seeing her interact with the variety of people she encounters provides the film plenty of joy and drama.The Tale of the Princess Kaguya uses the language of cinema in a way that, in my experience watching animation, has been truly special; through blocking of scenes, visual symbolism, color, and much more, the film is able to speak to us beyond its surface narrative and to tell a more robust story. It makes full use of the opportunities unique to animation and combines them with tools of the great live- action masterpieces of the past.The film, for example, often separates the princess from the rest of the world, particularly in scenes in which she is hidden from sight. She is often placed behind a screen or behind bamboo blinds for narrative purposes, but even when these are not present, there is often an element visually keeping her from other characters, such as a bamboo stalk or a tall blade of grass placed between them. While not forming a true wall between the characters, the viewer can see them separated and feel their distance.This film also offers a wonderful experience of sound and silence through the use of its score, which consists of tracks mostly under two minutes long. This allows each moment of music to have its power and meaning, while not overwhelming the viewing experience or directing the viewer along every step of the film's vast emotional landscape. Through contrapuntal folk sounds or delicate solo piano, the film is able to sing its story to us as it shows it and tells it. The musical pieces and the silence between them are given the full attention that they deserve and in turn give us exactly what we need.I cannot recommend this film highly enough. While critical response at its release was overwhelmingly positive, far too few people have heard of it, and even fewer have seen it. The Tale of the Princess Kaguya is a movie that you will never forget and offers an experience not quite like anything else you will ever see.",

            "content": "While I have not seen Song of the Sea yet, from personal opinion The Tale of the Princess Kagua was the best of the nominees. It is a stunning film and, while the Ghibli films since Spirited Away are all worth seeing at least once(with only Tales from Earthsea disappointing somewhat) and as great as Howl's Moving Castle and The Wind Rises are, The Tale of the Princess Kaguya is the best since Spirited Away without being one of Ghibli's very finest.It has and will alienate some viewers though, it is long, goes at a slow pace and elements of the story- for those unfamiliar with the old Japanese folktale it's based on- have gone and will go over people's heads. Neither of those however bothered me at all. The best things about The Tale of the Princess Kaguya are the animation and the music. The animation is just exquisite, Ghibli's best-looking since Spirited Away in which all their films since is the animation's the most consistently good asset of all of them, with everything looking so colourful and delicate and with an animation style quite unique to what's been seen before. Joe Hisaishi's music score is stirring, haunting and beautifully elegiac, it fits perfectly with the film's mood and is a wonderful score on its own, one that is guaranteed to have people rushing to find the CD if available and buy it.The story is divisive but to me it worked just fine. It seems simple structurally but the film does much with it that it doesn't feel simple, what occurs is engaging, thought-provoking and incredibly touching while not trying to make things too complicated. What stood out was the ending, one that was completely unexpected but also one that is beautifully melancholic and emotionally heart-breaking. The Tale of the Princess Kaguya's thoughtfully scripted, has some elements of whimsy and flows well and while the characters are archetypal they still engage. The voice acting is very good, with the Japanese version even better than that. In the English dub, which for this viewer wasn't bored-sounding at all, Chloe Grace Moretz voices with a lot of spirit, James Caan is authoritative and Mary Steenburgen is sympathetic and dignified with her Narrator being the stronger of her two roles.Overall, a stunning film, may alienate some but as seen will captivate most. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

            "content": "Based on the tenth century Japanese folktale, 'The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter' this film opens with a bamboo cutter being attracted to a shining bamboo shoot; suddenly it grows and opens to reveal a tiny person. He rushes home and shows his with; then suddenly the tiny person starts to grow into a normal baby. There is something magical about her; the childless bamboo cutter's wife suddenly starts producing milk and the child, dubbed 'Little Bamboo' by the village children grows at an extraordinary rate as events cause a spurt of instant growth. As she grows she starts befriending the local children and believes she will stay with them forever. However her father has found more mysterious bamboo shoots; one containing gold and another containing exquisite silks; he takes this as a sign that she truly is a princess and uses his newfound wealth to establish himself and his family in the capital. Here, when she comes of age, she is given the name Princess Kaguya. She is trained in the ways of being a princess and powerful admirers who have heard of her great beauty seek her hand in marriage but she yearns for rural friends and sets her suitors impossible tasks. Eventually the Mikado takes an interest in her but again she declines\u0085 she then reveals that in a few days she must return home; not to the bamboo forest but to her true home far, far away.Coming from Studio Ghibli's Isao Takahata it is not surprising that this film is both beautiful to look at and something rather different. The designs, which look like a mix of water colours and charcoal gives the film an ethereal feel that is entirely in fitting with the story. The story is told at a gentle, some might say slow, pace but there are bursts of energy where the animation becomes more chaotic in a way that beautifully captures the energy and emotion of the scenes. The story itself is rather melancholic; the bamboo cutter believes his 'daughter' will have a better life in the capital\u0085 and he certainly enjoys it there\u0085 but she just wants to be with her old friend and has no desire to be a princess. In many ways this makes it the opposite of many western fairy tales were a poor girl finds happiness when she meets her Prince Charming who whisks her off to a life of a princess.In summary; I found this film to be an utter delight\u0085 a lovely but melancholy story that is beautifully told. While the story is suitable for all I suspect the gentle pace and long run time may mean it will be better appreciated by older viewers.These comments are based on watching the film in Japanese with English subtitles.",

It's an emotional ending and the movie doesn't let any of this on until the very end when your defenses are down.Which isn't to say that the point of the movie is to tug at heartstrings It's an exquisite story about innocence, the prison of expectation and a sense of identity.

            "content": "After some questionable ventures, Studio Ghibli returns to its success formula: interesting stories rooted in Japanese folklore, featuring a young girl or woman in the beautiful countryside. Couldn't possibly go wrong with the oldest prose story that probably gave mount Fuji its name.The animation is top notch, the acting is really good - the old man was delicious - and the story is both archetypal and heart breaking. There are some problems with the film though, one of them being the slow development that required more than two hours of film to unfold, as well as the rather uneventful and fractured ending.The story is that of a magical child found in a bamboo stalk. It grows really fast turning into a beautiful girl. The bamboos also offer gold and beautiful clothes, so that the old country couple that found and raised her move her to the capital to turn her into a \"proper lady\". However the ridiculous restrictions and rigid customs bring nothing than unhappiness to the otherwise energetic and nature loving girl. In her desperation she mentally asks for help and she is taken back to the Moon, where she was originally from, to a place of spirits, light, but no life or emotions, only purity. So there were Nazis on the Moon after all, huh?There are other Ghibli animations that I like more, most of them, in fact, but I feel like this film is a promise that they will return to stories focused or inspired from Japanese traditions, rather than go with stuff like The Borrowers. Why ruin a perfectly good system that brought them a huge and faithful fandom? It is also a beautiful moody story that speaks to the viewer of youth, life and the desire to be free, even against all the best wishes of the people around you. I recommend it.",

            "content": "\"Kaguyahime no monogatari\" or \"The Tale of The Princess Kaguya\" is the newest Studio Ghibli movie. You may know director Isao Takahata, who turns 80 next year, from \"Grave of the Fireflies\" or the 1970's TV show \"Heidi\".As I wrote in the title, the way you will perceive this film is gonna depend a lot on how you like the animation. It is almost like a children's book and certainly not everybody's cup of tea as it's just so different, not only compared to what Disney and Pixar did in recent years, but also compared to other Ghibli films, such as Miyazaki's work. If you appreciate the style, however, you will surely like this movie. Checking out the trailer before might be a particularly good idea here to get a grasp of what you can expect. By the mere looks of it, this film could also have been made 50 years ago.My favorite part was possibly the first 45 minutes, the time Kaguya spends with her \"parents\" in the village before they move to the city. It's just all so harmonic and easy-going. Quite a shame, her father had something else for her in mind as otherwise we may have gotten the same for another 90 minutes. The life in the city and Kaguya's transformation were good to watch too, but not really for the story than for all the cultural and social references of Japan. The stories with her admirers were solid, but somehow I felt something was missing. The ending was a good idea. I liked the return-to-the-moon plot, but I wished it would have been done without all these moon people coming down to get her. I actually really liked the sequence, where she flies up with her childhood crush and this could have worked as a better ending in my opinion. But at least, they did not go for a forced happy ending.I am not sure about the Japanese version, but the German dubbed version I saw had a female narrator with very little text that was really not necessary in my opinion. One particularly interesting thing about the story was her relationship with her father. Even if he was the driving force for her different new life, which she did not appreciate at all, she was always as loving to him as she was towards her mother. This film offers lots of room for interpretation. Was the finding of the bamboo with a girl inside just as unlikely as the mother giving birth to her at that age and was the girl actually suffering from an illness that resulted in her early death? What about the quick growing early on and the normal growing later on? With that early speed, she must have surpassed her parents in terms of age quickly. And what about the bamboo reference? Do these grew tall quickly and stay the same till they die after 25 or so years? Is there a botanist in the room? This film is on the preselection for Academy Award Best Animated Feature Films and it will be interesting to see if it can make the cut and score the nomination or even possibly win. To make a decision for myself, I still have to see some of the other films on that list. Kaguya, however, is certainly worth watching and there were only really very few moments where I felt it dragged a bit, unsurprisingly with such a long runtime, especially for an animated movie. It was all very rewarding as the song that played during the closing credits was pretty beautiful.",

Stories for adults with a child's heart. I also liked the way they -almost- always offered some hope, regardless how dramatic or even gloomy they could get.Unfortunately, this tale is for mature audiences only, I'd say, and it's rather depressing, overall.There's nothing wrong with the film per se; the animation takes a very traditional approach and it becomes even simplistic, separating itself vastly from most Ghibli productions. The storytelling can get dull for people who are not into drama, with its 2 hours and 17 minutes in length.Besides, this movie lacks also a certain sense of movement which other Ghibli films had, mostly in the form of unapologetic action. The pace is quite tranquil, with one or two rushy moments, without reaching the peaks achieved in previous Ghibli films (and no real action).I liked other Takahata movies, like Pom Poko, Only Yesterday, My Neighbors the Yamadas and Grave of the Fireflies (being the latest pretty grim, as well).Alas, it's a movie for the taste of critics for sure. Pity that their tastes do not have anything to do with the youth, and the message Ghibli delivers to them in other films is lost here to a more mature and disenchanted audience.",

Story wise, it was unoriginal and after a while boring. And way too long: it had a promising start, but after they moved to the Capital the story stalled. It never managed to put me inside its world and make me feel something about its universe or the Princess.So to conclude, the story never moved me and the animation never talked to me.. the 5 is only for the first 40mins or so and the last 15, especially the scene when she meets again with her child love.",

            "content": "The famous Japanese movie production company 'Studio Ghibli' is known mostly for Hayao Miyazaki's film resume that ranges from 'Spirited Away' to 'The Wind Rises'. Studio Ghibli continues to put out beautiful and important animated films that not only tell an amazing story, but it also touches on several political, religious, and societal issues that are relevant all over the world. And Miyazaki's films have conjured up a large global audience that has developed into a cult following that is bigger than ever today.But this film 'The Tale of Princess Kaguya' is not a Miyazaki film. Instead, this is an Isao Takahata film and is not your typical Japanese animated film that has sleek CG animated effects or female characters that dress in next to nothing. 'Princess Kaguya' is a 137 minute film that is 100% hand drawn and is a story from the 10th century, which is called 'The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter'. Many people say that this is one of the first if not the first science fiction story ever thought up. And when I say science-fiction, I'm not insinuating aliens, space ships or far off planets with lasers. Instead, this wonderful story starts out with a middle aged man and his wife who live a quiet life in the mountains.This man is a bamboo cutter, who uses bamboo for food, shelter, baskets, and clothing. While working in the bamboo field, he notices a strange glow from one of the bamboo trees. When he investigates, he notices a little seedling that is rapidly growing. In it is a tiny little person who is alive. He takes this small person back to his wife where it transforms into a baby girl, who grows very fast too. The bamboo cutter and his wife think that heaven sent her down to Earth to become the most beautiful princess there ever was. As she grows up fast, her parents collect gold and fine clothing from the magical bamboo tree, which he has a giant palace in the city built for her.The bulk of this long movie shows this magical princess growing up and adjusting to her new wealthy and powerful life. Her father hires a teacher to instruct her on how to be a proper lady and princess, but the princess would rather laugh, dance, play in the fields, and sing than live a life of boredom in 10th century Japan. In addition to this being one of the first science-fiction stories, it also has a lot of feministic and women's rights qualities to it, which is always great to see.Another big part of the story has five of the wealthiest and powerful men in Japan vying for her love and marriage, to which she has never met any of them. She sends each of them on impossible tasks to prove their love for her, but it's really a ploy to see if they truly care about her or if they just want her as a piece of property. One of the overall story arcs is the love between the princess and a young boy she was friends with when they were little, where their paths cross rarely throughout the course of this movie, but their love is still binding them together, even they are so far away.This PG family friendly film might be too slow for most, where as anime buffs might take a stronger liking to it, but as the ending draws closer, the more bizarre the film gets, taking you out of the whole point of the story. The best parts are towards the beginning of the film, watching the princess grow up. It has such a wonderful and carefree charm about it that should make you smile. The animation is beautiful and simple and wonderfully colored. It's a real treat to see something illustrated fully by hand without the use of computers these days. The 137 minute run time is a bit long and could have played out better as a mini series, as this film is fairly episodic, but none-the-less, it's an excellent piece of animation and a great story. I just think it got away from itself from time to time and took too long to tell.",

It's slow paced to a fault and at over 2 hours, well out stays its welcome.The story is meandering, convoluted and doesn't make efficient use of the visual medium to deliver information, rather it feels more like listening to a slowly narrated audio book whilst flicking through some nice illustrations. I was intensely bored by most of it, despite the undeniable charm of some of the animation, I felt there wasn't any effort to engage the viewer on a deeper level with more dynamic film language or snappier, cleverer story telling. You can say that Japanese story structure is fundamentally different from Western methods, often employing a 'watch the grass grow' approach that celebrates silence, ritual and mood over Pixar's noisy barrage of constant challenges. I have found that difference to be quite refreshing in other films like \"Spirited Away\" and \"Princess Mononoke\" but \"Kaguya\", in comparison really lacked engaging characters and virtually any moments of dynamic tension.The art style in my opinion isn't terribly good compensation for this. While there are moments of exquisite gestural animation - the sequence where the princess rushes through the woods leaving a trail of fluttering garments in her wake, is gorgeous- overall the character designs are rather crude, pale and ugly, looking more like rough pencil sketches than the refined, noble and highly graphic woodblock prints they appear to emulate.It's a shame, I really wanted to love \"Kaguya\", but I don't think I could sit through it again.",

            "content": "(originally seen at http://goo.gl/UNpKrF)The Tale of the Princess Kaguya is an animated film based on what is widely believed to be the first canonical story in Japanese folklore, which is a lofty goal. It's generally a good sign to see the name of Studio Ghibli in the title cards, but even with the legendary abilities of Ghibli-trained animators rendering a story in a hand-drawn, highly emotive style, it ultimately fell quite flat for me.The problem comes solely down to the direction of Isao Takahata. His style is a vast departure from the work of Miyazaki, and while I'm certainly not a purist as far as how a film should look, Takahata-san has missed several very important lessons from the studio's legendary founder, and those lessons cover all the ways in which Kaguya failed for me.G Kids also distributed one of my favorites films of all time this last year: Song of the Sea. Tomm Moore knows, as Miyazaki knows, that your art\u2014while stylized\u2014must have a consistent focus and theme to it. Kaguya is unfettered, blending art and animation styles between artists with no theme. Characters are drawn vastly different from each other, looking like caricatures of trolls more than people at times, with no central idea or motif to make the world seem like anything but a mash-up. If you pay attention to Song of the Sea or, say, The Wind Rises (one of my favorites of Miyazaki's catalog), you see the art style carried through every character, every setting, and every detail. That's the kind of direction that a story needs, one where the details are crafted, not left to whims and crumpled together in the edit.While the story is a sad and heartfelt one, its presentation suffers greatly as Takahata really foregoes centuries of storytelling know-how, ensuring that audiences will have to expend a great deal of effort to engage with the plot. Kaguya (voiced by Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz in the English dub), is a goddess descended from the moon to live with a poor unnamed bamboo cutter and his wife (James Cann and Mary Steenburgen, respectively). For reasons left unexplained, the child grows from an infant to an adolescent in a matter of weeks (if that), and is blessed with a gift of gold and silks from the stalks of bamboo plants, which sends her father into an apoplectic fit of narcissism, self-absorbed negligence, and social-climbing ambition. He pulls Kaguya into the city to be raised as royalty in an effort to try to feel fulfilled on his own, and Kaguya is miserable until she's eventually called back to the moon due to reasons we never get the time to know, because she's off the screen and the movie's over in less than ten minutes after we first hear of it.This plot, disjointed as it is, sets up a lot of dissonance. It's hard to understand why she's so reluctant to return to the moon (much less how she knows of her destiny) when her father was such a miserable person to her for pretty much her entire life, using her to gain some semblance of self-worth. I never got any time to try to relate to her, or to glean any sense of her relationship with others. The plot skips when it should walk and crawls when it should run. At over two hours long, it both rushes and drags in ways I haven't seen in cinema for many years now. Stories like this are the reason so many storytelling tropes have been invented and accepted over the years. The standard Three-Act Plot, the classic Show, Don't Tell rule, pacing curves\u2014most of the rules of fiction are shown here rather conspicuously by their absence.Sadly, there's not much else to save it. The music is fitting, and not overbearing. It's nothing I'd rush to find the OST for, but it's well-done. The voice acting for the three main characters is worth applauding, but outside of that, we're again stuck with the traditional Disney-style parade of A-list celebrities who really have no ability to voice act at all. The performances are characteristically stilted and flat, which might fit the Disney-imported trend, but it's hardly required.Kaguya is a film that people have been lining up to throw perfect scores at like so many roses to a bullfighter, so I realize that I'm certainly not setting myself up for a popular review here. There's probably not many ways to make more enemies online than harshly criticizing a Studio Ghibli film, but here we are. I'm afraid that Kaguya is a rare miss from this studio, perhaps the exception that proves the rule of Miyazaki-san's excellence as a traditional\u2014yet culture-spanning\u2014storyteller.Scores (out of 10) Acting: 6 Story: 3 Visuals: 6 Sound: 5 Enjoyment: 3 Overall Score: 4/10",

            "content": "If Isao Takahata made more films he would most likely be my favorite director of all time. He was a co-founder of Studio Ghibli, a widely acclaimed Japanese animation studio, and also directed a few films for them. He is without a doubt my favorite animation director of all time, (sorry Don Hertzfeldt and Hayao Miyazaki, your both still great.) so when I found out that he was going to release a new film, The Tale of the Princess Kaguya, the first one in nearly fifteen years, I could not be happier. And when I found out that it was going to be his last one, and supposedly the last one by studio Ghibli, (which turned out to be false with the the release of When Marnie Was There, a film that everyone needs to check out.) I could not be sadder. But when I, at long last, saw The Tale of the Princess Kaguya I was more than satisfied with it. The Tale of the Princess Kaguya is based of a 10th century Japanese myth called the tale of the bamboo cutter. Which is actually the oldest known Japanese story, there's something very marvelous in making your last film an adaptation of your cultures oldest story. In the story a humble childless bamboo cutter, (Voiced in the American dub of the film by James Caan.) who lives out in the mountains, and spends his days cutting down the bamboo trees, and spending time with his wife. One day the bamboo cutter cuts down a bamboo tree and a mysterious light shines from inside the tree and the bamboo cutter finds a strange small girl in the tree. (Voiced by Chloe Grace Moretz.) The bamboo cutter then takes the girl home to his wife and they decide to raise it as their own. Supposedly The Tale of the Princess Kaguya was in production for eight years, and it shows. Not only is it the longest film Ghibli has ever produced, but every single frame in the film is absolutely awe-inspiring. I don't want to oversell the animation, but i think I can safely say that this might in fact be the best animation I've seen in any film ever up to this point. Don't get me wrong Spirited Away was immensely creative and detailed, and things like Akira and Fantasia were game changing, but there is a subtle and restrained beauty in The Tale of the Princess Kaguya, that I have never seen in any other film ever. Like all of the best animated films out there, The Tale of the Princess Kaguya creates its own world. And it's world is one of beautiful countrysides, crowded streets, empty lonely palaces, and most importantly whimsical magic. The animations subtle beauty does explode in some deeply emotional scenes, like in the flawlessly handled party scene, and the one immediately following it. The film's perfect animation is greatly enhanced by its soundtrack. The score for The Tale of the Princess Kaguya was composed by Joe Hisaishi, who composed most of the Ghibli's films, but even with his impressive back catalog The Tale of the Princess Kaguya is some of his best work. The song \"flying\" from the soundtrack is enough to bring me to tears, and when you combine the song with the actual scene in the film, man there really is nothing else like it. And the lyrics to the Nursery Rhyme are simply touching. Between the animation and the soundtrack I would say that the best way to describe The Tale of the Princess Kaguya is that the film just oozes beauty.The voice-acting is, well, on par with the soundtrack, animation and basically everything else in the film. Meaning it's beyond superb. Every single voice actor is at the top of their game. I should mention that I am talking about the English dub, the original Japanese dialogue is also great but I'm more familiar with the English dub, but in all honesty you can watch either and get the same effect. Typically when a film from a non-English speaking country gets released in an English speaking country, I would recommend watching the original dialogue, and to avoid any and all dubs, but that's not the case with Studio Ghibli. Disney owns the right to release Studio Ghibli films in America. So since they're Disney, when they release a Studio Ghibli film they get top quality actors to do the voices. And boy did they do a great job with The Tale of the Princess Kaguya. They're aren't many the big stars in The Tale of the Princess Kaguya, the biggest being Chloe Grace Moretz. But every single actor perfectly embodies they're character in a way that I've rarely seen done in animated film before this.The Tale of the Princess Kaguya was received well by critics, and was nominated for best animated feature by the academy awards in 2014, unfortunately it lost to Big Hero Six and while that's a decent film, the idea that Big Hero Six is anywhere near as good as The Tale of the Princess Kaguya is laughably and insultingly incorrect. The Tale of the Princess is one of the greatest animated films of all time, it's also one of the greatest films of the 2010s, if not they greatest for both of those categories. I really don't think I can recommend this film enough, everyone on this planet needs to see this film. It will never be possible for me, or anyone for that matter, to fully express this films beauty and quality in words, you just have to experience it for yourself. And please experience it as soon as possible.10/10",

The character work is solid, but it's archetypal stuff and still nothing that digs deep in a relatable way. This is just a type of whimsy that I don't enjoy, and at 2 hours, it's more of a chore. But at least it's a pretty chore. No doubt you marvel at the animation, especially during the dramatic running sequences. The fluttering music tends to match the lightness of the visuals. I respect Takahata, as I do for Miyasaki, but his Graves of the Fireflies did nothing for me as well. Outside the man hours put into it, Kaguya is nothing special.6/10",

I wouldn't go that far - for me nothing beats Miyazaki - but it is a remarkable movie.This was the last movie directed by Isao Takahata, the first one I've been impressed by since Grave of the Fireflies, and, since Fireflies was so painfully grim, the first Takahata film I've ever strongly enjoyed.

There will be spoilers ahead: I'm not going to talk much about the plot, because this film must be seen to be appreciated. So I'll do a quick synopsis first and then talk about the technical aspects.A bamboo cutter finds a small girl in a bamboo stalk and takes her home as a blessing from the gods. She becomes a regular sized baby and then proceeds to rapidly grow into a beautiful woman. She's taken to the city as a young girl to be raised as a princess Through much tumult, she finally learns her place in things and who she really is.It really is a very interesting story, with fascinating characters-all of which should unfold for you as you watch the film. This is not only one of the best animated films I've seen, but also one of the better films I've seen in some time.The hand-drawn animation is beautiful, the music is wonderful and matches the film perfectly. The editing is very good and the voice work (at least on the Japanese language soundtrack) was exceptional. The script was also excellent.Although I like Big Hero 6 and consider it also a very good film in its own right, I personally like The Tale of Princess Kaguya even more and I wish it had won the Academy Award instead. I know it really doesn't matter. Both are excellent films and are deserving of the accolades they've received.This film is available on Blu Ray and DVD. By all means, watch it on Blu Ray if you can.

            "review_title": "Isao Takahata strikes again",
            "content": "14 years after directing the underrated My Neighbors the Yamadas, director Isao Takahata finally released his new film. Based on the oldest, and apparently most well-known folktale in Japan, The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter. (spoilers) It details the life (and times) of Kaguya, a small girl who originates from a city on the moon, is sent to earth where she excels in the simple farm life, suffers under life as a lady in the city and eventually returns to the moon. It's a story containing both realist and surreal elements, a combination that Takahata has perfected in his films. Though apparently a very popular tale in Japan, the story isn't exactly blockbuster material. Nevertheless, Takahata followed his own vision and has crafted a highly effective film replete with all the love and care and obsessive attention to detail Studio Ghibli has become known for.We first see (what else) a bamboo cutter discovering a robed girl, Kaguya of course, as small as his hand in a forest. He takes her into his home with his wife where Kaguya grows abnormally fast. She lives a happy country life with friends etc. Eventually, the bamboo cutter cuts another bamboo tree and to his astonishment finds gold. He becomes something of a rich man and convinces his wife that by moving to the capital, they'll finally be able to grant Kaguya the kind of life that will make her happy. Of course, life as a lady is only suffocating to the free-spirited Kaguya who alternates between having to learn and accept the lifestyle of a 'proper lady' and wanting to desperately escape the city.Naturally, the film looks stunning. Takahata utilizes a palette consisting mostly of soft pastels and charcoal. Characters are drawn in minimalist, though highly distinct fashions. The soft pastels and charcoal textures aren't just eye candy however, but fit with the story's ancient origins, the film looking as if drawings on ancient Japanese scrolls were coming to life. As befits Takahata, visuals are also used to externally emphasize a character's inner life and feelings. One particularly amazing scene, showing Kaguya desperately fleeing the capital, begins with pastels and charcoal, but soon grows more aggressive, with more and more harsh charcoal lines, reflecting Kaguya's inner turmoil as she flees It's quite simply one of those scenes where you realize you are, at that very moment, witnessing 'art' taking place in front of your eyes; in other words, the greatest thing you could possibly experience in a movie theater. Personally, I can only level two complaints at the film: one, the surrealist aspect of the story was a bit hard to digest. I'm referring to the moment when Kaguya realizes she's from the moon and has to return there. There's something strange about watching a scene where she outright tells her 'parents' she's from the moon when the film up until this point was highly realistic in tone, despite the surrealist opening scene where she's found by the bamboo cutter. Two, the film is perhaps a tad too long. I have nothing against long (animated) films per se, but here I eventually felt exhaustion entering my body. I think this is an issue inherent to the story and the fact that it isn't exactly the most varied plot. There are basically only two environments: the landscapes depicting nature and life in the city. As befitting Takahata's later output, the tempo is quite slow and this will be hard for viewers who are unfamiliar with Takahata to digest. In its favor, I find the slow tempo to also be to the film's benefit. Like Kaguya, the viewer also grows tired of the city's endless parade of suitors and emphasis on etiquette.I've read articles where people question the point of this film. Why would Takahata adapt this story? After directing films like Grave of the Fireflies and Only Yesterday, why would he turn to Japan's oldest folktale? I believe the reason can be found in the end of the film. At one point, Kaguya is hesitant to go back to the moon and leave earth and all she's experienced. Even later, she has a small monologue about earthly life in general with all the beautiful and negative experiences she's accumulated. The point she's making is that despite the things she's experienced during her days as a 'lady' in the city, she still loves earthly life. Think back to Takahata's Only Yesterday with its positive outlook on people and life despite all the dramatic events. Both films prefer the honest farmer's life as opposed to city life. Think back to Yamadas which is an even more overt celebration of daily life in all its normalcy. Kaguya fits easily within this most important of themes in Takahata's filmography.",

            "content": "Let's just take a moment to appreciate how beautiful this film is, it is without a doubt a work of art. Every paint stroke, every detail and every frame by frame animation is perfection. I've never seen such exquisite visionary qualities in a film before. Every frame is colourful, bright and absolutely delightful to admire. Not to mention several scenes have multiple layers of animation embedded within them, masterful. I'm just...in awe of how amazing the animation was, I really am. Trust it to be Studio Ghibli, they really are masters of the animation genre. This film is a re-telling of the famous Japanese folk tale \"The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter\" where said bamboo cutter comes across a glowing stalk which is revealed to contain a princess. They raise her as she grows rapidly and, with the help of a divine presence, believe she should be living in the lifestyle of nobility. There is so much to analyse, so much to take in that I just don't have enough words to detail every theme that is explored. The story is one of happiness. The contrasting lifestyles of rural village people to rich noblemen. But is anyone actually truly happy? Princess Kaguya wishes to live back in the mountains whereas her old friends are jealous of her new luxurious residence. Within this personal conflict is the never ending battle of seeking true happiness which conclusively she does not find (much like everyone else in life). The bamboo cutter gave the princess a life in his own image, a life that he wished he desired all along. While he may have been happy, his daughter was not. He was blinded by the materialistic aspirations that he yearned for. The representation of the traditional Japanese culture was wonderful and really captured the authenticity of the folk tale. I do have to warn you though, don't let the cutesy animation fool you. I do not recommend this for children. It's a long runtime, there are heavy themes and I don't think they will fully appreciate it.",

            "content": "The moment it ended I genuinely did not know if I loved or hated it. It's such a deeply weird and truly unique movie. But I think it does have some definite flaws. And I will go over those first.First of all, the film is a lot longer than it needs to be, and the pacing can be very poor from time to time. The first full half an hour is quite boring and I was NOT enjoying myself. It was initially very intriguing with the opening scene, but it was quickly losing steam and it doesn't really pick up until around 45 minutes in.Very personal thing... but this movie did not need the nudity. It got a little awkward to be honest.A lot of the plots just feel like they go nowhere. They could have cut Sutemura & The Emperor and little would have changed. They conveyed Kaguya's longing for her old home well enough without having to include Sutemura. And they could have easily made Kaguya's breaking point where she accidentally calls out to the moon be caused by one of the original 5 suitors.Also that dream sequence where Sutemura agrees to run away with Kaguya felt really awkward because the film clearly shows us that HE IS MARRIED AND HAS A KID. That scene, while beautifully animated, was utterly pointless. They did not develop this character well enough.So on the whole. A lot could have been cut, and the film could have been a LOT tighter.Now for everything that I liked. Because there is a lot.First of all. The animation is spectacular. It's such a unique style and it adds a lot of character to the film. I love how abstract it is. The music is also very nice.But the reason that this movie works at all is because Kaguya is a great character. I just felt sad for her most of the movie and her struggles really got to me. I really did care about her relationship with her parents. The parents were good characters too. Some of the emotional scenes were also quite effective. It definitely made me feel something.And while a lot of the scenes were boringly slow. Others were very relaxingly slow. The film is incredibly ethereal and beautiful in key scenes.While I hate Sutemura's dream sequence, the one that Kaguya has is probably my favourite scene in the movie. The beginning of the dream is the most well animated scene in the movie and the rest of it just has this wonderfully ambient and eerie feel to it. Along with some great development for Kaguya. I loved that scene.But what truly made this movie for me, and the thing that initially left me SUPER conflicted, was the ending. It took me a while to process. Again, I didn't even know if I loved or hated it. But I now realize that this film is actually a tragedy. Just as Kaguya is beginning to fully realize how much earth means to her, it's taken away from her and there's nothing she can do about it. And she goes back to her apparently emotionless life on the moon, leaving everyone she loved on earth sad.This movie left ME sad. And I've come to like that. And I can tell that this movie is going to be on my mind for a while.And side note; I really loved Kaguya's little assistant/friend. She was just really adorable and somehow funny.So on the whole. While this movie is FAR from perfect there's something about it that really made me feel something. It sorta reminds me of Spirited Away in that sense. While nowhere near as good as that film, The Tale of Princess Kaguya is going to stick in my mind for a while and I won't soon forget it. It's a little sloppy, but still impressive.",

            "content": "Isao Takahata has always been a so-so director in my opinion. Grave of the Fireflies remained his grand achievement throughout his whole career and his other films have been rather hard to sell to non-Japanese audiences because of their heavy reliance on Japanese culture, tradition and most especially humour. Which is why I was so pleasantly surprised by this film, which in my mind easily takes place as his new magnum opus.The Tale of the Princess Kaguya faithfully retells a classic Japanese folktale about a princess, send from the heavens, who is found by a humble bamboo cutter from within a bamboo stalk. Said bamboo cutter is given gold, cloth and everything else he needs to raise the princess as his own and to give her the kind of life she deserves. The films doesn't really deviate from the tale, but that shouldn't count against it, especially because any non-Japanese viewer is unlikely to know the tale intimately.Plus, it's a really well-told tale, smoothly flowing from one scene to another, from the early days in a small cabin to grand feasts and noble suitors. Aki Asakura, the voice actor of Kaguya-hime, gives her a really likable personality and the film excels in showing both the humanity and otherworldly grace of the character.I also really like the animation style, which mimics the drawings that were used to illustrate the tale in the ancient times. It's simplistic yet beautiful most of the time, but can be very expressive when the scene calls for it. There are also couple segments which utilize a more experimental, almost abstract style, and they are easily the best parts of the film aesthetically.As a whole The Tale of the Princess Kaguya is an amazing experience. The story is universal enough to be appreciated by any viewer, yet it remains intimately Japanese at its roots. The animation style is beautiful in its bleakness, the characters are enjoyable and as a whole the film is one of the finest Studio Ghibli has ever released. Definitely worth a watch.",

I don't have any children of my own, so I never like giving any parenting advice, but I imagine the themes on display here would serve as a good lesson to remind parents that children are a gift. Also, it is important to note that placing your own hopes and dreams on them is not the most effective way of expressing your love for them. You can definitely appreciate the difficult situation that Kaguya finds herself in once she is taken to the city to become a Princess. Despite the fact that I don't understand some of the cultural differences, I could still comprehend the themes they were touching on throughout the movie. It's kind of depressing how the system traps her, but at least she is in more of a power position, so she isn't forced to take a particular husband.The Tale of Princess Kaguya has a different artistic style. Instead of giving all the images perfect crisp edging and dark black outlines, things are more freeform and feel almost like pencil sketches at times. They aren't afraid of leaving parts of the frame white, and letting colors trail off on the edges. I probably tend to prefer something more structured in style, but I can appreciate how this look makes it all feel like a fairy tale storybook. And that brings me to the biggest area that I struggled with in The Tale of Princess Kaguya...the fantastical elements of the story. Not only was I less invested because of the strange magic at play, but I didn't understand why the story ever needed to go there. As a result, the ending fell quite flat for me. I can definitely see that there is an audience for The Tale of Princess Kaguya, I just don't think I'm one of them.",

In the hands of the Japanese Studio Ghibli, director Isao Takahata has crafted a rival story of his colleague in that same studio, Hayao Miyazaki (The Wind Rises). The 10th-century tale of a princess found in a bamboo shoot carries enough contemporary relevance to keep grad students in theses for a decade.This lovely and exciting Japanese anime sports the usual and still beautiful charcoal\u2013watercolor motif (you'll want to linger with the plum blossoms) accompanied by Joe Hisaishi's fitting pastoral, woodland music. The surprisingly simple theme--like Dorothy and ET, she needs to get home--has multiple strains of narrative, not the least of which shows a loving adoptive mother and father (Mary Steenburgen and James Caan), who try to give her everything a princess could want only to fail to give her a most important treasure, her friends and relatives in her far away home.The lack of maudlin longing and her affection for her adoptive home make this unusual storytelling because it does not pander to the expectations of the audience. When the princess abjures the stylistic and cosmetic changes to make her look like a princess (her dad has, after all, bought her into royalty and she needs to look like one), she evidences the rebellious attitude of teens everywhere and anytime.Although violence could have been a legitimate element of this story, there is none; although a sappy romance with a handsome prince could have been warranted, there is none; although Kaguya could have been too sweet, she is not. The Tale of the Princess Kaguya is a beautifully told story in the best Japanese tradition.\"My mom won't let anyone treat me like a little princess.\" Chloe Grace Moretz",

            "review_title": "A gorgeous complex tale",
            "content": "The Tale of the Princess Kaguya is based on the Japanese folk tale The Daughter of the Bamboo Cutter, a tale that has been transmitted since the 16th century. This is one of those films that you don't imagine being made by anybody who is not Ghibli related. The tale could have been turned into a simplistic story for dumb kids with showy 3G visuals and little substance. However, Ghibli and Takhata created an animated piece that is both beautiful to look at, but also a complex multi-layered story with archetypal mythical characters, both delightful to watch and true to the myth. The childhood part is really wonderful, and we delight at seeing Kagugya discovering the world and growing up as a happy child, really cute, tender and fun; therefore, this part is basically experiential. The second part is, on the contrary, very reflective; it portrays old traditional ways of living and societal structure in Japan with easiness and fun, but it is also the tale of Kaguya's increasing sadness and unhappiness. The Tale of Princess Kaguya is related to the Buddhist Bon Festival, which is celebrated on a full moon on the 15th August (this is a hint!). Like any myth, the story is a compendium of human wisdom, an exploration of the human feelings, a depiction of human archetypes, and teaches many lessons. Some of the themes presented in the film are really philosophical and mythological and would require of page after page of analysis: from the creation myth, to the suitors tests, to the complex religious symbolism of the Buddhist ending. Just the analogy of the bamboo plant natural progression, and Kaguya being called Li'l Bamboo is an indication of what we can expect (another hint!). Some of the lessons that this old tale is embedded with are very relevant to our modern fast-paced 21st century: > Money and status don't equal happiness. > You cannot, should not, must not impose your ideal of happiness onto your offspring; that it is emotional castration. > We have an obligation with ourselves to let our voice be heard and our heart be seen, no matter the circumstances. > We all have to follow our own path, despite any family or societal pressure. It is our life, after all. > Life is a fleeting moment, and we should live it to the fullest. Seek joy, cultivate ways of living and emotional statuses that are soulful to you. > Love is not about conquest, is not about trials and games, is not about an ideal of love, the perfect partner. It is about what you feel in your heart and how things flow with another person even if that person is not your ideal. > Parental love is not just about discipline and rules, is also about letting our children find their own voice and way in the world. > When we die, all vanishes, no memory is left, even if you are a Buddhist and believe in reincarnation. However, there is a longing in our soul to improve next time we came down, if that ever happens, to try again, to have a second, third or fourth chance to be happy, to enjoy life and get what life is all about. > Happiness is not in the outside world, it is how you feel about the outside world. One of the most puzzling things in the film is that Kaguya is not a princess in the Disney sense or in the traditional European sense. Certainly, she has a legendary beauty, she is loving and lovable, and she has many suitors who have to do things to get her love. Yet, Kaguya is not perfect, she is a confused human being, and the story doesn't have a perfect ending either. Actually, Kaguya is truly imperfect, is the anti-heroine, she is a mortal human being, she has regrets, but she is never fake or accepts the system. Her only betrayal she commits is that of not letting her voice being heard at the right time and allowing herself to be engulfed by everything and everybody that surrounds her. More and more, I feel that 2D animation is really modern, artistic and versatile, and that is far from being replaced by 3G. This film is beautifully artistically drawn and lightened, with a very soft palette of gorgeous colors, and an intentional use of the background for narrative purposes. For example, life in the city is shown mostly through images of people, the backgrounds are basic and barely there, not much action, there is some sort of passivity and slow motion. On the contrary, the childhood period in the countryside and the trips of Kaguya to her native town are the opposite, and have very detailed backgrounds and images, rich colors, full of animals and little creatures and plants, and most of what happens there is movement. And that is, after all, the way Kaguya perceives the world. The only two downsides I see in the movie are, firstly, that it is unnecessarily long and, secondly the quite dramatic differences in the mood of the first and second part of the tale and there is not transition.I watched the movie in Japanese with English subtitles, and it was delightful.",

The Tale of Princess Kaguya is one of those films. This film is an absolute masterpiece. From gorgeous visuals, to a deeply profound story about what it means to live, feel, hurt, and be happy as a human. This is what Ghibli is best at doing - making a modern-day classic without any trace of feeling contrived or artificial. A lot of times when you watch a movie, you say to yourself something like, \"Oh I see why they had to do that. It was to setup such and such\". This leads to convenient coincidences and contrived plot twists. These things aren't bad. Fictional film and art is itself artificial by definition. But what separates a master storyteller from a great storyteller from a mediocre storyteller is the ability to create a story that feels like it sprung into being in full naturally. This is one of those films.",

            "content": "'THE TALE OF THE PRINCESS KAGUYA': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)A Japanese animated fantasy film from writer/director Isao Takahata. Takahata directed and co-wrote the movie (with Riko Sakaguchi), which is based on the Japanese folktale 'The Tale of The Bamboo Cutter'. It tells the story of a magical princess; who was found inside a glowing bamboo plant, when she was a baby, by a bamboo cutter who then raised her. The film has received mostly positive reviews from critics and it was nominated for Best Animated Feature Film, at the upcoming 87th Academy Awards. I found it to be bizarrely interesting but a bit overrated (like most films of it's genre).The film begins with a bamboo cutter, named Sanuki no Miyatsuko (voiced by Takeo Chii), finding a small baby girl; inside a glowing bamboo shoot. Believing her to be a magical gift from God, Sanuki takes her home and raises her as his own; with his wife Ona (Nobuko Miyamoto). She grows very quickly and the couple names her Kaguya (Aki Asakura). They raise her to be a princess and move her to the capital. There she is greatly admired, for her beauty, and sought after by multiple wealthy men. Kaguya is not impressed by any of her possible suitors though, and she challenges them all to bring her a really rare gift.The movie is the type of animated film I would have liked a lot more as a kid. It's well made, and an interesting story, but it's also way too long and overly melodramatic. This is typical of many animated films though; especially ones made in Japan. Fans of the genre, and especially the director, will love it though. I found it to be just a little too dry and boring.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chY2PeSnCng",

            "content": "Another beautifully animated tale produced by Studio Ghibli! This particular one follows a young girl (specifically tiny upon introduction) who is found inside a stalk by a bamboo cutter and his wife. They become her guardians as she very rapidly grows into a baby then quickly into a young woman. The father decides to take her into 'the capital' in order for her to become the princess she was destined to be. What follows is a very melancholic study of this young girl's growing unhappiness with the world she has found herself in and a portrait of already natural and existing beauty manufactured into something artificial. Despite that, the film is by no means shallow. It is superbly crafted with some genuinely captivating sequences (such as the princess running desperately back to her hometown; pure magic!) and consistently sweet moments particularly in the first half. Conceived and worked on for 8 years by Isao Takahata (Grave of the Fireflies) and sadly his final film after passing away at the age of 82, it is a passionately made story that also lets the audience find their own way in and is very much one that whatever you bring to it determines how much you take away from it. Although I'd like to watch it again, it is a very sad film and it's almost hard to sit down and watch it again for that fact. I'd very much recommend watching it in the original Japanese-language version as it adds that sense of authenticity but I have yet to watch the English-language version which I'm sure is also good!",

The story is based on the same bit of Japanese folklore that was behind the 1980s film PRINCESS FROM THE MOON, starring Toshiro Mifune. The movie was directed by Isao Takahata, who previously made MY NEIGHBOURS THE YAMADAS back in the 1990s, and it has the same basic, old-fashioned animated look to it, albeit with more colour and time spent on the imagery.For those looking for an action-packed Disney-style romp with dumb comedy, go elsewhere. Like a lot of Ghibli products, KAGUYA is a mature and reflective piece of work, more of a mood piece than anything else. The fantasy story is tinged with warmth but also sadness and tragedy; a classic coming-of-age tale with something of a depressing outcome. It might even be Ghibli's most adult film to date and it certainly connects with the viewer more than anything like THE WIND RISES; I'll freely admit to the tears running down my cheeks during a wistful song at the climax. My only complaint is that it's a little long, but that doesn't detract from the experience.",

            "content": "You have to hand it to Studio Ghibli, they really do know how to make exquisitely beautiful films. The Tale of the Princess Kaguya is yet another example of this. Its story is based on the oldest folklore tale from Japan. It starts off with a tiny girl being found in a forest by a bamboo cutter. He takes her home to his wife and she immediately transforms into a baby and then grows up with rapid speed. Soon it is believed that she must be a magical princess and she is moved to the city to live in a palace. While here she experiences some unhappiness and longs for her old life.The director of this one is Isao Takahata who directed the brilliant but harrowing The Grave of the Fireflies (1988) for Ghibli (so downbeat that it was the only Ghibli film to not be distributed by Disney). So, it was a bit of a left-of-centre offering from the famous Japanese studio, with Kaguya the material is more in line with what they are most famous for yet quite distinctive in several ways too. First off, as can almost be taken for granted, the animation really is quite beautiful and soulful. The style is definitely different though with a pastel watercolour palette and sketchy drawings. This style, however, suggests old paintings and suggests more effectively the ancient source of the material. The imagery is also complimented by an organic musical score that further underscores the aesthetic. As is the Ghibli genius though the story blends its surface fantasy with unmistakable reality, with important social issues interwoven into the flow. To this end we have the issues of women's place in society and the restrictions inherent in that considered in very clear ways. The story really captures this when five potential suitors for the princess are sent on impossible missions by her based on the superficial things they say to her in an attempt to claim her. It cleverly makes them consider the meaninglessness of their words and what their true motives are. So, it is quite a contemplative film on the whole and probably not very well suited to younger children who might find it unexciting. It's quite slow pacing and long run-time do make it one that is better suited to a slightly older audience perhaps. But if you can handle that it is a wonder in many places with a very emotional ending that is both sad and gorgeously delivered. Overall, this has to go down as yet another triumph for Studio Ghibli.",

The two founders, Hayao Miyazaki and Isao Takahata have very different approaches to character, world building, theme and storytelling (and I am decidedly in the Miyazaki camp). This was to be the last project that Takahata did for Studio Ghibli and to do so he returned to a story that had long held his attention, \"The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter\". He began by abandoning the realistic animation style, for which Ghibli had become famous, for for a style he created and named \"sketch animation\". He wanted His audience to \"imagine or recall the reality deep within the drawings\", rather than be distracted by a realistic art style. He wanted to have people \"recollect the realities of this life by sketching ordinary human qualities with simple props\". So, he depended on Osamu Tanabe to provide the \"sketch\" character designs and used Kazuo Oga's beautiful watercolor backgrounds. I have to confess it took a moment for me to release the one animation style in favour of the other, but the innate freedom of form and the beautiful palette soon won me over. Much of the story is told from the perspective of the Princess or Little Bamboo, as the village children had called her, and her wit and cleverness save her from the plans of others for her life. Although we are well aware of the \"otherness\" of Little Bamboo, the ending was too abstract for me and it lessened the resolve of the story. As is common to Takahata's films, the simplicity of nature supersedes the false promise of the city and we are left with a longing for Little Bamboo's former existence. For the beauty of the film, the flowing music, the winsome characters and the fully embodied character of the Princess, I give this film a 9 (superb) out of 10. {Animated Feature}",

I know nothing of Studio Ghibli nor do I know anything about the film's writer and director Isao Takahata. Apparently both are juggernauts of animation and prolific artists in the medium of film. Without any knowledge of either I must solely look at the film for how it resonates with me, and in short: it is a beauty.A bamboo farmer is harvesting his stalks when he comes across a tiny girl inside a lotus blossom within a severed bamboo stalk. He takes the little girl to his wife, who is childless, and they decide to care for the girl. Before they know it, the girl has transformed into a baby and rapidly grows into a striking young lady. Her father decides it must be the bamboo girl's fate to be a princess, which she fervently resists while simultaneously respecting his wishes. The poised and mysterious princess attracts much attention and enchants all those who hear of her. In the end, only she knows of her ultimate fate and in facing it, she faces her true being.Unfortunately I found it extremely difficult to find the subtitled original Japanese language version of The Tale of the Princess Kaguya and could only watch the English dubbed version, though let it be known I always much prefer to watch a film in its original language. Luckily, production was able to get veteran actors for the English voiced version of The Tale of the Princess Kaguya so the film is able to stand on its own in English as well as Japanese.Though aspects of the narrative within The Tale of the Princess of Kaguya are conventional, since its plot derives from an old Japanese folktale, the story is fantastical, emotional and enchanting and the antithesis of stale. The themes presented in the story are imaginative and engaging and the animation is complementary to the style.I had long forgotten the days when animation was a medium to facilitate imagination, creativity and artistry \u2013 and The Tale of the Princess Kaguya revitalizes the medium for American viewers in a wonderful and masterful way.Please check out our WEBSITE for full REVIEWS of all the recent releases and awards nominees.",

It nicely creates focus points on the story and made the movie's two hour duration all worthwhile. All the technicalities supported this movie very nicely. The mood of the story is critically emphasized by the whole drawing and coloration style. The whole, semi sketch draw style gives the authentic folklore feel, in conjunction with the main song of the movie. I really like the color palette choice of pastel and light shade colors. Although it gets to be very bright most often, especially when you're viewing the movie in a dark room from a monitor, the light shades always bring the original folklore spirit back on and reduces the mystery aura many times. The coloration that seem like it's unfinished coloring, with uncolored spaces between the sketch lines instead makes this movie look very beautiful in my eyes.",

            "content": "Based on a very famous story (which I have not heard before), Princess Kaguya is a beautifully animated piece which will speak to parents more than most casual viewers. The plot sees a simple woodcutter discovering a tiny princess inside a bamboo shoot, taking her home and, as she grows quickly, trying to ensure she has all the best things in life. To spoil the film for you early in my comments, this thread ends with her leaving to return to the moon, pursuing her own path in her life. There is a lot that goes on in the meantime, but this is the elements that kept me engaged \u2013 and perhaps because I am seeing the \"growing up and finding their own path\" journey first hand.This aspect is quite touching in how well played it is, however it is a simple aspect which isn't narrative per se. Instead the narrative moves slowly across changes in the life of Kaguya, suitors trying to win her hand, and the specifics of all of that. This is pretty engaging, but not as much as the critics would have you believe. The film does run long, and I'm not wholly convinced that it has the pace and content to sustain it. Like some others have mentioned, I did find my attention wavering a few times across the running time. This pace is helped by the style and animation, which creates a sense of patient beauty in how the film looks \u2013 so the opposite for example of the Batman Lego Movie, which feels like it is rushing you in and out of the movie from start to finish. Kaguya instead is beautifully animated in a way that seems so contrary to what can be done now with computer animation \u2013 where anything is possible, this focuses on creating beautiful frames with delicate strokes, and not having more than is necessary. As everyone says, it is a beautiful film in this way.The voicework in the English version maybe follows this too closely, and there is a certain 'downplayed' feel to the delivery from most of the cast. I think it all still works, and the famous names do generally hit their marks and deliver well \u2013 but I can understand the comments from others who say the cast occasionally sound bored, or subdued in their delivery; I took it as them matching the tone of the film and was fine with it.In the end, the animation is beautiful and it creates an engaging tone and pace for the film, even if I did think the content was not strong enough for the long running time and the slower pace. At heart though, the story of parents seeing their child grow was the element that stuck with me, and made it a mostly rewarding film, even if it is the animation that stands out above everything else.",

Basically a Bamboo Cutter (James Caan) is cutting down shoots, when he sees a shoot glowing, cutting it down he is shocked to find a baby girl growing inside, he takes her home where he and his wife (Mary Steenburgen) raise her as their own. Like a shoot of bamboo, the child who they call \"Princess\", is growing at a fast rate, earning her the nickname \"Little Bamboo\" from the local children, her adoptive father is protective for some time, but she becomes independent and makes real friends. Now a fully grown adolescent girl, and given the name Kaguya (Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz) by a priest, the Princess and her parents have become rich from another magical shoot of bamboo filled with a priceless gold substance, and they change to a higher class of living. Kaguya enthrals all who meet her, and being a mysterious beautiful young woman she gains the attention of many eligible men, specifically five men from prestigious families propose marriage to her, to help her decision who she will marry she asks each of them to find a memorable treasure and gift, including near impossible to find jewels. The men all find their task to prove their love and marry Kaguya impossible, with some of the men giving up and some trying to fake completing their task, eventually she is surprised to be proposed to by the Emperor of Japan. However, Kaguya finds out she must return to the Moon, where she came from, she is told she will be freed of all Earth's impurities, but also all her memories will be erased, she is granted a few moments to say goodbye to tearful parents, but in the end she floats away on a cloud going into the distance. Also starring Darren Criss as Sutemar, Lucy Liu as Lady Sagami, Beau Bridges as Prince Kuramochi, James Marsden as Prince Ishitsukuri, Eraser's Oliver Platt as Lord Minster of the Right Abe, Hynden Walch as Me no Warawa, Lois & Clark's Dean Cain as The Mikado, Daniel Dae Kim as Great Counselor Otomo, George Segal as Inbe no Akita and John Cho as Middle Counselor Isonokami. The cast dubbing the voices into English are all chosen well for their parts, the story is based on an old folk tale, it may be a little longer than it needs to be, have strange narratives, and be dull in places, but it has the right amount of emotional stuff to keep you watching, and you cannot deny the draughtsman style animation, not the same as past Studio Ghibli productions, is very good, overall it is an enjoyable animated fantasy drama. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Animated Feature Film of the Year. Worth watching!",

The \"simplicity\" or rather the hint of \"unfinished\" look in this animation made the story so much more important. No flamboyant colours or extremely detailed animations, which I often enjoy, but this was a fresh new look for me, and love it. The deep, immersive and somber story is made so alive by Mr. Takahata, and not to forget the gorgeous soundtrack, it will stay with me forever.

Yes, not even How to Train Your Dragon 2. One excuse was that The Tale of the Princess Kaguya hadn't been released in the UK yet, even though it had been floating around cinemas across the world for the past couple of years. Now released and featuring an English-dubbed cast consisting of Chloe Grace Moretz, James Caan, and Lucy Liu, it was time for redemption, and to watch what once slipped through my fingers. Or eyes. You know what I mean.Once upon time, in a galaxy far, far away, Mr Bamboo cutter, voiced by Sonny Corleone himself, James Caan, finds the tiniest of children hidden in a magical bamboo shoot and decides to take her under his, and his wife's, wing, raising her like their own and naming her Princess, due to her ability to grow at the speed of knots and develop much quicker than that of a mortal human. One day, Mr Bamboo cutter finds gold and cloth of fine quality in the same place he found his beloved Princess, and decides that she must be moved to the capital in order to fulfill her fate of nobility and become a real-life princess. First off, the film looks beautiful. In terms of effort and sheer elbow-grease the film must have required from the makers, it deserves a standing ovation, and I'm rather glad it got recognised by the Oscars, albeit losing out to the much more mainstream Big Hero 6. Each scene looks like it should be paused, printed out, and shoved in the Louvre for close examination. It is simply a wonder to behold. Now on to the story. Imagine the wonder of Pans Labyrinth. but set in the delicate world of a U rated movie; that's what came to mind during the course of Tale's simply glorious story that deals with all the key subjects of childhood, moving home, arranged marriage, and finally, fulfilling your destiny. The length of 137 minutes for an animated movie might be questionable, with the film suffering slightly during the half-way mark, but sticking with it results in one of the most heartbreaking, yet inevitable, endings of an animated movie you may ever see. In a nutshell? It's lovely.Overall Score: 8/10",

The story being told didn't fail to make me emotional several times during the film. Takahata movies rely heavily on the plot so it's really hard to fully praise his work while avoiding spoilers.

I love Ghibli and I went into this thinking it was another addition to the that specific genre that makes Ghibli's work so beautiful - the quiet, mature, ethereal movies that I had grown to love so much. But no. No, no, no.Right off the bat, this movie was so boring. It didn't capture or captivate me, and its story seemed nonsensical and simplistic. And I'm going to talk as much about the ending as I can without dying inside a second time. I just want to know whose idea it was to randomly send her to the moon (?) without any explanation or reasoning as an attempt at an ending. If you're going to incorporate the moon into your mythology for some reason, at least have some sort of setup.Something really didn't sit right with me with this animation style. It was one of the first hints that told me that this was going to be nothing like a Ghibli movie. And the pace was purely glacial. Additionally, if you're going to make a sad movie, please make it tasteful, as opposed to two hours of non-stop misery.In conclusion: no. That's it. Just no.-Sasha.",

            "content": "Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Rating: 4.7/5 starsBoasting narrative depth, unbridled candor, and exquisite visual beauty, \"The Tale of the Princess Kaguya\" is a modern animated treasure with timeless appeal. Legendary Studio Ghibli cofounder Isao Takahata (\"Grave of the Fireflies\", \"Pom Poko\") revisits Japan's most famous folktale in this gorgeous, hand-drawn masterwork, decades in the making. One day, an old bamboo cutter finds a princess side a shining stalk of bamboo. Along with his wife, he decides to raise the princess, who's only the size of a finger, but soon grows into an exquisite young lady. When Kaguya grows up, 5 men from prestigious families propose to her. Kaguya asks the men to find memorable marriage gifts for her, but they are unable to do so. Then, the Emperor of Japan himself proposes to her. The mysterious young princess enthralls all who encounter her, but ultimately she must confront her fate.From the studio that brought you \"Spirited Away\" (2001), \"Princess Mononoke\" (1997), \"Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind\" (1984), and numerous other animated classics comes a powerful and sweeping epic that redefines the limits of animated storytelling while marking a triumphant highpoint within an extraordinary career in filmmaking for director Isao Takahata. The Japanese have long been revered as masters of animation, and \"The Tale of the Princess Kaguya\" is a fitting farewell for one of the genre's greats.With its sumptuous images and impressionistic storytelling, the film is nothing short of a delicate, stirring fable - both joyous and melancholic. The animation notwithstanding, what makes \"Princess Kaguya\" stick in emotional terms is its depiction of an extraordinary girl, learning for herself that a life without real joy and spontaneity is only a shadow of a life. A charmingly sad story is sweetly told through breathtaking, hand-drawn sketches to give us a sweeping epic that's lyrical and heartbreaking in ways which most live-action movies can only aspire to. If there's a message here about the foolhardiness of parental expectations and societal conformations, it fades away in the face of the film's rapturous visuals.The fact that this film is animated using nothing more than a pen, pencil, brush, and watercolors shows that even today 2D done right brings more depth and visual appeal to a story than all the advanced CGI, 3D, razmattaz effects thrown together. Takahata and his team of animators meticulously craft each scene with hand-drawn sketches and mesmerizing textures that perfectly complements the themes of the whimsical story. \"Princess Kaguya\" boasts one hauntingly beautiful sight after another, seemingly built on nothing more than slight sketches and quick brushstrokes - something Hollywood movie moguls could learn from if they'd ever seek a way out of the exorbitant costs invested in their tech-savvy animated films.Featuring a heart-tugging story with characters that stay with you, and showcasing some the most gorgeous artwork in Japan's rich anime history, \"The Tale of the Princess Kaguya\" is a spellbinding spectacle that easily takes its position as one of Ghilbi's best works.",

It's not even a proper Japanese movie. It's an American movie, it's a Discworld movie, a Neil Gaiman fantasy novelization. It's a hippie movie disguised as a Ghibli picture. The major gripe I have about the whole affair is the way the story is derailed by the caprices of the magic which comes to mess up the kernel of heartfelt purity that had set off the movie.The birth of Kaguya is the best example of a supernatural act. It's familiar and unquestionable. Unlike later occurrences, you never doubt it's a dream sequence or a metaphor. The concept of miracle births have been drilled into us so soundly that we accept the childhood and disillusionment of Kaguya. What happens after the princes have failed in their quests is nothing but the admission (insert gratuitous box office joke) of the filmmakers that they have run out of imagination. This movie didn't make the splash it was no doubt vying to get and the anonymity that beckons will be very much deserved.",

Rather, since people in those days could hardly even imagine such acts, it would never happen for women to refuse the Emperor's courtship.Princess Kaguya, which appeared in the oldest Japanese tale, has first proposed the women's lifestyle to live of their own, taken for granted nowadays. Therefore she can be recognized as the \"super\" pioneer role model of today's women. However, the fact that such a way of life doesn't necessarily promise a simple happy end may well induce the sympathy of women.It is possibly difficult to conduct the background research of the Heian Era properly, so we often see a lot of weird descriptions about such ancient life in films even in live-action ones. Although the hand-drawing methods purposely used in this film are retrograde ones, by taking a tremendous amount of years and cost, this film completely sweeps away normal commercial films and successfully describes the life scenes at that time with genuine realities.Of course, although I have never seen \"the life scenes at that time\" before, beautiful and plentiful visual expressions, particularly in unique depicting techniques evoking our imagination, bring me a plausible feeling like \"oh, this is what it is used to be like\". For instance, like that the appearance of a palace is reminiscent of the Daikaku temple in Kyoto indeed built in the Heian Era, countless details also give the firm basis for world construction.If you feel like eating full of hamburgers or pizzas, see whatever entertainment film you want including Miyazaki's works. On the other hand, if you feel like tasting traditional and graceful cuisine, unfortunately, choices are quite limited these days. Therefore, this film is the extremely scarce one.",

There are some gaps in the narrative, but this remains a film that works on several levels. It is partially about a childless couple having the chance to realise their dream, but then it is also a tale of them coming to realise that they cannot dictate their daughter's happiness; i.e. it is about parents realising the importance of letting their children go. It is also a story of female empowerment with the title character giving her five suitors impossible quests to win her heart, since she does not wish to be owned by anyone. Furthermore, her empowerment tale is tinged with regret as she learns the unfortunate fates of her suitors, each one disadvantaged by attempting to complete her quests. Promising as this may sound, the film ends on a low note as things turn sentimental towards the end. Several narrative elements do add up either (the parents having the wealth to move to the city; the suitors all returning within a week of each other after a three-year hiatus), however, the quality of the animation constantly pushes the film through. The hand-drawn frames are incredibly effective, with a particular well done sequence in which she goes for a nighttime run and all the lines around her blur surreally together. The music is expectedly good too. If a far cry from director Isao Takahata's 'Grave of the Fireflies', this effort still offers an interesting, often touching story.",

            "content": "The story follows a Japanese folk tale and according to my Japanese friend, the film correlated with 80% of what she knew of the tale. Princess Kaguya is found by the Bamboo Cutter growing from a shoot in the forest. She fits into the size of his palm but soon becomes a rapidly growing baby. He decides to raise her as a Princess with his wife, deeming that the Heavens wanted so. However, Princess Kaguya receives many suitors and she feels stifled with her new status. Directed by Isao Takahata.Though the animation is not what we have become used to, it strongly portrays the emotions of the characters as well as enforces the mood of the scenes. It felt very expressionistic but was also vivid and bright at times, like an endless steam of paintings (though technically that is what animations are).There was this one scene which depicted Princess Kaguya running in the face of adversity and you could really tell that the animation were drawings with some very obvious pencil lines. However, it showed the act of fast movement really well and paired with dark colours to compliment the mood. That scene stood out to me and was exceptional in my opinion.I do feel that it could've cut short a few scenes. It's about 2 hours and 17 minutes long and during the middle it seemed to drag for awhile. It was not boring, but I was tired enough to be very sleepy and actually closed my eyes once or twice in the middle. Plus, the theatre seats were not very comfortable.Also, there was this one part near the end where something seemed to have happened but then it was totally disregarded and I'm left wondering what just happened. I can't tell much without giving it away but it just lost its continuity for a bit there. Oh, and there was the appearance of a certain religious figure that caused some discrepancy with what I knew of Japanese culture as well. It came as quite a shock to see that figure appearing almost randomly. I hadn't realized there was another Studio Ghibli film out, and I'm glad I caught this even though it wasn't in the mainstream cinemas. And though Hayao Miyazaki has retired and had no input in this, the film still stands up to its Ghibli reputation.Read more movie reviews at: championangels.wordpress.com",

            "content": "I have not watched many Japanese animation films. The only the other I have seen except this one is Spirited Away. But now I really consider watching them looking at the skills of the directors Hayao Miyazaki, Isao Takahata, etc. The tale of Princess Kaguya based on an old Japanese folktale is the story of a mysterious girl(named Kaguya later) who is discovered by a bamboo cutter in a bamboo stalk. He and his wife the raise baby girl as their own.Their house is situated in greenery of remote village in the mountains. Kaguya seems to grow very rapidly and becomes very close friends with gang of children in the neighborhood. Merrily singing and playing they enjoy the nature and Kaguya is having the most joyous time in her life. Her father though, envisions great things after he finds gold and fine clothes in other bamboo stalks. He thinks heaven wants Kaguya to become a princess and they need to raise her in that way. So off they go to the city and become a noble family with their gold. Kaguya who is initial happy with all the royal treatment soon understands the sorrows and bitterness in life when things are forced onto her. The story slightly loses its steam after the breezy first hour and I feel the run time could have been short by about 20 minutes. It dwells into complex themes of our world full of deceit and sorrow and the perceptions of cycles of life, afterlife hidden under its straight forward narrative. At times things get difficult to understand, still the visuals are so beautiful that you are completely engrossed into the scenery forgetting about the story. The ending which left me dazed was quite emotional and spiritually powerful. Despite some loose ends, the movie is overall well crafted with beautiful hand drawn animation and music. I felt it was emotionally moving and deeply profound. RATING: [4/5]",

            "content": "Thought this was pretty good, but definitely didn't love it.Felt a little too long, and I didn't 100% the animation style. Often it was striking, and there were some beautiful sequences, but sometimes it came across kind of rough and lacking in detail. I have to assume there was a stylistic reason for much of the frame to be left white in some shots, for example. I can't mark it down too much for things I'm not sure about, lest I come across like too much of an arrogant, out of touch westerner.Wasn't like my experience with Spiderverse either, unfortunately, where I found the animation jarring for 5 or so minutes before settling into its look and loving it.\nI will say I at least respected Princess Kayuga for having a bold visual style that I haven't really seen in another movie, even if said visual style wasn't one I always loved.I was looking forward to the story, having no idea what it was about going in, but it came across a little simple and surprisingly familiar, despite the 130-something minute runtime to work with. That being said: there are some great sequences, and it really nails its final 20-25 minutes.Oh, and the music is 100% fantastic. I can say that quite comfortably.So overall: not something I loved, but I did end up liking more about it than I disliked, so feel like it was 2+ hours fairly well spent.",

The watercolor-like visuals are beautiful, the characters' expressions are genuine and the whole feature is just so captivating.Not only you will be able to observe Japanese culture, you will also be able to watch helplessly hilarious and sometimes depressing traits of human beings. True that some of the scenes could be strange or even confusing but if we understand the underlying message of this Japanese folktale, we can learn invaluable life lessons from just watching this. Overall, you may find watching The Tale of Princess Kaguya (2013) a haunting experience due to the nature and the style of the this animated feature.Nonetheless, I won't say The Tale of Princess Kaguya (2013) is perfect as there are several aspects I do not like, but there are certainly more aspects to like than dislike. Due to that, this animated feature is possibly one of the best retelling of Japanese folktale in films. Therefore, it is one of my favorite animated feature of all time.As expected of Studio Ghibli's co-founder director Isao Takahata; The Tale of Princess Kaguya (2013) is unique in its own charm. I have seen the original Japanese version and I am pleased to report that this animated feature is definitely not your average flick. The ending is slightly weird but you will leave all sorrow behind after watching it.",

The expectations were sort of mixed since it was the first film after Hayao Miyazaki's retirement, and nobody could really tell what Studio Ghibli can come up with now.But when you actually start watching The Tale of The Princess Kaguya, all these politics and worries immediately dissipate. This film is SO visually different from what Hayao Miyazaki made, yet there's the same delicate touch and emotionality flowing from every second of it. It is like the paintings came to life to tell us a story. The story beautiful as life itself. In a way, it can be viewed as a parable about life, nature and humanity's futile attempts to ensnare it for its own vain entertainment.But, honestly, no analysis does The Tale of The Princess Kaguya any good. Some things are better if left as they are, for us to simply contemplate their beauty without trying to touch it or make it our own. And this is exactly the reason why it's pointless to dissect this movie into details and describe them here. Simply watch it, and you will be spiritually rewarded.",

The visual story is told so masterfully that I didn't feel that I gained much more insight after re-watching with subtitles. Length is not an issue here - Takahata takes time to complete the narrative, and for a good reason. The leisurely pace mesmerizes the viewer and allows investment in the characters. By the final moments, which unfold to an ethereal, psychedelic melody, there's not a dry eye in the house. The audience wept audibly both in Japan and U.S. screenings. Considering the similar effect of \"Grave of the Fireflies\", Takahata may be an even greater emotional manipulator than Spielberg, but a far less maudlin one. Although the film deals with universal themes that could easily turn into clich\u00e9s (parenting, social mobility, death, etc.), in the hands of this director they invite profound contemplation.The animated images are among Ghibli's most beautiful - they seem to be equally inspired by 12th-century Genji scrolls and modernist Rimpa-school nature paintings. One amazing scene, of Kaguya's brief \"rebellion\", is downright expressionistic. It's probably my favorite animation sequence of all time.",

            "review_title": "Little Bamboo! Little Bamboo!",
            "content": "Takahata's Kaguya is based on the Japanese folktale The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter, considered one of the first early examples of prose. It's a very Eastern narrative - Kaguya is part of a divine race who lives on the moon, and despite her highs and lows on Earth, is destined to return someday. I am reminded of a similar Chinese folktale, about a beautiful but vain woman who abandoned her earthly life and husband in an attempt to reach the heavens, but flew much too short, and was destined to spend the rest of her days on the moon. Neither reach the gut wrenching lows of Takahata's Grave of the Fireflies, but Kaguya's tale is tinged with hints of regret, nostalgia, and longing for various things. It's an increasingly rare but stunning example of traditional style animation, as per Ghibli standards. This one is even more unique. The old folktale is brought to life from its traditional roots; dark lines streak across the frame and fade out as if the brush needs more ink, splashes of watered down colours seep into the picture, and like the old scroll paintings, the background is often non-existent, blank and white. This is both good and bad - in some instances the film demands that the depth of the background be visible in order to immerse you into the world: the bustling marketplace in the capital, but more importantly, the grassy hills and trees of the countryside that she treasures the most of all. It's less concerned with light and shadow and detail (like many animes) and more concerned with a simplistic and serene portrayal of the story. But it also lends itself to the film's emotion - in one particular scene Kaguya is frightened and angry at being a plaything for her father to parade and put on a pedestal, and so she escapes in an otherworldly manner into the wilderness. Immediately the colour palette is muted and the shadows grow large and frantic. The art suddenly becomes frenzied as if the painter is feeling the same thing as Kaguya; the lines are streaky and messy and chaotic, the watery smooth ink is replaced by rough charcoal outlines. It's something that cannot be captured in a still frame, her fluid and furious movement frenetic. Her brows furrow (for the last time in a while) in pain and anger as she sheds layers of fine robes and runs through the streets underneath a gigantic full moon (foreshadowing her past and future). It's a remarkable scene. This is similar to the suitor's hunt for the jewel of a water dragon's neck. This too is stunningly portrayed, imagination fully realised as the embodiment of the deep sea roars and splashes against the tiny boat. We know that such fantastic and terrible things do not exist on this Earth, but can't we pretend? I have seen some complaints about the runtime and how some sequences should simply be trimmed. I do not agree. Aside from the absurd notion that shorter is better, Kaguya's life on Earth is much more substantial when showing us everything; every stolen honeydew melon in the summer heat, every childhood song, every delicious communal pheasant stew (or lack of). The way that the baby Kaguya's animation and story are handled is sublime and tender. True, she is still growing up way too fast (actually a device that is not needed, seeing as she slows down later in life to match the adult Sutemaru anyway). But we are allowed to grow up with her, every step along the way. Another director might have utilised a two minute or so montage to illustrate her early years, especially those first steps as a toddler. Takahata allows us to take delight in growing up with our very own little bamboo. Hisaishi's scores is up to his usual standards, with one track, The Procession of Celestial Beings, being the standout. It's a lively tune that trades the grace and serenity of the xylophone, triangle and flute with the heavier majesty of the brass and strings. At first I found it a little jarring, but on refection it's oddly appropriate. For the moon people, it's of course a celebration that their princess is returning. It's a stark contrast to the tragic farewell of Kaguya to her earthly life. Another thing, the English dub is surprisingly good (although it is Ghibli). Often I preferred it to the original Japanese because Moretz is less shrill and softer, more mature as she should be. For the few instances of singing however, the Japanese is a must, more beautiful and sincere than the awkward translation. And of course the songs are vital to the narrative. True, the themes are simple and we've seen it before. The longing for the idyllic childhood, the rough damsel in a refined society, the rebellion against parental and societal expectations, the what-could-have-been romance etc. But it's done with such nuance and emotional depth. We have the father, who's good intentions become a classic desperation for status and wealth and recognition in the ignorance of his daughter's true desires. Kaguya's struggle is something we have all experienced before in some ways, but her individual circumstances are tragic. Even with all the male suitor's fighting over her sexuality and her unhappiness with conforming to the court, her earthly existence is a meaningful one compared to an eternally stagnant nirvana on the moon. How many films can elicit such pain and nostalgic longing with such a simple but haunting song? The Tale of the Princess Kaguya is about life after all, the ebbs and flows of joy and sadness, the sudden but inevitable end. If Hollywood has made this, it would be about life too, but it'd be an optimistic bildungsroman. Not that there's anything wrong with that of course, but we do need more films like this.",

            "content": "I'm conflicted about folktales. What began as bits and pieces of oral literature, before someone had the good sense to put them to paper, are owed some amount of respect for being among the first stories that humans told. However, so many of the principles that we consider essential to the telling of a \"good story\" were developed \u2014 and are still developing \u2014 many generations after the birth of these yarns. Ancient storytellers didn't have the benefit of thousands of years of literature to lend them a detailed understanding of structure, character development, conflict, or how to make these elements compelling. I don't mean to be so hard on the awkward adolescence of modern literature, but folktales tend to be pretty bad stories. The process of adaptation can inject modern storytelling sensibilities into an otherwise crappy narrative, but in the case of the 2013 Studio Ghibli film KAGUYA-HIME NO MONOGATARI (The Story of Princess Kaguya) filmmaker Isao Takahata was unable to give this fable the contemporary touch it needs.KAGUYA-HIME NO MONOGATARI is based on the oldest known Japanese narrative, \"The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter,\" believed to be written in the 10th century. It tells the story of a poor man who finds a tiny girl in a stalk of bamboo. He takes the girl home to his wife, and they decide to raise her as their own and name her Kaguya. As she grows, Kaguya's otherworldly beauty becomes more apparent, and suitors begin to ask for her hand in marriage. She turns all of them down, rejecting the concept of marriage outright. At the end of the story, Kaguya must return to where she came from \u2014 the moon.As is clear from the premise of the tale and the opening scene of the movie when she is found, the titular character is not your average girl. Aside from her unusual discovery, we are first made aware of this in the scene where her adoptive father brings her home. She suddenly grows from a well-proportioned little person like Thumbelina or one of the Borrowers to something like a human infant. Considering that Takahata has always been the teller of more realistic stories compared Hayao Miyazaki (Studio Ghibli cofounder and legendary animator) and his flights of boundless imagination, this moment is one of the first instances in the movie that showcases Takahata's unique ability to blend the fantasy of this tale with the realism he is more experienced with crafting. It's so understated that it borders on unsettling.The first act of the movie is top-tier coming-of-age type stuff. The main character makes fast friends with some local boys and begins exploring the world around her home. Her father wishes to refer to her as hime, or \"princess,\" but her new pals dub her takenoko, or \"bamboo,\" to his chagrin. Her micro adventures cement one of the central themes within the film \u2014 the Buddhist ideal that a simple life is a good life. Once her father begins discovering piles of gold inside his bamboo harvests, it is only a matter of time before he whisks his little family away to an expensive palace where Takenoko will get the grooming she needs to become the princess the bamboo cutter intends for her to be. It is here that Takenoko \u2014 now referred to as Kaguya \u2014 begins to really develop as a character. At first, she openly basks in the luxuries of an affluent life but quickly begins to reject the expectations of one at her station \u2014 that is, etiquette, physical alterations, and eventually marriage.The story arc with the suitors is what I have the most problems with. They show up and boast all of the treasures they could lay at Kaguya's feet, but each boldly proclaims that Kaguya would be the most prized possession were she his. The princess rejects the notion of being objectified like a rare gemstone or precious metal and sends the suitors away. A few of them return later to prove their love through deception, but the young girl sees through their lies and sends them away once more, even refusing the proposal of the emperor of Japan. All of this is important to Kaguya's growth as a character. It proves that she is still the self-reliant tomboy she was as a poor bamboo cutter's daughter, despite all her pampering. The problem is that it lacks any of the understated magic that's so pervasive throughout the rest of the film and quickly begins to feel like a stuffy period piece instead of the fantastical folktale that it is. In a scene where the princess is doing something as uncomplicated as learning to play music, there is a mysticism surrounding her affinity for the instrument. All of this mystery and intrigue disappears as soon as these hopeful husbands show up. It bogs down the film to the point that by the time it's over, the audience has already been checking their watches for almost half an hour.To read the rest of this review, please visit: http://tinyurl.com/lylp5pz",

Doesnt age well, many disturbing depiction of women eventhough its the reality back in the day but now its hard to swallow. Not recommended.",

            "content": "When I think of animated films, my mind is not filled with enchanting scenes from Fantasia or talking toys or many of the other things that seem to be so exhilarating to mass audiences. Popularity and entertainment have grown less exciting to me the more that I watch movies. I want to be caressed with a beautiful idea and allowed to ponder it for a while. That's why I love Studio Ghibli. Or, that's at least one reason why I love Ghibli.Other contenders for best animated film might be... Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind, Grave of the Fireflies, Princess Mononoke, or the beautiful \"recobbled cut\" of The Princess and the Cobbler. I think that The Tale of Princess Kaguya is easily a contender. Not for greatest of 2014 (WHY Big Hero 6?) but of all time.Animation-wise, it is near the very top. It is every bit as entrancing as Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind. Of course, Princess Mononoke has more detail in its art and The Princess and the Cobbler is in a class of its own. (If you've never seen The Princess and the Cobbler - Recobbled Cut on YouTube, watch it now - its Salvador Dali meets Andy Warhol). The animation is minimalistic to the point that it actually enhances and adds to the experience. Your mind is allowed to fill in the blanks. The \"suggestions\" made by the animators are absolutely breathtaking. The spirit of Japan comes to life in their strokes.Considering the animated films that are being released today (Walt Disney Studios, for example, treats its audience like mindless garbage receptacles), Princess Kaguya is more than a breath-of-fresh-air, it is a very important film. It says something that very few movie studios have the guts to say. That money doesn't matter - life should be pure. That's what this movie pines for - purity. And how so lacking are America's studios today! Hollywood has become a business rather than a laboratory. It no longer makes films; instead, we are subjected to 2- hour-long trailers for merchandise. Kaguya is a real masterpiece and work-of-art. It deserves to be celebrated. And it deserved the Oscar. Maybe it's too good for the Oscars.",

The story is wonderfully fresh. In the first half, the princess was portrayed as a tomboy because she grew up in the countryside. In the second half, the princess is portrayed with more grace. The princess frolicking under the cherry blossoms was beautiful. The sound of the zither was also good. The emperor was the worst, arrogant and forceful. It was interesting that the boy who was her childhood friend called her \"bamboo shoot\". At the end of the story, the princess was drawn back to the moon, which was very touching.",

            "review_title": "A fitting finale for Studio Ghibli's Isao Takahata",
            "content": "I like Japanese folk tales because of their simplicity and unique wisdom. It also gives me the opportunity to imagine impressive landscapes in rural and premodern Japan. 'The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter' is one of those really old folk tales, which dates back in the 10th century. So even before watching Takahata's 'The Tale of The Princess Kaguya', I think I will most probably like the film too because it was adapted from a folk tale. Well, it turned out to be one of the artistically unusual animated films that I have ever seen.First impression was it felt like an old Japanese painting that came to life, but then later on, it felt like a dream rather than a painting. It was that good, and it mainly succeeds as a cultural film. This is a must-see for animation and Japanese folk tale enthusiasts.Most of the time, the pacing was at cruise speed, which allowed the environment to breath. We see beautiful landscapes done in watercolor and simple strokes, and generally, they looked more like an artist's sketch in a good way. These were accompanied by the relaxing sounds of nature, and the outcome has effectively immersed the viewer into its dreamy scenes. The experience was made even better because of its notable music. Combine these with its topnotch voice talent (Japanese version) and well-written dialogue arguably results to one of the most remarkable films in the animation genre.Although the theme is rather familiar, the film has given not just a good story to tell but a memorable experience. It is mainly about the search for happiness, and it has allusions to religious teachings about the person's earthly life, where there are sufferings and impurities, and the afterlife in heaven, where there are only peace and happiness. In fact if this theme is told in a motion picture, the result will most probably be just so-so. In this way, the film has achieved a remarkable feat and has ended it memorably with delightful tunes and scenes that elicit reflection on our life in this world. There was a certain facet, where the film didn't quite hit its target though. This was during the scenes where the emotions should have been powerful, but since you don't really have a good clue on what the character was talking about, these scenes rather felt a little bit awkward. Perhaps, the other world, where the princess came from, was not developed well at that point. This issue is easy to set aside though because the overall viewing experience has been great already. As a person who have some inclination towards instrumental music, it was not hard to notice the impressive music that Joe Hisaishi has composed in this film. This is arguably one of his best works among the Studio Ghibli films that I have seen. In the case of Isao Takahata's directing achievement, this is comparable to his solid work in the 'Grave of the Fireflies'; perhaps even matched it. Nonetheless, this film is indeed a fitting finale for his career in the animation industry, and this is one of the films that he will be remembered best.",

This great film by Isao Takahata was her first choice, and I was pleasantly surprised by how much my son also enjoyed it. It's the only \"Princess movie\" in the Ghibli canon (Princess Mononoke doesn't actually fit the genre in my view), but with few if any allusions to Disney. Instead it's closely modeled after a famous medieval Japanese tale, the Bamboo Cutter, which is also heavily Buddhist. Despite its 2013 release date, Kaguya is traditionally animated, though none of its production cels or backgrounds seem to have been on the market or at auction. I was very intrigued by how the animation recalls the illumination of medieval Japanese manuscripts, starting with the opening credits, which are against the background of multi-colored paper. To me, illuminated manuscripts are much closer to traditional animation art than, say, oil painting (more on The Painting soon). I could almost imagine, especially while watching the scenes of princess Kaguya running, someone flipping rapidly through an old manuscript book of the Bamboo Cutter. But then I remembered that they were scrolls, not codices, so much for that interpretation...",

            "content": "Finally! It has been almost two years since I've seen an anime movie that moved me. A Ghibli production, I should've known. While The Wind Rises did almost nothing for me, Isao Takahata's swan song maybe even trumped his debut (Grave of the Fireflies). It's almost impossible not to compare Hayao Miyazaki's final film to the one of Takahata. Both are founding fathers of Studio Ghibli and both announced their retirement in the same year. But unlike Takahata, Miyazaki's last work was a bit too much history and a bit too little fantasy. Something I really adore in Ghibli productions. Over all I like Miyazaki better than Takahata exactly because of the fantasy aspect in their works. Now the rolls are reversed: Miyazaki showed us his take on the interbellum in Japan through the eyes of Jiro Horikoshi, while Takahata brought us a captivating vision of one of the oldest Japanese folktales: \"The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter\" from the 10th century. His drawing is primitive and almost the antipode of Miyazaki's more refined style. Because of that I suppose some people will find this too childish or even amateuristic. I see it as an authentic and functional (an old tale requires not too sophisticated drawings) asset to this movie. For me it probably wouldn't have worked any other way. Last year I was a bit disappointed by the lack of truly majestic anime (referring to Wolf Children and A Letter to Momo) and after seeing The Wind Rises I gave up hope for this year too. Now that I've seen The Tale of Princess Kaguya, I again look forward to some new anime productions; Hiromasa Yonebayashi's When Marnie Was There in particular!",

If you find yourself not enjoying the first 15 minutes, stop there and save yourself a two hour of slow pace movie.I have watched thousands of movies and this is the first (and probably the only!) movie I am writing a review for. This in itself is a testimony of how breathtaking this movie is. It is a redefinition of the word masterpiece (I would not say this movie is perfect. No such thing exists!)The beauty of this art piece is in the combination of visuals, sound, and story telling. Lets break it down:Visuals: The mix of charcoal and watercolor style in this movie is indeed mesmerizing. Visuals is the strongest point of the movie. I found myself pausing the movie many times just to enjoy the sheer beauty of the paintings. The colors are chosen soooo brilliantly and scenes are extremely vibrant. I can watch the movie without audio and still get the orgasmic feeling of joy from the visuals. The creativity of this art style in my opinion is nothing short of likes of Van Gough or Picasso.Sound: I have watched the movie both in English and Japanese with subtitles. I do not understand Japanese, but in my surprise, the mixture of music and Japanese sound is so fulfilling. I cannot imagine if the characters were real, they would sound any differently. (The English dub is also decent).Story: Slow pace but enjoying. It builds up characters as realistic as possible. The simple sound tracks accompanied by minimalistic visuals truly engraves the right feelings in you. From the princess's furious run to even things as simple as tying of hair, all build up the emotions. Like many others have stated, it brings smile, and tears to your face and in your heart. The story is suited for adults and is overall sad. (do NOT show it to your kids! You will regret it and it will ruin the movie for the adults too). And finally, this is a movie whose feelings you will carry with yourself for quite some time after the ending.You should expect to see this level of art created once in a lifetime, as it was Isao Takahata's swan song.

            "content": "\"Tale of Princess Kaguya is a 2013 Studio Ghibli film. Despite being from Ghibli it has a very unique art style compared to their other anime classics. It still hits all the usual Ghibili trademarks, the animation is still beautiful, the Joe Hisaishi music is lovely, and the voice acting is top-notch.The story is based on an old Japanese fairy-tale. A bamboo cutter finds a tiny girl in the woods one day as he is cutting bamboo. He and his wife then raise this girl that they see as a gift from the heavens. The gril grows up at a magically accelerated rate, and the adoptive parents try to understand how they should raise their newly found daughter.The story takes a few different twists and turns, none of which I'll spoil here. But as soon as I thought I was getting an idea of where the story was going, and what direction it was taking, the plot would take an unexpected turn. I liked that about this movie. It was not clear from where the movie began exactly how the movie ends. Likewise, there are various themes and lessons that could be extracted from this tale. The different choices that the story makes may confuse or even frustrate some viewers. For me, I like the fact that it takes such bold swings with the story.But the film is not without its shortcomings, here are some things I didn't care for in the story. The relation between the daughter and parents, particularly the father, is that typical kids' movie, parents don't listen or understand trope. For as excited as the parents were to raise this heaven child, they don't end up spending all that much time with her. Usually they pawn her off on villagers or servants to do the raising for them. Second would be Kaguya herself. There are many parts throughout the story where her motivation will drastically shift. Even one point where the narrator simply says that she became like a \"completely different person\". It can become difficult to understand a character's motivation when they are so frequently changing.The expert presentation and unique story with many unexpected story points is enough for me to recommend this movie. It may be a little sketchy in places, but it comes together in the end.",

I came to the conclusion this is a masterpiece of a film.The Tale of the Princess Kaguya is far more mature than an R rated film and far more complex than the Oscar-bait films we receive year after year. This is a story of a girl having her happiness destroyed by others. It critiques patriarchy and even Feudal Japan tradition. It resonates on the human condition and both the beauty and pain brought about by life. It's heart-wrenching and tragic. It's beautiful and enjoyable. It will leave you unsure and uncomfortable, but in awe of its storytelling.This film isn't afraid to add depth to its characters (especially its wonderful leading lady Kaguya), to present darkness and compelling themes in a medium still considered childish, and to proceed at a lengthy, but comfortable pace in order to properly explore its characters, themes, and storytelling. What we are left with is a multidimensional masterpiece that will likely be timeless.Other objects of merit are the fantastic Japanese and English dubbing, the beautiful naturalistic art style, and the utterly spectacular soundtrack.

Some of the scenes might also bring confusion to the younger audiences due to the godly character of the princess that amazed other characters.I think compare to other Western animated films, this could be compared to UP or Toy Story because it has the element of comedy, heart-warming, but could also stirred-up emotions -- although this particular movie has different inside jokes that Westerners may not get.

This also explores the compelling spiritual worlds and their relationship between the human world.But what captures the pure essence and story of the film is the animated masterpiece of visually captivating landscape poetry and fabulous colour that brings the story alive and intro your heart.

The characters in particular are incredible: from their designs to their voice acting (in Japanese at least) and clear personalities, they are a high point of the movie (the 5 princes!)

She was born into this world and ought to make a difference: after all, she was born from bamboo. Nostalgia hits the heart and you hope for the best but this tale may be too mature for a feeble viewing. Its grandiose script shed any cliches of a princess longing for a prince to save her. The impact she has on the people around her and her introspective struggles aligned all to well with human suffering. Do not get me wrong, this is a beautiful struggle, but a serious one.

Disney needs to take a note, movies can have happy endings as long as it works and Ponyo is the best example of that, but sometimes the perfect happy ending can be too much like if in hunchback of Notre dame (my favourite Disney film) if Quasimoto had to sacrifice himself to kill Frollo and just ended with Esmerelda with the knight, I generally think that would have made the movie better.",

Having said that, it was torture sitting that long in the movie hoping for a different outcome than what we would eventually be presented. I don't know the source folk tale the movie was based on but I do see traces of the Little Mermaid in it. It just shows how universal some fairy tale themes are and how they are altered just a tad depending on the culture. If I was basing my enjoyment just on the last half and it's length, I would give this a lower rating. However, I am basing this on the fact that Studio Ghibli continues to put out meaningful movies, ala, \"Graveyard of the Fireflies.\" While there is a place for fantastical worlds and Disneyfied endings to fairy/folktales for the occasional escapism one needs to take in life, the source material for those Disney movies were very dark. I think it's necessary to fill one's childhood with a good balance of both because life doesn't always go how you want. There was nary a child in my showing which is a shame because I think mature children could have enjoyed this as well. The surprise in my showing was that there were so many men in the audience who did not look like they were drug there by a wife or girlfriend.

To my delight, Studio Ghibli has done it once again and produced another fantastic movie. One that delivers a beautiful, emotional narrative about a bamboo cutter who discovers a tiny princess growing from one of the shoots, who then grows up to become royalty only to feel misplaced, without an sense of identity and at times feels isolated. One that delivers blissful, traditional sounding Japanese folk scores and a very unique, water-coloured based animation style, hand crafted to perfection. The film focuses primarily on the princess and her short but memorable life on Earth. The tale features many different themes that keep the story diverse and engaging, and the ending provides a prefect sense of closure while being hugely powerful and heart- wrenching. The film is also very mature and provides all round entertainment for people of all ages-not just young children. The film does have a few flaws however that just slightly hold it back from being a 'perfect 10', the first being its length at 2hrs 17mins certain parts certainly felt dragged out, especially when arriving in the capital during the second act and some extremely slow paced scenes that aren't hugely interesting or gripping. These however barely take from the experience of this beautiful film and proving once again Studio Ghibli are the masters of anime and a huge influence on animation films in general. 8/10",

            "content": "\"The tale of the princess kaguya\" is an anime that really needs more attention, though I have to say that it's not a movie for everybody, especially not for the average anime fan. It's a movie drama that presents what a noble woman has to go through in the mediaeval times of japan in order to be socially accepted and be called beautiful. It goes even a bit father and touches the controversy of the mediaeval believe that woman only need to be beautiful and to get a noble husband to be happy. But don't expect a deep psychological approach on this aspect, since it only barely goings into this topic. However, what you do see is the story of a little girl that tries to refuses these norms and that tries to be her old self which doesn't succeed and she becomes more and more that, what she didn't want to be.StoryThe story is about a girl that magically comes into life and grows up on the countryside of japan with her father being a bamboos cutter, who then later realized he wants her daughter to grow up in the capital learning \"the ways of a noble princess\". This decision was made way too late leading to the girls unhappiness, since she had already seen the opposite world of joy and laughter on the countryside, which obviously is the one little kids will like more, but she still tries to, since she wants to make her father happy, who desperately believes her happiness lies in becomming a \"noble princess\". Now getting taught how to act as a noble woman and how to dress, she more and more wants to get back to her old home. The story is maybe similar presented as the american movie \"Memorie of a Geisha\" with only the main protagonist NOT wanting to become a beauty.The story itself starts off very slowly, especially with her being a baby. The childhood feels uninteresting at first but is later appreciated because of the built up to her emotions and the part with her being in the capital was made in a fitting pacing to keep you interested.CharacterThe main protagonist, the little girl who slowly grows up over the duration of the movie is by far the most interesting character of the film (kinda understandable since she is the focus). You see her laughing, crying, getting angry, getting depressed and even as an emotionless doll. You see her developing from a country kid to a well taught adult who sees no happiness in how the world wants her to be. Her father and her mother are the 2 second most important character, on the one hand, the mother giving her confidence and supporting what she wants and on the other hand the father who wants her to become a princess not seeing what really makes her happy. In my opinion was the father-figure too little portrayed, but at least they had a few conflicts between her and her father in the movie.Sound / ArtstyleThe sound and artstyle are probably the reasons why this movie gets so emotional. What especially impressed me that the already unique arstyle changes with the tone of the show, making emotional outbreaks even more gripping. It has a very nice soundtrack attached to it with a main theme played on the koto (so in the style of the mediaeval japan), which was very fitting to the drama parts. The sound changes as well perfectly with the tone of the movie. The animation is very fluid and shows great effort (it's a movie after all) ,the arstyle is hold simple, like in previous Ghibli works such as \"My neighbors the yamadas\".ConclusionIf you want to see a movie similar in style to other Ghibli firms this one wont be it. This is a drama movie with the intention to show you a sad story about a girl and her conflicts with society in the mediaeval japan. It got a very interesting way of storytelling and a perfectly fitting arstyle and soundtrack to get you emotionally connected to what is happening. And if you enjoy those kind of thing, then I highly recommend watching this movie.",

I completely agree with Mr. Nishimura. The film has a minimalist style taking some resemblance to My Neighbors Yamadas, but more colorful, more poetic and picturesque, and more artistically soaring in visual style. The plot is simple and beautiful. The soundtrack is awesome.In his career at Ghibli, Takahata has made just 5 animated feature films for 25 years (including Grave of the Fireflies), roughly a half as much as Miyazaki Hayao's works (9 films), but as the more time went by, the better and the more creative Takahata has been in making his works. And with Kaguya, he has reached his highest peak in the life of creation. In my own opinion, this film is as excellent as Miyazaki's Spirited Away in general: less symbolic but way visually better than Miyazaki's work.And like Grave of the Fireflies or Only Yesterday, Kaguya's ending leaves some melancholy in audiences' mind, though it is so predictable. Perhaps it's the melancholy not only about the film, but also about a rare gem in animation which has gone far far away and would never come back, like Kaguya.",

Everyone came here for Miyazaki Hayao, but I came for another director Isao Takahata. Miyazaki Hayao's Spirited Away and Howl's Moving Castle are riddles for me forever, so I prefer the works of Isao Takahata relatively, easy to be understood but profound too.Farewell Firefly of Isao Takahata was criticized before: as the aggressive nation in the war, Japan was dressed as the victim of war in the film. Actually, Farewell Firefly is across the region to tell the destruction of human life and happiness by war, and this kind of destruction appears again in his new work The Tale of Princess Kaguya.The movie opens with the myth that the bamboo even gives birth to a beautiful girl, named \"Bamboo\", and she grows faster than normal people (therefore to meet the tragedy quicker?). The old man thinks she is a princess, so she was sent to the palace.The movie shots are very special that most of the backgrounds are static, however, the stationary scenery on the background is already very beautiful, and Bamboo in the foreground is lively; while since she leaves her hometown, her name is changed to Kaguya which means light shine. Then it is turn for Bamboo to become stationary, as she could not appear and move freely due to the ethics. Thereby her freedom is forbidden and happiness is vanished.The ending of the story is different from what I have heard - Bamboo returned to the hometown and found her lover had married and had a son. The movie has this scene, but it is just a dream of her lover, and Bamboo does not know his marriage in the dream too. On the contrary, the ending echoes the beginning, with a sense of myth. Bamboo cries to the moon, then the Buddha sends a messenger to pick her up. When she is put on feathers, all her memory losses, but she still takes a glance at the hometown at the end.",

Well, all winds change, they must adapt to the surroundings and this amazing Studio is not different from the others - Hayao Miyazaki was a big and solid mountain but everything must evolve (he did too, in his latest films).

The animation style is simplistic yet exquisitely done in that simplicity: it echoes the traditional Japanese art and style you won't see in modern-day anime, which I'm not saying is bad, but \"Kaguya\" is a refreshing breath of air. The voice acting is superb, as is the norm with Ghibli's productions, and the choice of music and songs are almost heartbreakingly beautiful (the harvest song especially). The plot is a little slow and... well, non-exciting, as it is essentially a tale of a girl waiting to be married off: this plot takes up the majority of the film, but the subplots of Kaguya's wishes versus her father's hopes, is constantly there and the viewer is moved by the protagonist's simple desires and wishes. While it lacks the action of its predecessors, it makes up for it with the sheer joy of its own being: once again, the music, animation and characters themselves bring so much life to it.I would recommend it to anyone who likes Studio Ghibli, and maybe a few tissues for the ending which is rather bittersweet.",

            "content": "Isao Takahata's The Tale of Princess Kaguya is a beautifully crafted epic. The animation, atypical of the style of Ghibli-style blockbuster we've come to expect and love in the UK, is delicate and beautiful. It is of no surprise that this melancholic triumph received an Oscar nomination for best animated film this year.Based on 10th Century Japanese folklore, it follows the life of a humble bamboo cutter who stumbles upon a glowing stalk, a tiny, hand-sized girl growing within. Returning home to his wife with excitement, the child rapidly transforms from baby, to toddler, to infant in a beautifully animated transition. Though the genuine film can be seen with subtitles, the dubbed version stars a formidable cast of Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz, Darren Criss, James Caan and Lucy Lui that compliments the animation impeccably. It's then down to personal preference as to which you'd rather experience.The tale beautifully and poignantly manifests itself as a parable-like journey, staying relatively true to its historical and mystical routes. The story follows the family as the bamboo cutter moves them to the city in order to fulfil Kaguya's destiny of becoming a princess. Though it is never clear as to how or why the father made the connection between his adoptive child and her future of royalty, the film rifles on and allows the little plot indiscretions to go largely unquestioned. The balance between humour and solemnity helps the narrative flow whilst making you feel real empathy for Kaguya and her situation. Whimsical moments deliver in captivating you entirely.The film also injects sorrow, particularly as the princess struggles with her new life away from the farm, friends and freedom she grew up with. And While her life moves on, the film develops upon these points before flowing lovingly into a situation in which the Princess sends five potential love interests on a mission to find for her an unobtainable gift. The new development, in which Kaguya finally embraces her power, is charming and brilliant! Animated entirely from the modern innovation of ink and watercolour, the definition in the penmanship drives the tone of the film. In moments of calm the pen marks curve delicately, whilst in times of trouble ink is sharp, aggressive and unfinished. The effect adds peace and rigour respectively, another layer to enhance the story. The Tale of Princess Kaguya is a welcome departure from this over-saturated CGI market that, whilst great in its own mediums, has detracted from the flare of ink based animation. Here Isao Takahata reminds us that it is still a daring art form that can craft glorious movies such as this.The entire film is held together exquisitely by another Joe Hisaishi masterclass. The stirring soundtrack adding beauty, elegance and hope to an already sublime film. The concluding piece of music is harrowing, yet delightful in the ultimate juxtaposition of image and sound. The score alone will have you scurrying home and downloading it just to hear it again.The Tale of Princess Kaguya is surprising and captivating, a true victory of imagination. With folklore at it's heart it airs on ridiculous, but remains grounded enough to thrill. The story is simple enough, but ends with a profound message.Originally written for: I'm With Geek",

            "content": "It really is hard to put across how beautiful the animation is in this movie - whilst I expect no less from the artists/Studio in question, this movie made me want to pick up a pen and draw as each line felt perfectly placed and simply stunning. It's a zany fairy tale story (and not particularly western, but all the more refreshing for it) that is simple and heart warming and it's told with a lot of thought and care put in to every moment. The English dub (I had to watch with this due to the small screen size making the subtitles option impractical for my viewing) is read beautifully and the songs and wisdom of the words is translated without any loss of meaning or impact.I've had this film on my \"to watch list\" for sometime and my biggest regret is taking so long to get to it - and I'm looking forward to watching it again soon!",

            "content": "The title suggests that the story is based on a fairy tale. For this reason it is difficult to evaluate the story itself, but the realisation and the drawing give room for an evaluation. The drawing style is grandiose and fits wonderfully with the minimalist narrative, which is almost at the beginning very fast and yet at the same time inconspicuous.Many of the gimmicks that can obviously be traced back to the fairy tale have been wonderfully staged in this film and, despite their recognisability in other stories, are given a unique structure. Compared to other films that use more details, this film is very minimalistic and yet includes every expected detail. At some points, however, the film could have been more precise and taken more time, as the studio is known to do, while at other points I would have wished for the opposite, but this is a gripe at a high level. All in all, it is a wonderful work that is definitely to be recommended.This text has been translated from German into English.",
