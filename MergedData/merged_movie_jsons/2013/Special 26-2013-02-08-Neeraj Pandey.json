            "content": "After having watched \"A Wednesday\" by Neeraj Pandey innumerable times, I stepped into the cinema hall with high expectations from his latest movie Special Chabbis. And Pandeyjee has managed to pull off another amazing entertainer with a fast-paced & exciting plot. This is one of those movies which keeps on lingering in your mind even after the climax and you keep going back to the brilliant sequence of events and how they were executed throughout the plot.The movie is set in 1987 based on a true incident when a person posed as a fake CBI officer and robbed a famous jeweller at the Opera House in Mumbai. This incident forms the basis of the plot and how a group of conmen conduct false raids as CBI or IT officials to con politicians, businessmen and high profile people to rob them of their money. These heists are never reported as most of the money is black money and none of these high profile people want to be in the news for wrong reasons.Neeraj Pandey after his directorial debut with A Wednesday completely redeems himself with Special Chabbis and reaffirms his position as a master director. He is definitely not a one film wonder and a director to watch out for in the future. The best and the most noticeable part of the film is the period that it has been set in. 1980's have been very effectively portrayed in the movie, whether it was the cars running on the roads or the streets of Delhi especially well known areas like the Connaught Place, whether it was the print style of the newspapers or the clothes and jewellery worn by the actors. The whole movie seems to be set in 1980 and all credit goes to the art director along with the director. I am still wondering how he shot in the heart of Delhi with all these props from the 80s.The casting is perfect and each character in the ensemble of great actors delivers are powerful performance. Akshay Kumar has always been a great actor for me despite critics and so-called intelligent viewers writing him off. As the linchpin of the team he is subtle, intelligent and still manages to be funny in his own earthly way. This is definitely another feather in his cap with his long list of successful movies. Anupam Kher as a vulnerable supporter of the leader and a lustful old man (considering his long line of children) is superb and reminds of a perfect Punjabi uncle. Rajesh Sharma (Munjal from the movie Khosla ka Ghosla) as the third character fits perfectly into the well oiled team as the big guy from a Purani Dilli joint family. Kishore Kadam as the oppressed husband though a reserved role makes an impact. Jimmy Shergill's portrayal of a frustrated suspended police officer is very believable and you can't fail but empathize with the character of Sub- Inspector Ranveer Singh. But, Manoj Bajpayee is the actor which never ceases to amaze me. You put him any role and he shines, sometimes more than the protagonist. As a no nonsense CBI officer he again steals the show and gives another honest performance worth a standing ovation. Kajal Aggarwal (from Singham) is a pretty girl and looks pretty, however her character's contribution to the story is a little frivolous.The climax hits you in typical Neeraj Pandey style which I am sure is fast becoming his signature style in his movies. Full marks to him for great direction, amazing portrayal of all characters, great plot, superb casting and above all perfect detailing.Go and watch it, and I definitely can again. This one definitely lived up to my expectations and left me hungry for more (I waited till the end of casting hoping there would be another surprise scene at the end).",

            "content": "\"A Wednesday\" made me watch this and boy, was I surprised? Was I entertained? Hell yes, Special 26 is 2013's first serious cinema with no cheap humor, ridiculous stunt sequences or the typical B'wood masala. While Akshay Kumar is known for Housefull & Rowdy Rathore, this one plays different with a sharp plot-driven story and an even amazing execution on a real-life incident!Cut out the romance, and this is one gripping, fabulously woven heist drama parallel to what we see in Hollywood flicks. Anupam Kher couldn't get more thespian while Jimmy Shergill & Manoj Bajpayee complement the cast. Direction, screenplay (so that you don't get bored through 2.5 hours), score, acting and every other film factor is thoroughly scrutinized in this. Now, what's even more Special about this movie is that - since the time gap between decent, \"movie-wala\" movies is so vast, that you just can't get enough of it. Paisa Vasool!Originality in the thefts, corruption, authentic depiction of Indian locations and what-not, I could praise this movie and write a book moreover because it is 2013's one decent try.BOTTOM LINE: I should not reveal much and spoil the broth. Because Special 26 cannot be missed. 100% Recommended but if you are a logic- ridden cinema-goer, you may despise it! Except some dumb plot holes and serious anachronisms, it is a good thriller. But don't expect it anywhere near to what \"A Wednesday\" was. 10/10Can be watched with a typical Indian family?

            "content": "He did it again. Though budget was seven times than \"A Wednesday\" (first masterpiece directed by Neeraj Pandey ) still it wasn't much hyped one ( or may be i don't watch TV these days). I came to know about this notorious saga when one of my friend messaged me to watch it . Thanks to her!! Its being ages since I watched well crafted ingenious Bollywood thriller( recommended to get over with trauma of Race 2). And that to con classic is a really a treat. And what makes it more interesting is \"Based on real story\" factor (though definitely more fiction).The movie is set in late 80's (specifically 1987). For starting 10 minute never felt that its a con movie. Thought of some kind of vigilant drama. But then subtle revelation made it clear. Story moves with introduction of all characters. One thing which was perfect about the movie was the feel of 80's. Airports, roads, vehicles, hotels,places where people use to hide money, panoramic view of cities, clips of events from 80's, demeanor of characters (Pleat pants wore by Bajpai,simple sweaters even the watch wore by Akshay was 80's item). The perfectly executed raid scenes with money shelled out from imaginative places. Brilliant and unpredictable climax. All adding stars to this con epic.Only week points were repetition of some scenes which were unnecessary, lady love of Akshay Kumar as per Indian Rule book, boring songs.Good to see Akshay Kumar doing something good (small trivia Neeraj waited for this movie almost 3 years just because he wanted Akshay to play lead role and in return benign Akshay charged only half of his normal fees), Anupam Kher and Manoj Bajpai at their best. Others playing their part.Final verdict : Watch it for intelligent con thriller, horse and buggy Indian days and Stellar Akshay Kumar's performance.Rating : 8/10.",

After a long time, Akki shows his acting talent in totally new avtaar. Anupam & Jimmy plays his role very well. Manoj is full of power & very well lifted his role. There is no need of female character in script. Loose Point: songs, as there is no need to waste 10-12 precious minutes. Best Dialogue: Asli Power dil me hoti h.

Each actor has got the perfect character. The casting could not have been better than this. The direction is superb. So is the Art Direction. The story does not lag anywhere. So its a superb story with some really good editing.Talking about actors -Akshay Kumar - comes out of his day to day roles of khiladi and joker stuff. This is serious cinema which makes him a complete actor.Anupam Kher - reminds everyone that he is still very much the same awesome actor as the one in 90s.Jimmy Sheirgill - chooses the right kind of role finally. He perfectly fits the role of SI Ranvir Singh and also fits well in the 1987 plot.Manoj Bajpai - as good as ever. Special 26 ka CBI inspector Waseem Khan is as good as Wasseypur ka Sardar Khan.Kavya - hardly any role for her. Shes in the movie for songs only.Divya Dutta - standard supportive role. does well.Others - very well done.Art direction for Delhi steals the show. the 1987 Delhi has been brought alive. details have been worked out well. 1987 Mumbai disappointed. I guess it was very tough to recreate that so the director and the VFX team chose the green screen. Thats the shoddiest part of the movie and hence i gave the 9/10 and not a full tenner.Verdict : The movie can definitely been seen more than once at a theater if you get the tickets.

AND one more thing : All PANDEYz of bollywood please stay aside as this PANDEY is something extraordinary with his hand on script and direction. lets move back to film. film starts with a bang (Heist) which stuns you more because of body language of characters and the direction (ofcourse background score should get the praise too) film moves to some rom-com plot suddenly but without making you bore. First half was good but when the second half starts it takes it to another level. beyond our imagination and a amazing climax leaves you thrilled. film keeps you on the edge of seat throughout the 2 and half hour. astonishing sets,superb background score,tight script,marvelous performance and NEERAJ PANDEY. lets say the later NAME is enough to make you expect the unexpected. lets have a look to the performances : Manoj Bajpayee is amazing. one more time he gave his BEST and i don't think its necessary to say he is one of the most talented actor bollywood ever have. Anupam kher is also awesome with all his body language and dialogue delivery stuff. BUT this man AKSHAY was the show stealer. He did something out of the box and did it so brilliantly that you will remember him as his character name AJJU more than akshay. A film not to miss this weekend. All the abusive words got silenced and its a clean family entertainer with all the element to entertain and thrill you. missing such a cinematic experience will be a crime for a movie buff and bollywood lover.

            "review_title": "A Nutshell Review: Special Chabbis",
            "content": "It's been almost seven years before writer-director Neeraj Pandey decided to go back to the director's chair for what would only be his second feature film to date after making his debut with A Wednesday. And Special Chabbis, or Special 26, is indeed that special project that would lure him back, being once again a film inspired by true events, around a time in the 80s where identities of the taxman, and the policeman, were utilized by thieves in their respective heists against corrupt businessmen and politicians whom they know would not breathe a word on the loss of their ill gotten gains.Akshay Kumar plays Ajay, whom we see as a Central Bureau of Investigations (CBI) officer, together P.K. Sharma (Anupam Kher), Joginder (Rajest Sharma) and Iqbal (Kishor Kadam) performing a raid in New Delhi together with local policeman Ranveer Singh (Jimmy Shergill) against a prominent minister. But soon this facade soon gives way that Ajay, Sharma, Joginder and Iqbal are none other than con men of the highest order - confident in execution, meticulous in detail, and able to cover their tracks really well in their many heists together. This is like Danny Ocean and his Ocean's Eleven, except that Ajay relies on a much smaller crew in their attempts to fleece, relying on quick wits to turn unexpected situations into opportunities of gain.The crux of the story, once we get out of the extended introduction, is the cat and mouse game between Ajay and his crew, and that of CBI officer Wasim Khan (Manoj Bajpayee) who is determined to track them down and bring them to justice for ruining and embarrassing the good name of CBI officers everywhere. And in part this key assistance comes from Ranveer who had been duped into helping Ajay and crew, and possibly being the only one who can help identify all the perpetrators, who have so far stayed below the radar after the completion of each heist.Neeraj Pandey knows just what it takes to make a heist film, utilizing key requisite scenes such as the planning, and execution, tossing in surprises along the way to keep things fresh and engaging for the audience, never for once knowing just how each attempt would play out, at times for light comedy, but most times in admiration just how an escape strategy got formulated, with audacity. What's best here is of course the true meaning behind the title's Special 26, where once it's fully explained, will wrap up the brilliance of the entire caper, which proved to be that ace up Pandey's sleeve, with a pace that never lets up, save for moments where he felt he had to balance the testosterone levels with the introduction of Kajal Aggarwal's character Priya, serving as token romantic fodder for Ajay.I felt Akshay Kumar was badly in need of a hit, and a film that didn't requite him to play the joker. His filmography in 2012 was rather weak throughout, and for a hardworking actor who appears in more than a handful of outputs, 2013 might be off to a great start for his fantastic performance here as the master thief and schemer who is into his final lap, so that he can retire with his lady love and ride off into the sunset. It's not the first time Akshay's playing a thief, but it's clearly one of his best roles in recent years. And added to that is Anupam Kher's ever reliable performance in a supporting role, as the one amongst the gang who has the most to lose, given a large family to support, and the one who gets put in a spot to decide whether he should give in to the law, or stick by Ajay and his grand plan.Special Chabbis / Special 26 is that crime caper that's all smart and serious, but never without a light touch when the situation calls for one. Perhaps the only weak points here were the song-and-dance interludes that felt forced and necessary, but would have done heaps better without these pauses in the narrative, mostly for romance to take place, and to flesh out more depth to the Ajay character. But in all honesty, it's the audacity of the crime that's being committed that we're here for, and to see just how, in true Ocean's Eleven style, these robbers get to wriggle their way out of trouble.

            "content": "Special Chhabbis (a group of twenty-six specially chosen people) is based on the real life event of the loot of the jewellery showroom of Tribhuvandaas Bheemji Jhaveri in the Opera House of Mumbai (then Bombay) on 19.03.1987. The specialty of the loot was that the robbers had posed as CBI officers giving the loot the look of a CBI raid on the showroom, taking away jewellery worth millions in the shape of the forfeiture of the unaccounted goods. For this purpose, the robbers had used 26 fake probationers of CBI, 'recruiting' them through a fake interview just one day before and telling them that this raid was a 'practical test' for them. This incident gave Neeraj Pandey,the filmmaker a plot to make a thriller movie which has come in the form of Special Chhabis.Neeraj Pandey has shown that there is a group of four conmen who pose themselves as CBI officers or income tax officers and conduct sudden (fake) raids on the business houses and residences of corrupt govt. officials and ministers. The 'confiscated' currency notes and jewellery is their booty with which they vanish in the thin air without the robbery being reported to the police because of its being black money. They are fond of slapping people also while conducting the raid nay robbery. And they are very much proud of this act of theirs too as if they were doing something laudable. Coming from different cities, they assemble only for this joint venture of themselves whenever it is planned by their leader - Ajay (Akshay Kumar). After such a raid at the residence of a minister in Delhi on the Republic Day of India in 1987, the matter reaches the real CBI and an honest and dedicated CBI officer - Wasim Khan (Manoj Bajpayee) starts trailing them. By taping the phone of one member of the gang - P.K. Sharma (Anupam Kher), he comes to know of a big robbery planned to be conducted in the jewellery showroom at the Opera House of Mumbai (Bombay) and also the drama of recruitment of 26 youngsters to use them as ignorant accomplices in this loot. But despite his knowledge of everything, the loot takes place. His team of 26 cops proves to be the Special 26 for the robbers (and not the recruitees) which is used by the mastermind as the ignorant accomplice for the job. Instead of the showroom, the workshop of the owners gets looted where the jewellery of the showroom had been shifted by the real CBI.First let me jot down the pluses of the movie in a nutshell (because their trumpet has been blown by several reviewers quite loud). The filmmaker has created the period of the eighties with almost perfection on the screen which is a great job and deserves high accolades. The performers have done exceedingly well especially Manoj Bajpayee who from every angle, appears to be a no-nonsense CBI officer. The movie contains good humour and Ajay's demonstrating his quick-wit in an unexpected adverse situation is highly impressive. The director has maintained the momentum of the narrative throughout keeping the audience hooked (with the exception of the utterly superfluous romantic track). It's a very interesting movie, no doubt.Almost all the viewers and the reviewers got so much carried away by the entertainment value and the bringing the era of the eighties alive on the screen that they (perhaps unknowingly) bypassed the minuses of this movie which are no less in number than the pluses.The filmmaker has not bothered to explain the reason behind this robbery act of the characters except a (probably false) explanation furnished about Ajay's failing to make it to the CBI years back which led him to become a fake CBI officer. Very less is told about the personal lives of these foursome except the family life of P.K. Sharma containing his wife and several children. Besides, he has glorified the crime as if it were some noble cause. The real CBI officer shifts the jewellery of the showroom to the workshop, replacing it with imitation jewellery. Why ? When the robbers were going to be caught red-handed, what's need for that ?Neeraj Pandey has tried to create an unexpected twist in the climax of this movie in order to give a shock treatment to the audience. However since in case of this movie, the story is a real life incident, he had to amend it to create the desire shock value. This shock is less for the real CBI officer who has been made a fool by the conmen, more for the audience who has been fooled like anything by the filmmaker. It is revealed in the end that the cops who were posing as the ignorant accomplices of the con-gang are actually fake and their real accomplices. How can one digest it because the fake cop (Jimmy Shergill) himself brings the case to the real CBI and himself furnishes the identity and the Chandigarh address of P.K. Sharma (Anupam Kher) enabling the real CBI officer (Manoj Bajpayee) to tape his phone and thereafter trail and nail him ? This is as good as hitting axe on own foot. Besides, when the actual address of Sharma is known to the CBI,how can he escape now ? He has a very large family and establishment behind him. Neeraj Pandey has challenged the intelligence of his audience and fooled them. In no review of this movie (except the one on Koimoi.com) did I find this flaw of the movie being highlighted. What does it mean ? Do we enjoy being made fool just because the filmmaker has entertained us very much ? And is this why that instead of complaining, we start going ga ga over the movie and singing praises for the conman, i.e., the filmmaker ?",

Special 26 was the one movie the Khiladi needed as even if his previous films were successful, they weren't great. Baring OMG:Oh My God, his other films all depended on solid one liners, superb action, and word of mouth. I have nothing against Masala movies, they are quite entertaining but, it is not as good as a realistic films like Kahaani, Taalash and the recent Special Chabbis. The movie isn't successful only because of Akki, other people have contributed quite a lot to the film. What doesn't the film contain? Powerpacked performances, funny dialogs, decent songs, a proper flow in the story.The story is based on some true incidents that happened in the late 80s, it's about how certain people raided officials like ministers as fake CBI. These fake people would steal all their goods and money and leave the place, make it look like a real incident and leave. They would go to a secluded location and change their identities, from their they would part their own ways.The movie has something called a proper storyline, it also has a good flow in the storyline. There are hardly in clich\u00e9s and plot holes in the storyline and everything is well directed. The only clich\u00e9 would be the forced romance of Akshay and Kajal which doesn't fit well with the story. Other than that, the whole storyline has been well handled.Performances are first rate for the most part, Akshay Kumar does a brilliant job and it doesn't look made up. Being an Akki fan, this movie was a must watch for me. After a decent 2012, the Khiladi does a brilliant job in a realistic and well made film. Kajal Aggarwal looks gorgeous and acts properly though her part wasn't needed in the film. Even then, she does a good job as the heroine. Anupam Kher does a brilliant job in a supporting role and the same goes for Manoj Bajpayee. Jimmy Shergill is fabulous and the twist involving his character nearing the end is extremely well handled. The rest provide good support and do what is required.Music is decent, Gore Mukde Pe Zulf Di Chavaan is good(Kajal Aggarwal looks beautiful in that song), Kaun Mera is slow and melodious, Mujhe Me Tu(Sung by Akshay Kumar) is fabulous, it is so nice to listen to. The rest are good fillers for the movie.Direction and story by Neeraj Pandey is superb, he handles the whole movie properly without any rough patches. Even if the romantic angle is forced, it is well handled as there is no overacting and boring moments in the romantic bits of the film too. Kudos to Neeraj for giving Akshay the well directed and well scripted film he needed. Because besides OMG, none of his films were well scripted though the entertainment made the film worth watching despite the films being silly in parts.On the whole, Special Chabbis(26) is a brilliant film scripted and directed by Neeraj Pandey with Akshay Kumar and Kajal Aggarwal in the lead.",

Nice thriller marred by bad n unnecessary romance angle. Nevertheless, I enjoyed this movie. Akshay was OK. Can't act. Anupam stole the limelight. He was too good in this film. Perfect Indian heist film. Loved it man.\u00a0 Akshay shud do more films like these n avoid baby, houseful n holiday kinda films. Manoj bajpai was excellent as usual. Even Shergill acted well.

After watching Neeraj Panday's directorial debut A Wednesday, expectations for this film was already sky high and he didn't fail to meet our expectations. An excellent plot backed by great acting from the whole crew except Kajal Aggarwal. I don't want to reveal anything about the plot in fear of divulging those great twists in the process. The songs were really poor and irritating and was interrupting the general flow of the story; the romance angle was a complete failure; and though Neeraj did a great job in picturing the gritty real life scenes but in some places they felt a bit dull and lack-lustre. Without those horrible unnecessary soundtracks and romance, this movie could have been bold enough to be compared to OCEAN'S ELEVEN. But overall, this movie is no doubt quite impressive and a must watch for all con movie lovers!!!",

            "review_title": "A fine heist thriller which is enjoyable if you are willing to ignore its big open loopholes.",
            "content": "A Neeraj Pandey film post the classic A Wednesday cannot escape two major things associated with it unarguably. One is the huge amount of expectations among the viewers from his second film and the other is a comparison in their minds with his debut movie which was acclaimed all over unanimously. This time the basic theme revolves around few shocking true incidents of 1980s wherein four people posing as CBI or Income Tax department men robbed several businessmen and politicians in the broad daylight and nobody even reported those fake raids due to the fear of revealing their unaccounted black money. The subject is no doubt a well chosen one which also has been made into a fine exciting thriller which would surely entertain majority of viewers interested in this particular genre. The fantastic initial 30 minutes impress you a lot and then you get into the mood of watching an engrossing heist tale of four entertaining con-men who plan & execute their brave heists with great intelligence and confidence.To begin with, SPECIAL 26 has an uneven first half with a forced in love angle and few good songs (taking you again into the clich\u00e9d Punjab) which I was never expecting in a film from the maker of A Wednesday (a song-less masterpiece). Anyway, to say the truth, the film would have been a much better, focused and inspiring tale to watch without all these silly, forced in sequences.In the second half, though there is another song to continue the avoidable teasing, still Neeraj gets back on his track soon and then gives you a shocking climax in the end breaking all the norms of such con-films made in Indian Cinema till date. The twist in the tale makes you sit straight and forces you to think that how they actually did it. Yet here once again I would like to say that S26 will surely be appreciated more by the lovers of this particular genre only because the film has a major part of its content without dialogues with just the pulsating background score keeping the energy alive and the actors performing their act on the screen silently. Hence it's basically a film, which is more concerned about its rare plot in the script and less about the actors performing their roles on the screen (as it should be).Apart from its exceptional execution SPECIAL 26 also excels in its department of Cinematography and Art Direction showing the cities of Delhi, Mumbai and Calcutta in the late 80s almost perfectly. To give you the feel of that developing era, the essence of those times is well taken care of with all Maruti 800s, Fiats, Black Autos, the old Connaught Place (partially), Best Buses & Bus Stops in Bombay and Trams in Calcutta shown clearly in all the long and close outdoor shots taken elegantly. Further its also nothing short of an achievement made by the director that despite of being a film about con-men, police and thieves performing some big crimes, there is not even a single scene of blood- shed, murder or gun-shots. So visually too it's a great work done by the team lead by the talented Neeraj Pandey which needs to be watched keeping in mind the obvious points (like there were no communication sources at that time other than the fixed line government allotted telephones in our homes).Musically, S26 didn't require a romantic plot and the songs at all even if they do give you some listening pleasure for few moments (like Kaun Mera) . The songs hinder the pace of this crime-chase thriller hugely and they have clearly been added to suit the image requirements of the lead hero.Akshay is in terrific form in the film and emotes well in all kinds of scenes in the script, which is far different and ahead than most of his recent mindless comedies. But in case, the romantic angle was in reality forced by him only then its pretty evident that he was not 100% confident about the genre of S26 and its success right from the beginning. Both Manoj Bajpayee & Anupam Kher give another splendid performance of their bright careers as expected. Jimmy Shergill is efficient and same can be said about Rajesh Sharma and Kishore Kadam who mostly remain silent throughout the film.Kajal is wasted in a forced role and Divya Dutta shines in her small cameo.Having said that the film still has many big flaws(like the real identity of Anupam and his residence already known to Police, still he manages to fly away with his wife) which force me to rate it a bit lower than desired. However one can enjoy it surely if he wishes to ignores these big open loopholes in its entertaining script. So due to that very reason SPECIAL 26 remains a fine heist thriller from Neeraj Pandey which can surely be considered as A TUESDAY after his A Wednesday and not A THURSDAY.",

The movie has its share of light moments which are situational.

Overall the movie is presented very well with the climax being the best a thriller/suspense movie can have.

            "content": "With talented directors' innovative bend of mind we are subjected to some brilliant cinema off late (though the 100Cr trashes still rules the marquee).Neeraj Pandey is one of such avant-garde story teller who wooed the audience with his flawless directorial debut \"A Wednesday\" half a decade ago. After a hiatus he is back and back he is with a Bang! Special 26 takes us back to the era of 80s (not the loud inane \"Himmatwala\" kind) when things were less convoluted and people still used to have faith on fellow sapiens. In terms of technology life was simpler and people had the time to use their wit to the summit. The film is about an team of four intelligent con men who used to impersonate CBI officer (or Income Tax officer) & raid corrupt ministers, businessmen to loot their \"black\" money. Their confidence & acuteness gets tested when pitted against equally capable Wasim Khan, a dynamic CBI officer. Therein begins the war of wits which becomes more captivating with the progress of the film. Based on real events it is heartening to see that someone had the wit & balls to con those who are conning the whole nation.Neeraj Pandey should be showered with awards for this brilliant script which keeps you on the edge. There are many con films being made in India but this will feature amongst best Heist & Con drama made in Hindi so far. Pandey's film is one rare script-based gem that plays on the wit and gives a realistic touch to the proceedings. The detailing used to re-create the 80s deserves accolades. Every city shown in the story gives you the feel of the by-gone era and with usage of orange-brownish colour the tone of the film becomes more accurate. From telephone sets to car to newspaper the effort given in detailing oozes out from every scene. Dialogues like \"Ye juicer grinder kya hai\" hints on a subtly how mechanical we have become. The brilliant script is complimented with sharp dialogues with layered humour. One master stroke was when Akshay points on so many children of Anupam kher to which he replied that there wasn't any TV for entertainment in those days. At least there we have a reason for this gigantic population of ours ;) The script of \"special 26\" throws light on why Neeraj took 5years to make his second venture after a stupendous debut & now he stamped the fact that his maiden attempt wasn't a flash in the pan. Special 26 raised the bar & full marks to Pandey for making a commercially viable yet realistic, intelligent racy heist thriller that can proudly rub shoulder with world cinema.Late Bobby Singh's camera-work coupled with Reddy's art direction brings alive the 80s distinctive flavour with honesty and reality. Narayan Singh's editing gives the edginess to the narrative keeping us glued to each scene. The visual graphics used to recreate the 80s are commendable.Neeraj persuaded Akshay for the role and he excels as an astute con-man who let his brain speak rather than muscle. It is a rarity for Akshay who sheds his superhero image and gives an earnest performance. (How i wish he does more Speicla26 & OMG rather than the housefull rowdies. Also this film should force Sallu & Devgan to do at least one meaningful film).Manoj Bajpei is one of the finest actors around and we can only expect the best from him- whether it is revenge stricken Sardar Khan in GOW or a upright dutiful officer Wassem Khan in this film Bajpei is superlative. Even when he isn't speaking he is emoting through his posture & expression. Anupam Kher gets a meaty role after a gap & he pounce on to it giving a phenomenal performance. Jimmy Shergill had a strong yet understated character which is of extreme significance to the narrative & he doesn't let you down. As a dismissed confused police officer vowed to unmask the con men he adds more spice to the chat-pata narrative. Divya Dutta shines in an interesting supporting role. Rajesh Sharma is ever reliable and he made his presence felt in a role which is far cry from nutty Tikku mama from \"Luv Shuv tey Chicken Khurana\". Kajal Agarwal looked good but her character was forced and could have been done away with. The rest of the cast were restrainedly exemplary.Neeraj Pandey gives a winner again after \"A Wednesday\" and this is not to be missed. An earnest, honest and realistic heist drama which comes once in a while in Hindi. Good to see brainy films for a larger audience are getting made nowadays. Let us help this superb film to cross the 100 Cr mark to show respect to this kind of films. Indeed a special experience for cine-goers who are bored with typical 'race2' kind of films.",

This is one of those movies which keeps on lingering in your mind even after the climax and you keep going back to the brilliant sequence of events and how they were executed throughout the plot. Every one done his job very well in this movie.Neeraj Pandey after his directorial debut with A Wednesday completely redeems himself with Special Chabbis and reaffirms his position as a master director. He is definitely not a one film wonder and a director to watch out for in the future. The best and the most noticeable part of the film is the period that it has been set in. 1980's have been very effectively portrayed in the movie, whether it was the cars running on the roads or the streets of Delhi especially well known areas like the Connaught Place, whether it was the print style of the newspapers or the clothes and jewellery worn by the actors. The whole movie seems to be set in 1980 and all credit goes to the art director along with the director. I am still wondering how he shot in the heart of Delhi with all these props from the 80s.The casting is perfect and each character in the ensemble of great actors delivers are powerful performance. Akshay Kumar has always been a great actor for me despite critics and so-called intelligent viewers writing him off. As the linchpin of the team he is subtle, intelligent and still manages to be funny in his own earthly way. This is definitely another feather in his cap with his long list of successful movies. Anupam Kher as a vulnerable supporter of the leader and a lustful old man (considering his long line of children) is superb and reminds of a perfect Punjabi uncle. Rajesh Sharma (Munjal from the movie Khosla ka Ghosla) as the third character fits perfectly into the well oiled team as the big guy from a Purani Dilli joint family. Kishore Kadam as the oppressed husband though a reserved role makes an impact. Jimmy Shergill's portrayal of a frustrated suspended police officer is very believable and you can't fail but empathize with the character of Sub- Inspector Ranveer Singh. But, Manoj Bajpayee is the actor which never ceases to amaze me. You put him any role and he shines, sometimes more than the protagonist. As a no nonsense CBI officer he again steals the show and gives another honest performance worth a standing ovation. Kajal Aggarwal (from Singham) is a pretty girl and looks pretty, however her character's contribution to the story is a little frivolous.The climax hits you in typical Neeraj Pandey style which I am sure is fast becoming his signature style in his movies. Full marks to him for great direction, amazing portrayal of all characters, great plot, superb casting and above all perfect detailing.Go and watch it, and I definitely can again. This one definitely lived up to my expectations and left me hungry for more (I waited till the end of casting hoping there would be another surprise scene at the end). you will enjoy every single minutes ....",

            "content": "No kidding, Akshay Kumar has finally broken his self-imposed jinx and has taken up a film which doesn't demand him playing an overtly boisterous character. \"Special Chabbis\" is a welcome relief from the usual gibberish we've come to expect from the Indian film industry and a film that lives up to every promise it makes. Literally. From the fresh breed of young filmmakers that took over the new phase of the industry, director Neeraj Pandey's voice soared higher than anyone else's with his stunning debut \"A Wednesday\" four years back. And now, with \"Special Chabbis\", I can solemnly state that he could well be the next big thing.In the late 1980s, a group of four con-men dress up as fake CBI officers and conduct raids on corrupt ministers and run off with millions before the unsuspecting ministers figure out that they have actually been robbed. Since the money involved in these raids is brought in by scams, no one dares to report this to the police. The group consists of Ajay (Akshay Kumar), the real brains behind the raids, the timid Sharmaji (Anupam Kher), Joginder (Rajesh Sharma) and Iqbal (Kishor Kadam). While the group commits daring daylight robberies, the helpless CBI cannot do anything but look on. Finally, SI Ranveer Singh (Jimmy Shergill), a disgraced police officer who had helped the felons in one of their raids oblivious to the fact that they're actual robbers, agrees to help CBI officer Waseem Khan (Manoj Bajpai) to track them down. Ajay and Sharmaji agree to commit one last robbery- their biggest- and then disappear. But unbeknownst to them, Khan is eavesdropping on their telephonic conversations and wants sufficient evidence to nab them. The game of cat-and-mouse boils down to a tense climax where no one wants to be the one on the losing side.Bringing a real-life incident to the big screen is never easy but Pandey, working from a wonderfully twisty script, handles the camera with assured confidence which is evident from the way he builds the suspense. Recreating the events that transpired in great detail, the urgency with which the film is narrated is a perceptible sign of a man who knows what he's doing. The story is smoothly told with a consistently flowing narrative and the infusion of wry humor only helps to add to the delightful pleasures of its marvelous execution which can only be relished. The film is supremely funny in parts which, I admit, was an unexpected surprise from the director who had last directed a thriller which strived on palpable tension.In a film which boggles us with its sheer energy, a romantic angle threatens to cripple the narrative. That has unabashedly been the tragic biography of thrillers in the Indian film industry for decades and it's no different now. I cringed at the unnecessary use of songs and a half-baked romantic plot which is completely trivial to the story. So, why lace the film with them? No idea. I reckon the makers couldn't resist banking on the love story to set the cash registers ringing a little loudly than they would've ringed otherwise.Of the performances, Akshay Kumar is reliably excellent, as is Manoj Bajpai. Anupam Kher is terrific in the role of the timid Sharmaji, providing much needed chuckles with his mousy demeanor. Jimmy Shergill does well in a small role. Kajal Aggarwal's role is a trivial one, vastly underwritten and a balmy decision on the part of its director. \"Special Chabbis\" is a smart film which greatly respects the intellect of its audience and which audaciously attempts to bring an arduous anecdote to life and succeeds in keeping us hooked for 150 minutes, a film whose superb script triumphs over the credentials of its makers. How can anyone resist that?",

The villain of the film is the Romance angle which looks immensely forceful and acts as a major Speed Breaker to this pacey thriller (1st Half). Overall this is brave attempt by our Director which seems to have worked. Kudos to Neeraj Pandey for raising the standards of film making in Bollywood.",

(Interestingly, I was also watching \"a Wednesday\" (yet another time) later yesterday night on TV after watching Special 26.) I had hoped on this based on the trailer and Manoj Bajpayee. I didn't know it was based on a real life incident.I expected only entertainment and got only entertainment.The plot is fast paced and starts off right in the beginning. You kind of get the introductions later. It took me a while before I realised this was a period film with no mobiles and with old (now illegal) vehicle number plates.The plot is not very tight and there may be small holes here and there, but overall, it is executed with precision. The acting of Akshay, Anupam, Rajesh Sharma, etc, were top notch. Manoj Vajpayee does a fairly good job, too.The only character that did not impress me was Kajal Agarwal's. Neither did her acting. She had trouble speaking Hindi, too and many a times, I felt her sequences were unnecessary. But the movie goes on at a pace that can make you ignore this aspect altogether.Overall, I give it 8 for entertainment and direction.",

            "review_title": "Despite Getting Bogged Down By Forgettable Dance Segments, A Kitschy Romantic Subplot & A Hollow First-Half, Special 26 Gains Momentum Post-Interval And Wins Big With Climax",
            "content": "Special 26 begins well, ends better. Neeraj Pandey knew exactly how he had to surprise his audience, and so he probably wrote the rest of the movie hurriedly, only highlighting the key dialogs, because he knew that even if the audience remained less complimentary towards Special 26 till the interval, they would love it by the end because of the twist ending they had never expected. Before the interval, Pandey does not really have much to tell and so he inflates all his scenes till he can get sufficient footage for the average runtime of a Hindi film, and in the endeavor he wastes a lot many frames on forgettable song and dance sequences and a kitschy romantic subplot. After the intermission, although he begins with the same mistake of tarrying too long on unimportant sequences, once he gets to the section that justifies the film's true purpose, Pandey's approach becomes smarter, subtle and succinct. His screenplay required more of the crackling wit and dark humor which movies like 1986s Bette Midler starrer Ruthless People had, and some of Special 26's cast could've enlivened their roles with more spontaneity, yet Neeraj Pandey pulls off a successful heist film with his flair for unexpected climaxes. The best thing about Special 26 is the title: while you may have a fair idea about what the title stands for in the film from watching the trailer, you would be surprised by how well the title serves as a motif in the film. The motif not only acts as an aid for the game-changing climax but it actually sacrifices itself for the climax. You won't get what I'm telling right now but understand it after watching the film. I'll put it this way: The Special 26 in the film serve little purpose in the film except to become scapegoats for the actual purpose of the movie. The main plot of the film involves a group of crooks posing as CBI agents who raid the filthy-rich and escape with the black money. The two lead crooks are played by Akshay Kumar, who plays Ajay Singh, and Anupam Kher, who plays P.K Sharma; the duo joined by Joginder and Iqbal find this job extremely profitable and easy to execute because in most cases, the aggrieved parties do not file FIR fearing that their name would be tarnished if they do so. One of their successful targets shown in the film is a minister who stashes multiple bundles of notes behind library books and in large containers under the praying area.The group is accompanied by police officers Ranvir Singh (played by Jimmy Shergill) and Shanti (played by Divya Dutta) who too mistaken them for real CBI officers. After the group successfully escapes, the two officers are left shame-faced and are suspended by their superior. Ajay Singh and the rest then decide to go Kolkata for their next fake operation while Shergill (and Dutta) teams up with real CBI officer Wasim Khan to track the impostors down. On PK Sharma's insistence, Ajay Singh decides that they need to do something big, and for that they shall need additional help, and so they begin recruiting the 'Special 26'.Throughout the raiding sequences, we see money tumbling out of many unexpected places. Some are stashed under the back seat of a dusty unused car. Some are found in locked cupboards. Some are kept in hidden rooms. All throughout, we see the wrongdoers (as in those who've stashed the money and are in turn getting robbed) plead and give the silliest of excuses to prevent further raiding. For example, the minister's wife begs to the officer not to search the temple area as God's peace would be disturbed. These sequences needed more sparkling humor, and I can think of one person who would've got this humor while still retaining the central objective of the film: Paresh Rawal. All we get here is characters going \"What is this we have here?\" \"Sir, look what I've found!\" without getting more punch lines. And although Akshay and Anupam do a fair job at playing their characters, I believe the film would've been much different had for example, Ranbir Kapoor and Pankaj Kapoor or Naserrudin Shah or Rawal played the leads. Akshay Kumar plays Ajay the same style in which Ben Stiller played the lead role in Tower Heist: he seems to be there in every scene, he speaks each line clearly yet he does nothing extra to make him more believable as a street-smart, dexterous con-man who's capable and smart to execute complex plans. And worse are his unsuccessful attempts at creating chemistry with the inept \u0085; Pandey could've easily trimmed the entire film to a brisk ninety minutes by removing much of that time-wasting subplot. While Special 26 succeeds whenever it exclusively focuses on its core plot, it disappoints when it deviates to back-stories and subplots. People are raving about this movie as if it's something they've never seen in Indian cinema, but I'd like to remind that there was a similar film which achieved resounding overall success in its execution some years ago \u2013 Hera Pheri.",

            "content": "A well written and ill executed film.For most of the time, people are walking in the film and that too as if in stop motion, where the slow motion comes and disturbs the interest. The climax is more or less predictable just that it had a few hints by the end and an avid film goer might have predicted it. OK, the performances are good and I must say, post MOHRA this is the first film of Akshay Kumar I had seen in theatre and I was actually happy as it did not have fights or unwanted action sequences and instead had some brain thing. Thanks to Neeraj Pandey for not putting heavy action sequences for Akshay Kumar. Manoj Bajpai and Anupam Kher fared well. Kajal Agarwal was not needed at all, and this could have been better if the romantic track and those songs were not there. Coming to Neeraj Pandey, the director I was very disappointed, coz post Wednesday, it gave some hope that this man may churn out some non commercial flicks and would raise the bar, but he disappointed me with the song dance number, and the love track that made me just wait to go to the real plot. It was written with a good intent but it just did not fit in as a whole. Technically, the best thing is the meticulous production design of the Mumbai and other places of the 1980's and for this itself I would give an award to Sunil Babu. The editing falls flat and please cut off 30-45 minutes and increment the pace by making the walking as they are and take off the slow motion and for 75 minutes, you will get a wonderful ride otherwise it made a just above average flick. The time of nearly 135 minutes was made for the sake of making and I did not see any real purpose behind that. A generous 2/5 for a well designed film more than anything else.

            "content": "Hollywood has been famous for its incredible heist movies all the time. It is not often that Bollywood tries this type of concepts in its movies. Yet it took the risk, and this one was totally worth it. This movie is based on a true incident that happened in 1987 in present day Mumbai.A group of con men posing as CBI officers carries out a fake raid at a minister's house successfully, fooling two police officers in their way. They then get back to their way of continuing with their natural lives. They continue to do their operations. But the police whom they fooled first is determines enough to take the gang down, and thus contacts the real CBI, seeking their help. Thus begins the cat and mouse chase which forms a major part of the film.Ajay (Akshay Kumar) leads the gang of four, and is quite perfect in his role. He is accompanied by P.K. Sharma (Anupam Kher), Joginder (Rajesh Sharma) and Iqbal (Kishor Kadam). They all truly justify their roles in the movie. But the casting of original CBI officer Waseem Khan (Manoj Bajpayee) is the best decision that. His acting, expressions as the determined officer is phenomenal.The film has cool period flavour in everything from the costumes to the musical score. Even the chase scenes combining with the background score are quite interesting and succeeds in the creating the tension in the scenes. Unexpected twists also add to the movie's flavour. There are certain scenes which also minimize the tensions created with their comical mood. Although not intolerable, the dance scenes serve as an extra weight to the movie, which is typical of any Bollywood movie that you will ever find. But they don't reduce any of its good aspects.Overall, this movie truly justifies its genre and is one of Bollywood's finest movies. This movie is recommended to anyone who loves heists and crimes and also enjoys watching Bollywood movies.",

The movie spend very little time on 3 out of 4 con-men, so we have very little window in their lives or back story about their initiation into such high risk business. Most of the con seems too easy and exaggerated. It is sad commentary on Hindi cinema where such mediocre movie is considered - unique, epic, grand and exciting.",

            "content": "In the recent past, Akshay Kumar has mostly been seen in comic flicks, barring the odd stunt-based brain-dead crass films like Rowdy Rathore. Amidst all this, 'Special Chabbis' comes as a welcome break with director Neeraj Pandey delivering yet another gem after his much acclaimed 'A Wednesday'. The film is inspired by the real life 1987 Tribuvandas Bhimji Zaveri Jewel heist where a middle-aged conman had posed as an Income Tax Officer staging a raid with 28 'newly recruited' officers who were told that they were doing a mock-raid as a part of their training. The thief, who called himself Monsingh disappeared with the Jewellery and was never caught. To date, this is said to be an 'unsolved mystery'. While portraying a single event would have looked like a documentary, the writers have added more meat to the film through events and developing each of the key characters, presenting most aspects of their lives, love interests, family, etc., Sure, the storytelling has repeated shots of people walking or driving for dramatic effect, which gets tiresome after a point. But then, the story doesn't lose pace. The first scene shows a walk-in interview to recruit CBI Officers. Cut to flashback, Ajay Singh (Akshay Kumar), PK Sharma (Anupam Kher) along with Joginer & Iqubal are seen raiding a Minister's house in Delhi assisted by a cop Ranvir Singh (Jimmy Shergill). After they have recovered lakhs, it is revealed that the four men posing as CBI officers are actually fakes. The four soon disappear into the crowd with the loot. Fearing loss of face, the minister refuses to lodge a complaint, much like most of their earlier victims. It is revealed that the conmen use the fear of law to loot black money whose owners would never want the public to know that they had it in the first place. Soon, the news of the loot reaches the real CBI where Wasim Khan (Manoj Bajpai) is tasked with finding them. He is helped by the now-suspended cop Ranbir Singh.What follows is a very interesting chase across cities, peppered with the right dose of comic lines delivered at the right time. In a way, the movie reminds you of Tom Hanks, Leonardo DiCaprio starrer 'Catch Me If You Can' and the famous 'Ocean' series and packs in adequate drama. Although many Bollywood filmmakers have heist flicks before, only a rare few could get the formula right and 'Special Chabbis' is a good one!Some may argue that the film surely has a moral dilemma angle to it. One, that it makes heroes out of conmen. But the other argument would be that the people they robbed were bad anyway. The weakest link is probably the love track which rather delays the film, and some repeated footage that could've been avoided. On acting, the best among them is Anupam Kher who plays the greedy old man, which is closely followed by a predictably good performer in Manoj Bajpai and Akshay Kumar demonstrating that he hasn't forgotten acting. Kajal Aggarwal, as Akshay Kumar's love interest, at best is a pretty distraction and hardly has much to do. Jimmy Shergill as the cop and Divya Dutta who plays his assistant perfectly fit their roles too. The single biggest achievement in the film, is its production design: portrayal of 1980's India with traffic free roads, no cell phones, no modern cars, etc. And this had to be repeated for all the cities that the story is depicted in. The best of such scenes is an overhead shot of Delhi's Connaught Place which zooms down to Manoj Bajpai riding a scooter. There are some other scenes that are tacky, but can be pardoned. Take my advice and don't wait for it to come on TV. With tons of advertisements to interrupt the show, the chase drama would lose its charm. For all the good screenplay, intelligent dialog, occasional humor and some twists, make sure that you don't miss 'Special Chabbis', what many believe is the Indian answer to Ocean's series!",

            "content": "After a deluge of sloppy fare, Special Chabbis is like a breath of fresh air, the best movie till date in 2013, and quite simply, the best heist movie that Bollywood has ever churned out. With edge of the seat excitement all throughout, earnest performances and a super tight screenplay, this is one movie that has tons more entertainment than the usual Bollywood hit parade that overflows with formulaic bawdy comedy plus over the top stunts.Based on a true story where Tribhuvandas Zaveri Jewellers store was robbed in broad daylight by a gang posing as CBI agents, Special Chabbis hurtles through with a raid on a minister's premise led by Ajay Singh (Akshay Kumar), and P.K.Sharma (Anupam Kher), and unknowingly assisted by SI Ranveer Singh (Jimmy Shergill) and Shanti (Divya Dutt). Not exactly Robin Hood but CBI reject Akshay is the mastermind of a gang that poses as fake CBI officials and conducts raids on politicians, and businessmen relieving them of their wealth.This act, however catches the attention of ace cop Wasim Khan (Manoj Bajpai). Wasim wants to catch them in the act, and the remainder of the movie is one hell of a cop and robber drama, with the gang trying their final big bang heist and the police hot on their heels. Director Neeraj Pandey is Chulbul Pandey of the directorial universe- he gave us the excellent A Wednesday 4 years back, and follows it up with similar levels of intelligence, intrigue and emotion in Special Chabbis. For a Bollywood movie set in the 80s, the attention to detail is magnificent. While they did not have to change much for the Kolkata sequences, since the city still looks the same as it looked 25 years ago, the Delhi scenes really transport you to an era long gone. The cars, the props, the shops- how did he make Connaught Place look that way? The pacing is brilliant too- the movie has some songs, and there is the mandatory romantic angle thrown in (Kajal Aggarwal looking pretty in a thankless role) but even that adds to Ajay's purpose. The humor is mostly delivered with a straight face to sledgehammer effect by all the actors, and is infectious- the Special Chabbis selection scene is worth many viewings- in typical Pandey fashion we have a twist out of nowhere, and the background music is a zingy throwback to the masala flicks of the 70s. And what about the casting coup? Akshay Kumar reported cut his fee by half to shine in his most intelligent movie and is great as the leader of the pack, but it is Discover India with Anupam Kher (Official)nd Manoj Bajpai that take the acting honors. Kher is stupendous as the bumbling partner in crime, while Bajpai nails it by being more police than actual police. Not long back he was running around trees romancing half his age girls, thankfully he has turned a corner post Gangs of Wasseypur and now is focusing on good character roles.Pick any day- weekday, weekend, Valentine day. Pick anyone- wife, girlfriend, friends, mistress or yourself- please go and watch Special Chabbis if you have not already done, a cent percent recommendation. Beautifully scripted, excellently paced, clean family entertainer. Movies like this can only make us proud of our film industry- that there are some folks still there with their thinking caps on. 100 crores or not, this is one heck of a ride, a very very Special Chabbis!",

            "content": "Special Chabbis directed by Neeraj Pandey is an excellent movie!The movie is based on a real life incident which took place during the 80's.The movie has excellent performances,amazing dialogs and water-tight screenplay.In a nutshell,Special Chabbis is an excellent movie,which you ought not to miss!Story:The film is based on a real life group of con artists who pulled off many clever robberies during 1980's, they robbed famous businessmen & politicians by pretending to be the CBI or Income tax officers, on the pretext of conducting raids they would take away all the black money hoarded by them, the film also takes its concept from the real-life daring where the same group posing as CBI officers executed a daylight income tax raid on the Opera House branch of Tribhovandas Bhimji Zaveri in Mumbai, and disappeared with jewelery worth millions.The direction by Neeraj Pandey is marvelous.The screenplay is watertight.The dialogs are amazing.The cinematography by Late Bobby Singh is stupendous.The editing is fine.The music is good.Performances:Akshay Kumar is superb.After many years he is portraying a serious character and he portrays the character with panache!Manoj Bajpayee as Wsseem Khan is efficient.Anupam Kher as Sharmaji is excellent.Jimmy Shergill is very good.Kajal Aggarwal is wasted.Rajesh Sharma and Kishore Kadam are good in their respective roles.Vipin Sharma is apt.On the whole,Special Chabbis is a movie,which one should not miss at any costs!I am giving it a nine on ten.Strongly Recommended!",

            "content": "Special 26 is a wittily written story. Akshay Kumar plays a rogue con who was not selected in CBI. To avenge this, Ajju and anupam kher and two other guys con wealthy but greedy businessman and sometimes a politician and take away their money and run away with it. They carry out this con by portraying as CBI officials and a fake one at that. What brilliant stuff! The last time i saw a movie like this was Oye Lucky! Lucky Oye! which was a pretty good one. Kajal is just there for singing songs and being an eye candy.Akshay and Manoj and Jimmy with Shantiji kept us on the edge of our seat, for most parts, tweaking the events to finally unveil a thrilling end. After a remarkable debut with the political thriller 'A Wednesday', Neeraj follows it up with a notable 'Special 26'.",

            "content": "Neeraj Pandey, a 40 years old(young) man from a Bihari family background who shocked (pleasantly) many by his socio-dramatic thriller, the story of a common man, A Wednesday, is now narrating a story of 'con-men'\u0085'Special 26' based on the real incidents of 80s where a group of people posing to be CBI & IT official raided (robbed) many politicians, businessmen across the country without getting caught & also without any complain on the police records. The story is predictable, as it is based on real incidents, but the film being a Neeraj's baby was bound to surprise you in the climax, going by the standard he set through his previous film. (it may remind you of Ocean's series of George Clooney & Brad Pit). Never the less, the script, the art direction, pacey screenplay, wittiness of the characters & a BANG ON background score by Sanjoy Chowdhary are they key elements other than the performances which will keep you hooked. The vision of Neeraj about the look of the film is also stealer\u0085 I haven't seen Connaught Place of 1987, I haven't seen Delhi roads of 1987, and many have not seen the Zaveri Baazar of 1987 in Mumbai, Delhi airport, Howrah Junction, Chandigarh Airport\u0085.Neeraj showed us all\u0085Maruti 800, Maruti Van, Chetak Scootar, Matador, the telephone sets, & yes.. Ajay (the one who can never be defeated) played by Akshay Kumar carrying 'white pair of Shoes'.Since, the film is based on the real events and because of that the director had restrictions as far as the plot and its execution was concerned. He had to stick to the actual happenings leaving almost negligible scope for taking cinematic liberties. Still, he made facts look like fantasy.Performance wise, Akshay Kumar was well composed, did something refreshing, never went over the top (like he do most of time, and you blame only SRK)\u0085 he played a Khiladi, here as well. Anupam Kher is a master, was good as a 'fattu' conman. Jimi Shergil is good. Kajal Agrawaal, played the love interest of Akshay, has pretty face, but has not got substantial role in this thriller. I believed Manoj Bajpai when he said that we haven't seen even 20% of him as an actor. This movie, once again, proves that he is among the finest we have. The rest of the actors did well with whatever they were given.Music of MM Kareem is soothing. It's not a musical, 'Mujh me tu' stands out. The background music, as I already mentioned, is another leading character of the film.Overall, Special 26 is a well-made, entertaining thriller with a little hiccup here and there which you may ignore considering other things about it. ***1/2",

It was a treat for all my senses. Practically I do not remember when is the last time I watched this much flawless movie.First the script is well written and more awesomely executed. It was a full proof script what will take your breath way. Throughout the movie I knew there was a plan B, there must be a plan B. But till the final act i had no Idea that how will they show that. It was simply mind blowing. The script is almost without any loose end. It contains a bit of comedy also. Too much comedy would have been ruin the movie for many viewers. Secondly the cast selection was very decent, the actors knew what they were doing , how they are doing. Actresses has no particular act throughout the movie like most of the Indian movies.Finally ,one Sentence. \"Watch the movie again ;)\"",

Performances are good too with Manoj bajpai at his very best.Anupam Kher reminded me of his roles in Wednesday and C kkompany and does his job well.Akshay acts as a soft spoken serious character and is good.Jimmy shergill was offered less than what he deserves.Divya Dutta impresses with her desi style.What left me pondering was that why it was titled special 26.?There was nothing special about those 26 as they were easily be fooled by the fake CBI team.It would have been better if film was titled special CBI as it had done justice on part of both CBI teams,real and the fake.Never the less it is a good one time watch flick..I will rate it 6/10",

            "content": "The only other Neeraj Pandey film that I'd seen was 'A Wednesday' which I thought to be seriously overrated as I found it preachy and pretentious. Moreover, I had given up on Akshay Kumar thinking that he wasn't capable of doing good films anymore. But then again, it's got actors like Manoj Bajpai, Jimmy Shergill and Divya Dutta so perhaps it's worth a shot. 'Special Chabbis' came as quite a pleasant surprise. It's well written, edited, directed and acted in by the principle cast. With this film, Pandey shows tremendous improvement. He sticks to the main theme and has written a tighter script.The main flaw is the Kajal Agarwal track and the songs (especially that first wedding song). In my opinion, 'Special 26' should have been a songless film and either the romance angle should have been better developed and linked to the main story or removed completely. But there's much more good in the overall film that compensates for the flaws.Performances by the main cast are brilliant. Akshay Kumar and Manoj Bajpai do a superb job in leading 'Special 26'. I hope Kumar doesn't fall back into the rubbish he's been doing all these years as he's taken a leap towards the positive here. Anupam Kher, Jimmy Shergill and Divya Dutta (offers good comic relief in a brief role) provide fine support.The art direction, costume, hair and makeup department deserve mention for creating the 80s look (the film takes place in the mid-late 80s) and giving it an earthy look.Whether one likes 'A Wednesday' or Akshay Kumar or not, shouldn't be the basis of the decision to watch 'Special Chabbis'. It's an overall solid film with a few flaws.",

The quick wit, the tension and the most important part of any movie, the scripting of the movie are really good.Based on the Opera House heist in 1987, the movie starts off with a CBI team raiding a minister's house with the help of two police officers, and when the cops realize that the minister has been conned and his black money hoarded away, the hunt to trace the fake team begins. This movie has many good things going for it. Firstly, the script. There is never a dull moment in the movie. Secondly, the dialogues. A Neeraj Pandey hallmark. It is quick witted and it is great. Thirdly, the performances. Akshay Kumar gives a brilliant performance as the leader of the pack, Anupam Kher is sublime as the nervous wreck, Manoj Bajpayee uses the deadpan to great effect, Jimmy Shergill is amazing as the cop trying to correct the wrongs. Kajal Agarwal gives a sweet performance and so does Divya Dutta. If I were to nitpick, the love track between Akshay Kumar and Kajal Agarwal, albeit nice and sweet, felt slightly unnecessary. And the songs too felt out of place. The editing is slick, and the setting is brilliant, giving you the feel of the 80's. The cinematography is great as well. And the background score is very good too. This shows that adaptations of real life incidents, in the right hands, can make for an intelligent and thrilling movie watching experience.

            "content": "During the 1980s, the advent of wealth indicators such as televisions, Marutis, Fiats, Bajaj scooters and gold was partly attributed to the growth of substantial black money among politicians, businessmen and celebrities. Such wealth always brought with it the risk of exposure leading to the CBI and IT officials being viewed with trepidation. One con man, along with his partners, took advantage of this fear and conducted a series of intricately planned raids in the name of those agencies. Director Neeraj Pandey ('A Wednesday') tackles an intelligent subject after his acclaimed debut thriller and lives up to the promise of his distinct talent. Special 26 is a witty entertainer, based on true events in the same period and has its bases well covered with superlative performances by its actors, a credible, chronological script and screenplay with adroit direction that keeps the momentum under control between the seriousness, suspense and fun. Ajay (Akshay Kumar) intricately plans the raids and executes them rapidly, covering every detail and improvising spontaneously with his accomplices that include Iqbal (Kishore Kadam), Joginder (Rajesh Sharma) and of course, the brilliant Anupam Kher. Their first raid humiliates Inspector Ranvir Singh (Jimmy Shergil) who supported it unknowingly, thus leaving him distraught and determined to apprehend them. He passes on leads and information to a real CBI official who approaches the case in a diligent, critical manner with focused tenacity. Manoj Bajpai as Wasim Khan is the formidable force that can disrupt all those intricately planned heists and while they're made aware of their fake raid making it to the news, Ajay plans one big raid at a jeweler in Bombay by recruiting 26 more 'CBI interns'. Little does he know that Wasim Khan is a step ahead of his plan..... or is he really?Neeraj Pandey depicts the screenplay at a racy pace except for the occasional romantic escapade involving Ajay and Priya (Kajal Agarwal). Pandey's attention to detail is conspicuous in almost every scene with regards to the vehicles, structures, fashion and background score. But the film's strengths are its well directed storyline and the performances by its A-list of actors. While the director manages the balance between the seriousness of a raid and its fun result, the actors have their own fun portraying varying shades of themselves within moments in the screenplay. Special 26 could not have come at a better time for Akshay Kumar. Just when all his films started looking the same and his role in them hackneyed, along comes a genre in which he excelled ('Hera Pheri', 'Aankhein'). As a lead con man, his dedication and sincerity result in a convincing portrayal of the character while there is a complete lack of other nonsense that he has subjected his fans to recently, including item songs, jarring dialogues and ridiculous action. Manoj Bajpai plays a character that is yet distinct for an actor of his caliber, which in itself is remarkable. His ferocity in a chase sequence, composure while being in a commanding situation and natural reaction to adversity are notable traits in his laudable performance. Pandey maintains his conviction in one of India's finest actors, Anupam Kher, by casting him alongside Akshay Kumar and what a masterful delivery of versatility it was! His dialogue delivery varies in tone and confidence as he appears as the CBI Officer P.K. Sharma and as the tense con man who fakes it all. He thus provides most of the humorous moments without having to jump around or being obtuse. Among the supporting cast, Jimmy Shergill delivers an act so convincing that we all buy into his Inspector Ranvir Singh. Kadam and Sharma, as the other two accomplices are realistic actors for their roles whereas Tiku Talsania was at his comical, cheery best in a cameo.In terms of MM Kreem's score, the Akshay Kumar sung Mujhme tu is soothing but breaks the fast paced screenplay. Gore Mukhde is a fine bhangra number, to be listened to on an evening drive along Carter Road. With two critically and unanimously acclaimed films in his hat, Neeraj Pandey will have added pressure to deliver even better. Meanwhile, his team of Special 26 has achieved something that most films and film makers struggle with..... - Pure entertainment. This one should not be missed.8.812 on a scale of 1-10.",

Very under- rated sadly, but I can't think of a film in which his performance hasn't added to it. The way he stands there at the end and laughs and claps, I can't imagine anyone else being able to pull it off better than him. The reason behind myself typing out this review is different though. It is to explain the reason behind my rating of the film missing out on one whole star. It might not be big deal but it is for me given my history of being too generous and giving 10 out of 10 to many films. The reason here is the guy shown in it who stuttered throughout in his scenes. No, I am not against the role per se, what annoyed me instead was that it was approached in a way of fun. It gave the impression of his disability being mocked in the film. Maybe it's just me and that the film-maker might not have intended to show it that way, but I didn't like it to be honest.",

The story is written in such a way that you immediately start rooting for the \"bad guys\". The characters are well sketched-out and likable. The performances were very good, especially Akshay Kumar and Anupam Kher. Jimmy Sheirgill and Manoj Bajpayee enrich the cast further.This movie is written very well and not much felt out of place. The build-up was good and the pace was commendable. The songs seemed really unnecessary though. I did not like the female lead as much. The interactions between Kumar and Kher were funny. Overall, a good movie. Very smart script and great performances. Will keep you at the edge of your seat.",

It boast of a superstar Akshay Kumar but in the movie, the script is the king and the director tells a fabulous tale.Based on some events of high profiles raids by some fake Govt officials in the 1980s, the movie starts off beautifully. And its a joy ride to be precise with a deadly cat and mouse game as the climax. Its less about guns and violence and more about two brilliant men trying to outwit each other without a bit of violence. The men in question are Akshay Kumar and Manoj Bajpai. Kumar who most people doubt about his acting skills is brilliant. He finally gets an author backed role and he shines. Bajpai, one of India's most under rated actors is fabulous as the honest CBI official. The men have just one scene in the film together and its a class.The rest of the cast including Kher and Shergill are good in their roles. The director beautifully constructs the 80s India and I loved the old world charm in the movie. Pandey, easily one of India's under rated director makes a fine film different from his serious and thought provoking debut classic A Wednesday.The only flaw in the film is Akshay's love story which slows the pace a few places. But ignore the love story and its an Entertaining Intelligent Film.",

            "content": "With Special 26, the much acclaimed director of 'A Wednesday',Neeraj Pandey fame makes a comeback to celluloid after a hiatus of 5 years. His heist drama, which is based on the real life incident of 1987 where a squad of con-men cleverly robbed the businessman and politicians by pretending as CBI or IT Officers across the Indian geography, evokes the same kind of urgency and thrill that was prominent in his first venture.Pandey builds the tempo right from the inception where the con-team carries out its first raid at a politician's haveli , also keeping the humor quotient intact.The mastermind, Ajay Singh(played by Akshay kumar) along with Sharmaji(Anupam Kher), Rajesh Sharma and Kishore Kadam loot the victims off all their black money with so much of perfection and confidence and then decamp with the booty. However, things take a dramatic turn when the real CBI led by the upright and no-nonsense officer ,Wasim Khan (played by Manoj Bajpayee) with the aid of the suspended cop, Jimmy Shergill decide to nab the scamsters during their last heist. A cat and mouse game ensues which keeps the viewer constantly hooked till the twisty climax!Special 26 works primarily because of the tight roped plot , terrific chase sequences and brilliantly chiseled-out characters.The USP of the film is its ensemble star-cast which pits Akshay Kumar , the epitome of what we call as Blockbuster Bollywood against actors of substance like Bajpayee and Anupam Kher. Pandey also helms the arduous task of recreating the 80's \u2013 a testimony to his eye for details while keeping his obsession for rooftops and aerial-shots alive, and thanks to late Bobby Singh's immaculate cinematography for resurrecting and giving a 80s feel to the metro cities. The background score is much reminiscent of the bygone era and is top-notch.While I would say that few of the sequences practically stand out \u2013 like the job interviews for the 'fake' CBI team or Bajpayee's encounter with Anupam Kher, the romantic track between Akshay and Kajal lacks depth and seems off-narrative.Akshay Kumar is restrained and controlled this time and he is superb as the leader of the gang.Its immense fun to watch the man brazenly carrying out the raids in the broad daylight.Anupam Kher is terrific and he fascinates you with his transition from a weak soul to a tough cookie.Manoj Bajpayee shines here and gives his character the much need gravitas.Jimmy shergill and Divya Dutta are natural.Rajesh Sharma doesn't get any lines to rattle.Kajal Agarwal is kind of redundant in this enterprise.I go with 4/5 for this unapologetic crime caper \u2013 it provides you hearty entertainment and the same does not endorse to crime!Regards, Ahwaan",

Like A Wednesday, SPECIAL 26 also sets you thinking.Yet, it's sharp, intelligent and thoroughly enjoyable. On the whole, SPECIAL 26 is an intelligently woven, slick and smart period thriller with its subject matter as its USP.

            "content": "As I read somewhere in threads some users have point out that ---\"After Waseem found out what the plan was, they changed their Plan A\" !!!!It was not the pure Luck of real CBI that Waseem found out their Plan. It was deliberately done. As you can understand from the things that Jimmy was accompanying them and he find out the Anupam kher records. Also when Manoj Bajpayee got to know from the Jewelers' owner that Fake CBI have raided their workshop -- Bajapayee understood all their plan in flashback scenes. So they had deliberately involved CBI in this raid\u0085.Thus it was indeed the plan to involve CBI, now there are lots of plot holes here like ---1) What was the need of involving Real CBI? I could understand that Akshay Kumar wanted to show them that he is smarter than real CBI guys , but still it involved lots of risk.2) How could you be sure that the real CBI will definitely not arrest you before your final attempt to rob the jewelers shop? It could have been a good logic in US/UK where you have to caught the thief red handed to prove their crimes but here in India the Real CBI could have under- arrested the whole gang and then with normal torture/practice would have made them accept their robberies. Even few Businessman/Netas could have made to identify them. \"So it was a stupid idea to involve real CBI that too by sending your own goon\". Otherwise you could easily have gone at the jewelers shop and have looted that. There is no point of taking this much of risk to show that you are smarter than the real one!!!!! (I would have liked the movie if the Jimmy character would have been genuine as then it shows that the Real CBI worked hard to get behind those cons and finally in the end these cons were too smart and fooled them. But it this case it' bulls**t !!!!! 3) OK. I accepted.....you want to fool real CBI that' why you involved them. But then again --(god knows from where they got this intuition/ surety that)the real jewellery would be deposited in workshop.... This is not understandable. As lots of ppl have made this point that the better option was to keep the jewellery at some place in showroom like any vault. So again you have jeopardized your last raid by involving the Real CBI that too by yourself.......4) It was never shown how they were able to siphon-off the money they looted to other country. As after these fake raids they would have amassed lots of Money/jewellery which was not that easy to siphon-off. I know in terms of Movies or even real world it' small thing but they should have shown that where and how they were dumping the money esp. the raids outside of Delhi/Mumbai where one of the four con was located.5) Again the real CBI case - by involving them they have risked their family. At-least as shown in the movie (don't know the background of real con from where this movie is inspired) but here they have shown the big family for Anupam Kher & Joginder (Rajesh Sharma) and even for Iqbal (Kishor Kadam). Only Akki was the man with only a dumb sweetheart. So their family could have been an easy target of CBI esp. since you fooled their best officer.6) Last the Jimmy Shergil plot --- To make it feel genuine what director has shown (i) The Politician would definitely have called the SP after the fake raid even as shown in the Movie. So now either I should assume that SP was also fake or they all were so dumb to know that Jimmy was a fake Inspector. Even that fake Inspector can be suspended!!!!! And then this fake Inspector can go to CBI and told their top boss that he himself is investigating the case with 19 such sort of cases. So in all this process the whole REAL CBI/ REAL police was so dumb to find out that he was a Con \u0085\u0085\u0085 Overall the first half was very beautiful and engaging but the 2nd half/End and suspense was very stupid....For me --expectations were very high - As I watched movies mostly on the base of directors and not on the base of Star Power so had high expectations from Neeraj Pandey after \"Wednesday\". But was disappointed.Let'see with the next director Abhishek Kapoor -whose 2nd Movie is also releasing next week -Kai po che! after the marvellous d\u00e9but with \"Rock On\"",

What is so special about Neeraj's work, and especially Special Chabbis? Perhaps that it does not rely on star power! Neeraj does not require a SRK, Salman, Aamir or Hrithik to lead the main male roles, but simply someone who can portray the role. He has done that twice now with Anupam Kher and Jimmy Shergill. Special Chabbis starts off slowly, but after the intermission you are glued to the screen to see what happens next. Akshay Kumar plays his role with simple ease. For such a seasoned actor, such a role was never going to be a problem but he has done it fantastically. Anupam Kher will always be one of my favorite actors and this performances reminds me why. Manoj Bajpayee is out of this world! Why does he not do more films?! He is a powerful actor with his screen presence and dialogue delivery. Another notable performance is that of Jimmy Shergill, who is one of the most underrated yet talented of Bollywood. Divya Dutta and Kajal Agarwal don't get much scope in their roles, but do a reasonably good job. The music of the film is pleasant, and very much MM Kreem's work, but far from his best work. Kaun Mera by Papon is by far the best song in the album. Don't underestimate this film like I did before watching it. IMDM viewers have rated it an average of 7.7 out of 10 while I write this, which is no mean feat as I can see it has an higher average than the 3 biggest films of the year 2013 - Krrish 3, Dhoom 3 and Chennai Express.",

Special 26 is based on true incidents which happened in India in 1980's, a group of people used to raid(rob) politicians, businessmen posing themselves as CBI , Income Tax Officers. In simple words it is a chor-police drama. Special 26 lacks pace, content and dialogues (now-a-days dialogues can survive a film even if there is no content), but don't be mislead that this film is not a good one. Actually all this lacking is fulfilled by superb performances and some good background score. If you look at movie's promotional poster you will get a feel that Akshay Kumar is the lead here and he will carry this film on his shoulders but Akshay is just big on the poster. This movie has 3 heroes. 1. Ajju (Akshay Kumar) is the lead of fake CBI who plans their targets. This is one of the best performances of Akshay Kumar. 2. Sharmaji (Anupam Kher) is Ajju's deputy. I was amazed by how quickly he changes his roles. In one moment he is hesitant con-man and next moment he is fearless CBI officer who has the guts to slap a minister. Anupam Kher is the real star of this movie. 3. Waseem Khan (Manoj Bajpai): The real CBI officer. Mr. Bajpai never fails to impress and in this movie also he has done a fabulous job as CBI officer. Jimmy Shergill has played his part but there is nothing much to mention about it. Songs act as hindrance but apart from that director has done a brilliant job . Best part of the movie is there is no masala action , not a single gunshot is fired still the plot grips you and makes you clap for the heist. Special 26 is really a special one!Ratings - 7.5/10",

Late cinematographer Bobby Singh succeeds in creating an authentic world that looks real and convincing.The booming background score by M. M. Keeravani and Himesh Reshammiya though mediocre makes sure that you don't look away from the screen but the lousy songs add nothing to this film.But what keeps this film alive is the charming performances.Akshay Kumar , Jimmy Shergill, Manoj Bajpai and Anupam Kher and even actors playing little characters play their parts well with an exception of Kajal Aggarwal who sticks out like a sore thumb.\"Special 26\" wouldn't be half as good as it is if not for the director who succeeds to keep you on the edge of the seat with some good direction.Though not as effective as the director's previous venture \"A Wednesday\", this film has more than enough wit for a commercial cinema.Final Verdict: Entertainment guaranteed. :)",

The chief Sharma slap him twice, and tell a colleague policeman with dignity, \"True power comes from the heart\".Back in their car Sharma tell his partner Ajay how he was scared. The car arrives at a hideout and each man leave with his share of money. They are fake CBI!Maybe it's the first time I watch a Hindu movie, and it is to me a series of amazement. Having never been to India, just watching characters walking through the alleys, or camera looking around the city's landscape from a rooftop, is fun.After the heist, Ajay, the handsome, manly, and shrewd protagonist, dabbles in a romance with a neighbour girl, with a sentimental love song suddenly starting to play. Then he goes to Sharma's daughter's wedding. Among the joyous crowd, he dances with girls in saree of pink, green, and yellow swirling. It's certainly pleasing to the eye.Ajay plans the last and the biggest heist targeting a jewelry shop. He holds a fake CBI recruitment to team up decoy officers, called Special 26.

            "content": "India should be bursting with original stories.But Bollywood remains wedded to the big fat wedding formula and its hackneyed variations.Of late, there is a tendency to present the same stories in new settings, using one of the many accents of Hindi, to add color to the dialogues.Such films tap into the need to hear and see \"authentic\" local characters going about the same business of giving us a typical Bollywood musical or gangster saga.That mob flicks are also musicals is a giant folly, a case in point the highly stylized Gangs of Wasseypore, which had excellent songs but they ideally belong outside the film,as a part of its marketing ecosystem.Special 26 is directed by Neeraj Pandey who made the audience favorite A Wednesday. This time he makes a heist film based on the urban legend of fake CBI men raiding and walking away with black money in the mid 80's.Its a great idea, we need our own Oceans 11 and since India has a jumbo population he gives us Special 26, the more the merrier! In fact one of the characters PK Sharma (Anupam Kher) has a huge battalion of children, he tells the mastermind Ajay Singh(Akshay Kumar), that there was no TV in his time, a lame excuse to make babies for fun.And the condoms called Nirodh distributed by the government were melted down to make flip-flop's in a scam!Pandey gets the India of the 80's right, down to the street scenes strewn with Maruti 800s and Premier Padmini's. When he briefly shifts the action to Kolkata he must have sighed with relief, not much has changed there.The movie begins with stock footage of a Republic Day parade, Rajiv Gandhi accompanied by a portly Giani Jail Singh and Narasimha Rao in white shoes. How I enjoyed those white shoes.In this wimpy political climate we see PK Sharma and Ajay Singh raid the bungalow of a minister, posing as CBI officers.They have two other accomplices and a few real police officers to lend credibility. The raid looks authentic, this was a good way for CBI and Income Tax officials to make money back then.My memory of a raid on my family came alive, but between us dear reader, we proved to be a waste of time for the IT guys.(Back then IT meant income tax)PK Gupta is getting old and wants to retire.Like all good scamster's they want to melt away into the Dubai sunset with one final big job.Ajay too is tempted, lady love is teasing him in the form of Kajal Aggarwal.He is getting old too and wants some action, PK Guptaji has already produced a cricket team, and his bio clock is ticking.Meanwhile the cops who inadvertently assisted them in their raid on the minister are in trouble and Jimmy Sheirgil ,the inspector, wants to clear his name.He joins forces with CBI hotshot Waseem Khan played by Manoj Bajpai to track the gang down. Waseen Khan is brilliant and energetic.Watch him chase down a bad guy on his Lambretta.Ajay thinks up a big one, a huge jewelry store in Mumbai. But wait a minute, why should the owner hand over all his ornaments just because a CBI team is raiding him.This is the exact reason why Tribhovandas Jewelers deny to this day that they were the victims of a heist.Films involve suspension of disbelief and we should happily do so here, the rewards are quite refreshing. Does this faux docudrama morph into a genuine heist film? I will leave it up to you to find out.Special 26 loses pace occasionally due to the love angle and the songs which are its love children.There are a few genuine laughs here and the cast delivers a rock solid performances. The back stories of some of the other players should have been explored further as well as the genesis of this gang.How they find a target would have made for a wonderful subplot but sadly that strand is not explored here.Doing all that would mean sacrificing the holy songs.The color palette of film, costumes, set design and background score all add up to a very well crafted film. The locations are atmospheric, no credit to the line producers of Kolkata though.There is a wonderful scene staged in front of a small Indian Airlines plane.Ajay and PK talk, people think he is a govt. big shot.There used to be this Vayudoot airlines run as a subsidiary of Indian Airlines,serving remote parts of the country, mostly to ferry government officials while the losses were absorbed by the Civil Aviation Ministry.To pull out one of those little planes is a masterstroke.And oh the golden age of Beetel land phones(manufactured by Sunil Mittal of Airtel), a single cellphone and the plot would collapse like a pack of cards.Small and effective heist films have become international classics like the good old French Rififi(1955) which had a nail-biting 20 minute silent safe cracking sequence and the Argentinian film Nine Queens(2000) which has been remade many times.Special 26 is a very good film, and delivers an authentic 80's feel with an engaging plot. A fundamental rule of cinema is three good scenes, no bad scenes.Neeraj Pandey delivers more than three good scenes, several, in fact. Its 2 hours very well spent, the rest 30 minutes you can fiddle with your smart phone, take a leak, buy popcorn. Neeraj Pandey is one of our smartest directors and is improving with every film.Thats really exciting.",

One particular was that while checking the security, Manoj Bajpaye ask constable to check the cctv camera working or not in last robbery scene at Tribhovan jewllers. But at era of 1987 cctv was not discovered yet.. :) Yet this was much exciting and edge of the seat thriller movie by Neeraj Pandey and all actors are superb.. Complete entertainer. And the main part of story is that the person on whose life this stroy is based is still not caught by police. He is mohan lal and he made the robbery as per last scene in real at opera house Mumbai with help of 26 CBI candidates. Which were recruited by himself with fake interview. Even these candidate didn't know that they have been fooled and unknowingly help this man in robbery.. Hatsoff to this brain",

            "content": "Special 26 is a smart, suspenseful action thriller, albeit without any \"action\". Most of this movie, based on the true-life TBZ heist, takes place at a very cerebral level, and makes the audience actually think about what's going on. Too bad this is not what the average viewer wants, but missing this movie is the average viewer's loss.The movie stars a very low-key Akshay Kumar, who perfectly inhabits the role of the suave and sophisticated Ajju, the mastermind behind many con jobs. Ajju and his accomplices pretend to be CBI investigators or income tax officers, and thus scam corrupt politicians and wily businessmen out of their ill-gotten gains. No Robin Hoods, Ajju and his gang live life extra-large! Ajju's deputy is played by Anupam Kher, finally \"acting\" after Saaransh. The scene where he breaks down in the face of interrogation - that alone is worth the ticket price.What spoils an otherwise perfect movie is the absolutely unnecessary romance angle - apparently mandatory as per the Guidebook to Bollywood Movie-making. A simpering Kajal Agarwal stars as Ajju's love interest...and this takes away the impact of the movie. In addition, her youth serves to underscore Akshay Kumar's advancing age, and their romantic scenes are laughable. The movie could have done without this, and without the two attendant romantic songs as well.The others actors, including Manoj Bajpai and Jimmy Shergill play their roles to perfection, being suitably understated and appropriate foils to the lead actors.The fact that this is based on a true story is an added attraction, especially for those of us who are old enough to remember reading about it in the news!",

            "content": "Special 26... An amazing movie with a marvelous climax. One of the best movies of recent times.A team of four fake CBI officers are involved in several raids. But this time they're planning something big. Will they succeed? Or the real CBI officer will catch them? To know you have to watch Special 26. It's one of the best films of Akshay Kumar. I loved his 'catch me if you can' attitude. He doesn't beat up people on a go, nor he does any mindless comedy. He will make you fall in love with him by his calm and cool act. And there is not a single doubt about his personality, charming looks and enthusiasm. 'Kisi ki nazar naa lage Akshay Kumar ko'!! Akshay Kumar haters.... Here comes a kickass Akki movie.... So beware of barking next time when you even think of any nonsense for him. We need more such films from you Akshay Kumar.Anupam Kher is outstanding as Sharmaji. His character entertains us in two shades. One, when he's serious raiding and second where he is a bit fearful & hesitant.Manoj Bajpayee is stunning as 'the real' CBI officer.Jimmy Shergill & Divya Dutta play their roles perfectly.Kajal Agarwal has no scope of showing her acting skills as her character in the film was needless.The supporting cast is perfect.Hats off to Neeraj Pandey for such a wonderful direction. The film is set in 1987 and believe me you won't even figure out whether you're watching a 1987 film or 2013's movie. He has brilliantly written the script. It's so tightly written that you'll get glued to you're seat start to end. The first half takes some time to build up the characters where the second half is pacey.The first fifteen minutes are too good when they raid at a politician's house.If you're thinking that it's a serious movie, then let me tell you that it has a lovely touch of humor too. I've not laughed this much in any comedy movie of recent times.There are only two flaws in the movie. One: songs are out of place. Two: bad computer graphics especially in the second half.The music is average. Dharpakad is my favorite from the album.I'll rate it 8/10. I request each and everyone to watch this flick. 'Asli power script mein hoti hai'! Unmissable!!!",

            "content": "If I were to think about a Hindi heist movie by a Indian filmmakers, it would be stupid of me not to consider that movie a Hollywood remake, a bad one mind you (cough .. Players .. cough). That was before I saw Special 26. This movie and it's makers depict everything that is in constant revolution in Indian cinema. It's conception and subject is something that is very endearing, especially to an Indian heart.Before I start putting un-colloquial words on this post let me just confess that I have seen enough heist movies.This all so mighty nature led me to believe that I knew the ending well enough 20 minutes before the climax. I even with intellectual air up in my head try to tell my engrossed friend how the movie will end, to which I was served with enough verbal abuses. But then something happened and I was left totally flabbergasted with the turn around in story. That air up in my head disappeared like a shamelessly coward dog.The movie is good because it has what it's story demands \u2013 a tight screenplay. Apart from the 2 song sequence, it guides uninhibitedly, making it's patterns quite like the popular heist movies. With the subtle humour of it's characters and intelligent direction, the movie has a lot of scenes to get amused and laugh at. There is that scene where officer (Manoj Bajpai) tells the suspended policeman that he wont get fooled by this gang like he did and with that you know that this will be a good tom and jerry chase and the imminent win of one over other. There is also the savoring scene of interviews where young people come with very funny lines on why they want to join CBI. Neeraj Pandey with his promising debut comes forth with another movie that is enjoyable, witty, intelligent and has enough to make your moneys worth. He has augmented his reputation to another level, maybe the one of the best filmmaker in contemporary Indian cinema.Performance wise it does with what little it has to offer. Akshay Kumar plays the subdued part well in accordance to the story and it's his characterisation. But those of you who might carry the notion of his best performance yet need to slow down a little. The pick of this movie are two persons who with their portrayal make this movie so much fun to watch. Manoj Bajpai with his angry man attitude gets the part so well even with his overconfident nature of portrayal. It might seem like he will growl at you for passing a stupid comment and then he comes with the most quirky dialogue. Anupam Kher potential as a actor is far from recognised. The way he shifts his mannerisms from serious to devil-may- care attitude is worth applauding. This is just a opinion but I think that if Anupam Kher would have done something like 'Do dooni Char', it would have been all the more relishing (No OFFENCE RK). He just gets the common man attitude and attire. Rest of the cast did commendably good in supporting the story. Oh and yeah watch it l so for the art direction and portrayal of cities in 80s especially Delhi.A must, must watch.",

I wonder what was going through people's mind when they rated this film as 8 or above.It's a good change to see Akshay Kumar in character. The overall movie premise is also good and the film is stylishly shot and is inspired by a true event.As I said, the convoluted plots drown the movie inspite of some good acting from Akshay Kumar and Anupam Kher.Eg. A character who is the part of the robbery gang alerts the cops for no reason or compulsion. The cop knowingly allows them to proceed with their plan so that he can catch them in action, instead of actually apprehending them.There are couple more such silly scenes that totally drowns the movie.Neeraj Pandey, who debuted with the brilliant 'A Wednesday', could never repeat the tightness of his debut film in any of his following films including Special 26 and Baby.Special 26 a major let-down.

The con artists are willing to pull off a dare that not any one can comprehend. A brilliant twist at the end of the movie. The con artists start small and go undetected till some news is printed about them, instead of getting dejected and discouraged, they get more and more bold.

            "content": "An air of urgency, a wave of 'what next' with a little heat of 'why the romantic angle and songs' is what summarizes Neeraj Pandey's latest outing, 'Special 26'! Till a little after intermission, one wonders why the movie has been titled so. Well, there is more beyond the name. Let's delve into the special nuances:\u0095 Performances: Whoa! Neeraj, yet again manages to extract real feel from the reel characters! Whether it be the mastermind, shrewd, opportunist Akki or the more suave but vulnerable yet impressive veteran Anupam Kher. Manoj Bajpai is a treat to watch! The GOW actor is again at his best here whether it be his puns, mannerisms or body-language, all changing as chameleon with the requirements of the story. Jimmy Shergil does full justice to his erratic role. Other supporting actors like Divya Dutta, Tiku Talsania, etc. look well-suited to their characters. Kajal Aggarwal, the so-called female lead of the film is perhaps there to add G-quotient. However, her character only slows the otherwise crisp, high-voltage drama.\u0095 Plot and treatment: It's the unusual plot and its execution which score the highest marks for S-26. Bole to, film Ki asli power inhi me hai! The film has a realistic feel of the 1980s be it the gadgets of that era, or the hardly crowded roads or fashion statements. The film is said to be based on true con-incidents that occurred before the license- raj ended in India in 80s. On a macro look, it might look like a normal Chor-police story, sans the high-fundooism and macho-factor of a 'Dhoom' series. However, as the movie progresses, you will find it more amusing, captivating and hair-raising yet entertaining to the core with some taali-mar dialogs!\u0095 Music: was not required upfront, though there were 3-4 unrequired songs without which S-26 could have been crispier. However, the background score is one important ingredient in the film as it adds pace to the happenings and gives the 200 mts race, speed of a 100-mt!\u0095 Cinematography: Decent enough to make the terrains, places, locations believable and realistic to suit the era and the demand of the story.\u0095 Flaws: Yes, S-26 is not short of any flaws. Unnecessary romantic angle and songs I have already mentioned about. Also, a couple of shots filmed with Mumbai sea in background look very artificial. Perhaps, the director wanted to film them in the 80s the ishtyle only!In all, Special 26 is no less special for a watch. After a long time, the climax of a movie didn't disappoint. It's not another 'A Wednesday', but definitely worth a watch. Go for it guys, paisa-vasool hai!",

            "content": "~NO SPOILERS~I wanted to watch Special 26 coz of 2 reasons, 1) Neeraj Pandey who wrote and directed 'A Wednesday' 2)The trailer of course. Special 26 is a film based on the main theme of heist done by a group who act as fake CBI officers. The group is headed by Anupam Kher and Akshay Kumar. Also a love angle is introduced between Akshay Kumar and Kajal Agrawal to spice up the entertainment value. Manoj Bajpayee and Jimmy Shergil also play important roles.Pros- Acting wise Anupam Kher was absolutely brilliant. The first slap given by him to the PA of a minister is the highlight of his confidence, while a particular conversation wit a gun pointed towards him by Manoj, shows his variations and finesse as an actor. Next comes Akshay kumar who has finally done a sensible movie according to me after ages(OMG was good too). This is one of his best acts. He exudes wit, confidence, love and a quirky sense of humour. Manoj Bajpayee is the perfect cast for his role. I liked him more in this movie than Gangs of Wassepur. Jimmy Shergil did good job. Kajal Agrawal is a beauty to watchout for. The casting of every role is so precise that the whole cast keeps up the mood of the movie with their amazing dialogues. The writer, director Neeraj Pandey has again done full justice with the story and the movie. Well done. He has now emerged as a director to look forward to. The costumes and ambiance will remind u of late 80's. The camera work is good. The screenplay is fast and you won't be bored, except for a few songs which are OK. The only song which lingered with me was 'Mujh mein Tu' sung by Akshay Kumar. Its nice. The only think which bothered me was too much use of background music in long 'walk' sequences, which gave them more exaggerated feel rather than being realistic. Besides this little con, the whole movie is something not worth missing. The climax is brilliant but not too brilliant(ask me the difference) as I could judge it well in advance, but still an amazing screenplay attempt. Similar to the climax of Don (2006) or Race (2008) in terms of the unthinkable twists and turns. Finally the title seems funny when you will see the film. Special 26 is a special suspense, thrilling heist film. Must watch!",

Sharma, respectively.Originally entitled Special Chabbis in its homeland India, Special 26 is reportedly inspired by a notoriously bold 1987 Mumbai jewelry store robbery valued at an estimated 3.5 million Rupees (approximately $150k Canadian.) Pandey's meticulously crafted screenplay adopts several aspects of that unsolved daylight heist, including these actual scamming masterminds posing as CBI agents and running a newspaper ad leading to the recruitment of locals to unwittingly join their latest jewel-snatching scheme as fake Government of India security officers.Kumar is phenomenal here, effortlessly shedding the hammy, goofball screen personas of his many previous movies to tightly define Ajay's consistently cool charisma while carrying the lion's share of this 153-minute caper. As well, take note of the soundtrack's wonderfully haunting love song Mujh Mein Tu, sung by Kumar throughout. Kher and Bajpayee also pull in thoroughly astounding performances here, deftly squeezing out every morsel of character definition and drama from this cleverly twisty script for moviegoers of all ages to enjoy. The fun cinematic touches and CGI trickery used in recreating India circa 1980s are virtually seamless and truly inspired. Sure, there are flaws. The pacing at times feels unnecessarily drawn out and unintentionally comical, particularly during early scenes that seem intent on heightening dramatic anticipation. The accompanying incidental boop-boop instrumental doesn't help. It's also disappointing that Agarwal's role as Priya and that of Divya Dutta as Shantiji play out as little more than peripheral human eye candy unimportant to the over-all storyline. Also disappointing is that there's no official website for this big budget effort, apparently relying exclusively on a simple Facebook page and Twitter account for its online presence.Absolutely check out Special 26 for the outstanding performances led by Akshay Kumar, and for this subtitled, masala-tinged crime drama's clever and thoroughly satisfying story. Awesome! Reviewed 02/13, \u00a9 Stephen Bourne.Special 26 is rated PG by the Ontario Film Review Board for occasional use of words such as darn, damn, hell, limited embracing and kissing, and restrained portrayals of non-graphic violence, and is not rated by la R\u00e9gie du Cin\u00e9ma in Qu\u00e9bec.",

            "content": "The film starts with the bang - Akshay, Anupam Kher and two of their guys with the help of local police do a high profile CBI raid in a minister's house. Later, the police and the minister realise that they were fooled and the minister was looted. The first few minutes gets our full attention, albeit we are aware of gist of the story that the duo are frauds.Every heist the gang of four carry out is exciting. Not to mention their sudden fake raid to a traders' business in Kolkata is met with the real CBI already present there. The situation is fantastic when the real CBI stares at these fake CBI in long silence and the cons get nervous unknowing what to do next.Meanwhile Sub Inspector of local police station (Jimmy Shergill) who unwittingly helped the cons in minister house heist was suspended and is ashamed. He knocks the doors of CBI for help to find and put those cons behind the bars. That's when well talented CBI officer played by Manoj Bajpai comes into the scene. With SI, he embarks on to hunt them down.While we are excited on how the story went on in realistic slick manner in the first half, the second half becomes Bollywood-ish. There are redundant and unnecessary scenes. For instance, SI going on the flashback mode for describing the events that led to Minister house heist which brought SI disgrace. Dear Director, may be CBI Officer needs those flashbacks but not the viewers!The gang at last decides to retire with a final job of robbing a big jewellery store, unaware that CBI officer was tracking every step they take.The plot which happens in 1987 is loosely based on 'Tribhovandas Bhimji Zaveri' jewellery store heist by a mysterious con man posing as RAW officer along with 28 other people. The case is still unsolved.The film deviates from the plot when conmen in the guise of CBI conduct interview to recruit 26 people for their final big heist. The interview scenes, reminding of goofy people in the auditions of nowadays' reality shows, are hilarious.When the conmen are not in action, they would be in their hometown villages doing household works(!). I'm baffled. What did they do with the hell a lot of money (more than 50 heists as said by overacting Anupam Kher) that they still can't afford to live well!Every morning after leaving his son in school van CBI director returns home and stares at his wife's busty chest and asks her to wear dupatta over. I don't understand why does the director wants to depict. This is shown more than once in the film. Or is it just a fill for the sexual void created by the lack of \"item numbers\". Director only knows. Probably this is why the film got U/A certificate, otherwise there is no other objectionable material in it.Akhay kumar's romance with southern actress Kajal Agarwal is another unnecessary gap filling sub plot to run the film for two and half hours - the typical Indian film running time.The film which was realistic in the start takes a wrong theatrical turn in the middle and ends with another bang. The second half of the film is unconvincing. In the later half, even Anupam Kher is overacting and Manoj Bajpai comes around with frowned look rest of the film. But the film doesn't fail as an entertainer.Fast paced Cinematography and apt editing elevates film even whenever the story lags. Background score is overbearing at times. \"Mujh Mein Tu\" is a soft solo romantic song which might be played repeatedly. Other songs are forgettable though they are all melodies.Having an interesting plot 'Special Chabbis' could have been as punchy as 'A Wednesday' is, if the frills were avoided and if it didn't try to be a crowd pleaser.",

            "content": "Special 26 is not one of those mindless entertainers with leave-your-brains-at-home attitude. You may assume it's one because Akshay Kumar is synonymous with films like Housefull series, Rowdy Rathore and Khiladi 786. Special 26, which borrows from real-life incidents, is a heist drama, has no forced humor, no South-styled stunts, no song-and-dance routine with foreign dancers in the background. Special 26 is more of a 'treatment' movie, a plot-driven fare. So, there! Special 26 may be a fictionalized account of events that occurred in the 1980s, but Neeraj ensures it does not transform into a dry film/documentary that focuses completely and absolutely on the incidents. The film has the soul of a thriller and the director makes sure that it not only enlightens to the present-day viewer, but entertains as well. While the volatile plot and enthralling drama catches your attention, the execution of the written material, besides proficient performances from each and every member of the cast, makes Special 26 a game changer, a worthy follow up to the director's A Wednesday.Akshay Kumar does a complete U-turn with Special 26. Deviating from the comic/action roles he is recognized for, Akshay truly reinvents himself with Special 26. No two opinions on that. This is, without doubt, one of the most challenging roles in his career and the seasoned actor enacts it with complete authority. Not only will Akshay's fans adore him in this new avatar, even the skeptical types will applaud this superb act.",

Afterall , it's a project of 'NEERAJ PANDEY' \u2013 the director of 'A Wednesday'. Now excuse my 'Tarantino Mania' but I can't resist to use this word i.e rambunctious. Yes , like 'Django' was in 'Django Unchained' so was 'The Common Man' in 'Pandey's' first venture. But do we see that 'RAMBUNCTIOUSNESS' in 'Special Chabbis', let's see.STORY The story has been already known to us thanks to those idiots who made the trailer under tutelage of 'Neeraj Pandey' , why am I calling them idiots?. The answer is quite simple in the first half of the movie we see the descriptive trailer or one can bow down as token of respect to those producers and director for showing the first half in television for free. You are right the first half makes you feel going like the current G.D.P of India. But it is okay. I won't spoil the story as you are already miserable but I can say you will enjoy the second half to the fullest. But to those cynics and hard critics 'You can view the silhouette of almost everything coming'. When the film takes it to this altar, I mean playing with the C.B.I you can say that this flick is not one of the run-of-the-mill at least I say that .PERFORMANCES Talking about performances \"Anupam Kher\" leads . Sorry to upset 'Akkians' but that's my verdict. Isn't this little strange. You see the January movie 'Matru Ki Bijlee Ka Mandola'. In that also the so-called lead actor 'Imran Khan' was dull compared to 'Pankaj Kapoor'. So the question rises what about our star's former performances which were stellar and spectacular hit among the critics? The screen time of 'Kajal Agarwal' is quite short and it is also quite boring. Sometimes you may feel that the couple is blathering. Maybe the director used it as a side dish in a quest to attract the masses, but frankly speaking that the love story was a square peg in the round hole.'Jimmy Shergill' was perfect for his character. 'Manoj Bajpayyee' our beloved \"Sardaar Khan\" was as usual superb. Others were good.MUSIC Music in this film is a bit let down except the song 'Mujhme Tu', but it does play with the sanctity of the mood and hence deters with the pace . The music is not been provided in the demanding sections . Of course eyebrows will be raised regarding the level of dexterity of the music director. It could have been used as a prophylactic measure in the first half even if it cost the ludicrous marriage cum 'Bhangra' song.THE LAST WORD The last word 'DON\"T IGNORE IT BECAUSE IT IS SPECIAL'. And please after seeing this movie do say what is 'SPECAIL CHABBIS'? My rating- 3.5/5",

Its about a gang of four people conducting heist posing as CBI officers.The thriller is greatly directed, well performed with Manoj Bajpayee doubtlessly being the best being followed by Anupam Kher. The rest of the cast also performed well.But there are some major flaws in the movie\n1. Firstly, why the unnecessary love angle\nbetween Akshay and Kajal. I mean it would have been ok even if it was brief but it actually is carried with romance, emotions and four songs, I mean why??2. The lack of depth provided into the heists of the officers as in how they got the information, how did they convince people about them being CBI officers, They are living a complete mediocre lifestyle after conducting about 50 raids, How did they got the paper verification done???, etc.?3. Her, we are being made to route for the bad characters, but why by showing the actual CBI not smart. In the last segment, they didn't kept any trusted security in the warehouse. We know they were sure about the raid that would be conducted in the actual shop, but still if they are shifting gold at the warehouse, it turns out quite silly that they didn't keep any strong security at warehouse.4.
