The acting is so good here, the entire cast really makes you invested in their characters and care what happens to them. I've loved Ray Donovan from the very first episode of season 1 until the end. But like most here have already said, the last few seasons and the movie are not as good but still not bad. The only bad part of the show are his kids, especially Bridget. They just come off as spoiled and entitled and don't appreciate anything their dad does for them. Not too much to say other than this show was fantastic, if you don't believe me just read through the reviews. Most people who've seen it love it!",

It got boring during the middle seasons, but season 6 was very good. I have mixed emotions about season 7. They provided a lot of interesting back story for a few characters, but they left a lot of loose threads at the end.The whole series showed way too much of Ray's daughter. She got somewhat interesting in Season 6, but then I, once again, lost interest in her during season 7.I'm glad Ray's son wasn't shown much during the last few seasons. He was an annoying character from the beginning.Overall, it's a good show if you can stick with the boring bits.",

            "content": "I so want to love this series, as I did GoT, Weeds, and The Wire. The comparison to The Sopranos is apt, great writing, soundtrack, casting and acting. Completely spoiling the magic however is the character and the actor playing Ray's daughter. She's so absolutely dreadful, I stopped watching probably at season 4. I get that she's supposed to be a sniveling brat, but she makes every scene she's in unwatchable. Going back several times since Covid, Ive tried to binge watch, and just can't get thru without fastforwarding which is exhausting.Everyone is odious in their own special way, even the good guys like Terry and Bunchie- its what makes it so fun to watch. Balancing the general psychopathic insanity by showing the characters' humanity without going saccharine makes it fine, though it teeters on the brink at times. I have never seen Jon Voight in a better role than Micky .Donovan since Midnight Cowboy. Steven Bauer is fabulous, so nice to see him. I ignored the more ignoble parts of his career in one dreadful 80's-90's straight to Dvd classic after another; he requently wore headbands. So many good roles for character actors and trrific cameo performances from Roseanne Arquette and Elliott Gould to Ian McShane. Before watching Ray, I really wasn't exposed to Lieb Shrieber, and what a marvelous performance he's had carrying the lead. Kudos to everyone on the team for a job well done. Ever story has its arc and if this lasted 7 seasons, I'm sure it's creatively past its use by date, though i might be sad if I ever get past Season 4.",

I can honestly say that my interest never flagged.The delightful cameos by the many guest stars helped but the performances of Schreiber and Voight were superlative. Reaffirmed their talent as A-list performers.Voight is an inspiration!! His effervescent energy at 80+ years is truly unbelievable. Wow!!!Series 5 was a disaster. Glad to be rid of Abby, but what an interminably boring way to be rid of her. An entire series. Much fast forwarding required. Honestly her and the daughter Brigitte were the only downside to the series. Annoying to the core. Other female characters were great, and Sandy in the final few series was sensational. One of the best characters ever. In any series!I highly recommend this series. Captivatingly brilliant!!",

I really wanted this show to win more awards. It is the only show I'm aware of that has tackled one of the most difficult social issues of our time. It is so well written one must wonder if the writers are close to people who are wrestling with these issues. This is a must-see series and it really deserves more recognition, not only for the excellent writing, but the casting and acting and directing. Ray Donovan is Showtime's best new drama!",

I read alot of the reviews on here and kept hearing about how season 5 was a disappointment. Well I couldn't agree less. Every season has been amazing. I'm actually dreading that I'm coming up to the end. Happy to read that they have already started production of season 7. This show is a win in my book. Highly recommend.

            "content": "I watched the first episode of Ray Donovan without knowing much about the plot or characters. Liev Schrieber is fantastic in the lead role and is reminiscent of Tony Soprano in that he is a dark, violent lead male under constant stress who is protective and nurturing of those he loves, while at the same time projecting an aura of violence and danger to those who would cross him. One scene, where Ray menaces a man who double-crosses him is particularly chilling. The supporting characters are also very solid. Paula Malcomson, (Ray's wife Abby) under-utilized in Deadwood is here allowed to flex her acting muscles in several scenes with Schreiber. Also in the show is the great Jon Voigt, who plays Ray's father. The conflict between them is set up right away in this first episode and one senses an Oedipal confrontation coming somewhere down the line. Most series start out weak and get better as the show grows and develops. This show, however, started out with a bang. If it gets BETTER it will very soon be the best show on television.",

            "content": "This is a solid drama - with the lead character helping upper crusty (mostly) Hollywood types safeguard their positions in society. In addition to the basic premise, the lives (and issues) of the Donovan family are explored.Ray Donovan drives a good portion of this drama - but as a strong silent type - it is the lives of his family, associates and clients that keep the viewers fully engaged. Jon Voight delivers a remarkable performance as the troublesome father - and I think it is his role that helps elevate this series past a 6-7 rating. He really spices things up.The lives of his brothers (Bunchy, Terry and Daryll) - while not compelling in themselves; add a real-life substance to the series - helping make this a serious drama.I think the series suffers when we delve into Ray's immediate family - his wife (Abby) and his children (Bridget and Conor). You might have a different take on their roles but I personally found them uninteresting and often irritating.Abby doesn't seem to have a real role - she's not quite a mother, not a knowing/wise wife - but instead comes across as a needy teenager. Her scenes are passable and still somewhat watchable because of Paula Malcomson's impressive acting ability.Conor, the son, completely forgettable. His life doesn't engage nor does it irritate - it's simply meh - filler material.Bridget, on the other hand, plays the typical (Hollywood) epically annoying teenage girl. You will want to fast forward anytime she appears at 100x speed but... you'll miss out on characters like Marvin and Cookie. So you have to put up with her (it won't be easy). Since the rest of the series is so strong, Bridget is unable to single-handedly destroy the series (which Hollywood-written teenage girls often do).I am reviewing this after watching 3 seasons. I'm tempted to rate this a 6 because I dislike the epically irritating Bridget character so much. But there is so much more going on, so many other great characters, so many outstanding performances (from strong emotions to nuances) that this series is easily an 8 - despite the annoying teenager.May update review later (since I plan on watching all 7 years). It's been bingeable good!",

His 3-4 children (now around the age of 40) where two of them, including the titular character, were raped repeatedly by a priest.

But it's essential a family melodrama with over the top situations and you should treat it as such.The FBI is also present, but more as a caricature of itself so don't expect a police drama either. Humor or clever situations are completely absent, so don't expect it to be entertaining. Unless you think an illusion of a ...talking horse that gives you tips at the race tracks funny, so its fine by me.I should probably bash the show and give it 1 out of 10, but I watch all the episodes in its 2 seasons (with steadily diminished interest) and out of \"courtesy\" alone I'm giving it a 4/10.",

            "content": "I think Liev Schreiber is great as it is, but he plays an interesting role in Ray Donovan, and backed by an equally interesting cast. It took me until the second episode for the show to really catch me; when it did, it did big time. We often get a little glimpse of father/son relationships in certain shows, but Ray Donovan gets real gritty with that area. In fact, the whole family aspect gets a very unique spin here compared to others.So far, I'm loving this show. It's a refreshing piece of work. The acting is wonderful. Jon Voight gets to show off his acting chops (for any naysayers, they can naysay forever- Voight can act!), and of course the dynamic between him and Schreiber plays well. Eddie Marsan and Dash Mihok are enjoyable to see in the smaller roles of Ray's brothers; one with Parkinsons, the other an addict (of anything he can get his hands on). The story of the Donovan family has a lot of depth to it, and I'm excited to see where it goes as the season goes on. Ray's job, the location, Hollywood, the rich and famous; these things just add some exciting texture to it. It's so far, in my opinion, a brilliant new show. As I said before, I love Lieve Schreiber, and I hope this show will do at least reasonably well! I absolutely love it. 10 out of 10 so far.Post edit 07/14/14: I've just finished watching the Season 2 premiere, and wow- it did not disappoint. Ray Donovan just gets better and better as a show. There is already some exciting stuff about to come up and the first episode only just came on! The very last part of the first episode this season was so bad ass; even if Ray was a tough son-of-whaat, he now I am in serious awe of his toughness. Everybody should be watching this! Great cast, great writing, great characters.",

It's just an excuse not to have a plot with an actual story.Ray Donovan's inner circle is made up of everything from a priest-diddled brother to another punch-drunk moron of another brother, to a loud-mouth idiot of a wife with a very phony Southie accent, to a gay kid, and an adolescent daughter that should have been put to sleep instead of forcing her on viewers. Did I miss anything? That was just the first season. I stopped after that. So if you are looking for something with almost no action but heavy on really stupid family drama then this is for you.This could have been such a cool series if they had stuck with the action.

Whoever wrote her character must be a terrible parent. That's probably the most annoying character to watch considering how super whiny she is throughout each season. I think they've could have done a much better job with casting Ray Donovan's daughter, Bridget.So many great actors and (Mickey Donovan) Jon Voight is by far my favorite character. He does an awesome job in every season and the main reason I watched the show. Overall the acting is superb and everyone does a great job with their roles. Great casting and storytelling except for Bridget Donovan. The art directions pretty impressive as well as the scouted locations.

I've seen a few complaints about season five. I agree, they didn't need to kill the main female character. However, I found that season to be the most relatable season of the entire show. My spouse died of cancer at a young age. I felt very much the same as Ray's character. It is more than devastating when something like this happens. It was so relatable that I had a difficult time watching the season. The show took such a dark turn from season five and in the following seasons. And although I found it relatable, I was not happy they killed off one of the best characters. She was the woman who held Ray and the family together. The actress playing Abby did an astounding job her entire run on the show.Someone commented that the cancer experience was inaccurate and unrealistic. This person clearly needs the subtitles and also doesn't understand that every cancer experience is different. They claimed that Abby said she was going to \"start\" treatment when she was already losing hair. She didn't say \"start,\" she said \"stop treatment.\" So it was accurate she had lost her hair at that point. What Abby went through on the show was similar to what my spouse went through. Of course real cancer is worse in real life than when on tv. It's not like the actors can go catch some cancer so that the play the part realistically enough. I wish I could comment on other people's reviews, because some comments really annoyed me.I also read a handful of negative reviews on the actress who played Brigit. I'm shocked some people find it necessary to insult her appearance. She is a cute girl who played her role well. Makes me wonder what some of these fools look like in real life themselves.With all that said, Ray Donovan is and always will be one of the best shows. I was really disappointed when they didn't renew it. At least they could've given it a proper last season. I recently rewatched the show to prepare for the movie. Hopefully the movie gives us fans some closure. These characters and their stories deserved better than being suddenly canceled.",

            "content": "Never have I seen a bigger bunch of whiners and n'er do wells that blamed everything they ever did on their childhoods and, in particular, their father. GROW UP! The four boys, Ray, Terry, Daryll and Bunchy (Liev Schreiber, Eddie Marian, Pooch Hall and Dash Mihok) blame everything bad in their lives on their father, Mickey (Jon Voight), and Ray's kids, Bridget and Conor (Kerris Dorsey and Devon Bagby) blame everything bad in their lives on Ray. That's a very convenient philosophy: Everything good in your life you accomplished and everything bad is your father's fault. The only two characters who take responsibility for their own lives, and as such, are the two strongest regular characters in the series are the aforementioned Mickey and Ray's wife, Abby (Paula Malcomson). That said, I love 'Ray Donovan.' It is a unique concept, featuring top notch writing and situational humor. Jon Voight literally steals the show in a role he was meant to play. Liev Schreiber is the star and the catalyst around which the show is based, so if he he was weak, so too would be the show. Paula Malcomson is also a standout. Mickey's boys are all excellent. I enjoyed Ray's son, Devon Bagby, but Kerris Dorsey always annoyed me. A host of notable guest stars were stellar, including: James Woods, Elliot Gould, Steven Bauer, Susan Sarandon, Peter Gerety, Austin Nichols, Frank Whaley, Brian Geraghty, Ian McShane, Hank Azaria, Sandy Martin and Alan Alda. Special mention to Katharine Moening for her recurring role as Ray's faithful sidekick, Lena and Graham Rogers (Smitty) from whom I expect big things. The move to NYC, in Season 6, gave the series a shot in the arm as it created a new look and feel and new story lines, but we had an almost comatose Ray who kept getting his ass kicked. A huge booo! To Showtime for summarily canceling the show after Season 7, even though they had already committed to a Season 8. Like HBO's entirely premature canceling of 'Deadwood', Showtime saw the error of its ways and commissioned a, yet unreleased, 2 hour film in order to give this highly-worthy series a proper resolution and send off. I look forward to seeing that ending and I will miss this very original series.",

Lots of acclaimed actors, intertwining characters and events, and twisted twists make such series interesting to follow - but, for the sake of full comprehension, you should have time and opportunity to watch all episodes in succession. All this applies to the series in question, where the cast is evenly strong (well, Jon Voight as Mickey Donovan and Liev Schreiber as Raymond \"Ray\" Donovan stick out still), and the situations and relations get complicated a lot, without becoming airy-fairy, and the nature of Ray's duties and his big family enable to deal with dozens of different mini-scenes. Perhaps too much for some, but I personally liked to follow what happened in different places at the same time. Moreover, in many situations, I could ponder on and over complex issues, how/if I could resolve such a situation, and have some sympathy with characters even when the situation was unpleasant or even rude...Good job, and I am looking for the next season already.",

I measure of show by the necessity of putting the 'f' word in the writing as a contrived filler. As in life, the more the 'f' or 'c' words are used the more of an illiterate , ignorant low life a person is. I love vulgarity but it's not power packed unless used rarely and wisely. I wish Mickey would have been killed of long ago because he's boring. All the brothers but Ray are dunces by Season 3. They all say they hate Mickey and say they'll stay away from him yet they let Mickey step on them episode after samo samo episode showing what masochists they all are. Abby started out hot, strong and cool and now she's a trite foul mouthed weakling. Stale is the word to describe the series now. Not even someone with good ADHD, like me, can be sucked in anymore. There are always, at least, 5 soap opera plots going on with these fine actors having sloppy writing and poor plots to burden themselves with. Even Ray's looks and overly nonchalant behavior get weary. Mickey is simply irritating and , mostly , the whole darn show lacks credibility. But, since i'm stuck with the subscription for a month i'll trudge my way through it. Sad. i'M STILL trying to watch this but they are getting worser than worse with every Donovan getting stupider and studpider. Ray and Terry Donovan are as dumb as fence posts. Whewie",

We see a patriarch beat a guy to death for making an offensive joke within ear shot of his wife or kids, and then think we have to cocoon ourselves in a gated community , get a gun, and shoot any adult male who looks suspicious. In real life the real Ray Donovan went to jail; the writers of this were too chicken to portray this .",

I'm not saying that you are all going to agree with me, each character is dealing with terrible and emotional moments recreated by these actors bringing the emotion alive and done beautifully. Not to say at times this series is brutal, a sad testament to our times, but it is acted brilliantly, believable, this incredible group of actors who make this show what it is, dealing with some of the most difficult moments in their character's lives and the fall-out of those horrendous moments. If these things were to happen to anyone you know or to you, how would you deal with it? How could you cope knowing that your childhood was hijacked and you didn't know any better. After all counselors were unheard of during parts of the fifties and sixties, if you had a problem you went to your priest or pastor.....that these characters are carrying on to the best of their ability and making it believable makes this one of the greatest series on cable.",

It centres on a morally ambiguous Ray, who is a Hollywood fixer, but it has many complex layers that include his immediate family and friends. Ray's father is played by Jon Voight and it is a real treat to see him back on the screen in such great form. Paula Malcomson is perfectly cast as Ray's long-suffering wife, Abby.Liev Schreiber has found possibly the role of his career. He is Raymond Donovan both in mind and body. Once you start watching an episode, nothing will drag you away. It is one of the few TV series that makes you yearn for the next episode. That it has incredible actors, great stories and stunning photography is a given but the sheer complexity of all the characters makes every episode special viewing and I hope it has a very long and successful run.",

            "content": "This show is really good consists with 12 ep each season not dwelling too much on problems but still focusing the families' problems.The \"Ray\" character is brilliantly portrayed by Liev Schreiber. Ray was a provider for his spoil family a wive who did't work and idling her time all days, a spoil ungrateful stupid teen daughter, a spoil naive innocent teen son, an angry ungrateful handicap brother, an innocent yet mentally not very wise kind brother. Ray's father Mickey is amazingly portrayed by \"John Voight\" as a bastard with no responsibility and always taking advantage to those who near him also creating tons of problems for his sons but did not do anything to solve it instead only make it worse, however on season 2 we could see him not ratting his son on FBI much better than Ray's spoil selfish wive.The show is focusing on Ray on his relationships with his families and his clients but he is one of the most caring family person ever because even though the usual calm Ray always dealing with his client's problems on calm manner but if his family member got into a problem he will do anything to save him/her and not wasting time to help them even though it means that he cannot see his client on time hence more problem created. However most hindrance of his life come from his own wive, on season 1 we could see that he hate his dad a lot well he had good reasons for it, but on season 2 it's getting clearer that his wive was constantly whining, selfish, easily influenced by other, and a cheater. I can accept Ray's reason cheating on his wive since his home never provided the good family environment and his wive and kids never feel grateful for what he did for them (provided them with big home and good environment, good money, solving their problems when they have it but still they defend others and comparing him with his bastard dad). His wive \"Abby\" was a selfish mother never stays at home daylight or spending time with her kids however she was tired of all the family's problems and she had a fragile mind of thought especially with her husband lack of communication, still she should spending time more for her kids and become pillar of the family so her kids won't smoke weed, have wrong friends, or whatever they do that can ruin their teen life.Ray's past was not an easy one his mother died because of cancer while his sister jump to her death and he provided his brothers until they are old, his dad was cheating with other woman not to mention stole mafia's money then gave it to his mistress before leaving his small kids behind, leaving Ray to fend of his brothers and sister. When Ray thought that his wive was the best turned out she wasn't because she was easily influenced by what others were saying about him and accused him the worse, well yeah I get it this family lack of communication but Ray was being a sole bread winner in the family so his wive could have taken care of their kids and nurture them to understand to being grateful for their dad but instead she was selfish and whining all the time. Ray's only fault was being too kind and overprotective to his family so when something goes wrong he was the one who always being blamed for. The writer introduced us to human complex relationships and deeper meaning into people' behavior and habit. I really appreciate this show and hoping that this show won't get too complex and that Ray will finally able to gain happiness for all the problems that he went through.",

I highly doubt a man like Ray would marry this witch in real life. Then there is the daughter, again so annoying and ugly. I almost have to skip the scenes she is in. Of all the actresses in Hollywood why cast these two? Personally i think Christopher Walken would have been a much better choice as Mickey, but John Voight does an OK job.",

Why are kids in movies and dramas portrayed as insolent swines with no manners, who are never disciplined - little wonder there are so many delinquents in the world if they see kids on the screen behave this way.Most of the characters were excellently cast, but for me Jon Voight was a joy to watch. He delivered his dialogue with the humour it wanted, and which the drama badly needed, I laughed out loud many times at what was said.It drifted off badly after no.5 with brothers going to jail, getting out of jail, back in jail again, so really it needed season 8 to finish things off completely.",

There is one major problem, however. It's with the set-up. There is a fatal problem with the narrative story. It doesn't make sense.Critical to the success of the show is Ray's relationship with his father (played by Jon Voight). The way that Voight's character is written suggests that he is to be feared, that he is a loose cannon, that his relationship with Ray was so dark and black and unforgivable that reconciliation could never be thought possible. And the success of the show depends upon that.Instead, while we wait and wait and wait and wait for some grand revelation that could make sense of the backbone of the entire narrative of Ray Donovan, it never comes. Sure, there are things that are revealed. The nonsense about the father being set-up and going to jail for twenty years for something that he didn't do was ridiculous. What was Ezra's involvement? Never disclosed. Ray has legitimate beefs with his father, but it never rises to the level that would support the antagonism that is necessary for the conflict in the story to take root. It, thus, becomes academic, and in the end, unsatisfying. Moreover, it would seem to me that the father would be angrier and more resentful towards Ray for being set-up and sent away for much of his adult life. The father is no saint, that is for sure, but he is no demon and no mafia kingpin. Why is he feared? Why is Ray afraid of his influence on his children? Perhaps had the father been the one who molested Bunchy -- instead of a priest -- that would have made it more compelling . . . a rehabilitated pedophile? Maybe that would be a hard sell, but a former drug seller and embezzler just didn't cut it as a man someone like Ray Donovan would fear, let alone want dead. Without there being a strong narrative structure, the story simply doesn't fly. It is reduced to a man (Ray Donovan) who has an irrational fear of his father and will stop at nothing to shut him down. Ultimately, the father ends up simply being a flawed person who has in many respects failed his family in the past. But a terrible person? A monster? A man to be feared? All he wants -- and all he ever wanted for the entire season -- is to be close to his family after he gets out of jail.What can I say? It was largely a waste of twelve hours.I won't be watching subsequent seasons, and I do not recommend.",

            "content": "I did watch EVERY episode so I am being fair to this show. This show borrowed a LOT from other concepts, which well, is not a bad thing in itself. People pointed out it borrowed the crime boss/family guy concept from the Sopranos, Irish mobsters from every Boston crime movies, starting with the Departed with a Whitey Bulger clone, Sully played by James Wood thrown in. So close to real life this one was that he hid out in Santa Monica too. But it also had Beverly Hillbillies concept where uncouth South Boston Irish descend on trendy, modern LA and rub shoulders with the degenerate rich and famous. But unlike Jed and his clan, who are decent honest people, this clan is mainly a bunch of punks and killers, with some sad sack brothers for pathos and comedy relief thrown in. At first I thought Ray would just pull slightly sleazy maneuvers to get his star clients off the hook; like switching out the man in a dead coke whore's hotel room from a black athlete to a bisexual action movie star who was being outed as gay right before his latest action movie came out. But like Dexter, Ray seems to have a special license to kill or seriously injure rivals since they are bad people too. He beat a peeping tom to death when he simply could have had him arrested for say child porn since he and his crew of operators seem to be experts at all sorts of dirty tricks. But since the guy was a perv, it was okay to kill him in order to protect his blond air head child star girlfriend.There is also his two messed up brothers, one who is a church abuse rape victim, Bunchy, who hangs at the boxing gym run by his other brother, who is a crude but somewhat honorable boxer with Parkinsons, Terry. Bunchy seemed to be channeling Tim Robbins from Mystic River with a man- boy victim act gone viral. He is supposed to be some alky in recovery, but always ends up drinking, you get it. Then there is a black half brother who Ray finds out about in the opening of the show, Darryl, Of course, he hangs out in the gym and drinks and fights with the rest of the boys. Finally, his dad Mickey, played by Jon Voight, seems to steal every scene he is in with his hammed up old jailbird low level mob act. You see, Ray and his going senile boss Ezra, aka Eliot Gould, started this star protection business by framing Mickey for the murder of Ray's old girlfriend. Mickey did 20 years for a murder that the firm's first star customer committed. but since the star was high on Mickey's drugs and used Mickey's gun, Ray felt it was okay to stick it to his dad. You see, his dad turned away when Ray and Bunchy were being abused by the priest. The church sex abuse scandal is also featured prominently in this show, and it is not very friendly to the Church, if that bothers you. As a matter of fact, the opening scene of the show where Mickey got released from Walpole Penitentiary. On the ride home, Mickey goes and shoots a priest dead with a gun stuck in his mouth that he thought molested his kids.Then there is Rays own wife and kids, including the grating ginger wife Abby and two well groomed kids. Ray of course keeps them so in the dark that in the case when they actually might be in danger, Ray doesn't actually warn them but sends his ex Mossad sidekick Avi. Avi, played by Steven Bauer, is actually the most interesting of all the characters, since he doesn't seem to have any sort of attitude, unlike everyone else who has a 100 lbs chip on their shoulder. Okay, the show has lots of characters and actors who are way more interesting than laconic macho Ray, aka Liev Schreiber. As an actor, Liev is at best a co-star, He is just too wooden to be taken very seriously. As well as his character, no matter how hard they ham up the family protector angle, is just too amoral and criminal to be respected. He is just a greedy sadist who hides behind his family, like where he tortured a sleazy (aren't they all?) real estate agent to get ALL his stupid brother's money back, even after his demented brother torched one of the rooms in a drunken fit. Jeez Ray, toss the guy say 10g for his pain! A good chunk of the show revolves around how Ray, after his dad did 20 years in place of a star criminal that Ray helped cover for, decides to have his dad murdered. And who does Ray get to kill his dad? The mass murdering psycho mobster Bulger clone Sully who wastes about a dozen other people instead after Ray drags him out to the west coast. The show has a Dexter angle, (another SHO production) where if you stick to killing bad guys and are nice to women and kids, you get a pass. But Dexter was a lot tighter a show and took longer to wear itself out unlike this three ring circus of freaks, plastic people and punks.",

Ray seems to have gone from monosyllabic to dull mute, not sure its the endless drams of whisky he pours down in every episode or just the stupor he seems to be in after the death of his wifeor maybe just poor acting? The entire family seems to have come down with a severe case of rank stupidity which makes it difficult and very annoying to watch and certainly does not evoke too much sympathy for the characters other than Mickey who as always is played so brilliantly by Jon Voight.\nPerhaps we don't need a season 6 after this lot.",

            "review_title": "One of the best character written shows on TV",
            "content": "I caught this show through a suggestion by a friend who actually lives in England. Since I live in LA and he was surprised I had not watched it. I am not really a big fan of LA shows, especially when its focused on the Hollywood celebrities and their problems. However, from the first episode I was really impressed that this show's writers had a different take about a guy like Ray Donovan \"The Fixer\" who goes around and intercepts through any bully tactics, to solve situations and problems of the Hollywood elite and their dirty laundry; yet he is very internally conflicted in his own personal life with the people he loves. To my own surprise for some reason I got really hooked into this show from the first episode. Maybe partially because it does not portray Ray as a nice guy, in fact he is as bad as as any criminal, he has all the right people in his pocket that owe him favor or he something on them to black mail them to fix a problem. In one hour this show shuffles through so many characters that you feel the hour is filled with great characters, great acting one scene after another. It also does not feel like it's based in LA, more like an East coast, because LA is not a place where you associate a Boxing gym and a bunch of tough Irish guys hanging out, that's why this shows fails to City's landmarks and streets in general, it's the weakest part compare to a show like \"Southland\" that really shows LA as it is. Ray Donovan is always at the center of this show, but his father and brothers each get a equal time with their personal issues too. Ray's wife Abbey played by \"Paula Malcomson\" who I think its best in the show, there is so much in just her expressions and eyes without any words. I think its character like Ray's brother \"Bunchy\" who have been damaged by some childhood trauma and still struggling with, its what makes this show so rich in writing. Ray himself is a very angry and damaged person whose brooding face is almost a permanent mask he wears to the outside world as a shield. Ray's work is as immoral and illegal as any criminal, he really reminds me of another \"Tony Soparono\". This show somehow does parallel in some part to \"The Sopranos\", the scenes with Abbey and Ray remind a little of Tony and Carmela at times, but it goes further deeper into their relationship, Abbey is more aware of Ray's lies, even though she tolerates his infidelity, but she demands emotional honesty from Ray, which is not something Ray is capable of even to himself; at least even Tony Soprano went to therapy to get some help but Ray's only solution is the bottle and the rage he carries inside,his resentments against his father that he wants to have killed, anger his fuel. I was never fan of \"Sopranos\", I only liked the late \"James Gandolfini\" whose acting was the center of that show, there was no Sopranos without him been in it and what it became. \"The Sopranos\" was not really about anything than bunch of gangsters; the therapy sessions in the first two seasons were at the heart of it but that lost focus after the 3rd season, then it became a TV version of \"Good fellas\"; with almost half of the same cast.This show however \"Ray Donovan\", has something called depth and intelligence, its written with heart; its characters are troubled like \"Terry', Ray's other brother who runs the Boxing gym, his right hand has twitch and broken heart tattood on his chest, their father Micky, play by the legendary \"Jon Voight\" whom has not done anything like this good for a long time, he plays an ex-con who is really hard to get a read on at times, he is both good and bad like Ray; that's why they mirror each other and their conflict with one another is confused and unexplained. That is mostly to Ray's hatred and holding on to his own perception of the past. It even puts some focus on Ray's kids, they are not used as props and their issues at home and growing up is part of Ray's struggles to center him in a way, his family is his refuge but even with them he hides who he really is. I read a lot of great reviews here on this show how it was compared to same level of writing and depth of shows like \"Dexter\" and \"Breaking Bad\"; which are both superb shows too but I still think this show will probably surpass both those two shows in years to come, it can easily go 5 to 8 seasons. Although \"Breaking Bad\" had a central character \"Walter White\", the show's whole theme is about the change of this ordinary chemistry teacher to this mean ruthless meth dealer, how good changes to evil, the other supporting cast like his wife had no real change or issues as the range of multiple characters on \"Ray Donovan\", where each character has their personal conflict, this is truly one of the best shows on Cable TV today and I hope they stay on the air.",

Bungy's settlement money just stopped being mentioned, though he knew who had it, and he was going to get it. Dropped! Ray gave Bungy the bar but, when they all move to NY, no mention of the bar which was supposed to support Bungy and his family. It just evaporated, along with any mention of what the bar was worth. Again, leaving Bungy with nothing! The ransom money, stolen by Mick's sister-in-law? We see her driving away, while drinking and not watching the road. Did she crash, and the 3 million burn up? Never mentioned again. They sold their home in California, but when Ray is in NY, he is homeless, living with the cop who rescued him. Etc. etc. etc. How about tying up ends? Crazy gaps everywhere!

But the one who really stands out is Jon Voight.

After two episodes, it is clear that Liev Schreiber and Jon Voight have bought in fully to their roles and they are nailing them. Supporting performances are also very strong, in my opinion.I expect plenty of people to be confused by the plot, because the writers don't feel the need to spoon-feed the audience.

No one is particularly likable, and when you first start watching it, you feel slightly angry with yourself for committing to it. You may even question what you like about it, when everything that happens in it is so dark, gritty and grim.But the acting is phenomenal, and each character develops in a way that is almost genius. Each character has their own pull. Sometimes when you watch a show there are certain scenes that you can't be bothered with because you don't care about that particular character as much as others. In Ray Donovan ALL of the characters are compelling and unique. Even the vulgar and hateful Mickey is just too awful for words BUT absolutely brilliant in every way.Bridget, and Abby are both fantastic in their roles. And now in season 3 the newly introduced Finneys are amazing creations, taking the show down a whole new journey.This is a highly underrated programme, and one of my favourite all time things I've ever watched.

To end the series with a two-hour movie did not do it justice. I did not think Ray's character was an \"over-the-top\" tough guy ala John Wick. It had plenty of tough-guy elements (I mean we're talking about Irish mobsters), but there were also elements of family drama and Ray juggling his life as a fixer, while trying to manage his family problems. There were some seasons where I felt like the writers made incongruent changes to the story line from one season to the next, but overall the story lines remained lineal and in-tune with audience expectations.",

The story suffered a serious setback from Episode 1, and the downward decline just couldn't stop to Episode 7. Like Ray Donovan's tired face, this series also making me feel tired to the bone.Furthermore, the girl who plays Ray's daughter seems to became even uglier after 4 Seasons, her whole facial structure just fell out with overly protruding cheekbones, lower chin and caved-in nose and mouth areas that made me feel very uncomfortable every time when she appeared on screen. When there's a dialog by some players in this series praised her beautiful face, it just made me want to puke.Again, I just wish Ray won't spend his next episode to force us watching him to lost himself in remembering his dead wife. Enough is enough, you stupid producers and screenplay writers.

Given the general premise, the fact that it starred Liev & Jon and the favorable rating on IMDB I figured it would be right up my alley.Well, I made it into season 2 before finally throwing in the towel, I just became indifferent, bored, and it became cringeworthy and bothersome. I think if I started watching this weekly back when it aired instead of bingeing, I would have given up on it much sooner. But I wanted to give it a fair shot hoping it would get better.Ultimately what lead to me giving it up was a combination of the believability factor, coupled with characters I just couldn't get into. Starting with the believability factor, I get it, this is TV, not real life, it's for entertainment, etc.... But the show does take itself serious and even know one must suspend disbelief for certain things, it was just too far off the grid for me. It wasn't the action which surprisingly seemed believable, but rather relationship dynamics, and how people would typically interact and react to things, especially between Ray and his wife & kids. No way is any of this remotely close to real life. As far as all Ray's work-related dealings, that part of the show I actually liked, but going back to the believability factor, it was just too far away from reality for me to roll with.Now onto the characters, this was the other thing that ultimately bounced me out of the show. For a show to remain intriguing enough to keep one's interest, you have to be able to like or relate to some of the characters, it gives you something to root for and invest into. However, for this to work characters at least have to remain somewhat consistent or be grounded to whatever principles they adhere to. In this show the two main characters Ray & Mickey would act a certain way, and then go do something so conflicting or polar opposite that it just creates an artificial or unnatural chaos. And for the record I'm totally fine with morally gray characters, but they at least have to be somewhat consistent, unless they are a psychopath or something. In this case I couldn't care or get invested into Ray, his father, or pretty much anyone else from his family. About the only characters I liked were Terry, Avi & Lena, but collectively they have such low screen time that it didn't amount to muchTo sum up, I like the main plot theme, and a few of the supporting characters, but for me it fell flat with characters actions or interactions, and lack of consequences for anything, just so outside of the normal world. I found myself spending more time questioning: \"How could that person just do that\", \"why would that person just put up with that\", \"how can that person be such a rich powerful person and yet such an idiot\", or \"How is it that people can just down glasses of hard alcohol in pretty much every scene like it's water, not show any stick faces, and not seem to get drunk.\" Anyway enough is enough for me...",

The writing, while good overall, leaves one bad plot hole: Bunch gets Sandy's keys to go and get some paperwork, and when he comes back, Sandy has taken all of Mick's money and has left. She is shown driving her car to Boston....the car that Bunch borrowed and which couldn't have been there for her to take.Not too bad, I suppose, but the scenes in bars always shows a bartender taking a cap off of a bottle and pouring a drink. Bartenders use pour spouts on bottles, and have since the '50s. It's pretty hard to keep up with serving drinks if you have to uncap and recap bottles for each drink.So, the writers, directors and continuity people do drop the ball here and there.

I should say, 3 1/3 seasons.Abby's sickness and death did more than mark the, (unnecessary), departure of a good character, but it pretty much killed off what made the show great.Whatever happened, though highs and lows, Ray was always strong. He bounced back. He managed to hold everybody together. Since moving the show east, Ray has been a sad, inconsequential shadow of his former self. Instead of the extraordinary fixer, fighting through his sadness at the loss of his wife, he has devolved into a two bit hood that anybody can kick around.Ray Donovan has become a chump. W.T.F? There were glimmers of the former Ray here and there but holy crap, this is getting hard to sit through. He's turned into ol' yeller...basically waiting for a bullet, and it's not entertaining to watch.He now sucks as a fixer. His family, (that he did so many terrible things to support), either uses him and/or has abandoned him. His few friends screw him over. He was always a drunk, but now he's a drunken loser...and as of the last episode I saw, he wakes up in a psycho ward.Micky was entertaining but now he's just annoying. Bunchy has gone from useless to pathetic. Terry started fighting again...for absolutely no reason. We knew that he would after Ray warned him that his parkinson's would come back...and voila...his parkinson's is back. Not so subtle, that foreshadowing.Lena is momentarily happy with a girlfriend...but we can't have that, so they kill off the girlfriend. Both of his kids hate his guts.Wow. How the mighty have fallen. The show was always dark, but now it's bleak. They turned Ray into a sad pu$$y. I know the season is already filmed but I sure hope they can pump some life into this thing in the editing room.I have tried to but I don't feel I have properly expressed my disappointment with the developments of Ray Donovan. If feels like everybody just stopped trying. Mediocre, cliche writing. Dead eyed, wooden acting. If they were trying for gravitas, they shot way past the mark and are currently falling through catatonic.Maybe they shouldn't have pulled Ray out of the water. At least then we would mostly have good memories of the show.Sure...I'll probably watch the rest of the season. I probably have another 4 hours of my life I can spare but it's more out of curiosity over how much more depressing they can make this once amazing show, than out of any hope of that they can pull out of the tailspin.",

I saw many others complain about this also and I didn't think it would bother me but after a while it gets annoying.In the show Ray tried to say everything bad that happened was because of his father but in reality everything bad that happened was due to Abby. If she would have listened to her husband knowing how his father is then he wouldn't have shown up and none of this would have happened.I don't know if it is a given that the women characters are so annoying or what but they are just like they were in the Sopranos. Abby knew what she was getting into and was fine with all the money but then decided one day that wasn't good enough for her? The only decent female character was Lena. The rest were basically greedy and liked the money but wanted to complain about how it was made when it suited them.Update: Abby was annoying while she was alive but who knew that she would be even more annoying after she was dead.

As I mentioned, so much of the plot lines and developments are quite preposterous as Ray, his brothers and the various cops, criminals and players get inflicted with more physical punishment than your average gladiator did in ancient Rome. Still, it's a fun series to watch in you have no objections to gratuitous violence, sex and profanity.Superb acting in this. Live Schreiber is compelling in the title role as is cable series queen Paula Malcomson as his long suffering wife Abby. But the best performer is screen veteran Jon Voight as Mickey Donovan, the ex-convict father of the three Donovan men. Voight steals every scene he is in as he is able to do one of the hardest tasks in acting-making a completely repulsive and utterly selfish character somewhat likeable. Unlike \"The Sopranos\" who managed to have lots of laughs (perhaps unintentionally) they are infrequent in most RD episodes, but they usually come from Voight. RD also brings back a number of actors older viewers will remember. Besides Voight, we have Elliot Gould as a sleazy attorney who hires Ray to cover up the various messes his celebrity clients get in, Susan Sarandon as an evil studio executive, Hank Azaria (Simpsons, Brockmire) as a crooked and kinky FBI bureau chief, James Woods as a veteran hitman, and even Paul Michael Glaser (tv's Starsky), Stacy Keach , Cheryl Ladd, Dabney Coleman, Diane Ladd and Ann Margaret in small roles.",

Instead, the next episodes a boring family drama lead to a complete yawn-fest. The show lacks humor, even when trying to be hilarious. All characters are like suffering, putting faces of internal pain all time and so on. Main character, Ray, in the first episode is portrayed as an hieratic bad-ass, able to solve any situation with the support of his no-less bad-ass Eastern Europe hit-man and a no-less bad-ass computer and espionage expert. In next episodes we discover that Ray actually is a weak sociopath unable to communicate efficiently with other human beings (specially his wife, whom he supposedly love, although he treats her like sh*t...yeah, in this show women are constantly used and abused) and full of issues, hidden behind a macho facade, with a pathetic family of social misfits plagued by traumas and mental issues. Rapidly, the show focus on the relations and conflicts, generated mainly by the insane lack of communication among the several characters. Less action in each episode, unfriendly characters with whom it is impossible to empathize, and growing drama and unrealistic story lines made me leave the show at the end of first season.

The third season was very nearly as good, but perhaps not quite so polished. Season Four, however, introduced a major story element that made my heart sink. Cancer. (Yep. That tired old soap-opera trope!)Now I should point out that my disappointment at the direction the show took was, of course, highly subjective. But I feel that if I had been adequately warned in advance about where things were heading plot-wise, I would NOT have spent the money to buy this otherwise excellent show. Because for very personal reasons I have a deep and powerful aversion to the subject of cancer, and watch shows like Ray Donovan SPECIFICALLY to escape from having to think about it. So my heart sank when it was introduced, and it sank even further when it became clear that the producers intended to use it as the MAJOR storyline going forward.However, I had paid the money, and the rest of the show continued to be high-quality and riveting. In fact, so compelling - during the brief interludes that didn't involve watching someone slowly dying from cancer - that I couldn't stop watching, even though the show was now a serious downer. I binge-watched the remaining two seasons (4 and 5) in one go. But it was more of an endurance event than the sheer delight that it had started out as.Season Five was a HUGE departure too, for stylistic as well as narrative reasons, and judged on its own merits would only have scored 2 stars from me. Aside from being a major downer due to the bulk of each episode being about multiple characters dying slowly from cancer, it also changed its storytelling style from a linear, straightforward narrative to a needlessly convoluted and messy miasma of flashbacks and flashforwards, crashing clumsily and confusingly backwards and forwards in time with no particular structure and nothing to ground the viewer or help them orient themselves in the story. Frankly it was a bleak, depressing, confusing mess. It also introduced another stylistic element that had previously been blissfully absent: Dream sequences and hallucinations. I passionately despise these things, as they are a lazy storytelling device, as well as being clich\u00e9d and annoying!However, and here's the thing with Ray Donovan; the bits of the show that actually focused on dodgy deals, hiding bodies, blackmailing scumbags, and managing the various disasters created by Mickey and his sons, remained as compelling as ever, and I still couldn't stop watching - despite not enjoying the majority of each episode.The show lost its way badly after its third season. But it is still a great series, with a top cast, excellent writing, and a gripping story.

She was an excellent ride or die character.Kate Moennig is a great actress who fit well with Liev in role of boss and right hand person. Lena was the brains behind the operation while Ray was the brawn. Together they made a kick ass team. Shane the show did not focus on the business more.",

The end justifies the means and Ray, with a mix of distortion, threats, violence and murder, always gets the job done.Ray has a marriage that suffers both under his absence and lack of ability to show any kind of emotional response. He seems tired and burnout all the time as if he has been carrying a responsibility that is too big for to long. He is so expressionless that it at last gets on your nerves.Furthermore he has his two brothers. One with an alcoholic problem, that appears infantile, and another who has a boxing gym and a right arm with some odd motor deficit that you sense there is some secret behind.His father is released from prison after twenty years and season one can now begin.At one level Ray Donovan is action packed but at another a lot more is going on as the interaction between the characters is given much attention.The father, played brilliantly by Jon Voigt, enters the scene and shows us in a most convincing way what a life in prison does to your social abilities. He is full of good intentions but flunks again and again with his own belief that he can charm anybody with his superficial humor. He furthermore has an inappropriate language and to a certain degree moral values that has been in a time capsule for twenty years.The dynamics between Ray, his father and brothers are very engaging to watch but as far as the marriage goes the repeat button has been pushed too hard. The recipe is that his priority, without exception, is his job and his wife again and again, and yes again, shuts and yells at him for not being there while he leaves the scene often with a cell phone in his hand.There is much anger and bitterness on Rays part pointed at his father and the secret behind this slowly reveals itself with all the suspense this involves. This part is in my view the most exciting to watch and is beautifully intertwined with all the other stories that come to life.Regards SimonPs.

But I think that's exactly what the show is about, the fact that dark and awful things happen all the time, dirty meaningless sex happens all the time, and horrible violence happens all the time. And I personally find it interesting and compelling, but maybe my \"moral compass\" is broken. As far as believability, I find the characters to be dimensional and well portrayed, and the dialogue to be well written. I don't know any movie stars, rich people or old Boston townies, but I don't find any accents or characters to seem over the top or off (which can be a pretty easy thing to notice when it's really bad). At least it's not as bad as shows about CIA operatives who wear heels on every mission... (but that's another show).",

At best just not fulfilling certain expectations. ---- OK the gist of the story: . Ray Donovan is a tough, shrewd guy, who \"Solves\" rich clients problems for a fee. He tries to do it without un-necessary violence but if push comes to shove he will shove. There ain't much he can not handle one way or another apart from problems caused by his own family and folks. - He can not 'push or shove' the ones he cares about. They don't understand the nature of his business or their problems, so they defy him, and by default he only manages to alienate them instead. They all demand the 'Truth' but as usual 'can not handle the truth' , ------ The stories are very well written, acting is quite good (by most if not all) - Ray is well portrayed as a tough macho with problem after problem piling up for him to manage. His wife Abby is also well portrayed as a neurotic, ungrateful bitch who although loves Ray and the kids, but somehow is under the delusion that she deserves more respect! Mickey the A*hole father is played very well by veteran Jon Voight. - I absolutely love the series, it is not perfect - but hey what is? - going back to those aforementioned criticisms, somehow, some people expect more real characters, more real situations, more real etc. - All I have to say to them is \"Watch documentaries instead!\" - this is fantasy, a story, a drama! . . . by definition it must be bigger than life - you want more \"real\" there are always \"days of our lives\" type soaps.",

I've taken in Lieve Schrieber's masterful performance over four years and forty-eight hours of television and found it both exciting and meditative. Showtime offers up some prestige television and Ray Donovan is at the top of this network. The show follows Ray as he fixes problems for Los Angeles rich and famous. The show picks up after an action-packed season finale of the third season with a shootout where Ray and his father Mickey Donovan (Jon Voight) took down the Armenian mob with the help of Ray's right-hand man Avi (Steven Bauer). Abby Donovan (Paula Malcomson) discovers that she has breast cancer and debates whether to seek treatment as she is upset with her husband and his promiscuous ways. Ray has to seek treatment himself for his alcohol addiction where he is introduced to the boxer Hector Campos (Ismael Cruz Cordova). Hector is seeking a title so begins to train at Ray's gym under the training of Ray's brother Terry (Eddie Marsan) who has Parkinson disease. Hector also has an incestuous relationship with his sister Marisol (Lisa Bonet). Ray's other brother Bunchy (Dash Mihok) has married the wrestler Teresa (Alyssa Diaz) but after her pregnancy, she suffers from postpartum depression. There are so many other great characters but another exceptional one is Lena (Katherine Moennig) who had a falling out with Ray but is back in the fold this season. Also, Ray's half-brother Daryll (Pooch Hall) is really funny as the comedic relief and I'm glad I've been seeing him in commercials recently. After Season Five: Ray Donovan (Liev Schreiber) returns for a mournful fifth season as the death of his wife Abby (Paula Malcomson) has caused him an immense amount of grief. It is not immediately revealed how Abby died the season is split between present-day drama and flashbacks of Abby's last days. Ray is in a drunken daze for most of the season as he copes with his grief. He is forced to attend anger management class after an incident involved his brothers and father and his daughter calling the cops. As the story plays through multiple times, Ray has problems in the present even if he isn't totally there to deal with them. HIs family is still up to no good and finding themselves in over their head with a ton of intense trouble. Abby was a sobering force for the Donovan family so leaving them behind with a bar leads naturally to chaos.Ray's daughter Bridget Donovan (Kerris Dorsey) seeks out a young man Smitty (Graham Rogers) who was denied treatment because Ray arranged it that Abby would receive the treatment. Something went wrong with Abby receiving the treatment but Smitty was pushed out so he is steadily dying. Terry Donovan (Eddie Marsan) has had his Parkinson assisted by a device that stops his shaking as he struggles with his own guilt over Abby's death. Bunchy Donovan (Dash Mihok) tries to make an investment with his settlement cash but ends up being robbed at a subway shop. Mickey Donovan (Jon Voight) is being harassed by FBI agent Frank Barnes (Michael McGrady) to kill Avi (Steven Bauer) who is smuggling drugs. He also helps Daryll (Pooch Hall) when one of his clients Jay White (Brian White) accidentally kills his sensai.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com",

So yeah, pretty bad. For the first 2-3 seasons, the kids are well \"kids\" so they were portrayed the same \"Hollywood\" way as they are kids, so they should be rebels and won't listen to reason.Jon Voight's character was too caricature-ish at most places. Though he worked his talents well, didn't expect much from him. Eddie Marsan was great as he is an accomplished actor, we can say that.Paula Malcomson was good too. She is beautiful and also a good actress. Her accent went too far but she already performs 3-4 accents so it's alright.Other characters came and go and were mostly forgettable. What really stays with the viewers is the costume. Ray's suits were immaculate and the wealth and personality was shown through his clothes and accessories. Any kid under 17-18 would learn a lot about style from this show.Ray Donovan is a complex show with a complex protagonist but give it a watch. Some characters may annoy you but keep going for Ray. 7 seasons and 80+ episodes, it's alright.To Season 1, I give Ray donovan 8.6\nS02 8.6\nS03 8.6\nS04 8.7\nS05 7.3\nS06 8.7\nS07 7.9",

A family of inbred caricatures with the wife that undermines, kids that rebel, damaged brothers and neglectful father. Ray seems to spend most of his time herding his family like cats from one catastrophe to another. His job seems to be an extension of this with him problem solving for celebrities who mostly should be strapped to a chair and wearing nappies for their own safety. Associates and enemies of low IQ plotting or collaborating yet exhibit behaviour more reminiscent of kindergarten than the street. Essentially the series is let down by attempts at bringing some dark humour to characters and situations that turns out to be clumsy and in some instances ridiculous. E.g. a loner FBI agent in his secret basement tells a convicted murderer informant that his investigation is totally secret and gets shot in the head for his troubles... really!? The result is a potentially slick drama let down by lack of creativity and innovation in the writing.",

After watching all season, so far after so many episodes in to this show now, I just can't seem to get into it.Ray Donovan has the perfect cast. The lead is great, the supporting cast is great, the whole vibe of the show is dead on to be a killer crime syndicate show. I have no problem with the actors. The problem is the overall storyline and pacing. The whole premise of the show is just boring.Ray Donovan, unlike other crime dramas characters is a \"fixer\". This show is missing that intense element other shows like Dexter have where we can anticipate catching a high-value target or killing someone. Ray just kind of \"bullies\" people with their problems. The show gets very boring this way. Nothing exciting really happens. His daughter gets in trouble constantly and the dad just kind of screws around with everyone. The show drags on more and more, and nothing intense really happens.Overall, this show is just boring. I wouldn't say bad, and I think it can get better. But right now, it's just missing something that other classic crime dramas has.",

However they are just as unsavory in their dirty dealings.Therefor they need a clean up guy like Ray to get rid of the dirty laundry. Strike that, it's downright filthy laundry.As Ray goes about cleaning up, he collects a lot of cash and insurance just in case someone gets the idea of eliminating Ray or his beloved family.It's really a great cat and mouse romp with twists and turns you think can't possibly be wrapped up in one season but wrap up they do.Each season tells a fresh sordid tale and I like that there are no cliff hangers from season to season. Although the story lines and players may change, the Donovan's are a constant reminder the more things change, the more they remain the same.I enjoy this series very much.

That's why it is so hard to avoid comparing Ray Donovan with the Sopranos.Still, there are some similarities - A troubled relationship with one's parents, a dysfunctional family, jealous wife, FBI on your back... The list is endless. But I'd say that it's unfair to dismiss Ray Donovan as another Sopranos clone because most mob movies/TV shows follow the same premise. Instead, I'll focus on the good stuff, and there is plenty of it.First of all, Liev Schreiber is amazing, a rare talent and I dare to say one of the best looking men in Hollywood. Seriously, someone should send George Clooney a farewell. Having spent some time in Massachusetts, I can say that his Boston accent is spot on! There is of course Jon Voight, the legend he is, playing Ray's father Mickey.The story is not the most original, but don't forget people like Ray (\"fixers\") have existed in the world of rich and famous for eternity, and the show offers us a rare insight in their world. I also love the subplot involving sex abuse scandals in Catholic church, a problem that only a few shows have touched so far.Why 9 out of 10 then? Well, the chemistry between Ray and Mickey is simply amazing, but it could get more screen time.With Masters Of Sex and Ray Donovan, Showtime has another winner.",

Ray is maybe two of these or all of these. The new type of writing always shows the personal side of these people--oh, he has a family and he is a loving husband /father. This was true as well in the vastly popular 'Sopranos'. They're not truly bad, just motivated by love of family. They don't really break the law--they just follow the trends like the Stock Market, twisting it a bit. His brother hates and would kill all homosexuals but he's really just a good kid who was molested (BTW, I was 15 too once and I never met a healthy male teen who could be made to do anything they didn't want to--just ask their parents and peers.). His wife isn't a former hooker or dominatrix, she's just a girl who didn't have the opportunity to get much education. His daughter isn't a borderline on the rise--she's just being a teen. His father isn't a bad ex-con, he just got some bum deals in life and wanted to avenge his son's bad priest homo abusers. Let's all rally round the 'deez, dem, doze' boys and show them how much we appreciate all they've done to bring culture into our world. The one saving grace of the this show is that it probably comes closest to revealing the real Hollywood as it is and was. People with money and power are always corrupt. Macbeth will always do the wrong thing but that's why we like him and identify with him isn't it? I used to watch film and tv to escape the horrors of life; now it just pulls me down even further into it. I used to read about man's atrocities to man.

Anti hero Ray goes through life like so many of us, thinking he does what he does for his family.

Also, since I am not a fan of flipping back and forth in time, it became somewhat confusing on many occasions. It did not help that the main characters mumbled half their lines. Have never had to turn the volume up so high, or rerun scenes to get the dialogue and...I still missed some. Mind you, 90% of their dialogue was 'f...', very easy to learn their lines I guess \ud83d\udc4e\ud83c\udffbJon Voight's character had, without a doubt, the absolute best writing for his character AND played his role to 't'. Not sure if he ever was nominated for his role, but he sure as hell should have been.Season 6 was an utter waste of time. Became like an action movie for kids. Really....Ray leaps out of a window which appeared to be 2 or 3 storeys high, then gets up and climbs a huge wall...come on. Totally ridiculous.I will not be watching Season 7...I give up!",

It is a fantastic show, especially for those non-spoken, highly emotional things, but you simply have to have the brains to get that.Secondly, the characters are not unreal, oh no. Maybe not everyone can live in a villa in Hollywood, true, but as for the rest? Like it or not but 90% of families are that f+++d up actually in one way or another, only picket fences on the outside and I love the fact how they transport this in that show totally in your face. I actually think people get quite uncomfortable witnessing this, and in one form or another, even if in a way more harmless form, they know it from their own family life experiences how messed up families can be. I personally think it's brilliant how this show transports the conflicts and relationships between the family members, how important father-children relationships are, not only when you are a child but also, or even more, when you are an adult. Observed in a perfect way from a psychological point of view. Third, it also shows very realistically (and again very uncomfortably) how dramatic the lifelong consequences can be for victims of sexual child abuse. And how different (depending on the resilience one individually has or doesn't have) victims are able to cope with it and in what ways.And last, I have to grin a bit, about some comments here from guys stating how a guy almost 50 can wear tight pants like Ray Donovan. Jealous much? - you'd have all reason to be, so you are forgiven ;)",

The only flaw I see is Ray's wife, I am not sure if I like her character and I would of rather they selected someone else for the role. Not that I don't like red heads, I just don't think she is as hot as she should be. I would of figured Ray to be with a woman that's a 9-10 compared to one that is still hot at a 7-8. Other than that I am hooked and can't wait to watch the next episode. I am sure the Catholic religion would wish it goes away real soon. I hope it stays around for many seasons to come.",

The context of the show is like we've seen so many times in recent television, however this is much better.After the first couple episodes, I guarantee you will be hooked. This show is clever and full of action. Liev Schreiber is an excellent actor and portrays the role convincingly. He does not over-act, in the contrary, he is quiet and introverted, which emphasises the mysterious nature of this complex and charismatic character.This is the best action/mystery show to come out of America in a long time.

Sully was in the process of stealing Ray's money (hit money he was going to pay Sully with) even though he hadn't earned it (hadn't killed Ray's father Mickey). At gunpoint he was jumping a boat to leave the country. It's possible he was going to kill Ray, Mickey, and maybe even his partner Tiny before that boat shoved off. So Mickey shooting him was self-defense. Self-preservation. So why are they all so afraid to let the truth come out? Didn't the FBI agent who was there (and who got shot by Ray) tell the FBI that it was self defense? I don't get it. Sully was a murderer.I have to say this is the only problem I have with the show.

Terry, Avi, Lena, and Daryll have nothing to do. Mickey has become a dottering old fool, not the street-smart con we've come to know and love. Ray seems to have lost his balls. Singing Karaoke to get information instead of beating it out of the guy? This season Ray's constantly running from one place to another like a soccer mom with four kids on four different teams. How many trips has he made to Nevada this season? This is not the Ray Donovan from the first Three Seasons. Montages are used to fill time because the writers have hit a dead end with the plot. They're also pulling characters out of their butts to come up with something to try and make this season make some sense. All of a sudden we learn Ezra had another fixer? Abby gets diagnosed with Stage 0 breast cancer and ends up making out with her oncologist, Lena's conveniently cast former girl friend, in a strip bar? Conor overnight becomes an incorrigible gangster wanna be? It goes on and on. Character development and background has become non-existent whereas we really got to know everyone during the first three seasons.After Episode 2 this season I had hope things were getting better.

All I can say is Season 5 is a hodge-podge of flashbacks to the degree there's very little of what made Ray Donovan so good in earlier seasons. Scenes flip back and forth in time, often with little clue that's what's happening. Half the time, you can't even tell what city the story has moved to, or why. Buried under layers of family squabbles, there's a plot afoot concerning a movie studio or production house, but it seems like an afterthought. Any hope of \"picking up\" the story even though you missed earlier episode is pointless. Inserting temporal flashbacks into a story takes a certain level of skill so they actually move the narrative along without being confusing. Ray Donovan Season 5 fails to deliver.",

The challenging situations Ray's clients are faced with and the multitude of manipulation tactics employed against the Shows Marks ring True for \"Magical Spell-Casting Land.\" All Credit can be given to the writers for dialogue and scene structure, but I have No Doubts that many of these stories stem from actual experiences and stories they've heard while schmoozing around L. A. :)First...\nAn observation I've made about some of the older and more recent series I've been binge watching lately. Many of the Lead Characters Daughter's have similar traits.Abby n Ray's daughter, Bridget is a Disrespectful, Entitled, Wannabe Grown Ass, Annoying, and Unattractive to put it kindly tbh. She's constantly mouthing off to her parents from the very beginning of the series. The fact that both parents allow it believing that it's the cool thing to do, refusing to keep a child in a child's place by creating and enforcing any boundaries of respect or discipline is a symptom of the illness that plagues so many families today.I would never in a million years, even \"think\" about disrespecting my parents by saying or acting the way she, and many other TV series daughters do! Nor would my Wife and I allow \"Our Grown Adult Children\" to disrespect in any way. Fortunately we've raised them with enough respect to know better.Second...\nThe storyline that a Hot Young Rapper that can have any Fine Ass Female out there but chooses to pursue Bridget's Ugly Ass because she's \"Real,\" is Totally Ridiculous, as well as Insulting to our intelligence and sense of taste!!!As I've started to notice in many of the recent series that have young daughters depicted.. They're all following the same script type for the Daughters; Mouthy, pretentious, disrespectful, little \"biatches..\" Really!?Is this what society wants to impress on their kids these days? Please don't allow your kids to follow this template.There's a time and a place for kids to act grown, and that's when they leave your house! Not when they're preteens or teens, living under your roof! And... Never.. Yes, Never.. should they feel free to speak to You, their Parents, any old way they feel like it and/or Pass Judgement on your Life. As long as you are a Good Parents and are providing for them the best way you can. Anyway...

We made it through the first six episodes of Season One. We looked at each other and said, \"No.\". Why? Not really sure. We think that it may be we are tired of dysfunctional family-series. And Ray Donovan is certainly that! No problem with the acting. Writing is mostly okay. But we have watched soooo many similar shows. We enjoyed all 7 seasons of Sons of Anarchy. Really good. Sopranos? Of course. Yellowstone is quite good, too. And today you can't do feel-good 1950's Ozzie-and-Harriet type shows. They just wouldn't sell. But after a while the dysfunctional family stuff gets wearing and boring. If it doesn't, you might enjoy Ray Donovan. For us, enough!",

It's still a great series, but it seems to have taken a turn and in my eyes, not for the better.Seems the good have turned bad, the bad turned good on and on. The flashbacks are a waaay too much.What I really can't comprehend is everyone's attitude. The \"F word\" is running amok, matters not if it's the mother, daughter, son, brother, etc. It's just everywhere. Don't get me wrong, it's a word, but even in real life, that word is not used that much, most especially in a family environment. And the kids attitude toward their parents (Abby & Ray) is really beyond comprehension. Can't help but wonder if the writers talk that way at home or to their mothers.And lastly: just how many drinks can these guys handle in one day and still keep standing? I don't think there's ever a scene that goes by that someone doesn't have a drink in their hand (or in lots of cases, a freaking bottle). Geez, 10, 12, 14 drinks a day and they're still standing and driving and screwing? I realize they're working on the stereotype Irish clan that constantly has a glass in their hand, but really? That's not the case at all. It just gets boring watching everyone swear, drink still be able to think somewhat rationally. I think the writers should review themselves and put the grit back into the show rather than the swearing and drinking on a constant basis.Lost my interest for sure.Just my opinion.",

The acting in the last episode, especially the scenes with Jon Voight and Liev Schreiber, was as good as it gets and Schreiber must be one of the most underrated about after seeing what he can do in it. Special shout has to go to Eddie Marson as well who put out the best performance I've ever seen of a Brit playing an American on TV or film, and proved himself to not just be underrated but to be a genuinely great actor.

            "content": "The TV series \"Ray Donovan\" - a look at the life of modern elites of Los Angeles. Ray Donovan is the best part of the resolve complex, controversial, often sensitive problems of the rich and famous residents of this city. He can really do for them in almost any dirty work, to help resolve a variety of issues, but to deal with the problems his own family turns out for the hero much harder.\nFrom the first series, I was attracted by the main character Ray Donovan strong brutal man whose job is to eliminate by any means the problems of the rich people, stars of show business and financial tycoons. Ray slightly burdened with principles of a moral nature, but in his own way loves and protects their loved ones wife, children, relatives.\nLiev Schreiber definitely played one of the best roles in his career. I'm always impressed by Schreiber, however, so convincingly and naturally it draws its purely visual. So here it ray willingly intriguing and impressive even with a relatively small inventory of words and their hidden essence, which is the main mystery of the series and perhaps not the less dominant lure for the viewer. For his role Liev Schreiber was nominated Best Performance by an Actor In A Television Series - Drama 6 times.\nFor me, \"Ray Donovan\" is one of the best series. Some of the series even want to revise a couple more times, but it's worth a lot. If you, like me, put off viewing this series on then immediately change their opinion and see ray right now! You will not regret it.",

            "content": "Season 1: 7.5/10 The first season of Ray Donovan is supposed to be a crime drama, but couldn't help becoming a melancholic Shakespearean tragedy. Casting-wise, this show excels, despite being too overcrowded with characters and subplots of subplots. Each scene is pretty explosive and entertaining on its own, but is everyone necessary and vital for the progress of the plot? Most of the time the answer is a massive \"No\". But do I regret watching Jon Voight enjoying the living crap out of himself in a gay club? Most of the time the answer is a massive \"Yes\". So in general the season is both guilty and not guilty for its shenanigans,just like its characters.The motif of sinning and forgiving is fundamental to the series, with the little brother Bunchy Donovan (masterfully played by Dash Mihok) lying at the core of the conflict. As I already said, individually every character shines in their individual scenes, but few of them contribute to the story. Well, except a \"son\" character with questionable sexual orientation, he might as well not exist. The Donovans is spectacular, Ray's co-workers are campy badasses and Jon Voight basically chews your TV screen. The family is alright enough, it does the job to judge the main character for his every step. The second act really picks up when a guest, legendary old school actor joins the cast, unfortunately the ending fizzles out too quickly . What I hope happens with this show is that it stops taking itself so overly serious and starts contributing more screen time for its hilarious black humor. Some episodes you feel the struggle in the journey of self-discovery and I have faith that in Season 2, the series will find its groove.Conclusion: The first season of Ray Donovan is a fun, over-the-top melanchonic journey of self-discovery for both the show and its characters, with tones shifting left and right. Worth watching for the outstanding performances and a terrific cast. And possibly Jon Voight alone.7.9/10 During Ray Donovan's sophomore season, the show gets to play Capitan. After a couple episodes I felt like I finally was understanding the tone and the abundant amount of charm that the series was going for. It is still far away from being perfect, but I have begun to love it for the gritty and stylish atmosphere, well supported by its magnificent cast. I rarely feel this way about similar shows, but every character is truly fascinating. Even the obnoxious kids and the moody wife are more than my descriptions of them suggest. The man himself, Liev Schreiber absolutely kills it as Ray Donovan. You can feel the miniature domino that gets pushed at him every single episode, triggering a chain of events leading to his soul-wrecking change in the finale. Every single one of his brothers has an arc, that doesn't waste the acting abilities of the actors. The supporting cast is quirky and rich in character. And the never-ending highlight of the show is still Jon Voight's Mickey Donovan. During his scenes you start to perceive the tragic events in a more lighthearted matter. He is still an abnormally big jerk, but he brings much needed levity to everything happening and you clearly see that he'll get completely mad if he takes all the trainwrecks happening around him seriously. I particularly liked the great use of a returning character that didn't bring much to the table the first time around. The major negative aspect of the show is how conveniently the story plays out. Some things just happen for the sake of happening, so the plot could progress. You could say that's part of the show's charm, but it might bother some people. The most unexpected thing this season was the possession of Abby. It was like the demon inside Skyler from Breaking Bad was bored from its vessel and decided to enter someone else. Why the producers decided to make Abby completely insufferable is beyond my knowledge.Conclusion: You may have noticed how I used the word \"play\" in the beginning, as the show still has a road to go to deserve its place behind the steering wheel. Yet there is so much charm to help you overlook the flaws. I place my confidence in the third season to be even better and to elevate the show to a \"Capitan\".",

I mean surely, this time he was way over his head. The Russian Mafia wasn't going to let things slide and Barnes wasn't the pussy he once was. In the middle of Rattus Rattus, my stomach made odd grumbling noises. I was out of snacks. Surely, the nailbiting finish wouldn't occur without some chips and chai. Having waited till 5:30 am, I cycled to the nearest store. Boy, it was worth every single crumb.Ray Donovan is terrific. The characters are real. They are brutal and oh so human. Ray is no angel and neither is his family. A bunch of crooks, getting saved at the nick of time by some excellent editing. Spotlight brought Liev out in the open to larger audiences. The summary on Netflix wasn't so compelling, but Liev made me want to give it a shot. Four seasons later, I can't wait for more.Jon Voight is a gem. What a stellar performance. Having done 20 years for a crime he did not commit, he surely isn't going to live a saintly life now. His role as Mickey is nothing short of iconic. The black humour he generates with his subtle expressions and dialogue delivery is worthy of the highest appreciation. Mickey's character is loathsome, but it's surely Voight's expertise that I hoped throughout that nothing bad should happen to him.Bunchy and Terry are complex characters played with some supreme finesse.What a friggin' show.

Bordering on the unwatchable. It seems like a few episodes were skipped and so now we have the dubious pleasure of revisiting those skipped episodes via endless flashbacks. Now speaking for myself I think unless you are making \"Memento\" shows should legally be barred from using more than 2 flashbacks per episode period. This season thus far is about 15% \"new\" stuff and 85% annoying flashbacks. Some of which repeat. NOTHING actually seems to be happening this season. Instead of maybe devoting two or three proper episodes to what the writers are trying to tell us via the endless flashbacks it seems like the writers are treading water until they can think of an actual compelling plot line for this new season. My girlfriend is very close to the point of giving up on the series entirely and I am not far behind. This show has gone from quite possibly the best show out there to barely watchable. If the writers and producers did not have any material for this season then maybe they should have just skipped this season altogether. Or like I said earlier: just wrapped up the Abby and kids BS with a few episodes and then skip the rest until inspiration struck again. My vote, by the way, is for how season 5 is developing thus far. Otherwise I'd have given this a 10 based on the previous seasons.",

I liked Ann Biderman's Southland a lot and looked forward to this, but am disappointed to say the least. There is never a point where anything that would intrigue or challenge the audience is brought to bear. If you like to watch the Freeway, PCH, rich and powerful, petty, anxious people, like mindless sex and violence you'll like this show.

He's mysterious because he doesn't say much, and when he does say something, it's calculated and to the point. Ray struggles with moral issues and hard decisions by pinching his eyebrows and cheeks but he otherwise comes across as a somewhat empty contracted thug to the rich, not letting anyone in, the audience included. His choices dictate his character and he leaves behind his humanity to get the job done.If you can put up with morally ambiguous characters that you find yourself not caring too much about then this is excellent TV.",

He is a real \"old time\" stereotype which is GREAT - finally a hero which resembles people we knew and are now old. a REAL man. He is no saint but he does what he does out of total loyalty and complete family devotion (and screwing a bit around doesn't count - just like real man of old) he is the guy we are all missing today with all the metro-sexual crap. People are complaining about Abby's character - but she is perfect - she was a rough neighborhood unspoiled girl who married a man she crazy about but struggles with his shortcomings. She is clearly not the mommy type but she is doing everything to overcome who she was and be a loving mother. Not perfect and that's what makes it so good. She is trying to care and spoil the children but also wants her own peace and quiet. The plot is clear and the characters are down to earth with a twist. Nothing makes me happier in an era where flimsy screen writers are giving us promises and not delivering. The cast is great from the tortured soul of Ray which seems to have been tailored for Liev Schreiber which is doing a wonderful job. He wears Ray Donovan like a glove. He brothers are the good Irish boys who enjoy fighting and drinking and love their big brother. Eddie Marsan is doing a wonderful work as the conscience of the family whose loyalty keeps him quiet. And both bothers take care of the \"little boy\" - a challenging character which has still more to develop done by Dash Mihok in a good way. I believe with the right script for him he will be much better. And finally the wonderful Jon Voight whose acting is free and adds a contrast to Ray's dark and serious nature (well after all Micky is the reason Ray is like that..). And the brushing of the screen with great actors like Elliott Gould, James Woods and Rosanna Arquette (a nice comeback!) only makes it better. And finally, Ray's sidekicks are a nice mix of the funny ex-Mossad Avi (Steven Bauer in a great comeback as well! - i hope they don't kill him because Ray's character really needs Avi to pull all he does) and Lesbian Lena which deserves a story of her own... And for all Trekkies.. Denise Crosby closes the comeback line :-)Thanks for a GREAT Show!! Give us more of the SAME!! Don't change Ray - don't make him mushy-soft now that we know what happened to him - we don't need him sitting on a couch. He is a man - and men deal with it!!",

I really want to like this show, but most of the time I don't.I have watched the first two seasons, and it is very clear that Ray Donovan doesn't actually fix anything, no matter how hard he tries. Here are a few examples...1. He hired a bunch of people to kill his dad, and none of those \"professionals/thugs\" could do it. He then sent his dad to Mexico, but then his dad returns. Ray bribes the Parole Officer to trip up his dad and send him back to prison, instead the Parole Officer teams up with the dad. Nothing fixed! 2. Ashley is having a problem with a stalker and asks Ray for help. Up until the end of Season 2, Ashley is still having a problem with the same stalker. What has he fixed?3. Ray tries to get his daughter into an elite school and strong-arms a member of the intake committee. For some reason the daughter still didn't get into the school.4. Ray strong arms his wife's lover (the policeman) to keep away from his wife. Well they are still at it...5. Can't even strong-arm a female reporterAnd there are more examples of \"how not to be an enforcer\". But for those few occasions where problems are eventually fixed, I am left a little bit disappointed. The way Ray solves a conflict is to just give the aggressor what he wants. The following is a typical exchange between Ray and the person he is strong-arming... \"I want that video tape\",- Ray\"OK, it'll cost you $1m\",- Thug\"OK,done\". - RayWhat is that fixing?? Any moron could do the same thing- Just give them what they ask for.I feel let down because Liev Schreiber on screen stature is diminished by his pussyfooting methods.Of course I am not looking for a constant blood bath when issues need to be resolved, but I just feel the sometimes feeble approaches used make Ray Donovan look incompetent.",

            "content": "Ray Donovan is a 'noir-soap' about a violent Hollywood fixer whose constant, melodramatic family issues outweigh the dirty jobs he has to do, like the 'Black Cube' organisation.Jon Voight has a whale of a time as Ray's father, a tricky trouble-maker, in a blatant tribute to The Soprano's unlovable 'Uncle Pauly'. Paula Malcolmson as Ray's wife Abby, is nothing more than a Boston Irish Carmela Soprano, while Liev Schreiber as Ray is a kind of ripped Tony Soprano with a Lord Alan (UK Apprentice) Sugar stubble-beard. Steven Bauer, Breaking Bad's Don Eladio, is great, among many brilliant supporting cast turns. Shame the lead characters are also two-dimensional - not the actors' fault btw.There's a lot of Sopranos-style black humour of characters turning perfectly ordinary social events into disasters. Women get short shrift; prostitutes or sex objects, black people seem all to be dangerous in some way, and Ray's clientele, the power brokers of Hollywood, are all out-neuroticizing Woody Allen.Many venerable actors, apart from Voight, are wheeled out to top up the ham quota. Not so much stunt casting as 'stent' casting. Elliot Gould, I'm afraid, is worse than he was as Ross's father in 'Friends'; he can't act and speak at the same time.It says it all, really, that the therapist (yes, there's a therapist) is played by Mr Data from Star Trek. Well played, but still. Spot the android.Ironically, considering that its model The Sopranos was left open-ended, Ray Donovan was unceremoniously cancelled without warning after seven seasons. Watchable, but annoyingly derivative in places.",

But the thing is, it really is full of clich\u00e9s and over-the-top-nonsense-drama.One of the biggest problems is the messy story - it just goes in every direction and while it's not even too hard to follow, just doesn't make ANY sense. It's (randomly) entertaining, but sadly made of clich\u00e9s following clich\u00e9s. The next bad thing about the show is the fact that Paula Malcomson can't decide which accent to use. It really drives me crazy when she first speaks using the American-like accent and then she slips out to use her original accent - and sometimes they happen to mix between sentences! This happens way too often (in every episode) and makes her performance look amateurish. I think she was much better on Sons Of Anarchy. Not all characters are completely terrible, I like Terry and a few others like Avi. I hate the fact that this makes really good actors look really bad. This will be the last season I'll watch as obviously it's not going to get any better. It had the chance to be really good, but in reality it's nowhere near worth the hype.",

I don't mind a bit of the old ultra-violence every now and then as long as it's in context, but I'm not into a steady diet of sadistic violence and this show has that aplenty. It just strains credulity to believe that the members of one family can perpetrate so much mayhem and never get caught or held accountable. It also strains credulity that these miscreants can smoke, drink, do drugs, all to major excess, yet still be able to perform feats of superhuman strength and endurance without any kind of indication of what they do to stay in shape. By the time the last episode of Season 1 rolled around, I knew I had made the right decision to ditch the show. The scene on the docks where Micky turns his gun on Sully was telegraphed from a mile away. Just another example of the kind of cheap, clich\u00e9d writing that otherwise marred a promising initial run of episodes. Too bad, considering the talent involved, especially Elliot Gould who should consider his involvement in this exercise in pandering to an audience's basest instincts as a major \"shonda.\"",

I liked at this show in first three seasons that it shows an interesting family and good mafia action in Hollywood atmosphere.

Now it's just him and some problems he has to fix but there is no more drama like it was with his Daughter and Cookie or with his wife and all his affairs. For example the relation between him and the journalist women or Tom Cruise Ex (forgot her name) was so intelligently written and the scenes were always on point.

It is one of those good productions: the first time you take in the action, the second time you concentrate on how it is done. Let's be clear: everything about this series and every episode of it is predictable. There is nothing here which hasn't been done before, one way or another. But predictable doesn't have to mean bad. Shakespeare is predictable, cartoons are (were) predictable and video games are predictable. Done well, they can all be excellent. That's what makes this series good: good acting and genuine depth in how the stories are told.The series is constructed around two pillars with Ray Donovan (Live Schreiber) at their centre: who he is and what he does.First, what he does: Ray heads a small team of cleaners, in Los Angeles, a city with a lot of trash. He and his team are action arm of a small law firm (headed by the always excellent Elliott Gould) focused on a recession proof business model. They clean and fix the lives of the rich and famous. The rich and famous can be relied upon to destroy whatever they touch; they can also be relied upon to gratefully hand over a lot of cash, without questions or arguments, in exchange for Ray's services and his miraculous capacity to piece together their crashed lives. This in itself makes the series highly enjoyable. Seeing how silly, stupid, shallow, mean and disaster-prone the 0.1% is plays to our Schadenfreude and makes us satisfied with our more modest lives.Second, who he is: this is even more predictable. He is the alpha-male of four brothers, from a Boston-Irish family which has relocated to California to get away from the father. The series starts with the early release from prison of Mickey Donovan (Jon Voight), their father. Mickey is can't wait a minute to join his sons in California and take up where he left it: wreck their lives. He is charming, fun and indulgent, and at his most indulgent with himself. He worms his way into Ray's home, wife and his two teenagers. Of the four brothers Ray is the only one who has managed to create a normal family. We understand quickly where the feeling of doom in Ray, as he witnesses his father's return, comes from. He has been the father to his brothers, and a sister whom we only know as a distant and painful memory, while Mickey has always avoided any feeling of responsibility. There are all the usual ingredients: alcoholism, pedophile priest, vengeful and demanding wife, teenagers adoring the simple lessons of their grandfather: responsibility bad, indulgence good.What makes the series work well is how the two schematic parts connect, with Ray at their centre. Seeing everything he has built for his wife, children and brothers, predictably and inexorably destroyed by his no-good father, he somehow does his job and even manages to channel his private rage into his work.",

Just a mess.. a whole messI had high hopes for this one, but by season 4 episode 8 I gave up..I give 5 for the acting, because the actors did a good job, but what can the actors do with little to no plot and no decent lines...The 1st season was very good and worth watching tho",

His father and brothers constantly make things worse for him though the show.The most annoying things about the show are his daughter (probably the worst character), Ray's wife, and Brandon. Other than characters, there's a consistent unrealistic back and forth with getting locked up such as getting in jail and then getting out.Highlights of the show are his father, some great t&a, and violence.",

It is a fairly unique story-line, but beyond that the writing starts to fall apart. The secondary characters are thin and mostly contrived.What bothers me the most is this formulaic approach \"Cable\" networks have to \"Mature\" dramas. First the more sex, references and portrayals and acts of sex the better. Sprinkle in some very street-level language and Wham you got a hit! I prefer to have my intelligence & imagination stimulated, not just my libido. This show could have been amazing, and I am going to give it a few more episodes to see if the writing and character development show potential growth. Right now its stuck as interesting BUT.....",

Such as Jon Voight, Steven Bauer, Eddie Marsan, and several others.I'm completely engrossed each episode and I can't wait to start the next one. The storylines flow so well and leave me wanting more! Kudos to the writers! Whoever is in charge of the music, great job, because I love it, especially the classic rock!I love that on one hand this is a crime-drama, and on the other hand, it's also about a family and their lives. The woman who plays Abby-Ray's wife, I have to say I don't care for her. They turned her into a nagging, self-centered, nosey, neglectful, and whiney mother and wife. Any scene with her is difficult because of her horrible attitude. I can't believe how neglectful and uncaring she is to her kids. She's so wrapped up in her own wants/needs, she's an awful mother and wife.And, what spouse would get so involved or questionable with what their spouse does at work or for a living daily?!? They're working 20 hours/day and bringing home a huge paycheck so you don't have to work. And provide an expensive life for you, why nag so much?? The way Abby questions Ray about what he does constantly is ridiculous then throws a hissy fit when she doesn't get her way. It all drives me nuts, I just can't stand Abby's character.Other than her, I'm enjoying the rest of the characters and storylines. It's the best TV series I've watched in a long time, and I'm looking forward to the other seasons.",

Except no one will probably watch it. The stories seems to be going around in circles. Hey there is a difference, Tony always had a sandwich, Donovan a tumbler. In fact Donovan never eats but manages to maintain his frame, drinks like a fish. The whole series is an advert for hard liquor. He is married to a teenager, who has a crush with a policeman who is another teenager and has a crush with a mil_. they all seem sad and pitiful. You know after awhile it's like who cares, there is no saving grace, they all deserve one another. I think Ezra is a lawyer, but he never does any lawyer stuff. The show is full of losers, the only persons of any character and redeeming qualities is Lena and Evi. For the longest time i kept staring into the TV and said that cannot be the deck of the enterprise. so i looked it up on IMDb and yes no.1 it was-20 years ago, i couldn't believe it. Don't know where the writers are going to take us in season 3. Have to see if i care first. But it better not be the days of our lives because it sure ain't that. Put Donovan, dexter, hell on wheels and justified into a blender and add a sprinkle of haemoglobin and a touch of bad a__ women you get Banshee.

Americans will never learn that Irish people NEVER, EVER, EVER use this corny phrase. Considering the character is Irish-American, and not supposed to be from Ireland, (like the IRA members in Sons of Anarchy, with the truly shocking Irish accents that make Irish people cringe) it's not too insulting, just annoying. With all those negatives said, the show has potential as a storyline, but the writing needs to tighten up considerably. The storyline needs to slow down, and dialogue needs to be deeper and more interesting to develop characters and interaction in the show. Second episode was an improvement on the first also.",

Great true story.As for Ray Donovan, the story line this season is really strong. We've grown to love the Donovan's and it the story played out really strongly this season. And being from the northern east coast and familiar with that way of life, it makes the story all that more compelling and believable. It's great to see them play out that area so well. Eddie Marsan (Terry) delivered a great line to Paula Malcomson (Abby) after she tells off this old lady while shopping. It went something like this : \"It's good to have a Southie b**ch on your side.\" Awesome !I just saw the season 3 finale and this had to be one of the best season finale I can remember.

I was also impressed by the cast, I've always liked Liev Schreiber work. Sadly Liev Schreiber isn't enough to save this show though. I don't know where the blame lies, is it the actors or the characters? After getting into the first few episodes it amazed me just how bad Paula Malcomson and Jon Voight actually are in this show. Am i missing something? Does Paula Malcomson's character have bipolar in the show? Is she happy? is she sad? is she angry? you just can't seem to tell. Simply put her actions are terribly erratic in the show and just don't seem to make sense at times that coupled with her poor portrayal of emotion and facial expressions just make for a slightly uneasy and annoying performance. That being said John Voight should never EVER be allowed to act, who ever put him in this acting role and set this role up for him should be fired and sent away and banished from the acting world never to be seen again. A 60+ year old plastic gangster who is out of touch in seemingly ever way possible doesn't make for easy viewing. Again i don't know if it's poor acting or poor characters but Paula Malcomson and Jon Voight's roles do seem to make the show un-watchable at times, for me anyway they're that annoying. On the plus i really do enjoy Liev Schreiber in this and particularly like Steven Bauer and Katherine Moennig in the show. For me they don't seem to make up for how poor Paula Malcomson and Jon Voight are in it, mainly based on the fact how big the parts they have are. In the end i'm really glad i didn't have to buy this and it's only my time that I've lost and i wouldn't even attempt Season 2. P.s i forgot to mention, if you're feeling down or a little low/upset just go and listen to Paula Malcomson's accent it should definitely bring a laugh or a sarcastic smile and shake of the head to you.",

The writing is flawless and believable. The actors bring life to their characters so seamlessly. Liev Schreiber and Jon Voight are amazing in their portrayals of \"Flawed Hollywood fixer\" and \"felon, flawed father\" that one wonders where one begins and the other ends.Excellent writing, casting and crew make for excellent, believable TV. Bravo Showtime....bravo!!",

I am not watching a thriller to learn that.there are better ways. But season 5 was an insult to viewers. All those melodramic flash backs. It is takibg 2 seasons to kill Aby..... So many \"what?\"s and \"sure\"s by characters with no story line. I couldn't take it more and gave up. Not going to watch season 6.",

Jon voight is electric like you've never seen him before, he's a bastard but very lovable as a vital character in the brilliant debut series.

But something is always happening, it's certainly never dull, so there is always a good chance I'll get my wish. The first one I want to go is the daughter. Loathe her. And how on earth Ray Donovan can be portrayed as being irresistible to women is quite the mystery to me. He is wooden, morose, and just plain unattractive. Anyone else think he looks like a chipmunk? So I'm hoping he goes too, but of course I expect he'll be around for Season 4 and until the very end I guess; after all, it is all about him.

Every season, I was praying for Abby or Bridget to get killed, throw in a Bunchy, I wouldn't mind. Ray is a perfect fixer surrounded by family drama. Now the show wasn't called \" The Donovan's\" so why am I fast forwarding past the drama so much. I could even live with the Micky Donovan revolving door as long as every season ended with bad guys losing. I say I made it to S4E12 because that was my season finale. I liked Steven Bauer's \"Avi\" too much to watch the series without him. At least I can thank Mr Kelly for not letting the Russians kill him. I have a hunch they could have, maybe they were trying to warn him how easy it would be to kill him off and that would have been it. Search Steven Bauer and he is not without baggage and we don't know how much he brought to the set. I forgive him and blame Tony Montana. Something happened and I think it ruined the show and his career. RD was a great vehicle for Steven Bauer to steal the show every time he was there. I read an article that said Warren Beatty told Steven he could be the next Warren Beatty. He blew it. It's not all SB's fault. Tony Soprano became a show about a daughter and a complaining wife too.Like it or not, This is my honest review (opinion). Forgettaboutit.",

Everyone seemed to be playing cool, dark and detached. So I became detached from the story. The story was awful, clich\u00e9s non- stop. Each character damaged, relationships twisted. Where was it going? I don'w know, not do I care. I kept hoping that Dexter would suddenly emerge and kill off the cast. I give it one star, because Ray dyes the stalker green.

Basically everything is there for me to really like this show, yet there are a few things that are starting to annoy me 6 episodes in, hence my given rating. It has to do with the side stories and some of the characters within them. The older brother's love life, the kids and their growing pains, the spiteful wife and her distrust, they're taking me out of the flow of an otherwise exciting main story line. Especially the wife parts really bug me. And while I do realize this is a drama series and that these happenings influence the main protagonist in one way or another it comes across as fluff to me filling up the spacing in between, extra filling that is just not as interesting to me as the main story line and as I mentioned before, breaks the flow of a great show for me which in turn unfortunately affects my urge to continue watching it. We'll see.",

            "content": "Firstly, I'd like say that I absolutely loved Ray Donovan up until season 4 began and in particular season 1 and 2. The series used to have elements of humour in characters such as Stu Feldman etc. Ray had a certain sophistication and calmness to his methods. Now the series is hard to stay on course with and is often dark and depressing, and sure any story needs conflict but Ray is out of control. No longer the fixer that people relied upon, Ray is now the destroyer. As a result from killing off key characters the story is often bland and repetitive. It seems to have steered away from the original idea of a Hollywood fixer to a brutal thug drunk committing career suicide and this severe story arc is so far gone from the first 2 seasons and the Ray that we rooted for. I liked the characters of Lee Drexler and Ezra Goldman but they no longer exist along with many others. I don't know, I guess I miss the old Ray. I remain watching due to the immense acting and being a fan of the show I wait in hope for Ray to return to old ways which appears to be the common theme having read other reviews. As season 6 approaches, yet again as in seasons 4 & 5 the old Ray may just be further away than ever as he takes on New York.",

I can barely listen too it and I laugh ever time Steve Bauer talks. Sorry Steve but wow, it's not like Steven Bauer was a great actor to begin with and this cheesy accent isn't helping. The rest of the cast is great. Most people I know have become hooked on this show. By the way they all say the same thing about Steven Bauer's accent, horrible. If I could suggest something to the writers, now that you are popular and have a following. Why not add real actor stars as cast of the show?

Why is Katie Holmes's Paige Finney wearing braces? With her billionaire dad, shouldn't her teeth have been fixed by the time she reached 36? This detail doesn't make sense.",

A hokey concept, clich\u00e9d plot twists and formulaic writing hold it back from being a top notch series.The Good- The whole cast put in good to outstanding performances, with Live Schrieber, Jon Voight, Paula Malcomson giving the most notable performances. Supporting cast is strong.The Bad- East Coast Stereotypes(Blue Collar Boston Catholics) clash with California ones (Hollywood Players) in the land of Glitterrari. Plot is really weak-If this guy is such an effective cleaner for Hollywood Elite, why wouldn't he just have someone knock off his father in prison? Feels formulaic in the attempt to add layers to the characters and story. All three brothers move out to Hollywood, the 2nd runs a gym but has a nervous condition. Give me a break.Bottomline- The series still has potential to be a winner, especially with this cast. Second season is going to be vital for future success.",

            "content": "Maybe I have a different opinion of the show since I watched all four seasons one after another. What I can definitely say is that there's an obvious arc whereby the show goes from exciting, dangerous, and dark, to just plain stupid and beyond realistic.My review will begin on seasons 1-2. Ray is clearly an unhappy person, rarely smiles or shows any type of emotion whatsoever. His kids are typical teenagers with typical problems, some of which are amplified due to Ray's profession. His wife, Abby, sticks out like a sore thumb with her Boston upbringing. She can be extremely irritating. Their relationship leaves much to be desire and you wonder why she stays. The dysfunction is overwhelming. What is worth watching is how Ray performs his job with precision, like a robot. The people who need him are narcissists, rich, and with serious problems only Ray can make go away. Many of them are extremely obnoxious, including his boss, mentor, and friend, Ezra. There are plenty of times you think to yourself, \"yeah, right, like that'll ever happen\", but yet you still watch. The show itself is indulgent and entertaining, but you know it has a shelf life. Moving on to seasons three and four...words and phrases come to mind such as, ridiculous, you can't be serious, and oh come on! There's an old phrase, which I hate, but we all know the phrase people use when a show has outlasted it's welcome. This show absolutely turns to sh*t by season four. The story line and it's characters have all gone off the reservation. Do yourself a favor, save many useless hours of watching, and change the channel after season two. I gave a 6 rating for the overall series, but if I were able I would give the first two seasons a solid 8 and the last two would be a 5. I don't know if it's coming back for a fifth season, but I cannot imagine any further episodes could warrant watching.",

So many family conflicts and lower, than low, life styles. But Voight pulls these off with such integrity. Smooth as silk! And he definitely loves him some woman! Maybe \"trashy\" women by some standards. But I keep pulling for him. And how in the bageeza can he still look so good. He has reached a point where he has not aged in the last uuh, 20 or 30 years.

            "content": "I remember when this show first came out, it was dark and intriguing; I wanted more every episode; figuring out what would happen next and understanding the plot and elements to the story; figuring out the mystery of it all. The second season began in a similar fashion with fantasy-like tendencies (which is not ideal) but again, it worked.... For a bit.Suddenly, I felt like a brand new rookie producer and writing team replaced everyone important. Instantly, Ray devolves into an inhumane Neanderthal with very little emotional connection to anything and his family just completely turns on him while he does *literally* nothing about it, and his brothers go off into their own stories (which seems good, but isn't) that leads to zero substance and sad character arks.Final comments: I ABSOLUTELY HATE the Latina wrestler that becomes Bunchy's BDSM/wife/baby mama. I have NEVERRRRR witnessed something in cinema or television so forced, uncomfortable, and awfully unnecessary. I'm sure whoever had the idea for her character THOUGHT they knew things about sexual abuse to give Bunchy a leg-up for his character, but clearly is living in their own world.Also- Throughout the ENTIRE series; episode one to whatever; the \"actor\" who plays the son, Connor Donovan, is without a doubt the worst actor on the planet. When you see a show and notice in the pilot a major character is replaced for the second season and on; and you wonder why... Connor Donovan is the answer to that question/curiosity.Bonus: There is a moment in season 3, episode 6 where Ray and Mick come into the Fight Club and Terry is paranoid about a possible intruder. After the gun is out and away, the three characters (father and two sons) have a very quick moment of laughter and happiness, slight vulnerability and genuine character. It's quite beautiful; probably nothing you can think of now. But when you see it, you wished the entire series had this element of life to it.Perhaps a difficult ask for the show's premise, but not impossible.",
