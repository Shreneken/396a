            "content": "I remember in 2005, as a young child who was just being acquainted with the internet, learning about Lawrence Kasanoff's Foodfight!. The film seemed unlike anything I had ever heard of before, combining dozens of popular advertising mascots such as Mr. Clean, Chester Cheetah, Mrs. Buttersworth, and Charlie the Tuna into one film that would resemble Toy Story if its setting had been transferred to a supermarket. The story of the film is actually one of cinema and animation's most baffling stories of a film's time in development hell and still captivates me whenever I scour the internet looking for a summation of what exactly went on with the picture. The story is one of incredible ambition, controversy, and an unfathomably disappointing conclusion. If you're not familiar with the backstory, I'll give you a little rundown.In 2001, director Lawrence Kasanoff, who was known for producing the Mortal Kombat films as well as a handful of TV adaptations on the franchise, announced an undertaking like no other - he was going to make an animated film under his own company Threshold Entertainment that focused on the events that would take place inside a supermarket when the lights would turn off. Kasanoff envisioned a spectacle like no other, centering on dozens of recognizable brand mascots that would fend off a new, evil brand that attempted to takeover the marketplace. Not only was a film planned, but merchandize-galore was in addition, with toys, stuffed animals, a potential web show, commercial tie-ins, fast food toys, books, and more were also planned to coincide with the film's release. Kasanoff called Threshold Entertainment \"the next Pixar\" and also banded together top animators from around the world to piece together a project with incredible ambition. The film was to be released in 2003.So why is it that for a film this ambitious you probably haven't heard a damn thing about it? Well, for starters, the film's first immediate roadblock came in the form of a burglary in 2003 when hard drives containing the film, its animation, and its conceptual mockups were stolen. The animators and everyone assigned to the project needed to start from scratch. Nonetheless, Kasanoff pushed on with the project, confirming a release date of 2005.Foodfight! never came out in 2005 and news of it became scarce and vague when it did manage to circulate. The release date was changed several times before finding itself up for auction in 2007 for a surprisingly low $2.5 million, given its ambition and $65 million budget. Finally, the film came out over a decade after it first hit production, in October 2012. It received a very limited theatrical release in Europe and a silent DVD/video-on-demand release in the States, effectively ending one of the most mindbogglingly convoluted chapters in animation history.Now the question begs an answer, what does Foodfight! look like in its final state? The simple answer is \"hell.\" This is a film that was clearly rushed upon being purchased at the aforementioned auction. The story concerns, as stated, a supermarket that turns into a playground for its product-mascots upon closing. The leader of this world is Dex Dogtective (voiced by Charlie Sheen), a crime-fighter who becomes incredibly suspicious of \"Brand X,\" a new line of products that are hitting store shelves. Dex and his gang of friends Sunshine Goodness (Hilary Duff) and Daredevil Dan (Wayne Brady) prepare to keep the supermarket in their hands, but Dex increasingly finds himself distracted by the likes of Lady X (Eva Longoria), a desirable woman who keeps trying to win Dex's eye and the store manager finds himself dictated by Mr. Clipboard (Christopher Lloyd), who is enforcing Brand X.To begin with, the animation is awful. This is animation that looks and moves like a broken Sims game on PlayStation. Never in my life did I think I'd call an animated film with so many colors and characters odious but that's exactly what it is. While the characters appear in a three-dimensional state, the backgrounds almost look two-dimensional, and worst, are almost indistinguishable in terms of what they're supposed to be. This is clearly animation that is not finished and was forced to be the finished product. Characters are very stiff when moving, have a peculiar coldness to their movements in addition, and many of them look grotesque and ugly.Then there's the awful writing at hand here. One can sort of forgive the animation for looking terrible, seeing as, understandably, everyone's hands just wanted to be cleaned of this film, but with twelve years of production and a forced rewrite thanks to a burglary, you would think the writing would be marginally polished. And yet, Foodfight! bears so much sexual innuendo it's ungodly and very inappropriate for children (Daredevil Dan says to the sultry Lady X in one scene, \"Oh Mamacita! Yo, sweetcakes, nice packaging! How about some chocolate frosting? I'd like to butter your muffin!\"), Lady X boasts fetish-like lingerie as her primary outlets, orchestrating the fan-fiction version of her character, and characters speak almost entirely in grocery-store/food puns. There's no characters here, despite there being like thirty that are recognizable. There are just empty, hollow animated creations programmed to spew something that is allegedly funny.Foodfight!'s existence and eventual outcome should be a warning to those who have an idea they see bold and ambitious opportunities for. Granted a burglary can't really be blamed on part of the writers and directors but an awful script, a premise that seems to exist solely as a corporate byproduct, fourth-rate animation, and incredibly unforgivable and unnecessary sexual innuendos can be. The fact that Foodfight! is a bad film is the least of its concerns; it's a morally, ethically, and visually reprehensible fiasco that scrapes the bottom of the barrel so forcefully that it's tearing a hole in its base.",

            "content": "Genre film producer and Vestron Pictures producer Lawrence Kasanoff tried to cash-in on the success of animated movies made by Pixar and Dreamworks in the mid 90's and early 2000's but he did it in the laziest possible way a kids film can turn out to be.If it would have been released in 2003 as it was planned, it would probably be considered a bad, strange and awkward hack job but fate had different plans for this piece of garbage. It wasnt enough to be a bad product of its time, fate wanted it to be one of the worst films ever made by delaying the already flawed production for years and releasing this trash into the world.When you mix a pandering producer who doesnt have much experience at directing, let alone animated features, with a bunch of annoyed underpaid animators, several production difficulties and straight up bad decisions you get... Foodfight.The film was originally going to be animated to resemble a Looney Tunes cartoon but Kasanoff decided the film would use motion capture, a technique that clashes with the cartoony animation style he wanted. The result is the worst of both worlds. Characters are stiff with their movements but this is often interrupted with more flexible stretchy movements that arent executed properly because of the bad animation and feel completely out of place. Thats not taking into account the awful art direction, ugly 3D models, disgusting textures and generic designs.When you try to make a project like this, you should at least be familiar with how the medium works, instead of making arbitrary decisions that will inevitably create troubles for you and your crew; there doesnt seem to be a consistent idea or vision for the film besides making it a commercial family picture for the lowest common denominator.",

It's so bad that the film has been stuck in production limbo for a decade and it hasn't aged well. The CGI, the story and the one-liners (oh God, the one-liners...) all bear the mark of genuine and profound incompetence, a complete lack of even the most most rudimentary story-telling skills.What passes for a narrative revolves around supermarket brands coming to life at night. Rex Dogtective (yeah, go ahead and try to laugh at that one), voiced by Charlie Sheen, mourns his lost love but must soon save his supermarket city from the evil, impersonal Brand X. With the help of ... ah, who cares?Foodfight! will bore, offend and anger you at the same time, such is its unprecedented badness. Please don't watch it.",

Hillary Duff, played by the fantastic Lizzie Mcguire, is fantastic as Sheen's porn star daughter. I won't spoil it, but there is a fantastic appearance by Vanilla Ice with great comic relief that had me in tears laughing. Don't miss out on this one.

            "content": "Where to start with this one? Let me start by talking about the animation. I do not understand what is up with all of these reviews saying that the animation is bad. Do not get me wrong, it is not on the same level as something such as The Queen's Corgi, but the animation is not bad like everyone says it is. The animation is unique and original. I bet you can not name one other animated film that has animation quite like this one. Every scene clearly had a lot of heart and soul poured into it. It truly makes me wonder why so many films that come out nowadays show no signs of having passion behind them.Moving onto to the characters. One of my favorite things about this piece of art is that around ninety percent of the characters is that they are product placements. Another interesting thing that I noticed was that for the companies that clearly disagreed to have their brand shown anywhere in this film are portrayed as some sort of disgustingly designed bootleg version. It truly shows that the creators of this movie were so confident in it that they basically laughed in the faces of the brands that refused to come near the movie. This movie introduces a new character in basically every scene which keeps the film from ever getting boring. Each and every character is unique and like able, something that most films nowadays fail to create. Each and every character has a role in the story and so much backstory to go with them.Another truly extraordinary thing in this movie is how characters get around. Literally one second they are standing in the strange alternate dimension that they reside in and than suddenly teleport to the actual world with no context whatsoever. Most people would see this as just being lazy, but I see it as something else. This is called character building. You see, given how fast characters move around it is easy to assume that they have teleportation abilities. A lot of people these days want everything said out loud to them because they lack the sufficient amount of brain cells to figure things out on their own.However, my favorite part about this movie has to be the villains. In every single scene that they are in there are Nazi overtones. One of the characters literally says \"We were just falling orders!\" before being flattened and most certainly died right after. Not to mention their logo is basically a eagle clutching a + symbol, much like the eagle clutching the swastika. Same position and everything. This goes to show that the creators were not afraid to teach young lings about Nazi Germany and what happened during those times. Show many movies for kids these days are so watered down that they become boring to anyone with a somewhat developed brain.There is so much more to this film and I do not understand where the negative reviews are coming from.",

            "content": "I remember watching the Nostalgia Critic's review of this as well as JonTron's. It's truly some of the Critic's best work and should be seen. He compared it to \"Wreck-It Ralph\". I guess those are similar to the even more awesome Lego movie. They are films that show us that a world of fictional characters can be made into something wonderful. Sadly, this film shows us the complete opposite. I wouldn't quite say it was the worst animated movie I've ever seen. I think that \"honor\" goes to the 2001 animated Titanic movie. This film has credits that go for eight minutes. That other one had credits for fourteen minutes! I guess it technically isn't as ugly as \"Joshua And The Promised Land\", but it really is a worse film. At least that movie was less than an hour long! I hated every minute of this. It has some of the ugliest CGI ever created. These cartoon characters are horrible at showing emotions. They just seem to be staring blankly all the time. All of these characters are ugly. Even the ones who are labeled ugly are really no worse than anyone else. This might be the reason why I'm not into celebrity voices. Of course, anyone would regret being in this movie. What's worse is that there's this guy called General X who explicitly mentions how aroused he is by everything.The villain, Lady X wears clothes that alone should have gotten this movie a PG-13 rating. The climax is one of the most monotonous things I've ever seen in any movie. It's just characters throwing food over and over. It's painfully drawn out for something that's only an hour and a half long. The movements in this film are amazingly terrible. The facial expressions are among the worst ever created. It's good expressions that make me love animation so much. This film makes no sense. It features this world where food mascots go into their own magical world or maybe it comes to life at the end of the day or it exists on some other plane, but I don't care at all.It is a hideous film where the cameos serve no purpose at all. I looked in the credits and I found out there were characters like the Energizer Bunny in this. I didn't recall seeing him so they probably just put him in the crowd scenes for no reason and still mentioned him in the credits. The voices are obnoxious, especially this giant nosed sneezing guy. It's also hateful with them explicitly making Jew jokes. Wait, why would Brand X recall the prunes that Lady X came from? That's impossible! This is idiotic in every sense of the word and is as terrible as every Internet critic has made it out to be. Zero Stars",

It is both an original and a clever homage to some of history's greatest films. It is a pioneering achievement in the art of animation, one that shall never be surpassed. This film will draw you in, and it will touch you. It will make you feel a powerful range of emotions which you have never felt before. You will laugh, and you will cry. You will rage, and you will fear. You will be sick to your stomach. You will ultimately feel a satisfaction unmatched by that which you have already experienced.Foodfight is more than just a movie. It's a personal experience. The characters were realistic and beautifully written. I felt like I knew them. Nay; I KNEW them. While I was watching the film, I considered them my closest friends. Their struggles, although foreign, were also relatable. As I watched them overcome their fears and their prejudices in order to save the day, they taught me that I, too, could be the hero. It made me rethink everything I thought I knew about society, heroism, and morality.This movie is truly a miracle. It cured my cancer, fed my starving children, and brought my grandmother back to life. Larry Kasanoff (the wonderful director of this film) is more than a filmmaker. He is a PROPHET. Mere words cannot express how thankful I am for the existence of his masterpiece. Thanks to Kasanoff, we finally have an answer to the age-old question. God is real, and He is Foodfight.\u221e/10 stars.",

It was supposed to come out in December of 2002. The film was stolen, and that was probably for the best.

It all started several decades ago when I read Harry Medved's great book \"The 50 Worst Movies of All Time\". Since finding and seeing all fifty of these movies, I have also attacked IMDb's list of the 100 lowest rated films of all time. However, as this list is ever-changing, I have to re-check the list periodically to see if there are any new additions. Fortunately (or more like UNfortunately) I noticed a new addition to the list....\"Foodfight!\". However, unlike many of the bad films I have enjoyed for their sheer awfulness and cheese-factor (such as \"The Room\", \"Plan 9 From Outer Space\" and \"The Apple\"), some films are just horrible and offer no enjoyment whatsoever. \"Foodfight!\" is surely one of these joyless and horrible films.The story of how this terrible film got made and released is something in itself. While work on the film began in the early 2000s, the hard drives for the film were apparently stolen and work had to begin again! I assume that these folks simply had never heard of the concept of making backup copies. Also, I can only assume someone stole the film in order to save humanity. Unfortunately, work began again--and the original release date in 2003 came and went. Release dates kept changing until eventually the filmmakers were in default on their loans. The film rights were bought at auction for a tiny fraction of the cost to make the film and it was eventually released to DVD only recently.So why is this film so horrible? Well, the reasons are countless so I'll just concentrate on the major problems. The biggest and most obvious problem is the computer graphics. This CGI film has the ugliest, cheapest and lousiest looking animated film in history. Film students would be ashamed to put their name on this product...it's that bad. Although the work was done in the 2000s, graphically the film is what you would expect in the early to mid 1990s--well before the first \"Toy Story\" film. Characters are blocky, haphazardly stuck on the backgrounds, have garish colors and are simply ugly. There is NOTHING about them that ever speaks quality in any manner. The same can be said about the backgrounds--which are usually very fuzzy and look worse than an old-school computer game like \"MYST\".The dialog is the second worst thing about this 'movie'. While it's clearly aimed at children and stupid people, too much of it is spiked with sexual innuendo to make it appropriate to the children at least. A few choice pieces of their brilliant dialog would include: 'I'd like to butter your muffins' 'Better take it easy on the potato juice before you become chip-faced' '...you have something to say, candy-arse?!' 'I want to scrub your bubbles, Dex' 'What the fudge?!' As for this final comment, it DOES actually sum up the film extremely well! The story itself is also simply horrible. Some parents might strongly object to the fact that this film is ALL product placement aimed at children--with many of the characters consisting of unappealing corporate knockoff characters that look like McGruff the Crime Dog, Charlie the Tuna and Mr. Clean (among many others). I could also talk about the plot involving the evil Brand X trying to take over the grocery store where all these characters live....but so many other awful things assaulted my senses that I really didn't even care about the insanely bad and cynical plot.Despite a plethora of B and C-list stars to provide the voices for these unpleasant characters, there just is no reason to see this film for the average person. For fans of dreck, perhaps it's worth seeing...if extremely unpleasant and boring. And, I could also see professors at schools such as Ringling School of Art and Design showing it to their students as an example of the worst animation to be produced since the beginning of time. Otherwise, steer clear of this wretched piece of bile...",

Like the animated Titanic movie, it isn't just bad, it is bad in such a way that it will be considered inconceivable that such a movie could have even been green lit; a movie where people will see brief snippets and wonder if it was a real movie or just somebody's entry-level CG demo-reel.For this reason, this is not a movie that should be watched. This is a movie that should be thrown into the basement under lock and key for twenty years until it becomes obscure and collectible just like Nintendo's Virtual Boy.I'm not kidding. I have a Dex Dogtective doll, and when I tell people what it is and where it's from, the reaction is always the same: \"Holy ****! That thing is real?!\" The C.G. is terrible, the characters are one-dimensional, the writing is asinine, the jokes make BioDome look like Waking Ned Devine, and the talent of the voice cast is squandered across the board.The only thing that makes this movie even worthy of note is the overabundance of marketing icons. But this isn't a precursor to \"Wreck-It Ralph\" -- won't offer any insights as to what the life of a marketing icon might truly be like (Charlie Tuna makes an appearance, but nobody comments on the fact that he exists to sell the shredded corpses of other tunas). Instead, all we get is a hollow narrative about how buying generic brands is evil. SO BUY OUR CRAP!!! Yes, it's that bad. Right up there with Manos: The Hands of Fate, Tentacolino, Birdemic and The Room: A movie so bad that some people just absolutely have to have it.",

            "content": "There is not much to add to what has already been said, and so well by everybody else here. As a lifelong animation fan, Foodfight! is one of the few that I deem completely unwatchable and it is certainly one of the worst animated films ever made. The animation is unspeakably awful, not just the worst computer-animation in an animated film(excluding Video Brinquedo's and Spark Plug Entertainment's output, seriously the animation here makes Animals United seem like Toy Story in comparison) but some of the worst-looking animation ever. Everything looks so flat and stiff, no vibrant colours, technical invention or easy movements, and you'd be hard pressed to find creepier and more nightmare-inducing character designs. The music is generic and completely unmemorable, often it is placed in an irrelevant and over-used way too. The story was not a very good idea to begin with, but everything is so contrived and predictable it actually hurts, there is little momentum in the pacing and the story meanders a lot while being simplistic at the same time. In short you are never engaged or emotionally invested. There is not a single decent character either, they are either annoying or insignificant and their creepy designs(especially the villains) further add to this. The voice cast on paper are talented, but the voice work is poor here with only Christopher Lloyd trying, Charlie Sheen sounds very detached and bored and there is a lot of overdone hyperactivity and wasted talent everywhere else. Harvey Fienstein is the only other voice actor along with Lloyd who sounds immediately distinctive, the bad news is that I didn't see the point of his very brief role. The script was the worst culprit though, not in a long time has there been a script in an animated film this abominably bad, the bad-taste bathroom humour, out-of-place and inappropriate innuendo, Nazi overtones and equally crude one-liners and catchphrases that are enough to make anyone cringe taken to offensive levels. To conclude, cheap and intelligence-insulting, Foodfight! is execrable, not just one of the worst animated films ever but one of the worst films in general that I've seen in some time. 0/10 Bethany Cox",

It may sound like a cheat, but trust me when I say I saw enough of this movie to last a lifetime without having to watch it all the way from start to finish.This is the kind of shoddy work that would get penny-a-day workers in Malaysia scolded by their superiors - you can make it look s***y, but THIS s***y? The whole thing is meant to cash in, and only cash in, on the craze of hip-ironic computer animated movies of the late 90's and early 00's without any sort of understanding what made those movies matter (i.e. Toy Story and Shrek but I'm sure you can point to others from Disney and Dreamworks). This lacks any shred of competency, but more than that anything close to humanity. If Roger Ebert once said that movies are like machines for empathy, then... this is the opposite of that.Horrible puns (which can often, when done right, be really funny in real life, honest, I swear), horrible animation (it makes even the creepiest of the Uncanny Valley animated movies like Polar Express look like Sleeping Beauty), horrible voice acting (even Charlie Sheen, someone who just picked up a check for years on end to fart in front of sitcom canned laughter, seems bored - or Christopher Lloyd who's having a stroke in front of the world), and a horrible, unforgivable cynical grab at, on top of the aforementioned steals of Toy Story and Shrek: Casablanca. Did this f***er even watch Barb Wire? It's not even funny enough to laugh at, which is one of the most unforgivable things about something that goes into the subterranean depths where barrel bottoms don't even exist (to put it in perspective, Doogal is a better bad movie than this - DOOGAL). While you can go look at the trivia online and add that into the fire of horror that comes with this movie, just on its own terms it's an unqualified disaster. It's not even joyful to dump on the movie, it's simply a waste that makes America look bad to foreign countries and sets us back another 50 years as far as being pioneers in the world of arts and sciences.Oh, and it is the kind of material that I'm sure, if you show to your kids or you are a kid and decide to watch this, that will give you nightmares. And I don't mean in the fun horror movie way. I mean more akin to the kind of dreams where you watch your dog making love to your parents while a bonfire engulfs your X-Box and Salvador Dali plays baseball on top of their corpses.",

            "content": "Jontron was right! Nostalgia Critic was right! Animat was right! Phantomstrider was right!Why didn't I listen to them?!This is an animated feature about a dog named Dex Dogtective who's played by Charlie Sheen and gets depressed after his girlfriend Sunshine Goodness disappears. After a brand called Brand X, controlled by Lady X begins to take over the food market that he and a bunch of grocery mascots live in, they must fight back.Where do I begin? The animation is hideous; it's the worst animation ever put to film, I'm not even kidding here. It was originally destined to be in a Looney Tunes style when planned in 2002, but when the film went into production issues, the director decided that they should change the style to motion capture. Seeing these two styles combined makes the movie look unnatural. The animation itself looks ugly from the character designs, to the awful effects, to the backgrounds, the list goes on. Ranging from the human designs to the designs of the mascots, they either look unnatural or uncanny. For example, Lady X looks very plastic like and Cheasel T. Weasel has the color of poop. For some reason, the camera moves in almost every single shot. You may see the camera zoom in, spin around a tower or pan in for an extreme close up. The backgrounds have an incredibly low resolution, to the point where some of them look flat. For example, in the beginning of the movie where the store closes, the interior of the store looks flat. Keep in mind that this movie came out in 2012. I could harp on about the animation, but I think I should move on.The story and characters aren't much better in comparison. To start with the story, we have the concept. Basically, food mascots come to life at night when the store closes. The concept bares a striking resemblance to that of Toy Story's, only with food mascots. To go along with the concept, the movie uses endless product placements from Charlie Tuna and Mr. Clean to the Vlasic bird. It doesn't make the audience feel grateful seeing all of these advertisements in a movie. As for the story itself, it's very incoherent and there are many scenes that don't make much sense. For example, during the midpoint of the feature, Dex can be seen out in the market during the daytime while customers are shopping and it doesn't make sense as to how he is able to be on the outskirts of the store. There are also these weird sexual innuendos that are noticeable that really do make me question the PG rating. During the midpoint of the movie there is a musical number that is really grating on the ears to the point where I nearly went insane listening to it. None of the jokes hit and come off as cringeworthy. Did I mention that the story is incoherent?The characters...hoo boy, where do I start with them? I can start by listing them. The doctor does nothing but talk rapidly in the most obnoxious voice possible. Cheasel T. Weasel, aka the poop rat is incredibly over the top with his cartoony movements; heck he has an entire shop hidden inside of him. Lady X is a generic villain who tries to seduce our protagonist, and she also wears very suggestive clothes while doing it. Daredevil Dan is an obnoxious racist stereotype. And then there's Sunshine, who maybe the most likable character in this movie since she isn't annoying. Finally, we have the main character Dex Dogtective. Dex is probably the most interesting character of the movie because of his girlfriend's disappearance. However, that doesn't make him likable. What makes him unlikable is the fact that he spouts out food puns all the time. While this gag doesn't make him unlikable per se, it only makes him look tolerable at best. One last thing I'd like to mention about the characters is the voice acting. Many of them are voiced by talented people such as Charlie Sheen, Wayne Brady and Eva Longoria. However, their voice acting in this movie can range from sub-par at best to bad at worst.If there is one tiny saving grace to the film, it's that the opening song is actually pretty good. However, it doesn't save this from being a terrible movie.Don't be fooled, the uncanny animation might seem like the only reason why this movie is so hated on the outside. However, if you dig deeper into the movie, you'll see the real reason why it gets so much hate, it has a nonsensical story, annoying characters and sexual innuendos. Please I beg you, do NOT watch this movie. Don't even get this for your kids, it's too inappropriate for them. Give them something else, ANYTHING else.I want to be done with this movie forever!",

The animation has a really jerky quality that you'd find in a test clip that lacks it's final slickness. There's virtually no depth or texture to any of it either. Looks like someone downloaded Blender and spent an afternoon learning to use the software.The concept of the film is like they'd watched some recent successes with animals and other kid friendly characters and picked up \"101 Hilarious Jokes\" from a charity shop. All they had to do was glue those elements onto the family movie skeleton and there you have a winning script for a screening at the International Kicked in the Head by a Horse Convention.The humour in it is annoyingly bad and the delivery from the actors make you cringe... I can't completely blame them though, because the sound quality suggests that they weren't given a lot of time.\"Hey! How's it going with that project we gave you $65m to make?\"...

            "content": "Yes! Somebody honestly stole this utter travesty of cinema unfinished movie in its early days back in 2002. The theft really hurt Threshold Entertainment hope to be as big as Pixar. As the majority of the budget was already spent on licensing products, mascots and actors. The progress on the film that was 60% complete is now gone. With no backup available, the production started from scratch in 2004, after months of additional conceptual work. This small break had given director/producer Lawrence Kasanoff a new idea, one that probably sealed the film's fate. He wanted to direct it like a live-action movie, complete with retakes, motion-capture performances and more spontaneity than the 'squash and stretch' computer animation. As a result, he and animators spent even more money using really outdated insufficient software. The movie continue to be delay, with each passing year. Despite Kasanoff raising tens of millions of dollars in funding over the years, the movie defaulted on a loan, in late 2011, and creditors auctioned off the film's assets and all associated rights. In 2012 the film was made a low-key release, being direct-to-DVD, with still unfinished broken computer motion and absolutely dreadful and atrocious computer animation. The figures still perform in wildly exaggerated motions from its 'squash and stretch' animation days with jerky and the constantly gesticulating hands motions. Yet, in other scenes, the CGI animation is nearly lifeless with death shot eyes, stiff facial expressions, and robot like motion. In addition to computer problems. The story is horrible. This CGI-animated film tried to do 1995's Toy Story, did for Toys or 2012's Wreck-It Ralph, did for Video Games with advertising mascots. The story concerns a grocery store that comes to life at night when people are not around. The 'IKES' AKA the iconic advertising mascots live in this world. Dex Dogtective (Charlie Sheen) is a top agent of the United Supermarket Defense Association which keeps the aisles safe from crime as well as running a club called the Copa-Banana where fellow advertising icons like Charlie the Tuna, Mr. Clean and the California Raisins hang out. After his beloved Sunshine Goodness (Hilary Duff) vanishes without a trace, he ends up stepping out of the game only to be brought back in when a mysterious \"Brand-X\" has emerged in the grocery store by its owner, Mr. Clipboard (Christopher Lloyd). Soon after they arrive, Icons start to disappear or found to be murdered. With the help of his sidekick Daredevil Dan (Wayne Brady), Dex must uncover the truth behind Brand-X and its Femme Fatale leader Lady X (Eva Longoria) and rally a resistance in order to prepare for well, a Food Fight. The movie is very uncomfortable with its story. Seeing Commercial icons getting whacked in violent ways might haunt the children watching the film. A lot of children might not get that the movie script mirrors that of 1942's Casablanca. It's such a rip-off than playing homage to that film. The Brand X antagonists are very offensive. Dressed in Nazi-inspired regalia, the villains declare their intention to send the \"Ikes,\" or brand icons, to the \"expiration station'. Honestly, with a better director or writer, this plot could work like 1988's Who Framed Roger Rabbit. It could represent the struggle between free market capitalism beliefs and that of fascism control, but no, it's a generic plot full of unfunny jokes. It doesn't work, because most have no setup or punchline. The fart jokes are probably the worst. The sexual innuendo is bit much, for a movie aimed at small children. The villainous Lady X performs a seductive dance in a schoolgirl outfit for Dex, who appears to sport a visible reaction in his trousers. Then she get shun, because she was indeed fat and ugly. The character of Sunshine Goodness looks something out of a Japanese fetish furry anime. Daredevil Dan makes catcalls and sexual insults. No wonder, why a lot of companies didn't pitch in, for this film. At the time, the movie being made was first announced, the film was denounced for taking product placement to the extreme, and doing it in a film targeted at children. Kasanoff responded to the controversy by noting that they were not paid money for the brand inclusion and therefore the addition of known brands did not constitute product placement, though the brands were expected to provide $100 million worth of cross-promotion. Those that didn't want to put their characters in the film, had ugly to unlikeable replacement. I really felt bad for those that honestly, did put their characters in, because they were made out to be useless jokes. The characters, they made for the film, are such ugly ethic stereotypes. I hate Daredevil Dan as the comedy relief. Lots of unfunny black jokes. The main lead, Dex isn't that bad. Still, he's a dog who is the mascot of a raisin cereal? Did they know that It dogs can't eat raisins because they're poisonous to them? Why, haven't Dex died, multiplies time over? The voice acting is alright, but you can still, hear some background noise in some of the recording. Overall: This movie is pretty bad. It's so bad. I wouldn't say, 'it's so bad, it's good'. It's too horrible for that. I don't recommended, watching it. Stick to watching commercials on TV. They're a little more entertaining than this film.",

            "review_title": "Truly the Worst of the Worst or Nah?",
            "content": "As far as most people will tell you, there does not seem to be any animated feature that has been called the worst ever made since Foodfight. Created by VFX studio Threshold Entertainment and directed by movie businessman Lawrence Kasanoff, this film has garnered nothing but hatred and scorn since its release ten years ago. After going through countless delays, production nightmares and distribution conflicts, the film came out with a poor release and was soon labeled as the \"worst\" animated feature to ever exist. However, looking back on it, while it is terrible beyond words, I wouldn't call it truly worthless.The film revolves around brand mascots that come to life in a supermarket after closing time, who all end up having to fight against the forces of a newly placed product called Brand X. Despite the film's premise sounding creative on paper, the film's final execution is all over the place. On top of that, the humor ranges from rancid food puns to confusing pop culture references to downright inappropriate innuendos, thus leaving the question who this film's audience is supposed to be in the first place. Not to mention, a lot of the characters are thoroughly bland and even creepy, many of whom range from awkward protagonists to unsettling looking villains. Also, one third of the story structure is set up while the last hour is one big climatic food fight sequence, losing any memorable screen time that should have been dedicated to character development. What's not helped is the blatant allegory of Brand X resembling nazism, proving just how little subtlety is really in this cluttered mess of a family motion picture. It's really baffling how one 90 minute feature can feel more like 9 hours.That all said, perhaps the most immediate glaring flaw in Foodfight would have to be its animation quality. It's been said that the filmmakers intended to go in a cartoony squash and stretch direction visually, but after an infamous file disappearance, director Lawrence Kasanoff opted for motion capture, and the end result is horrifying. In addition to the character designs not translating well digitally, their motion is so robotic that even their facial expressions are reduced to living wax figurines. You know your own character work is poor when the rarely seen famed food mascots look more convincing. Even a lot of the backgrounds look weakly rendered and mismatched color palettes that don't blend well anywhere. Not to mention, a lot of the food splattering effects feel more like kids show bumper graphics, to the point where nothing looks appetizing in a movie about food products. It's unfair to blame the crew when the film's reported $65 million dollars never went to good usage, but needless to say, what ended up on screen should never have gotten past anyone.However, despite all of these blatant flaws, there are a few things that do give Foodfight a little more worth than it got. Given that this film was intended as somewhat of a Who Framed Roger Rabbit like crossover with supermarket mascots, such as Charlie the Starkist Tuna, Mrs. Butterworth, Chiquita Banana and many more, the mere concept behind the film has all the makings of something truly imaginative. Some worldbuilding ideas like the food mascots living in areas built around their food, the fear of being recalled and junk food being bad for the whole market would've had more effect had the plot taken full advantage of them. On top of that, a lot of the big names attached to the project like Charlie Sheen, Wayne Brady, Eva Longoria, Christopher Lloyd, Harey Fierstein and Cloris Leachman do the most with the material they're given, and one can imagine they may have had more fun behind the scenes than anyone else. Along with an tense upbeat score by Walter Murphy, one can see the slivers of gold in an otherwise wrecked disaster of a feature.So it's definitely no surprise that Foodfight remains a dreadful experience due to a messy narrative, flat characters, horrendous animation, and arguably the worst attempts at humor in animation cinema. That being said, the seed that grew an otherwise rotten plant did show a lot of promise from the start, and it's easy to imagine a more competent filmmaker revisiting the idea within the coming years. Although I would not recommend the movie to anybody, unanimously calling this the worst animated feature ever feels rather cold and pretentious. Besides, it's neither the first nor last time a good concept has gone wrong.",

Like binging the home shopping channel on TV. Like stumbling across some weird animated fetish film made by artificial intelligence. This is a film that makes you feel like you need to take a shower after watching. It should be illegal to show Foodfight to anyone who is not a consenting adult.I watched Foodfight during a Twitch virtual afterparty for a Fire Toolz movie night. We tried to joke though it. We tried to laugh at it. But ultimately, the film won. It was simply that bad.Only watch Foodfight if you want to see how bad an animated film can be.

            "content": "The story behind this movie is much better than the movie itself. While work on the movie began in the 2000s, the original copies of the film were stolen and never to be found again. I can only assume that the folks that stole it knew that the movie would have been atrocious and the animators never heard of original copies. The release date was always postpone until the filmmakers were forced to release it and it came on DVD only in 2014.There are three reasons why this movie is horrible and I'll discuss them all. The most noticeable and worst is the CGI. This animated movie has the ugliest looking, cheapest and sloppiest CGI ever seen in history. Everyone involved with this mess would be ashamed to admit that he was behind this crap-fest. While the movie was made in the early 2000s, the graphics look like from the early 1990s (even years before the first TOY STORY movie). All characters are like stuck in the backgrounds, are sinfully ugly, have garish colours and they are pretty ugly. The backgrounds look like picked straight from the oldest videogames ever, as they are very fuzzy and incoherent.The characters' dialogue is awful too. Although this is an animated movie marketed towards children the dialogue is downright dumb and full of sexual innuendos inappropriate for children. The plot is also a mess as well. While it can be looked as an obvious attempt to cash in on the product placement (with many icons and also knock-offed ones such as Mister Clean, Charlie the Tuna, the California raisins) it has also a sub-plot about a detective dog that fights crime and the evil Brand X from taking over the supermarket that has everything that comes to life at night (much like in NIGHT AT THE MUSEUM). But everything in the movie is so horrible that the plot is not that important.Despite a voice cast that includes Charlie Sheen, Hilary Duff, Eva Longoria, Harvey Fierstein (in a pointless bit role), and even veterans such as Christopher Lloyd, Edward Asner and Cloris Leachman (!!!), there is no reason for watching this movie. Even for bad movie buffs like me it's too boring and painful to sit through. The only advice I can give you? Steer clear from this movie as possible! And you'll probably thank me for this.",

I did some research on this animated film and for a film that took ten years, $65 million dollars, numerous familiar voices, and even footage supposedly stolen, this looks like the stuff of kids' nightmares. Is this suppose to be a kids' film? I'm not even sure.Where did the $65 million go towards? Certainly not the animation, which looks like leftovers from the Sega Genesis/NES/SuperNintendo era.Dex Dogtective. Worst. Character name. Ever. And why is this detective...oops, I mean \"dogtective\", dressed like Indiana Jones? Shouldn't he be wearing a nice suit, not dressed like he's looking for the Ark of the Covenant or running from giant boulders or fighting the Nazis? Speaking of Nazis, the villains consist of some scary looking old guy that walks like he's having a seizure pushing his Brand X products to Marketopolis Market (seriously, who comes up with these stupid names?) to stock on their shelves, a green dude that chants \"Brand X, Brand X, It's simple and plain. Brand X, Brand X, it's different but all the same.\", and Lady X, who seduces Dex with some naughty outfits and seductive dancing.Speaking of dancing, the characters flailing their arms around and pirouette for no reason while they're talking is just plain distracting. The same goes for the dead stares in the eyes of the characters.Speaking of characters, why have your movie poster feature product placement characters (Mrs. Butterworth, Twinkie the Kid, etc.) in the forefront, yet in the film give them absolutely little or nothing to do with the actual movie? Talk about false advertising (no pun intended).The first time I heard Dex speak, I'm thinking \"Mmmm, this dude sounds like Charlie Sheen.\" Then I go on IMDb and found out it IS Charlie Sheen. Then I see who else is in this and I think, \"Why? Why did you sell your soul for this garbage?\" I'm convinced that Charlie Sheen got all wackadoo not from working on Two and a Half Men but from having to do this film for almost ten years. As for the other actors, Eva Longoria, Christopher Lloyd, Tim Curry, etc. need to fire whoever got them this gig. And Hilary Duff proves once again she lacks talent for singing, acting, and voiceovers. The same goes for her sister Hayley, who's also in this stinker.The endless puns by Dex, which are basically borrowed lines from better movies with food items replacing certain words, are annoying. Allow me to demonstrate: \"Of all the produce bars in all the supermarkets in all the world, she had to walk into mine.\" \"Let's snap, crackle, and pop out of here.\" \"My problems are just a hill of coffee beans.\" \"Frankly my dear, I don't give a spam.\" And then you have the sexual innuendos that makes you question is this suppose to be a kids' movie. Again, I'll demonstrate: \"It warms my heart the way you love my raisins, tough guy.\" \"I'd like to butter your muffin.\" \"I think I just wet myself. It feels rather nice.\" \"I want to scrub your bubbles, Dex.\" Does this film have something against cats? First Dex is fighting a giant rat that holding some kittens hostage and Dex calls him FatCat. Shouldn't he LOOK like a cat as oppose to a rat? And what's with that nightmare of a thing called Sunshine Goodness (again, another stupid name), a cat/human hybrid that Dex wants to marry? Damsels in distress are not suppose to look scary, but she does. And why when your girlfriend that you want to marry disappears do you wait six months later to actually make an effort to search for them, especially when they said they'd be right back? And why, during that time when said girlfriend is missing, do you open a nightclub called Copa Banana (again with the stupid names)? Some boyfriend Dex is.And finally, a twist ending even M. Night Shyamalan would call B.S. The crazy spastic guy from earlier in the film was actually a giant robot with Lady X inside. And Sunshine Dumbell accepts Dex's marriage proposal. Not that you'll care because you just want this thing to end ASAP.If you choose to watch this stinkburger of a movie, don't say you weren't warned.",

It's all very strange, confused, and the film does not care one bit to explain to us which are the rules of this universe. The film simply think we are already aware of everything.After this initial shock, everything gets worse. We face generic characters, extremely poorly animated and ugly to look at - what heck is that weasel, my Jesus. The plot is a spectacular mess. The film does not know what audience it is targeting. It's look terribly childish, but there are dialogues and grotesque sexual innuendos and poorly made, not suitable for children. There are Nazis. The moment it happens the war of food is worthy of Michael Bay, with endless explosions, the point you wonder when it will all end.The animation it seems that was taken from someone's ass in the early 90s. That would be horrible in 1995, imagine how horrible it is today. The scenarios are really terrible and confused, you never know where the characters are, whether it's on the shelf, or in the world of products, or in the aisles of the supermarket.Can anyone explain to me why the hell this film had a big budget? Would you believe in me if I said that this film has a budget more expensive than Fantasia, Lion King, The Secret of NIMH, Toy Story and Spirited Away? My fuc*** Jesus, this can't be serious.",

Nostalgia Critic tried to warn people. This movie had a huge budget but none of it should go to these writers or actors. There is nothing to be proud of in this movie. In fact, here's all the problems with this cancer. 1. The animation looks like puke and crap all over Minecraft backgrounds. 2. The characters are all terrible and are not interesting in any way at all. 3. The jokes are little more than stupid food puns or lines that make no sense 4. It manages to be even more insulting towards stereotypes than Family Guy. 5. It throws in random morals in the end that were never emphasized earlier to make it seem emotional. 6. Screw the story! The voice acting doesn't save this movie. Nothing does. Even Chuck Norris' tears can't cure this grotesque cancer. I'd gladly give this 0 out of 10 if I could",

            "content": "OK so I've claimed that The Little Panda Fighter is the overall worst movie ever made but Foodfight is what I call my most hated movie. This feels like an offensive ripoff of Toy Story, Who Framed Roger Rabbit and Wreck-It- Ralph, the stories are different but they are similar in their own ways, it's basically the famous icons interacting with each other with cameos from other icons story. But Foodfight? This is the most painful ripoff I've ever watched. The story is confusing, you will spend nearly the entire time questioning the physics in this. The animation while not as dreadful as The Little Panda Fighter is still incredibly lazy, not one character looks alive even though the film had a $65,000,000 budget, the animation when the film was first being developed was better at first but the original footage of that was eventually stolen so we ended up with these horrible visuals instead. The characters suck, they're all offensive, unfunny, annoying, ugly- looking stereotypes, there are even a few that look so terrifying you will have nightmares for who knows how long. My biggest issue with this expired product is the 3 main characters, Dex Dogtective, a half human half dog who's dressed up like Indiana Jones and is played by Charlie Sheen, Sunshine Goodness who's a young woman(human) with cat ears and is played by Hilary Duff, and the main villain, Lady X who's played by Eva Longoria. These 3 are INSUFFERABLY TERRIBLE, there are disturbing fetish references between these 3, what 2 human girls would marry and do the tango with a human-like dog?? It is just so disgusting. Even Jessica and Roger Rabbit's relationship doesn't seem as creepy. So overall I don't care if I had spoiled any parts, I'm doing this for your own sake, this thing probably asked for an extended warrant but didn't get it and got recalled. For the sake of our sanity BURN THIS MOVIE IN HELL!!!!!!",

So all I can say is: It's so bad, It's good. I've seen bad movies, but most people will be thinking that it makes no sense at all.

Visuals, Writing, Characters, Originality, and Overall Likability. Let's start with the visuals. The visuals are the LAZIEST MOST UNREALISTIC THINGS I HAVE EVER SEEN! Really. I can make a movie better than this in the span of 10 MINUTES! It's like they didn't even try. Everything has a plastic texture, crap texture, THAT MAKES YOU WANNA THROW UP AND STOP THE MOVIE BEFORE THE 15 MINUTE MARK! Writing, Um.. Where is this \"writing\" exactly? All it is is just about a main protagonist named dexdogtective who goes on failiure adventures to solve failiure mysteries! Oh, and our main antagonist, Lady X! Lady X is the only character that I like here. Because she is trying to STOP this ugly atrocity! We also have a fight scene that is a length of 35 MINUTES! WOULD YOU WATCH A MOVIE WITH A FIGHT BEING LONGER THAN THE ACTUAL STORY?! Um.. No. Next category, Characters. The characters tell awful jokes that I don't even get! Like, \"Let's strawberry jam out of here\". HOW DOES THAT EVEN MAKE SENSE?! As I said earlier, only 1 likable character, being Lady X, or the main antagonist. The rest of the characters even don't make sense, OR JUST SIT IN THE BACKGROUND FARTING AND BURPING ALL THE TIME WITH THEIR UGLY CGI DANCING AND PLASTIC TEXTURES! Originaltiy, some people thing this is original. But if you think that, YOU ARE DEAD WRONG! THIS MOVIE RIPPED OFF ANOTHER MOVIE CALLED \"Over the Hedge\" WHICH IS WAY BETTER THAN THIS! BASICALLY THE WRITERS ARE TOO LAZY TO MAKE SOMETHING ORIGINAL, AND PLAGORIZE SOMEONE ELSE! And now, overall likability. YOU WILL NOT LIKE THIS MOVIE! LITERALLY! WATCH THE TRAILER! EVEN THE LIP SYNCING Doesn't EVEN TRY TO MATCH WHAT THE CHARACTERS ARE SAYING! I WOULD GIVE THIS A 0/10 IF IMDb Didn't GIVE US A MINIMUM OF 1/10 TO CHOSE ON WHAT TO RATE THIS GARBAGE! I AM DONE! So parents of young kids who are reading this, do not watch the movie. Don't EVEN THINK ABOUT SHOWING THIS MOVIE TO YOUR KIDS! Don't EVEN SHOW THIS TO YOUR BOSS EITHER! If your boss sees you showing him/her this movie, YOU WILL BE FIRED! Just watch something like Zootopia or Despicable Me 2. Because those 2 movies were great. But of all the movies you choose, DO NOT CHOOSE FOODFIGHT!",

It's right there with A Troll in Central Park in terms of filler and Cat in the Hat in terms of well almost EVERYTHING ELSE! How did this trash get green lighted or how did anyone ever believe there was potential in this? Story: Basically it's the Wreck-it-Ralph of food icons, where every night when the store, Marketopilis Market (how creative) closes all the food icons and their town come to life. Dex Dogtective has lost his girlfriend Sunshine Goodness (how original!) and Lady X and her evil army of X-Nazis come in to take over with their elixir. WHY ME? WHY ME?!? OH THE PAIN!!! THE PAIN IN EVERYTHING!!!! I'll list them right now: 1) The characters: Awful to the MAX! Their names are just flat out stupid (Dex Dogtective, Sunshine Goodness, Mr. Clipboard, and so on, not counting Mr. Clean, Charlie the Tuna, the Twinkie guy and others because they actually exist) and their characters are just stereotypes in terms of racism (Daredevil Dan) and sexism (Sunshine Goodness). The animation on them is one thing that makes them look so unlikable, but it's their dialogue too. Just listen to how Sunshine Goodness, General X, Vlad Chocool, and Dr. Si Nustrix talk and you'll know what I mean. 2) The jokes: The worst food puns you will ever hear in your life, right up there with Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2! I'm surprised no company sued the movie for puns like \"Tricks are for kids,\" \"Frankly my dear, I don't give a spam.\" While other puns like \"Time to banana split out of my club,\" have no way of working! I bet if Groucho saw this film he'd say to the director, \"I've got a good mind to join a club and beat you over the head with it!\" 3) The animation: Atrocious! Absolutely atrocious! It's 2012 when this film came out, the year where CGI is around its best, but this atrocity exists? The animation on the characters gives me the CREEPS from the icons to Mr. Clipboard to the shoppers!!! This some of the worst animation I have ever seen! Even in the whole fight scene there is no masterpiece art; it's like they were trying to rip off Pixar and then smudge out all the details, and tried to make it look 2D with computer animation. Also the motion capture is almost nonexistent. All the acting comes through the overuse of arm acting. It gets annoying after a while. 4) The adult moments: (just ran to the toilet throwing up!) It's categorized as a family action film! A FAMILY ACTION FILM!!! Nothing in here is family friendly or anything for kids to watch! I cry that it's categorized as a family film; it's false advertising! There are too many visual innuendos and sex jokes to take in! They're creepy to see (baloney going down Dex's pants), so painful to witness (Vlad gets an erection), so unnecessarily phoned in (\"Are those melons real?\"), and so slam your head with a mallet unfunny. As a side note, there's a scene where Lady X almost cuts off the frog's tongue (FOR KIDS??????), I know kids can be adult to handle some things, but that's just TOO BRUTAL! 5) The plot: No! Just No! Everything's just all wrong! It could have been a great story, but it blew that chance away! The fact that Nazis are in it and the way the reenact the 1940's is just wrong. Don't believe they rip off the 1940's? Check out this example: Lady X on a high building making a \"You must be desirable\" speech and getting rid of the non desirables. Oh and still don't believe me that it's 1940's? They sing the French National Anthem (well a song with the melody), the Brand X soldiers walk saluting X, \"Long live La Resistance,\" and \"Curfew is now in effect; only Brand X officials are permitted in the isles.\" I wouldn't be surprised if there were people who found all of this offensive in its portrayal, and you know what? I don't blame them! Another problem I have with the story is when Sunshine is missing and Dex never finds her (until the end at least). The story might have built his character better if she had been dead, teaching kids and adults that even when life takes away something precious you gotta learn to face life, learning everything that your precious someone left you. Also she was nothing but a tool in the story. The whole story was completely pointless.Nothing more to be said, except stay away from it, or if you absolutely must watch it, don't say I didn't warn you!",

            "content": "So bad it's good (SBiG) is a term commonly used to describe films which are entertaining despite being terrible, mainly through unintentional hilarity. I have enjoyed many films for being SBiG, for example \"The Room\" and \"Plan 9 From Outer Space\". However I would argue that Foodfight! is not even worthy of that dubious honour, and here's why; It is far too dull. The film reaches an almost mind-bending degree of total failure, to the point where it becomes hard to rationalise and understand, never mind mock. Foodfight!'s animation is probably it's most glaring flaw. It looks horrifying, absolutely unacceptable by the standards that were in place by 2012. Perhaps it would have been more tolerable in the early 2000's, provided the broken facial expressions and hideous textures were improved, however it is insulting to expect a paying audience in 2012 to tolerate this crap. There is little to talk about here, aside from how obviously ugly this film is.The writing is honestly a greater insult to me than the animation. Almost every conversation or exchange of dialogue contains puns, bad puns. Puns constitute 80% or so of the film's limp and flaccid attempts at humour. These puns vary from bad, to eye-bulging in their failure, it is a pathetic defeat to see 5 PROFESSIONAL WRITERS produce this horrendous quality of humour. Aside the puns, the film's dialogue is disjointed and completely nonsensical, it becomes unintelligible noise after around 20 minutes or so. There are also some worryingly misogynistic and sexual elements at play in this 'script', for a film supposedly meant for young children. If I were to discover that this film was written in one sitting and was partially intended as a joke, I would totally believe it.The audio quality also causes me to tilt my head in sheer bewilderment. Some lines, sometimes from the same character, are of drastically lower quality than others in terms of audio clarity. This problem gets worse towards the film's end, leading me to assume that the more expensive microphones were lost or sold later in the film's production, meaning cheaper mics had to used. The quality honestly reaches shocking levels of awfulness, and becomes near to unlistenable at points.Overall, this film fails in every notable area. It is hideous in every strata of it's existence, to a point in which it stops being funny and simply becomes sad to witness. This is the audio/visionary equivalent of having a sowing needle impaled through your toe, if that makes any sense.",

This can be quite enjoyable at times, as many of the films we watch together provide numerous opportunities for MST3K-style commentary. A couple of years ago, I chose to watch Foodfight! with him while he was over my place. I had heard that this was one of the worst animated films ever made and I thought that it would be a source of much schadenfreude. After an awkward hour-and-a-half, I realized that I was mistaken - Threshold Entertainment has managed to produce a film that's so incompetent on so many levels that it's almost unwatchable.The most glaring flaw with the film is the animation. The computer animation in Foodfight! looks worse than animation made on a much lower budget 15 or 20 years before this film was released. The character models range from unappealing to horrifying and some of them are reused multiple times in the same shot, with crowds of people consisting of the same five or so character models repeated dozens of times. Apparently, the original assets for the film were stolen, forcing the film crew to recreate what was lost on a much lower budget, so they weren't entirely to blame for this aspect of the film's awfulness.Those involved in the film's creation don't get a similar pass for the writing. The plot is riddled with so many clich\u00e9s that you could hang Dex's fedora on them. For example, Dex is the character who was once a detective but left the profession after the woman he loved disappeared, a stock protagonist so generic that even Ballistic: Ecks vs Sever included him. The humor is equally bland, consisting of fart jokes, bad puns, and sexual innuendos that seem rather inappropriate for a children's movie.A large part of the controversy surrounding the film's release was the rampant product placement. While I found the product placement a minor quibble compared to the film's other glaring flaws, I understand the concern - Foodfight! is ostensibly aimed at children, and they are more susceptible to being influenced by product placement. However, I found the greatest disappointment surrounding the inclusion of brand mascots, called \"Ikes\" in the film, is that they don't do much other than stand in the background of some shots. I was hoping to see Mr. Clean use his navy training to beat the villains senseless, but the only action scene involving the Ikes was a brief scene near the end, where they throw food at the Brand X soldiers.The real tragedy of Foodfight! is that it is not even \"so bad it's good\". Foodfight! could have easily been enjoyably bad, but it commits the cardinal sin of being both bad and bland. I could even see a version of Foodfight! that I would enjoy unironically - a move that embraced the absurdity of the premise and was written in a way that was more self-aware. Foodfight! was never going to be Citizen Kane, but it could have been Robocop - a movie that used its rather silly premise to deliver some clever social commentary. However, the version we got is neither of these things.",

I'm not saying everything in this movie is bad... though that's probably the case. But bad isn't the word I'd use. What I'd use is \"wrong\". And that in turn doesn't mean \"there is something wrong that I can't put my finger on\". But \"wrong\" as in \"should not BE\". Like it's a perversion and an affront to humanity and nature. That goes for animation, editing, writing, plot, \"plot\"... EVERYTHING is \"wrong\", to the point that I am broken in a way I cannot explain. Existential crisis does not quite cut it. There is something truly dark and sinister in play.Watching this makes me feel like a black hole has spawned somewhere where my head connects with my soul (I believe in those now too, thanks to this) and is slowly sucking away my brain and soul at the same time. Somewhere in another universe there floats a chunk of brain matter with an unfinished human conciousness, and it has been contained for research by that world's version of the SCP Foundation, and it's being documented as a work of cosmic horror in another universe. And each of those universes is a tiny bit worse for it, because each version of this conciousness by its nature spawns other instances of this being in other alternate universes, and none of them might ever learn to truly understand it until it's far too late.This *thing* is wrong. It should not be. But it is. And none of us are safe from it. For mere knowledge of this atrocity is enough to initiate... not end, because that implies natural flow of time, but the erasure of any beginning. Non-existance itself will not be. There is no word or concept in mortal tongue and mind to comprehend the state.And humanity played a key part in it.Tl;dr: Movie bad.",

The various vocal talents in this movie made it even more delightful than the product placement alone. Charlie Sheen deserves his own award for the passion that was conveyed through his canine counterpart. Hilary Duff and her sis also fondly brought me back to my Lizzie McGuire days, and Eva to my Desperate Housewives times. The nostalgia is overwhelming!! My kids also thoroughly enjoyed this film. My 12 year old insisted I make him a Halloween costume to match that of Charlie Sheen's character. I myself went as Eva's character! Needless to say all seven children in our family will be receiving Foodfight in their stockings this Christmas, as well as some foods to reenact the climactic battle on Christmas day!! I sense a new family tradition being born!To those of you who are skeptical, remember: never judge a movie until you've seen it at least five times. It gets better with each new viewing!!!",

Almost everything about this film is god-awful and should be recalled from existence. The characters were flatter than a fresh sheet of paper, the animation was like watching everyone dance like they were high, the plot was a clich\u00e9d eye-roll, etc. For example, how did Brand X even find out what who was fighting for and against them? Where did characters A, D, and Q come from and where do they go? Do any of us even care what goes on in the film? The \"deaths\" were pointless, so this movie was robbed of any emotion it might ever have had, although it probably still would have been devoid of any emotion whatsoever. Seriously, what did I just watch? And WHY was this made? Well, not my problem.There was one positive take away from this movie, and that would be \"It's Our World\". It sounds lively enough to try and add some life to the movie, but frankly, It's Our World deserved better than this abysmal piece of excrement. That song was the only thing about the movie that actually felt like it was actually in its time period because the rest of it was dated to hell.So yeah, Foodfight can fall off a cliff and into the depths of no longer existing.",

Shortly after watching a youtube review on this movie (by jontron), me and my best friend decided to watch it together. We went in with the plan to not only judge it for ourselves, but at the same time insult it for all it's expected awfulness and unintended comedic value... so basically we watched it to make fun of it. we sat through the whole thing and let me tell you how not worth it it is to see for yourself. Over all the \"plot\" of the movie is terribly written and so heavily rushed that the main plot finishes in just under an hour and straight into the big food fight sequence, which technically lasts for about 30ish minutes. The jokes they try to put in are very forced and just unfunny. They added in so many unnecessary and stale characters (no pun intended) that contributed almost nothing to the plot. my own personal biggest complaint about this movie is that overall it's just ugly, it's almost literally hard to look at the screen because of unappealing characters and mostly empty scenery. Just trust me when i say DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE! The movie can be best described as an endurance run, both me an my friend agreed that if we had decided to watch it on our own we would have stopped before the 20 minute mark. It's not even worth making fun of. So in conclusion i'm just saying not to watch it, it's ugly excuse of a movie that over uses product placement... it's simply terrible. If you really need to know what it's like then just watch jontron's review on youtube, it sums it up in the best way I've seen done so far.",

You could have Charlie the Tuna talking to Mr. Clean! How amazing would that be? Well that was the question that Lawrence Kasanoff had for about 70 brand managers in his new sure to be epic movie \"Foodfight!\". They managed so wrangle $60 million for this and got the permission to use all these mascots for their new venture Threshold Digital, an offshoot of Threshold Entertainment that was going to be the new Pixar. Except there was a difference between Pixar and Threshold. Pixar has managed to make hit after hit with very few commerical failures meanwhile Threshold has literally never put a product to air that has truly succeeded. This was not going to be good.They failed to come out in 2007 and 2008 and then when the movie was half rendered, the hard drives were stolen in which Kasanoff called a case of \"industrial espionage\". So instead of restoring from a backup or something they simply moved to cheap motion capture. This was a bit of a mistake because now this was the only way the characters were able to show any kind of emotion. You'd think they'd use the face but beyond flapping their mouths, there was absolutely no plasticity given to them. Literally the characters have these cold dead eyes that never quite look in the direction they're supposed to.And if that wasn't bad enough the this whole thing sent Threshold into receivership and they needed to sell the movie off to the highest bidder. $2.5 million is what they got and that was the opening bid. But what is so bad about it beyond the lack of proper expressions, sponsors that dropped out forcing them to change characters and people that never made a feature length movie before? The story really comes down to this: \"Buy commercial brands with mascots because buying store brands is like supporting the Nazis\". And no, I'm not kidding.The main characters are all store brands or \"Ikes\" possibly taken from \"icons\". The evil Brand X representatives are dressed like Nazis. There's even a scene taken directly from Casablanca, a movie that Kasanoff compared Foodfight! to, in which Brand X starts to sing the Brand X loyalty song while the Ikes break into the Supermarket loyalty song which sounds suspiciously like \"La Marseillaise\" or the French national anthem. I'm not kidding. One of the most iconic scenes in Casablanca reduced to this. It's shameful.And that's it. The central message is colorful mascots are good, generic and store brands are bad. It's no wonder most of the sponsors dropped out when they found out what the story was about. Watch this for a laugh. For the longest time the DVD was only $5.00 so I would be surprised if it costs more now.",

            "content": "I first encountered this film through Nostalgia Critic's review of it. Curious how the whole thing felt, I went and looked for a full copy of it. What did I discover? It was just as bad as you would expect it to be.The premise of the film is similar to scenarios like \"Toy Story\": whereas in that film, toys came to life when people left the room, in this film the mascots and logos (called \"ikes\") for food and household products come to life when the grocery store closes at night. In one such store, an Indiana Jones/McGruff mix named Dex Dogtective is about to ask raisin mascot Sunshine Goodness to marry him, when she disappears. Cut to six months later, when Lady X and her \"Brand X\" product enters the store, and promptly takes it over. Eventually Dex leads the other ikes in a revolt against her rule, leading to the climactic and eponymous conclusion.The story of how this film was made is a long, amazing story of stolen hard drives and long delays, and the unfortunate truth is that it shows. The character models are a mix of tolerable and downright ugly to look at (especially most of the human or humanoid models), making the film difficult to view. The animation clearly relied on motion capture, perhaps to increase the speed of production...but whereas most animation studios know to rely on motion capture as a basis and not the sole source of animation, \"Foodfight!\" looks like it relied upon motion capture without any sign of correction by individual animators: there are times where characters will move about awkwardly, and in a few instances characters will gyrate and quiver like they're having a spaz attack. Much of the animation, in fact, looks like it was a rushed job, especially in regards to eye movement: many characters, when interacting with others, will rarely make eye contact and simply stare forward as their head moves about.The script is equally embarrassing. Half of it is simply food puns (eg., \"Chipfaced.\"), while the other half are sex jokes that would embarrass most parents. Now granted, many films/TV shows aimed at children will have either jokes only adults would get, or jokes that only someone of an older age would appreciate, but usually they were subtle enough to keep parents in the room from feeling embarrassed; no one who watched \"Animaniacs\" as a kid understood why Yakko would look at the audience and go \"G'night everybody!\" until they were older. \"Foodfight!\", on the other hand, has adult jokes that should have increased the rating a bit higher. For example, Daredevil Dan, seeing a good looking ike, says, \"Hey, nice packaging! Want some chocolate frosting?\" The worst one, by far, however, is the line said by Lady X's general over the loudspeakers, when he says something to the effect of: \"I love a good violation...I love anything to do with violation...\" This isn't even mentioning the strange fascination Vlad Chocool has with Daredevil Dan.Even stranger is the use of real marketing icons alongside fake ones that are obviously referencing real ones (for example, a female toucan reporter that is clearly a reference to Toucan Sam). One wonders why the filmmakers didn't just forsake the idea of including real mascots and just make up spoof mascots. It might have avoided the criticism that this film is a giant product placement, and most of the main characters aren't real icons any way.Voice acting-wise, most of the actors at least *attempt* to do a good job. Part of the problem is just that the script is so bad, the characters so annoying, and the animation so ugly and terrible that I don't think they could have salvaged it. In the end, people who have sincere talent get wasted either in minor characters (like Chris Kattan as the extremely annoying Polar Penguin) or in wasteful roles (like Christopher Lloyd as Mr. Clipboard). In the end, the reason any actor agreed to do this has to amount to either the original concept was better, or (as so often happens) they needed the paycheck.There really is nothing good to say about \"Foodfight!\" as a whole. The only reason I find myself watching it again from time to time is to examine just how bad it is. If you want to see it, don't expect the next animation masterpiece - see it KNOWING it's going to be terrible. It's one of those films that simply has to be experienced to be \"appreciated.\"",

At one point you don't understand who's fighting who. I usually like puns but there were too many shitty food puns e.g. Banana split out of here. Lawrence Kasanoff should be sued for causing brain damage for whoever watched it. He produced it himself probably cause nobody else would. He is a producer-turned director so obviously it was amateurishly made. I heard the music of the french national anthem with different lyrics. usually I hear jokes on the french in Family guy and southpark but the national anthem should be off limits. Let us not blame the actors who only gave their voices. Charlie Sheen has comeback again with 'anger management' and Hillary Duff in 'Younger' so thankfully their careers didn't crash and burn because of this food poisoning movie.

The supermarket transforms into a city, in which all the citizens are personified well-known marketing icons, A.K.A. \"Ikes\". The story opens with the protagonist Dex Dogtective saving kittens before he then tells his friend, Daredevil Dan, that he is about to ask his girlfriend Sunshine Goodness to marry him. However, when Dan attempts to draw a picture of Dex proposing but crashes and Sunshine goes to assist Dan before Dex can propose. Dan returns, but has no idea of what happened to Sunshine.Six months later, Mr. Clipboard, the Brand X representative, arrives at Marketropolis to persuade the owner to stock products made by a large parent company known as Brand X. While there, he crushes some potato chips, which becomes a large topic of discussion with the Ikes. At the Copabanana, Dex's club, Dex talks to the Ike whose chips were stomped, before meeting the Brand X detergent Ike, Lady X. A fight breaks out, forcing Dex to order everybody out of his club. Lady X leaves with Daredevil Dan.Later, back in Dex's home, Lady X drops in on Dex where she attempts to seduce him while using him as an alibi for when they find a group of Ikes dead in the street, which causes their respective products to expire. Dex is asked to investigate but doesn't want to get involved until he finds out Dan is missing. New Brand X products and Ikes quickly replace the destroyed products, which causes Dex to suspect Lady X, who tries to bring him over to her side. He refuses and gets locked into a dryer with Dan to be melted, but they escape. Dan and Dex find out that the secret ingredient in Brand X is addictive and toxic and decide to send for a recall with the owner's computer.They get to the computer find out that Sunshine and the Ugly Prune brand was recalled and the computer gets shut off by a Brand X Ike before they can be sure their recall went through. They decide to fight, and Dex has a plan where everyone puts lightning rods on their buildings while one Ike goes to cut the power while the Brand X Ikes are distracted in a massive food fight. The cut power somehow causes a lighting storm that destroys Brand X buildings because they don't have lightning rods.Dex goes inside a Brand X tower to find that they have Sunshine and are holding her hostage. They escape the building with the help of Dan to see that Mr. Clipboard has entered their world, but it's soon revealed that he was just a robot with Lady X inside (as it was hinted by his stiff and bizarre movements). Lady X reveals that she was the Ugly Prune Ike. She had grown jealous of Sunshine and had them both recalled. She got a make over and was able to make a new brand using Sunshine's essence. Lady X tries to kill Dex, but Sunshine fights Lady X and reverts her back to the Ugly Prune Ike and is taken to the expiration station. They find a cure for the poison, and then Dex and Sunshine get married.This Film Should Have Received a 0% rating on rotten tomatoes! This is the Worst Film Ever Made!",

I don't understand how this movie went wrong because this had an extremely high budget and 10 years of production so should there be an excuse for this movie's failure...? Besides the stolen hard drive, no there shouldn't be as they released this movie so the production isn't important to this review.The animation looks absolutely dreadful, some of the worst I've seen with it's ugly colour scheme, hideous models and bleak environments.The story is where Dex tries to figure out where his love interest is whilst flirting with another woman (who is the main antagonist), not too bad right? Well the characters make really silly decisions and has some of the worst plot twists EVER.The jokes are pretty lame. I'll admit it had a couple of jokes I chuckled at because they were laughably bad but they are mostly a groaner. They are also based on inappropriate content because... kids really get these jokes (sarcasm).The characters are racist stereotypes or just really forgettable. The only character I found kind of funny was Mr Clipboard but everyone else is a stereotype of any sort.I don't even need to say anything, this movie is some of the worst. Whilst I was never nearly as annoyed when watching this as I was with The Reef (2006), this movie has the worst quality for animation along with Where The Dead Go To Die. Again, I find Where The Dead Go To Die worse than this but this is very close. If you want to watch a good animated movie based on food, watch the Cloudy With the Chance Of Meatballs series or hell, EVEN The Veggietales movie but stay away from this one.",

            "content": "Have I ever been more bored in my life? The answer is probably no.Let's kick things off with the production of this film because I think this is pretty necessary. This hopelessness of a film has been in production since 1999, and several different studios have been working on it, if that already tells you that quite a few people have gave up on it what's the point on watching it? That's what some people knew because it only got $75,000 back from a $65,000,000 budget, so obviously it was a flop. \"Foodfight\", was also denounced from taking product placement, which could've got them more money, to make it better! The studio that made this atrocious film also decided to get it out as quickly as possible since some of the characters in the poster weren't in the actual film. GEEZ! Another reason to back this up is that the ending where the main character proposes to his girlfriend is really rushed, this could've been a good scene but it was wasted by the studio who wanted to get it out quickly and get some money, which they didn't do.There were quite a few famous actors in this film such as Charlie Sheen however; one member of the cast shocked me quite a bit: Christopher Lloyd as Mr. Clipboard. His acting in my favorite film ever: Back to the Future was breathtaking and in this he was breathtakingly bad, how can he do this? I believe he should stay with acting because his voice acting was awful. Plus, what kind of name is Mr. Clipboard; it's insulting to say that the creators have no imagination with that name. Charlie Sheen is another fantastic actor, what a disappointment from him. All his lines were dull, even if the writer wrote them like that, he could've put some energy into his lines, unfortunately, he didn't and that's what made crap like this. The final voice actor who baffled me was Hilary Duff, the actor who played Lorraine Baker in Cheaper by the Dozen. She portrayed Sunshine and made the character sound like a 5 year old, this was ridiculous! Judging by this film all of these actors/actress shouldn't be voice acting. On the subject of voice acting in general, it was dull and lifeless it made the whole film drag. During this film, there were a few speeches and somehow they were loathsome, speeches are supposed to get you hyped not bored! If I could use two phrases to sum up this film they would be \"simple and Plain\" and \"It's a trap\", yes a Star Wars quote in this crap, and I hated it! The final thing I'm going to say in this paragraph is about the cheesy one -liners, because it feels like you're having a cringe attack when you hear them, they're so dull and the way they've been said is ghastly.One of the main monstrosities of this film was the animation, Google it now because it looks like it was from a PlayStation 2 game and it was made in 2012! If the production history didn't scare you well the animation will because it's horrendous! Another thing about this film is that it's 100% dull, none of its interesting, if I told my brother to watch this he'll watch about 15 minutes of it and turn it off, it's that boring, I've sat through a few boring movies but this one is the worst. One of the reasons why this film is so boring is because it's really unfunny, I had more laughs out of Superbabies than this, and I think I laughed about once in 90 minutes, that makes me feel depressed. Another reason why this is so boring is the fact that the plot was so basic. I can say it in 9 words: Evil Nazis take over shop, heroes must fight them. That's the plot. I'll let you take some time to realize how poor it is. Atrociously bad. You may be thinking why I said Nazis and I'm going to tell you now; the evil organization is called Brand X and their characters and strategies are a strong resemblance to the Nazis, the evil woman whose name I can't remember is strangely like Hitler because she's good at speeches, has a very good manipulation strategy and back in 1945 Hitler was a handsome bloke apparently, and this evil woman was no exception, she was made to look good. Even her henchmen had slight German accents and were crazy, one of them reminded me of Joseph Goebbels, and not good who ever made this diabolical film. As I mentioned before the \"imaginative\" creators gave some really good names such as: Rex Dogtective! What a lousy and ridiculous name, even I could call the main character something better, for example: Jeff or Buster. You see a dog's name with a detective meaning I am better than these creators, but to be honest, it's not hard. On the same subject, in this \"film\" the lead role becomes a General? Because he starts to formulate plans like a general does but he's a detective? It's a bloody complicated movie in my head. One final reason why this film was bad is because it had really bad sex jokes in it; you may be thinking \"sex jokes in a kid's movie?\" This has been done before and as an example, Shrek has quite a few but not this bad. Again, these jokes make me cringe and question the world. There are a few other reasons why this film is bad but I don't want to milk it. So here's the final paragraph, the conclusion. I believe this film was a waste of time, money and effort. I've already explained why and I just want to get to the next movie because I really can't be bothered talking about this movie. I want to forget about it: 0.6/10.",

I may be 16, but throughout the entire flick I felt disrespected. The animation looked like it had no heart put into it. It's as if the producers were going: \"Screw it. We're gonna put no effort into it because we are lazy and need money for beer.\" The plot was so rushed and there was never a moment for the audience to comprehend what was happening. It feels broken as it's going. It would've been OK if they used certain scenes to get in more story. But instead of doing that, the producers just threw in some filler. Plus they added in puns that wouldn't even make a five year old giggle. Also, was Larry Kassonof...horny or something when he made this? Because this feels so fetish.

The voice cast is actually not too terrible. It's always fun to quote Christoper Lloyd saying \"You must be Leonard!\", but still quite confusing how they even managed to get some of these actors. Charlie Sheen...not so much. The animation...oh, don't even get me started. I can't tell what program they used, but it wasn't good. Maybe Microsoft Kinect. The plot is way too convoluted and they give no explanation of anything, even if it is central to understanding the basic concepts of the movie. Again, I say, DON'T WATCH IT.",

            "content": "Foodfight. Where do I even begin with this masterpiece. Foodfight was a movie that began development in 2003, and released in 2012. After 9 years in development, this movie was worth the wait. The movie stars Charlie Sheen playing a Sherlock Holmes wannabe dog, and Hillary Duff playing an uncanny anthropomorphic cat creature. This is honestly the best combination of things that a movie director could come up with. This movie has many upsides and is offset by 0 downsides, because the movie is perfect.Foodfight is an artistic masterpiece in every way possible. The idea of the movie is ridiculously innovative and has never been done before. In a grocery store, food turns into people, and the shelves all turn into a city. It's quite revolutionary and has never before been seen in the history of film. I bet directors everywhere were kicking themselves both metaphorically and literally for not thinking of this idea. The exterior of this movie even better than the artistic value, however. With top notch animation, and a script that would put Shakespeare to shame, how could this movie not be good. The animators of this movie had the revolutionary idea of using Microsoft Paint to draw the models, and then imported them to iMovie to cut it all together. Of course I don't actually know if that is how they did the animation and editing, but with work that good, it's the only way I can think of that could get such a stunning result. The writing is an absolute marvel for its age. It has a beautiful number of niche jokes that you would see in other masterpieces, such as Shrek, and a bunch of sexual innuendos for those kids to enjoy. This movie teaches all its viewers many important lessons that everyone should know. Some movies teach some really clich\u00e9 lessons that everyone heard a million times, such as treat everyone equal, and you are your own person. Foodfight takes a different approach and teaches its audience that if you are ugly, you lose and don't get what you want. This could be interpreted in many different ways, but they all come around to that conclusion. I feel like this is a very important lesson that everyone should learn at least some time in their life. Throwing all these magnificent pieces together, we get one beautiful work of art. I could say that Foodfight was the best film of 2012, but its far more deserving of that and thus I declare that it deserves film of the century. Foodfight is easily one of the best films ever made, and that is why I am giving it a 2/10.",

Not to mention some of the characters are just nightmare inducing.The writing is like it came from a racist kid's fetish dream. From wildly inappropriate innuendos to stereotypes of almost every ethnicity, but none of it is even funny to the crudest and most immature of people.What's the worst is IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE. The plot switches around so much in it's focus, the jokes don't work on a level that transcends bad to the level of thinking this was a giant joke on humankind, the characters inconsistent and the sheer fact that this movie, a movie about recognizable brand mascots teaming up, take up almost no screen time.

The characters? Ugly, ugly, UGLY. This movie's poor character design is so utterly lazy that it reaches from a level from mediocre to downright horrible! Oh yeah, did I mention that every character in this movie is poker-faced from start to finish throughout film? I mean, they can't make any facial expressions to express any emotion of any type whatsoever, so they have to play charades with their arms. It is that lazily-animated of a movie!As far as to the plot, well..um\u0085sorry! Can't find one. Again, all the many many lame jokes that fell flat on the floor, the poorly-designed characters, and especially all the food brand mascots that were in this movie were so distracting that it hindered the whole conflict of the entire film. It's like watching a fan-made commercial in movie form.Food Fight literally wasted (let me put that in numerals, so get ready to face-palm) $65,000,000, and let me say that it did not go to good graphics. Not one penny went to anything that anyone can expect from a Michael Bay film. The entire budget went to pay for all our beloved famous food brand mascots to be part of some fan-based crossover. A crossover with such poor computer graphics that high school students taking 3D Animation class can create something much better and more enjoyable to watch than Food Fight.Honestly, I feel so sorry for all the actors that had to be in this movie. The fact that it took Kasanoff a whole entire decade to make this monstrosity was already is not worth any penny or any minute he spent on it.

With the exception of a few close-ups of our hero, Dex Dogtective (yes, his actual name is Dex Dogtective), voiced by Charlie Sheen, this movie looks as if it were made using a Kinect.This should be good.... Our movie begins in a grocery store that becomes a city at night and the brands come to life (Oh, hello, Toy Story!). After a few jokes spent early on, we see Dex fighting a criminal called Fat Cat, a RAT with several badly animated goons backing him up. Dex defeats Fat Cat and ends up in a park, I guess, where we get our first glances at Sunshine Goodness (Voiced by Hillary Duff), a cat-girl-thing(?), and Daredevil Dan, a squirrel (Ooh! Chocolate flavor!) voiced by Wayne Brady. I'm getting lazy so let's just sum it all up. Sunshine is kidnapped by Lady X (forgot who she's voiced by) and Dex ends up figuring this out and eventually finds her, who combats Lady X and saves the day with Dex's help. It all ends with: \" Frankly, my dear, I don't give a Spam\".",

None of them serve a point to the story other than the two main leads. The villains are confusing and their plan is just confusing as well. They exist in a store where everything springs to life like some kind of \"Wreck-It Ralph\" world. Plus, consumerism plays a big part in normal life, as well as advertising many different products. If only one brand of food exists in the world, then what good would it be to anyone? It's a failed set up. On top of all that, the animation is just an eyesore. It looks like complete crap.

            "content": "I have seen a lot of films in my life, but I have NEVER seen a film with such sheer genius as foodfight!Pixar and blur studios wish they had animation of this high-quality and detail! After seeing what this movie could have been, after watching the original 2002 trailer after the original movies files were stolen, I'm absolutely thrilled that the director took this much determination to animate the entire film AGAIN, along with adding some newly SpIcY stuff, to give us an even better looking product than what we were originally supposed to get! I couldn't even tell this was done with motion capture with just how fluid and expressive the animation was!The cast and characters are top of the line god tier! Dex Dogtective, I'll say up front, is Charlie Sheen's best performance hands down! Wayne Brady should've at least won an Oscar for best supporting character when playing Dan the big cheeked man, melts in your mouth not in your hand! But the character who really deserves all the love and attention is not Sunshine, not Lady X, and sadly not even Mr. Clipboard, but it all goes straight to the moose, for being THE BEST GODDAMN CHARACTER SINCE JOHN COFFEY FROM THE GREEN MILE!And the writing and directing? I'm gonna say it, it's better than the entire godfather trilogy! M. Night Shyamalan wishes that a twist ending as good as Lady X being the villain the whole time and she kidnapped Sunshine for six months all because she was a better looking ike than her!And I didn't bring this up in my cast and characters category, but Dex Dogtective goes through such a tremendous character arc in this movie so powerful that even the characters in Spielberg and Zemeckis' characters didn't have the time to go through! Whatnot with him going from being ike city's best Dogtective to going through clinical depression all because of his dying love for Sunshine and finally realizing that there's more to life than milk and Sunshine when brand x starts to kill off the markets greatest product place- *cough cough* I mean ike's!In conclusion this movie is a beautiful piece of art that deserves all of the love it's currently getting! Any movie that you know as a masterpiece? All stinky poo poo garbage compared to the chad known as foodfight! If yoy haven't watched it yet? Then get off your fat stinky ass and watch it already! It truly needs to be seen to be believed!",

Among those industries; real estate, fine art, antiquities, construction, and.... film making.This movie was likely used as a vehicle to launder money using falsified production cost figures and licensing transactions.It is the only rational explanation for this abomination.",

            "content": "You know what? I'm just gonna SPOIL EVERYTHING in this movie. I don't care, none of it needs to be kept secret. So here it goes: Dex, voiced by Charlie Sheen, is a dog detective in the supermarket world of Marketropolis Market, when his girlfriend, Sunshine Goodness, played by Hillary Duff, is secretly kidnapped by Lady X, played by Eva Longoria. So some random crap happens in between, like Eva making for some not PG scenes, some crap about Dex carelessly murdering innocent Ikes, and a chocolate addicted bat who reminds me of Count Chocula as a bat played by Larry Miller. Also there is a terrifying weasel played by director Lawrence Kasanoff. So that is pretty much as much as I could take of the plot. 2/10.",

And now I still hate every second of this.Plot is as bland as you can get Stop invaders defend stuff with everyone in blah blah blah.Characters are awful and stereotypic. Dex is just your normal main badass one-liner character. Sunshine is just the kidnap girl who shows up only in the first and last 15mins. Other ad mascots are what you get when you try to model them out of pure memories with the apps that you are worst in.Jokes are horrible and not funny at all and the only joke I laughed at is just simply because this movie got in theaters and people paid their tickets to see this.All in all, it's a stupid scam like cash grab of a movie that makes just as weird as when you bit something crunchy in your cake desserts.",
