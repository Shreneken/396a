            "content": "Despite not being an auto racing fan, the stories of the rivalry between James Hunt and Niki Lauda and Lauda's accident are well known and on research was big news in the 70s. 'Rush' did seem intriguing, Ron Howard has done some good work in the past and my sister and her boyfriend absolutely raving about it. However having no knowledge of auto racing and having never found it my cup of tea there was a touch of intrepidation. As well as the worry as to whether there was going to be any bias and whether it was going to stray from the facts. After watching 'Rush', this viewer is so glad that she gave it a chance because it was a gripping and entertaining film from start to finish, and quite easily Howard's best work in some time.Some occasional rushed pacing and some weak dialogue, that lacked flow, sounded awkward and stuck out like a sore thumb against everything else that was done to such a professional level, were the only drawbacks to overall one of 2013's better films. The time period is very evocatively depicted, there is a real sense of time and place, there is wonderful vibrant colour throughout, the editing is slick, clever and gives the race scenes the thrills they need and the photography is similarly audaciously slick and like the cinematographer was part of the action itself, especially good in the climactic Japanese race sequence. Hans Zimmer's score is not his best work by all means, but it went with the racing theme remarkably well and does capture the mid-70s time period and the atmosphere of the sport to such great effect (again the final race in Japan stood out). The sound effects also help, having a real authenticity.For a film about auto racing, one does have to talk about how 'Rush' deals with the race sequences. The good news is that they are absolutely thrilling and keeps one to the edge of their seat, while all of them are brilliantly done, showing how glamorous and also dangerous the sport is (not many sports films I've seen have properly and fully captured the spirit of the sport it's portraying in the way Rush did) the highlight is the climactic Japanese race, which was both exhilarating and moving (masterful if having to sum it up in one word). Howard not only depicts the mid- 70s as if the viewer were transported back in time and part of the period (such was the evocativeness of the atmosphere) and adopts a visual style that never looks cheap and as said like the cinematographer was there part of the action, but he shows here that he knows how to tell a story. The storytelling is always compelling, thoughtful, informative and thrilling with a surprising amount of emotional impact, found myself really identifying with Lauda.The film is faithful to the facts, the rivalry between Hunt and Lauda is genuinely engaging and are shown a lot of respect and dimension here. Neirher Hunt or Lauda are one-dimensional here and, although Lauda is the more sympathetically drawn of the two, one does not takes sides with one or the other. It also is tightly paced and assured, never getting bogged down in too much back story, too much soap- opera, too much sentimentality or technical jargon/minutiae (that would likely have gone over the heads of first-time viewers or non-fans of the sport). All the supporting performances are well-done, though some with not much to do, with Olivia Wilde and Christian McKay faring the strongest. It is however the two leads that carry 'Rush' cast wise, both of them as close to perfect as one can get. Daniel Br\u00fchl gives Niki Lauda a real brooding intensity and genuine poignancy, making it very easy to feel sorry for him, while swaggering Chris Hemsworth has never been better as Hunt.All in all, a gripping and hugely entertaining film. Has its imperfections but they are far outweighed by the number of things 'Rush' does right. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

            "content": "In 1976, the rivalry between two brilliant racing car drivers, the British James Hunt and the Austrian Nikki Lauda, came to a head in the almost literally life-and-death struggle of the Formula One championship. American director Ron Howard (\"Apollo 13\", \"A Beautiful Mind\", \"Frost/Nixon\") and British scriptwriter Peter Morgan (both play and screenplay of \"Frost/Nixon\") have done a terrific job bringing the titanic struggle to the big screen, aided by some excellent casting and powerful sound and cinematography. Those were the days when most years a couple of drivers would be killed, so the stakes could not be higher.Sensibly the car racing does not over-dominate, since this is essentially a character- driven conflict, but when the racing is on screen - notably in the final race - the excitement is visceral. The Australian Chris Hemsworth (previously best known as \"Thor\") and the Spanish-born German Daniel Br\u00fchl (\"Inglourious Basterds\") are so good as the British and Austrian drivers respectively that the dialect coaches should receive a special commendation. Arguably Br\u00fchl gives the stronger performance which should auger well for his future career.A great strength of this tale is that there is not a hero or a villain. Both drivers had privileged backgrounds and were superbly talented, but both were flawed. although in very contrasting ways, including styles of thinking, driving and womanising (Olivia Wilde as model Suzy Miller and Alexandra Maria Lara as aristocratic Marlene Knaus respectively).I never saw the recent film \"Senna\" (2010) so \"Rush\" reminded me most of the much older \"Grand Prix\" (1966), but what is stunning about \"Rush\" is that it all happened. A season of the fastest sport in the world decided in the last race by one point - you couldn't make it up. Rush to see the movie.",

            "review_title": "Thrilling character study",
            "content": "As Asif Kapadia's gripping and extremely moving 2010 documentary Senna  proved, cinema audiences have a thirst for the larger-than-life  characters that inhabit the Formula One track. The sport itself is  frightfully dull (although I'm sure plenty will disagree with that),  but the sportsmen willing to lay down their life for a kick and a  trophy are infinitely more fascinating, especially in the days of lax  safety rules. The sport nowadays is little more than advertising on  wheels, but when the likes of James Hunt and Niki Lauda battled it out  on the track, epic rivalries were created, and no matter how talented  these men were at driving these \"coffins on wheels\", every race could  spell out death.  Rush portrays the clash of two opposing personalities. The long-haired,  dashing Englishman James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) was all about the  adrenaline, embracing the post-race parties and lying with the many  women that would throw themselves at him. He was reckless, willing to  risk his life and others in order to win, but, as described in the  film, there was no better driver in the world in terms of raw talent.  His rival, Austrian Niki Lauda (Daniel Bruhl), was focused, clinical,  and even helped design the cars he would drive. He was the early-night  type, 'rat-faced' and cold. In every sense, he's the perfect villain.  But where Rush succeeds the most is challenging our early conceptions  of these two characters. There's little fun to be had with Lauda, but  played by Bruhl, he evolves into the underdog of the movie, perhaps the  only one that actually gives a damn about his own life and the life of  his opponents. This, naturally, leads to tragedy and a particularly  wince-inducing scene in which Lauda requires having his lungs vacuumed,  but it's at this point that we realise just what these two drivers mean  to each other. As Lauda watches Hunt claw back some points in the 1976  Formula One season, it becomes clear that these two need each other to  survive. Their hatred of one another only serves to fuel the flames,  and leads to Lauda's defiant early return to the driver's seat, scarred  and bandaged.  Fast cars, beautiful women and exotic locations hardly sounds like a  recognisable workload for Ron Howard, one of the most play-it-easy  directors out there. His past films have been unjustifiably successful,  critically and commercially, never stamping a recognisable directorial  trait onto his work. Yet here, although the bright sheen of the 70's  initially takes some getting used to, he has managed to create a world  that is very much alive, using snappy editing, a pumping soundtrack and  some growing sound design to re-create this world for petrol-heads. But  he doesn't neglect his characters, and evokes the great work done on  Frost/Nixon (2008), which was also a study of two giant, clashing  personalities coming together on the world stage.  Rush is an exhilarating experience, able to distinguish each race from  the next and literally putting us in the driver's seat with the use of  digital cameras. Although it occasionally drifts into formulaic  territory with the introduction of the 'wives' (played by Oivia Wilde  and Alexandra Maria Lara, respectively), Howard cleverly uses this as  an insight into Hunt and Lauda's personalities. Hemsworth is very good  in his first 'proper' post-Thor role, but it is Bruhl that you take  away from the film. How he gets you to initially loath him, only to be  cheering him on at the climax is the work of a great actor, and it's a  crime that he has been snubbed by the Academy this year. Hopefully this  will inspire a host of decent sports movies, as Rush proves that you  can mix character study and even existential musings with the thrill of  sport.",

One of the most intense films I have watched in a very long time with gripping performances from Hemsworth and Br\u00fchl! An extremely clever script from Peter Morgan in which he doesn't pick sides, but instead allows the audience to view these characters in their own light.I am a huge fan of F1 so when viewing a film relating to that sport it would be questionable that there are some anachronisms or minor problems. But no! There was not a single fault with this film, it is the most realistic sports film I have viewed! A film that portrays the rivalry between the British and Austrian world champions and the fateful crash. With some powerful dialogue from Lauda and Hunt.Even if you aren't a fan of F1, the intense action and no-holds adrenaline should keep you entertained from start to finish. With a great sway of emotions from melancholy to ecstatic! This film deserves the acclaimed reviews it has been receiving.",

I can't recommend it highly enough for F1 fans like me, sports fans, or anyone interested in a story of rivalry i.e. something different to the unoriginal junk movies which get churned out each year.All the crew involved should pat themselves on the back. They've done a fabulous job making this film critique, explore and honour two memorable F1 drivers.James Hunt's fun, party lifestyle along with his brash and raw driving talent. This is contrasted against Niki Lauda's methodical thinking, technical brilliance and professional lifestyle. These two characters are total opposites but as their lives are explored it also acknowledges the value of an enemy, i.e. something to beat. I believe this is a commentary on human nature in that the best of us shines when we have something to beat or overcome.Do yourself a favour and see it now.",

He's turned into a lesser version of Steven Spielberg -- his films are just as maudlin and emotionally manipulative, but they lack Spielberg's technical panache.However, the great reviews of \"Rush\" and the awards attention that swirled briefly around Daniel Bruhl got my butt in the seat for it, and I was surprised by actually liking it. It's a lean, mean telling of the intense rivalry between race car drivers James Hunt and Niki Lauda. You don't need to care much about race car driving (I certainly don't) to enjoy the story, particularly that of Lauda, who overcame a devastating accident to return to the track. Bruhl is as good as everyone said he was at the time, and Chris Hemsworth, as Hunt, is serviceable if nothing special. This is still a Ron Howard film, so don't expect it to push any boundaries, but it's much more technically daring than anything else he's made, the cinematography and editing putting the audience in the driver's seat more than once.Grade: A-",

While my score of 7.0 is slightly less than the current 8.3, I was glad I saw this film.I was surprised because I thought the film would be very much like the classic race films \"Le Mans\" and \"Grand Prix\"--two 1960s films about Formula 1 racing. However, it was very different. These older films focused on the driving itself--and both had amazing camera-work. Additionally, the films seemed much like watching the races yourself (particularly \"Le Mans\"). However, both films were a bit light on plot. \"Rush\", on the other hand, had surprisingly little (and slightly underwhelming) race scenes--mostly because this was NOT the focus of the movie. Instead, it was more of a character study of the two drivers, Niki Lauda and James Hunt. How the men were similar and how they were significantly different is the focus of the film.The acting was very good and the film engaging. I could say more but, frankly, the film's been out for some time and it already has more than 350 reviews, so I'll just wrap it up now.PLEASE NOTE: The scenes after the 'big crash' are very hard to watch--particularly those in the hospital. This along with the crudeness of the language and brief nudity make this a film you might not want to show to your kids.",

            "content": "Really. His performance in Rush came as a huge surprise. This is his best performance by quite some margin, a role which he plays with a great deal of maturity and respect. He plays Hunt with just the right level of arrogance, cockiness, confidence and audacity to convince you that he was real life 70's playboy James Hunt, a man destined to live fast and die young.Bruhl is superb as Niki too. It's a role that he deserves much recognition for, particularly his accent and mannerisms. Lauda was one of the first of a new generation of professional driver, driving the old playboy characters out of the sport and Bruhl nails this icy determination to succeed magnificently. A particular nod goes to Christian McKay's portrayal as the slightly eccentric, petrol head extraordinaire, ever so aristocratic but hopelessly financially incompetent Lord Hesketh. The camera work is spectacular, none less so than with some very creative angles of the beautifully filmed on track action. The brief in-helmet camera shots are inspired, giving you a glimpse of the drivers world. CGI work will be spotted by the keen eyed, but you have to consider that without it that there are certain scenes involving priceless period machinery (the sound of a Cosworth DFV firing up and filling the cinema was worth the ticket price alone) that would be just impossible to film as accurately as they were depicted here with real machinery. As a result, they are able to use the CGI sparingly and to good effect.The main facts of the 1976 season are on the whole handled very accurately. Certainly, some liberties are taken with poetic licence, but this is still a scripted film and not a documentary. The factually heavy writing of the script along with beautifully filmed and liberal use of period machinery being recorded at pace on real asphalt will be enough to keep the fans of the sport well represented.It's a gripping telling of the 1976 Formula 1 season, which whilst not sharing the same shear spectacle of Howard's other 'too unbelievable to be true' film Apollo 13, Rush tells a story which would be just too unbelievable in terms of human bravery and personal destiny for any fictional story to be given credence. It's a tale which will be enough to hold the unfamiliar or casual viewer's attention with a steel firm grip to see how the different personalities handle the pressures of life both on and off the track and how rising to the top takes it's tole on these two polar opposite real life gladiators of the race track.With the lead actors clearly committed to giving their best performances yet and a tastefully handled script, Ron Howard delivers a visually impressive account of events that may well become one of his most respected directorial efforts yet.10/10",

            "content": "The film is just over 2 hours long, but when it was over it seemed like I had been in the cinema about 30 minutes. The film centres on the battle for the 1976 Formula 1 World Championship, and the rivalry between the Austrian \"professor\" Nikki Lauda and the British playboy James Hunt. The two are depicted as enemies, but in actual fact they were good friends who trusted and respected each other on, as well as off-track. This bit of artistic licence does not spoil the film and is reasonable in order to make the battle between the two for the F1 crown more intense. The film is nicely paced. We are introduced to both characters through their own narrative and scenes that leave the watcher in no doubt as to their background and philosophy on life. The two are first seen in competition in 1970 at a Formula 3 race at Crystal Palace (where they have a coming together) and sets the scene for the rivalry throughout the film. I'm not sure if this is further artistic licence. The two definitely did race each other in F3, but I am not convinced as to whether this actual incident occurred. After that we are given a whistle stop journey between 1973 (when Hunt came into F1) to 1975. We are shown the dangerous nature of F1 at the time with the Francois Cevert accident at Watkins Glen in gory detail \u2013 although this does not seem like gratuitous, but necessary to bring home just how unforgiving the sport was back then \u2013 and it truly was (of the top 12 points scorers in 1976, F1 cars were to claim 3, 1 ended up in a wheelchair and 1 had his career ended by a leg crunching crash). We are then taken to 1976 and that titanic struggle for the World Crown. Only one real issue here \u2013 the British Grand Prix result, but I suspect this was simplified in the interests of time. The casting is superb. Chris Hemsworth, an Aussie, does an excellent job on public schoolboy James Hunt, while Daniel Bruhl both sounds and looks frighteningly like the Austrian. There is little room for a supporting cast amongst the drivers which is a shame \u2013 only Clay Regazzoni has a part of any real substance. Peterson, Watson, Depailler, Scheckter, Andretti et al could have featured a little more I think. What did their contemporaries think of the two protagonists? The supporting cast is mainly required for Hunt \u2013 Lord Hesketh, \"Bubbles\" Horsley and Teddy Mayer / Tyler Alexander of McLaren, while the Ferrari team principals are rarely seen. The love angle is perfectly catered for by Olivia Wilde (Hunt's first wife Suzy) and the gorgeous Alexandra Maria Lara - of Downfall fame \u2013 as the future Marlene Lauda. Both give quality performances. The attention to detail is superb. Although the tracks are not the actual ones (for understandable reasons) the cars, the helmets, the sponsors are all authentic. The film \"feels\" like it's happening in the 70's. For anyone interested in great personal stories, F1, the 70's, cars or just like to see a great film, then Rush is for you.",

            "content": "Originally I planned on not watching \"Rush\" at the theater, simply because I lost interest into Formula 1 considerably since the Schumacher years. However, finally curiosity got the better of me and I decided to give it a go. Which proved a pretty great choice as Ron Howard's latest movie makes for a very entertaining two hours. I was vaguely aware of the year season 1976, the developments and outcome of the driver championship and Lauda's spectacular crash of course as you get pretty much reminded here every second weekend when you see him being the co-host of current Formula One coverage. Putting Daniel Br\u00fchl into perspective to what I see there, I think he nailed Lauda's character and his very own Viennese charm. Of course, it's different to compare with Lauda now being roughly 35 years older than in the movie and I was not even born the year Lauda ended his career, but I think he made a good job in portraying him. Aside from all comparisons to what Lauda was really like, he definitely created an interesting character that had your eyes glued to the screen during every scene he was in. It's not surprising Br\u00fchl is in talks for his first Oscar nomination and it's nice to see him back so strongly, after I was a bit disappointed by his work in recent years, especially in \"Inglourious Basterds\" where his performance wouldn't make my top5 of the film despite having a pretty interesting character.While Br\u00fchl kinda sways between lead and supporting territory, the movie's clear lead is Chris Hemsworth as Lauda's equally talented competitor James Hunt. In fact, he is around 5 years younger than Br\u00fchl, but his character is slightly older. I believe Hemsworth made a couple smart career choices recently and, after thoroughly enjoying the first Thor movie, I'm pretty curious about the second, which comes out soon. His character here is a bon vivant who loves drinks, ladies and the sweet life, the polar opposite to Lauda's stubborn lone wolf. And these exact opposites are the basis of the film, the reason why it works so well as an intriguing character study of two extremes clashing. Their personalities also reflect directly on the women with them. While Olivia Wilde as Hunt's wife disappears almost as quickly as she entered the picture, Alexandra Maria Lara as Lauda's wife stays there till the end and we see a good portrayal from her as somebody who's attracted to the danger (their first meeting in the civilian's car), but at the same time constantly worried about her husband's well-being and powerless as she can do nothing but hope for the best.All in all, I recommend this film a lot. Really, you don't have to know anything about Formula One or racing in general in order to enjoy it for being a great character study. I haven't seen a full race either in maybe a bit less than ten years and it still felt like a compelling watch. The motorsports circus is really just the stage for the two protagonists and except very close to the end there's not that much racing action included anyway. And when there is, it always comes with an impact on the relationship between the two. But even if it's just the stage, all the scenes at the race tracks were executed very convincingly and I never thought that it's all just make-believe. They also managed to convey the aura of the Formula One from the 1970s that has sadly lost a lot of its charm by now. Howard knew that he had to make a film that appeals to the masses and Formula 1, compared to NASCAR, Indy 500 etc., has never been a sport that created too much interest in North America, which is why you don't really find American drivers participating that often either. He managed very nicely and it's a great example of a rivalry that pushed each of the rivals to the limit, often in a good way, and occasionally beyond. What I also liked about it is that it definitely ends on a positive note, possibly with the best scene of the movie with Hunt and Lauda meeting at the hangar, which sums up their relationship perfectly. Subtle criticism for the other's lifestyle, occasional mindgames, but also respect. It's always nice to go out in style as we usually tend to remember the ending more than everything that was before and, if badly executed, it can hurt the film's overall perception a lot. Not so here. Very well done as almost the entire rest of the movie. With this character clash, screenwriter Peter Morgan succeeds at least as much as with the one in Frost/Nixon.",

The presence of Ron Howard's and Chris Hemsworth's names above the title may put some bums on seats but the fact of it being a film about motor racing will undoubtedly ostracize some potential viewers.So stop right there. Rush is not a movie about motor racing for speed fans any more than Titanic was about sailing for merchant seamen. Rush is a superbly shot, directed, edited and performed film that transcends the sport of motor racing, just as the principal protagonists themselves did almost forty years ago.The rivalry between F1 drivers James Hunt (Hemsworth) and Niki Lauda (Daniel Br\u00fchl) is common knowledge.

By the end you may still not want to be an F1 driver or even watch a grand prix, but you sure as hell will wish you could have been there for at least some of the 70s.Howard has provided us with a mixed bag of films over the years with schmaltzy, flicks (A Beautiful Mind), thoughtful biopics (Frost/Nixon), compelling dramas (Apollo 13) and utter twaddle (Angels and Demons). So which category would Rush fall into? The tension Howard creates is ridiculous. Pistons pump, colours blur, the scream of engines deafen us. The editing is so tight it feels as though something will snap. The anticipation prickles the skin and, though we already know what and when, it is almost too much for us to watch it unfold. Technically, Rush verges on exquisite. The digital creation blends flawlessly with the live action and the skids, tumbles, crashes and explosions are horrifying.But it isn't just with the speed and madness around the track where Howard guides perfectly. The hospital scenes when Lauda is treated are almost grotesque. We find ourselves shying away from the visuals, involuntarily grimacing at Lauda's agony even when he demands more pain in order to drive him towards recovery and revenge.Rush boasts one of the finest film scores of the year so far with Hans Zimmer proving why he is among the busiest composers in Hollywood. It's not that the score that makes the film, but it enhances it beautifully, adding emotional colour to the startling visuals to magnify the tension.The joint leads are on impeccable form. Hemsworth portrays Hunt as the playboy we wish we could be (or bed) and his charisma doesn't ooze, it gushes. He is arrogant, cocksure, charming and handsome. He makes it obvious why men wanted Hunt's life and so many women welcomed him into theirs. It is a confident, full performance from Hemsworth that marks him out yet again as an actor with a certain chameleon-like quality and undeniable star power. Immediately we like Hunt but as 123 minutes rush by, he evolves into a flawed man we admire but ultimately decide we don't really want to be and, in some ways, pity. It's a fine performance that engages us on every level.When Br\u00fchl's (The Edukators, Inglorious Basterds) Lauda strides onto the screen, it is with purpose, his Austrian directness and confidence taken as conceit and arrogance. He does not suffer fools (or almost anyone else) whether they are subordinates, rivals or the men paying for his drive. Supremely confident to the exclusion of social niceties, the Lauda we observe puts our backs up immediately but, just as the Hunt on screen evolves, so, too, does Lauda and by the film's end our allegiance has wavered. It is a sensitive performance from Br\u00fchl and his understanding of the man he portrays and clear admiration for him infects us thoroughly.Some of the dialogue is lumpy, there are numerous liberties taken with the truth (though not to the extent that U571 completely rewrote history!) and much is glossed over. Howard has perhaps tried too hard to appeal to a mass audience by focusing on the principal women in the drivers' lives, notably Hunt's wife, Suzy (Olivia Wilde) and Br\u00fchl's, Marlene (Alexandra Maria Lara). In Marlene's case, she is relatively impactful on her husband's life, suffering through his accident with him. In Suzy's case, however, though she was influential on a period of Hunt's career, it is difficult to see her as anything other than a bystander in his life and yet Howard sees fit to return to her though she is far from his thoughts.These are minor quibbles that make Rush a very good film instead of a 'great'. Nevertheless, my companion for the film who has no interest in motor racing and less knowledge gave a simple summary: \"Excellent.\" Me? I'm a fair weather F1 fan. If there is a realistic hope of Button, Hamilton and Di Resta winning or there's been enough hype, I'm there. Otherwise it's Formula what? But, as I wrote, Rush transcends the sport. I was gripped throughout, I gritted my teeth, I gasped, clenched my buttocks and willed the drivers to the finish, on the track, in the hospital and in life.For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.",

            "content": "Niki Lauder is among the most well known personalities in the history of Formula One. Even today millions of Germans watch his TV presentation at every race. We know his manner and speech extremely well and any actor portraying him faces an uphill if not impossible task. But Daniel Bruhl delivers a performance so wonderfully convincing in his faithful and profound portrayal that he should clearly be among the Oscar nominees for Best Actor. The story of Lauda's famous struggle with Hunt in 1976 has become the stuff of legends. And perhaps this production has used some artistic license to enhance them. But the film isn't really about the thrilling story of those events. That's just the vehicle for a much deeper drama examining the ever relevant dialectic between hedonism and pragmatism. It's about the self beneath the skin rather than the glamor of the surface: a concept normally quite alien to the Oscar awarding Hollywood elite. So poor Daniel Bruhl must await another vehicle to display his superb talents. And one day he might be remembered internationally in his career as Niki was himself.",

            "content": "I liked this film a lot more than I would have anticipated. Sure I knew going in that the two main leads were both brilliant actors - Hemsworth especially has become a recent favourite of mine - but they both exceeded my wildest expectations. They became James Hunt (Hemsworth) and Niki Lauda (Daniel Br\u00fchl), down to the smallest of detail, the most delicate of nuance. The 1976 racing season was before my time, but even though I'm just a casual Formula 1 fan, I had heard about it and I knew who these two were. They were such large characters, such giants in their chosen field, that had this film not captured them perfectly, it wouldn't have been half as good as it is now. Luckily Howard's directing and the performances of these two are some of the finest I've seen in a long time.I also really like the fact that Rush is more than just a sports film about racing. It's a character study about two masters of their craft, embedded in deep rivalry. Both of them know that they stand unopposed, except for that one man, who's their polar opposite in both personality and driving style, yet who is just as capable. That's a great setting for a movie and Rush beautifully explores the possibilities given to it. You buy the rivalry and by the time of the final race I found myself at the edge of my seat, even though I already knew the outcome.It's also great how the movie never takes sides. It's not a film about Niki Lauda - even though he was involved in its making - nor is it about James Hunt. It's about them both and about the sport as a whole.To sum it up, I'd say this is the best sports movie I've seen in my life. But it's that because it's more than a simple example of its genre. It's a brilliant character study, an interesting period piece, a gripping drama and yes, at its core, a film with furiously fast cars. Highly recommended.",

            "content": "The true story of the rivalry between F1 drivers James Hunt and Niki Lauda and the 1976 Formula One season is one of those stories where true life is more extraordinary then fiction. Fortunately two men with great experience at adapting true life stories, Ron Howard and Peter Morgan, have taken this project on, giving us a movie that is about a clash of ideals and personalities as well as about the drive of motor sports.James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) and Niki Lauda (Daniel Br\u00fchl) are racing drivers with different approaches and philosophies whose rivalry starts in Formula Three racing. Hunt is a good looking playboy who enjoys drinking, partying and sex and has charisma to boot. Lauda is a serious minded, extremely determined, technically astute and is able to get the most out of a car, but is a cold, distant man who drives people away. Soon the men's rivalry see them battling it out in Formula One leading to the 1976 season where back-stabbing, danger and disaster affects the sport.As a sports movie Rush is a very well made and entertaining film that focuses on its characters ideals and differences. Hemsworth and Br\u00fchl are in top form as they play these very different men. Lauda is a self- determined man who is willing to risk everything to get into F1, but easily rubs people the wrong way, whilst Hunt had a greater support network, media friendly but is a loose cannon. Both end up becoming each other's hubris as they take bigger risks in a sport that already dangerous.As well as the focus of their profession, Rush looks at the personal lifestyles of the two drivers, particularly Hunt's as he womanizes as Lauda settles down with a woman. Hunt is a thrill seeker who uses pure talent whilst Lauda is aware of the risks of his profession, but does not want to add to them.To anyone who knows about Niki Lauda is he suffers a tragedy and the easy route would have been to make Rocky style picture about someone overcoming adversity. Fortunately, Howard and Morgan made something more interesting by showing both men to be faulted, that Lauda is not a man who is easy to like, making personal digs against and being a very sore loser.At a running of two hours, three minutes, Rush moves along at a very brisk pace. The first 40 to 45 minutes focuses on a six year period as the rivalry builds up. Many story elements are dealt with quickly. A great example of this is when Hunt meets model Suzy Miller (Olivia Wilde, who does an impressive English accent) in the team garages and the next scene is them getting married. Rush is a movie that tackles many story elements with broad brushstrokes. It does seem like a longer cut may exist.Even though the film is called Rush, Howard and Morgan build up to the racing segments. We get a F3 race near the beginning and then we have a long wait the F1 races. Howard and Morgan focus on three main races in the 1976 season, N\u00fcrburgring, Germany, Monza, Italy and Fuji, Japan. Howard shows his technical acumen with the racing sequences, as we get up close to the action on screen with camera being place many on the parts of the cars, in the driving seat and even in the engine and in the air gun during a tyre change. There are intense, exciting sequences as Howard uses stylistic flashes and slo-mo as we see how dangerous races were in the 70s. Morgan also uses a similar montage trick he used in The Damned United to quickly build a picture of the '76 season with Howard using title cards to the sequence a bit of flash.The story about James Hunt or Niki Lauda could have made for a compelling movie on their own terms, but Howard and Morgan give us two films in one. Rush is a very well-made, engaging and compelling sports flick that is character driven and is about the build-up as well as the racing.Please visit www.entertainmentfuse.com",

            "content": "This is a Ron Howard film of a predominantly true telling of the 1976 year of Formula One racing. Featured are the world champion from 1975, Austrian Niki Lauda, and his rival Brit James Hunt, seeking the world championship. Lauda and Hunt were quite opposites, the Austrian the focused, precise, calculating racer. It was a profession he was very good at. The Brit a flamboyant risk-taker, a womanizer who enjoyed a good drunk after a victory, and who nervously vomited before a big race.The actors chosen are excellent, with costuming and makeup resembling the real racers quite closely. The Aussie Chris Hemsworth puts on his best British accent as James Hunt, and Daniel Br\u00fchl (full name ' Daniel C\u00e9sar Mart\u00edn Br\u00fchl Gonz\u00e1lez Domingo ') is authentic as Niki Lauda.This is much more than a telling of the racing season. In the hands of director Ron Howard we are treated to selective slow motion and stop action, and even POV shots of the racing engine's intake and exhaust valves at work from inside the combustion chamber. In slow motion, of course!Surely some archival footage was used, but they recreated certain racing situations very realistically. Overall the cinematography (shot digitally) and the sound track are superb. A very enjoyable movie, of two fierce competitors who gained deep respect for each other, in spite of their attempts to bury each other on the track.Their spouses were capably played by Olivia Wilde as Suzy Miller Hunt and Alexandra Maria Lara as Marlene Lauda. Of note, Hunt died at a relatively young age of 45, but Lauda is still going strong in his 60s, as an aviation entrepreneur.June 2019 edit: Lauda died recently so I took the opportunity to watch this again. I enjoyed it almost as much now, 5 years after my first viewing.",

The main set pieces of the film set a year before I was born in 1976, so mainly my knowledge was based on my Fathers recollection of the events. I'd seen James Hunt in interviews and recently watched footage with Niki Lauda so got an idea of the characters.The film is bang on in period, cars fashion and sets the tone excellently, the cinematography is nothing short of breathtaking and the fx are very much in keeping with the period, no ridiculous CGI.The acting, on the whole is nothing short of miraculous, Hemsworth and Bruhl are fantastic, particularly Hemsworth, who's accent, mannerisms and natural acting was a big surprise. I could see a few awards for this role. I have seen Bruhl in quite a few films and I am always impressed so this just continues the trend. All the support actors are very good in smaller roles.The film is well paced for 2 hours and quite graphic, particularly a few accident scenes.Direction: Ron Howard - nice job, I'm not a massive fan and particularly after the da vinci/Angels fiasco's a big return to decent form. The flair was there but played safe (As normal) but let the story and the actors take centre stage.If you like History in F1, a well documented rivalry and a film that capture this, watch it. It is similar to the excellent Control, Moneyball etc but with a bit of heart.8 1/2 out of 10",

Hemsworths presentation of James Hunt is uncanny it's like a documentary he's almost as good as Daniel Day-Lewis in Lincoln.If your not a F1 fan or from the 70's it may not be more than a blokes film, but give it a go it is going to end up being a important as Apollo 13 in the life of Mr Howard and quite frankly is by far the best car racing movie ever",

The racing action is exciting. The 70s style looks good. I love all the cars. Everybody is great in this. I do have two minor problems. I hate most narrations and this is no exception. It is good for exposition but mostly takes the audience out of the movie. However a narration from the real Niki Lauda at the end would be great.The other problem is more basic. The movie follows both drivers equally. Although it's filled with details from both men, it's not as easy to fully commit to either men. A more traditional structure would follow one protagonist and it would be a more compelling story. My personal preference would be to follow Hunt up to the N\u00fcrburgring Nordschleife race. Then they could go back to Niki Lauda's story from the beginning showing the other side of the story all the way to the end. That way it would minimize the back and forth and maximize the rooting interest. Nevertheless this is a very solid thrilling movie. It's compelling and well worth the praise that it gets.",

            "content": "Formula One racing isn't a sport that I watch regularly but I certainly respect it more than its competing leagues. The tracks are complex, the opportunities to pass are limited and the pit stops must be carefully timed. But this movie isn't current F1 racing, this movie largely takes place in the late 1960s till the mid 1970s where it was far more dangerous and that much more invigorating because of it. We get a classic storyline of two rivals with two very different styles, they had to respect each other due to the sheer magnificence of their driving.There are so many things that I want to praise this movie for. I guess I'll start with how thrilling the world of 1970s Formula One is. The cinematography, the sound effects and the camera angles make this as close to a racing experience as you can imagine. I literally felt like I was in one of the cars racing and I haven't had a theatre experience like that in a while. It was like being on a roller coaster, I got caught up in the \"Rush\" so to speak. The racing sequences are exciting, and the movie does a great job reminding you of how dangerous the sport is. One of the taglines for the film is \"more powerful than the fear of death is the will to win\" I couldn't agree more. People are decapitated, ripped apart, cars burst into flames, this is not a sport for the weak hearted. The movie is involving, white-knuckle tense and I couldn't turn away for even a moment.Perhaps the biggest credit to Rush is how balanced and even the story is between the two main characters. Neither man is a hero, they both are arrogant jerks who are only interested in their own success. Lauda is cold, calculating, pompous but he has the wit and the skill to back up his big talk. Hunt on the other hand is like the handsome jock you knew in school. He is just as cocky, determined and unlikeable as Lauda but has the drive to win and the silver tongue to gain acceptance from the racing community. The movie does a great job showing you the virtues and faults of both men and amazingly enough you want both to come out on top. A good comparison on how well layered and how well balanced the characters are would be Warrior, another favourite of mine. It's a feat in storytelling and they pull it off perfectly here.The acting in the movie is superb to say the least. Both leading actors give excellent nuanced performances that would be worthy of Oscar consideration. Chris Hemsworth seems like a logical choice for the charismatic and determined Hunt. Detractors from this movie claim that it's another typical Hemsworth performance, but I was really surprised with how effective he was at portraying the gauntlet of emotions that Hunt goes through. He has a ton of natural screen presence, but this movie shows he's got real leading man skills (outside of Thor) If I was forced to pick between them though, I would credit Daniel Bruhl with the best performance. I've only seen him in Inglorious Basterds but in this movie he does a flawless accent and has so many levels to his acting job as Lauda. You believe he is Lauda and he's just so wonderfully unlikeable, I would give him the Best Supporting Actor Oscar. Lauda is a complex man with a strict code and due to Bruhlh's performance he's captivating.I've talked about the dual leads enough but another pleasant surprise about this movie is that it features some strong female characters. Olivia Wilde is only in the movie for a short period of time but she's good. Olivia is more known for her amazing good looks but she's a better actress than she's given credit for and has done some good work (House, Deadfall etc.). She's talented and she makes the most of her screen time. I also really enjoyed the performance of Alexandra Maria Lara as Marlene who is the woman who eventually marries Niki. She's feisty and she's a good match for Niki. She's strong, beautiful and she plays a critical role in shaping where Niki heads in the course of the movie. With a cast that lacks proven Oscar contenders, the acting is Oscar calibre and is one more firing piston in the proverbial engine that is this movie.Much like any classic, the movie runs the gauntlet of emotions so well. This movie was sold to audiences through the trailers as an action/sports movie but it's more of a drama with some solid action scenes in it. I've gone on about how much it involves the audience in its plot but what I haven't mentioned is how tense and thrilling the end is. Its lean back in your seat and hold your breath type nerve wracking. The movie has its comedic moments as well, largely thanks to Hemsworth's charm and timing. The movie touches all the bases, making you want to cheer your favourite racer when they cross the finish line first and then drop your jaw in awe when they risk it all, almost killing themselves in the process.Rush had all the action you could want but turned out to be a superbly crafted drama. It's a beautiful movie with some Oscar calibre acting and wonderfully stylish moments. It's my favourite movie of 2013 and it's one of the bigger pleasant surprises I've ever seen in a theatre. I'm giving Rush a 9.5/10 rounding up to a 10/10.",

I have mixed emotions about NOT watching the international trailer, before watching \"Rush,\" because I would certainly have held much higher expectations. First and foremost, \"Rush\" is NOT about Chris Hemsworth's pecs; nor, for that matter, is it that much about about Chris Hemworth's character, James Hunt. \"Rush\" is about two extraordinary men's visions of life and their approaches to racing; and, it is viewed from James Hunt's most famous challenger, Nicki Lauder. Lauder is a technocrat; a man who, at least, appears to \"know the price of everything and the value of nothing.\" Hunt is free spirit; one of simultaneously knows the value of everything and nothing. Hunt and Lauder are presented in much the same manner as the two main characters of \"Lonesome Dove\". Like, \"Lonesome Dove,\" \"Rush\" is majestic in its presentation of these two lives. \"Rush\" is poetic in its presentation, absolute precision,from its score, to its cinematography, to its performances to the most both memorable and appropriate score I have heard since \"The Good, The Bad & The Ugly\".If you have not seen \"Rush,\" watch the international trailer, available on YouTube.

I wouldn't at all be surprised if the cinematography and the sound editing are nominated for Oscars. The engines roaring alongside Hans Zimmer's score really gets you into the mood. The backdrop is gritty with lots of dark and gray colors giving it a tough 1970\u2032s aesthetic. Howard places is camera so specifically and we get so many different angles that are gripping. Camera work inside the cars giving you the intense look of driving an F1 car as well as camera's on the grass looking up as they fly by. Howard's use of slow motion is also perfect and helps build the intensity of the rivalry he is exploring here. The racing is intense and the dangers are shown in some dramatic ways as the suspense keeps building up. The biggest problem is that Formula 1 isn't the biggest of sports here in the U.S. If people can get past that and go see this, they won't regret it.Grade: ASCRIPT The story follows two F1 drivers in the mid 1970\u2032s that don't always get a long but have a mutual respect for one another. It centers around British driver, James Hunt and the Austrian Niki Lauda. Peter Morgan's script is brilliant and Howard brings it to life in some really great ways. In essence, both characters are the protagonist and the antagonist of the story. The film explores Hunt and his immature ways but at the same time makes him very likable. Then the story switches to Lauda and his quest to live his own life outside the big family business, yet again making him likable. However, at the same time each take their own turn in being the \"bad guy\" and showing you qualities that make this person flawed and unlikable in some ways. But then the movie brings it back around showing you why these characters are good characters to root for and the mutual respect they have for one another. It's the competition that drives them in this story. What makes it so great though, is that the audience really gets to choose who they want to root for. They build up and tear down each character so flawlessly. The use of narration at the beginning and at the end was a perfect choice as well. The ending becomes a bit sentimental and hits the buttons that you'd expect from Howard and company.Grade: APERFORMANCES Daniel Br\u00fchl and Chris Hemsworth are amazing. This is perhaps Hemsworth's best as he portray's James Hunt in some incredible ways. He's the dangerous driver that has Tony Stark mentalities in terms of partying, women and being extremely likable. Yet Hemsworth shows some depth and some emotion here as well which this character calls for in some ways. Br\u00fchl, who you may know from Inglorious Basterds, almost steals the show. He's the Austrian car genius who becomes famous for knowing how to make the cars lighter and faster, thus making him part of the Ferrari team. One can argue he's the bigger lead here as he narrates a good chunk of the story and brings in some great perspectives. Br\u00fchl's performance is spot on though and brings life to this character even when Lauda is more deadpanned. Olivia Wilde is good here although her character is a small role. This is about Br\u00fchl and Hemsworth and they carry the movie extremely well.Grade: A+SCORE Freakin Hans Zimmer. The dude is on fire lately. A lot of people like to criticize Zimmer for having score's that are similar or nothing new but they work. His score for Man of Steel added a lot to that film and his score for The Lone Ranger was about the only good part of that movie. And his score for Rush was really great, again. It added a lot of intensity to the racing moments and has become something he's perfected. The score here is more laid back and in the backdrop though many moments but when the action ramped up, so did his score as well as your emotion.Grade: A-FINAL THOUGHTS Rush was an unexpected pleasant surprise. Given the sports stature of F1 in the U.S., I didn't have much expectations but Ron Howard usually delivers and he does once again. The cinematography is gorgeous and makes it visually very exciting. The performances are stand outs which makes the story feel so alive in many places.Overall Grade: A",

            "content": "RUSH is a film which tells the true-life tale of the rivalry between F1 drivers Niki Lauda and James Hunt during the 1970s. It's a film which explores what makes the two men tick in terms of their personal lives, but it also looks at the world of racing back in the 1970s, which was definitely a more dangerous time to be a racing driver.The film begins quite slowly, with lots of extraneous sex scenes that director Ron Howard seems to enjoy slipping in for no real reason other than to titillate the audience. I'm not really a big fan of Howard as director and he's quite lazy here, repetitively using songs on the soundtrack to evoke the emotion of his leading characters when better writing in the script would have helped.Stick with it though, because after the first hour this starts to get much more interesting. A sense of suspense and impending doom hangs over the whole production and you begin to get invested in the leading characters. Both Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Bruhl are good as the leads, with the latter putting in a particularly effective performance as a man whose desire to win leads to some tragic circumstances. RUSH is rounded out by a solid supporting cast and some excellently staged racing scenes which lift it above its average beginnings.",

He knew how to set up his racing car.Daniel Br\u00fchl captures the spirit of this almost cold, aloof character who will then have to recover from an almost fatal accident and make him appear human, even likable.Chris Hemsworth has the showy role as the wild, erratic, playboy James Hunt.The guy always looking to have a good time partying. He is reckless on the track, Hunt the shunt is his nickname.However Hunt as his own demons and in the 1976 Formula 1 season, he spends most of his time chasing Lauda who had a dominant points tally.Unlike other race films, director Ron Howard did not have to try too hard in getting a thrilling storyline. Real life provided it.Lauda was well ahead in the championship until his accident which allowed Hunt to claw back. Lauda miraculously recovered enough despite his burns and returned to racing and the title went to the final race decider.Both actors capture the spirit of the people they portray. Hunt became well known to racing fans after his retirement as a F1 commentator and Hemsworth does well in getting his vocal mannerisms with maybe just a lapse or two to his Aussie accent.I reckon the film would have little interest to those who despise racing but for others there is plenty of thrills here.",

            "content": "After a short framing section, this starts off with a bloody-mouthed Chris Hemsworth in half-undone racing coveralls strutting into an emergency room on a wave of testosterone like a cock into a hen house. Every female head in the place turns, and a glaze of lust falls across nurse Natalie Dormer's face. Within a minute and 4 lines of dialogue, he and she are doing the horizontal mambo on the examining table and, through a series of quick cuts, plenty of other places. In short, it looks like we're going to get a 16 year old boy's dream of being a race car driver.It turns out to be a great deal more. Director Howard and writer Morgan turn out to have a lot more empathy with the precise, earnest, \u0171ber-professional Austrian Niki Lauda (known as the Rat or the Sour Kraut) than they do with long haired, gorgeous English party animal James Hunt \u2013 there's a montage after Hunt wins the 1976 Formula 1 driving championship that subtly trivializes and belittles what he does with his victory, and a concluding t\u00eate \u00e1 t\u00eate between Hunt and Lauda that makes it explicit. This isn't surprising considering the way the critics have treated Howard's body of work over the years. But along the way we're treated to a struggle between Cavalier and Roundhead, JFK and Nixon, inspiration and perspiration that is never less than captivating. The personal distaste between the two men, the contrast of styles, and the way they get into each other's heads are too intense for the subject of their rivalry, which after all is only motor racing. You feel that they were born 30 years too late, and that they should have been up in the sky a generation earlier, trying to kill each other in Spitfires and Messerschmitts instead of zipping around in McLarens and Ferraris. The gorgeous women (Dormer, Olivia Wilde, Alexandra Maria Lara) are more or less along for the ride as arm candy, although Hunt gets to display some dry, malicious English wit after his supermodel wife (Wilde) dumps him for Richard Burton. The racing sequences pull you in, and the overwhelming sound design gives you a real feel for the power (and fascination) of the internal combustion engine. The climactic race is subtly different than you'd expect from a sports movie but absolutely true to the characters.This is not great art, but it is thrilling popcorn entertainment the way it's supposed to be done, and it is to racing movies like Das Boot is to submarine movies. They'll never have to make another one.",

            "content": "\"Rush\" is one of the best films of the year. I was pleasantly surprised by the amount of depth and emotional story telling this film possess. From its brilliant script that infuses humor, drama, and a story about a fascinating rivalry to its impeccable and detailed oriented direction, this film succeeds on every level.Ron Howard's direction is extremely noteworthy as I felt like a part of the journey and involved with the characters as I cheered them on. In the beginning, I was rooting for James, but as the movie progresses and things unravel, I was cheering for Niki. However, as the movie moves forward, I couldn't choose one over the other. This is the type of engagement that I love in movies, it keeps the audience involved and contently thinking about every situation and the characters as a whole.This film is well edited and shot as well. I couldn't find a useless or uninteresting moment in this film. Everything flowed very well and the film moved at a brisk pace. It felt as every shot or sequence is catered to moving and developing the characters and their story forward. The racing sequences are well shot and make you feel a part of the race. My heart rushed when characters successfully made narrow life endangering turns. It is a really good film to look at as the scenery and environment crafted feels inviting and absorbing.The cast in this film is superb. Chris Hemsworth gives his finest performance to date as a carefree playboy. Even though his character James Hunt doesn't appear serious, he struggles with his inner demons trying to be taken a bit more seriously. Daniel Bruhl also gives and equally impressive, if not better, performance as Niki Lauda an arrogant self-absorbent racer. It's interesting to see his character go from caring only about himself and racing to something more important. The greatest aspect of the characters are their interactions. I really enjoy how they can't stand each other, but can't be successful without each other either. While they hate one another, they find a mutual respect for the other. It's quite endearing to see how they have each others back off the tracks.Overall, \"Rush\" is an amazing movie and totally worth your time. It's a movie that has everything, from drama to humor to love. The greatest aspect of the film is its truly brilliant and masterful score by Hans Zimmer. His score gives the right amount of emotional punch along with improving everything we see and giving the film a greater amount of importance. I give this film an extremely high 4.5/5, a well oiled film that has no wasted parts.",

            "content": "I remember seeing the trailers for RUSH when it was just about to hit the cinemas in the early Autumn of 2013 and thinking it was going to be a major contender for the Oscars . This is the type of movie the Academy Awards love in theory . True life story with actors playing true life people and at the heart of the story rivalry where men risk their lives to show they're better than their rival . On top of that from what you're able to glean from the trailers this is a very proficient film from a technical point of view and I had this down as walking off with the Oscar for editing and sound . Therefore I was totally shocked that the film did not receive a single nomination when the nominations were revealed at the start of 2014 . True 2013 was an exceptional year for films but after finally getting round to watching RUSH I'm still at a loss why it didn't pick up more awards and nominations Now I've got to put my cards on the table and say motor sport doesn't interest me in the slightest . Formula one is the personification of \"spectator sport\" and totally uninvolving . If you or I were to drive a car a couple of hundred miles per hour down a stretch of road we'd be looking at a court case . As I said I've no interest in this so called sport but as a child I do vaguely remember the rivalry between James Hunt and Niki Lauda . Of course all the British press were on the side of Hunt due to chauvinism , To be blunt Hunt was the type of man you're going to instinctively hate on every level . A privileged background , an out and out playboy , too handsome by half and uses every opportunity as an absolute sex magnet it's difficult to find any type of likability in him . Add to this he was a success and bingo , you've got a ready made villain . RUSH doesn't waste much time in showing whose side we should take . Lauda isn't exactly short of money himself but with his arrival on the racing circuit we see a very introverted unassuming man who wants to win . Again this single minded will to succeed in sport can be potentially alienating . Speaking as a Brit our sports heroes are flawed , self destructive people and we don't like dominant winners but this film despite the bias doesn't paint either man as black or white and we see two very complex men at the zenith of their careers trying to be champion . It also points out how dangerous F1 racing was back in those days . In the last 20 years three formula one drivers died in races and I had to check to see if \"Two drivers being killed every season\" wasn't in fact hyperbole and it was indeed a tragic statistic in the mid 1970sThe acting is uniformly superb and never for a moment did I think was watching actors playing roles . Aussie actor Chris Hemsworth is James Hunt and Daniel Bruhl is Niki Lauda . . The races themselves are fast and exciting but the film really concentrates on the drama between two men and has a great sense of time and place . Again I've got to repeat that I was puzzled why it wasn't Oscar nominated in any category and seeing it at last I am now doubly puzzled . It's one of the rare occasions where the IMDb members have found a film underrated and put it in the top 250 movies where as the more prestigious award ceremonies had snubbed it",

Instead, it's a very nice movie, fairly accurate, and a must-see for any racing enthusiast.First and foremost, the racing scenes and the championship events are accurate and spectacular, they're pure fun.\nI have to say there are some of the most perfect special effects I've ever seen, you can't say what's real and what's not.Also, I've NEVER seen a more accurate depiction of the 70's style; that's a very important thing to preserve the atmosphere and let you believe the movie is actually set in the 70's. Lots of movies fail miserably while attempting this. Here, every single t-shirt and haircut of the crowds in the stands is spot-on, the film grain for the racing scenes is very good, the cars are perfect, and most notably the tracks are straight out of the seventies.I like when the actors look like the real people they are interpreting. Here, everybody is a dead ringer: Niki, Marlene, Clay, everyone.Acting is good, Bruhl starts a bit over the top, but soon you'll get aquainted with his persona, and you'll find it's actually a very good performance.\nSupporting cast is on par.\nJust Hemsworth is a bit off target, because Hunt had a playful note he's not able to replicate. Here he plays just the \"handsome rogue\", and little more.The Lauda-Hunt relationship is the less accurate part of the story, but this is an understandable license.Lastly, some quotes have real swagger, the Drake makes a cameo appearence, and the scene where Lauda drives in the italian countryside is outstanding.",

            "review_title": "Very good true-life sporting drama",
            "content": "There was a time during my boyhood in the sixties and seventies when I took a keen interest in Formula One racing, but my enthusiasm quickly disappeared when I realised what an appallingly dangerous sport it was; during this period several of my heroes were either killed (Jim Clark, Bruce McLaren, Piers Courage, Jochen Rindt, Peter Revson) or seriously injured (Stirling Moss, Graham Hill). Despite my disillusionment, however, even I could not fail to be captured by the rivalry between James Hunt of Britain and Niki Lauda of Austria in the 1976 season. The events of this season read more like the script of a Hollywood film or of a blockbuster novel than the record of actual historical events. Lauda, the reigning champion, dominated the early part of the season, opening up a big lead in the championship ahead of Hunt, who was regarded as his closest challenger. Hunt won the Spanish Grand Prix, but was disqualified after the race for a technical infringement of the rules. (He was eventually reinstated and his points restored). To add to Hunt's problems, his marriage fell apart when his glamorous model wife Suzy left him for the actor Richard Burton. The drama reached a climax when Lauda was seriously injured in a crash during the German Grand Prix. It seemed that his racing career was over, but only six weeks later, defying his doctor's orders, he returned to the wheel of his car in the Italian Grand Prix. During his absence, however, Hunt had whittled down his lead in the championship, and everything now turned upon the final race of the season, the Japanese Grand Prix. Apart from their love of their sport, the two men had two things in common. Both were from a prosperous upper-middle-class background, and both had defied their families by taking up a career in motor racing rather than in the professions. Both were married to beautiful wives. (Lauda's wife was the socialite Marlene Knaus). In personality, however, they were very different. Hunt was a brash, outgoing playboy and party animal, a lover of the good life and of beautiful women. (Suzy was far from being his only conquest, and his frequent infidelities were a major cause of the breakdown of his marriage. It is, however, perhaps ironic that she left him for Burton, a man twenty years his senior and with an even greater reputation as a hellraiser and womaniser). He started his Formula One career driving for Alexander Hesketh, an eccentric aristocrat and kindred spirit who had founded his own racing team. His aggressive, and often controversial, driving style won him the nickname of \"Hunt the Shunt\". Lauda was much quieter, a calm, calculating perfectionist who was an expert motor mechanic and knew as much about the technical side of the sport as about the actual driving. According to this film, the two men disliked one another intensely, although the accuracy of this has been questioned. Ron Howard is one of the more versatile directors currently working in Hollywood, able to turn his hand to a number of different genres, including comedy (\"The Paper\"), the Western (\"The Missing\") and sword- and-sorcery fantasy (\"Willow\"). \"Rush\", like some of his earlier films such as \"Apollo 13\" and \"A Beautiful Mind\", is a biographical drama, but is quite different in content to either of those films. Howard is able to elicit good performances from his two leading actors, Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Br\u00fchl, who are able to bring out the contrasting personalities of the two rivals. Hemsworth also achieves a remarkable physical likeness to the real James Hunt. As with some other sports, notably soccer, there have been a number of films about motor racing, including some good ones, but no really great ones. (For some reason, apart from \"Chariots of Fire\" about athletics, nearly all the great sports films seem to be about either boxing or baseball). \"Rush\" does not quite come into the \"great\" category, but it is nevertheless a very good sporting drama, with some fine acting and exciting action sequences. 7/10",

            "content": "''Rush'' is a very good film about the rivalry between two Formula 1 race car drivers and their lives behind it. Directed by Ron Howard, the film is a triumph concerning action sequences, film editing and sound. Despite it being a sports film about racing, ''Rush'' never fails to develop its characters, its story and its suspense thus delivering a deeply satisfying conclusion.Beginning with the film's performances, one would expect to see little character development, acting and emotion but a whole lot of action. However, this is not the case. The film's performances are very good. Daniel Br\u00fchl gives an outstanding performance as Austrian Niki Lauda: from the character's personality, body movement, expressions and emotions to his speaking accent, Br\u00fchl manages to handle it more than well and deliver a very authentic and powerful performance. From his first appearance in the film, he stays a very powerful figure throughout the film and very memorable after it. He realizes the character's motives and feelings which enables him to fully portray his character. Despite his performances in films such as ''Thor'', ''Red Dawn'' and ''The Cabin in the Woods'', Chris Hemsworth gives a decent enough performance as James Hunt. He is far from outstanding but he portrays his character as he should be, never overacting nor underplaying his character, thus delivering a satisfying and believable performance as a race car driver. The rest of the cast doesn't have much screen time since the film mainly focuses on the two protagonists but their acting does not disappoint.The film's exhilarating action sequences are probably the main reason people will go to see it and they will not be disappointed. With rapid but smooth editing, the renowned film editing duo (Daniel P. Hanley, Mike Hill) manages to ''tell'' the story rather clearly rather than just smothering it under its heavy action scenes. Other technical aspects such as sound editing, sound mixing and cinematography are superb. Sound, especially, plays a very important role in the film and luckily, the sound is clear, realistic and not bombastic as most Hollywood action films. The racing sequences are superb: we see them from every angle possible, never confusing nor annoying the viewer with their rapid cuts, instead keeping the viewer interested (especially during the final climatic race). As for the score, Hans Zimmer's fast paced music adds nicely to the film's racing sequences, turning the suspense meter way up without distracting the viewer. As with most of Zimmer's works, the film's score is very epic and memorable which captures the film's action.What works very well in the film is the fact that it's not just a film full or car explosions, racing and trophies but a film which tells the story of two people who succeeded in the race tracks, a film which doesn't drown its characters under its impressive action sequences but allows them to breath.",

Like the similarly adrenaline-drenched \"Warrior\" before it, Rush does an excellent job of evenly pursuing its dual leads, examining both to such lengths that we have ample reason to pull for each in their climactic showdown. Directly inspired by the real men behind the story, its depiction of both personalities, warts and all, is masterful. Ron Howard's always known which strings to tug for maximum emotional impact in his work, but that usually comes at a price: simple, one-dimensional caricatures at the helm. Rush represents an evolution for the director; he no longer shies away from the darker, less desirable elements of his leading man/men, and that strong investment in their development pays dividends at the climax. The pulse-pounding F-1 scenes are gripping and intense - I'd expect no less from today's bombastic Hollywood effects departments - but the real attraction is the race that goes on away from the track, as two dedicated drivers break themselves in half to one-up a lifelong rival.

I want to be a screenwriter so I wanted to see how it's done, especially those races. It's not the only film of the next four months that I've read nor the first of the bunch. I read upcoming films because reading scripts of films I know can be distracting trying to picture them for myself and unproduced scripts are most likely unproduced for a reason. Upcoming films means I have seen glimpses of them from the trailer but not too much and they're considered good enough to be produced right now. I wouldn't read a potential favourite but I'm still generally excited for the big films of the year. Anyway, it had to be said as it did affect my viewing experience, but it was certainly not a hindrance. It was only a hindrance for differentiating the film and script between the few scenes cut and added but there are only few and mostly for the better.The first thing I got from the script was that Rush is all about sex appeal. James Hunt's introduction is written in big bold words given its own line: Sexy. The characters inhabit the extravagant sexy world of the 1970s with all of its grainy flavours and gritty vices. The use of words in the script invite vibrant technical potential in the editing and cinematography department for a audio-visual sensory experience over anything else. All this is designed as a juxtaposition to Niki Lauda, of whom is frequently described as a rat. Rush is sex vs. rat. Which is fine as an oversimplification, but it trades characterisation for superficial personality traits. As charming as Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Bruhl (who is good, not as great as his current acclaim) are in their roles, they rarely feel like relatable human beings. Granted, the film wants them to feel larger than life but personally I prefer emotional immersion than a spectacle that pushes its audiences away. But flash if it must and flash it does well.The rival's back-and-forth continues throughout the film by constantly switching protagonists which although its intentions are that it wants to cover all ground, it results in us never feeling intimate with either of them, especially as each scene is rather short. Ironically, it feels rushed. It's scared of being boring. However, it's the film's third act that makes it all worth it. In that final race, everyone in front and behind camera is at the top of their game and it's a fantastically nail-biting sequence. Even if you know the result, it raises the stakes magnificently. I even forgot what happened by then. Not only is it thrilling but by this point the rivals have found an emotionally rewarding bond, even if they are still at odds. The film quite reminds me of last year's Argo in its pace and rock and roll atmosphere but its final cathartic act makes Rush a stronger film over last years Best Picture. Some have considered that this might be this year's Best Picture and Director. Even if 12 Years A Slave and Gravity weren't this year, I wouldn't see it happening, but after seeing the film I can see it earning a nomination, which I didn't after reading the script.However, the representation of women is still terribly neglected. They are forever on the side, forever turned on (or off) for the men and racing. Olivia Wilde's character is a joke. It's not her fault, it's just what she had to work with. I wish the film didn't bother rather than awkwardly work women in, as there isn't a developed one here, even though the existence of Lauda's wife becomes key in the third act. That's what Rush is like until its third act, unfocused. The best scenes are the longer ones which move the story forward. Ron Howard is usually a very bland director. My favourite of his films is The Grinch, mostly for nostalgic reasons. What lifts Rush is the signature work of Danny Boyle's regular cinematographer Anthony Dod Mantle. He may have let Trance down but his kinetic closeups make the film, even his documentary-esque wides can be messy and not cut well together. They still made it cinematic. Zimmer's score does a great job of matching up to that standard. I wouldn't call Rush a winner, but it's worth watching. 7/10",

In many ways, I wonder if that wasn't to my advantage going into Ron Howard's 'Rush', a sleek, well tuned film that focuses on the brief, but intense rivalry between these two very different men.Though the film is tightly focused on Hunt and Lauda, I still found it to be a somewhat superficial examination of them. Like the cars they drive, the movie races by at breakneck speed, rarely taking a pit stop. It's a gorgeous looking film that totally immerses you in its time and place, and the performances are all top-notch, but if I had one complaint it would be that it's just a tad too shallow in its observations and characterizations of these two men and the compelling rivalry they shared.",

            "content": "Ron Howard is the rare Hollywood auteur that doesn't have a distinctive style (how did the guy that gave us \"Frost /Nixon\" give us Jim Carrey's \"How the Grinch Stole Christmas\"?!). In his latest film \"Rush\", we get a glimpse of Howard playing with some Danny Boyle-esque flair, especially in the racing scenes. Unfortunately, outside of this visceral, kinetic spirit, \"Rush\" lacks an emotional connection with its audience, leaving us in the dust with only a memory of what just sped past. The amazing true story about the on-and-off-the-track rivalry of racers James Hunt (Hemsworth) and Niki Lauda (Bruhl) should be ripe pickings for good filmmaking. The story has some unexpected turns that are enlivened by their being true. Add to that some decent performances and a strong middle section involving a hospital, this should be a no-brainer success. Sadly the film fails in a number of other ways: the dialogue, while not bad, is unoriginal and boring, clich\u00e9d and overly-Hollywood. This along with some silly, overwrought Hollywood moments (\"We may hate each other, but at least we respect each other\") hurt \"Rush\" immensely. Admittedly, I am not a racing fan of any kind, and this is clearly a movie made for them. Nonetheless, I think Howard is trying to reach beyond this demographic but comes up short. \"Rush\" is by no means a complete failure, but when it steps away from the formula 1 racing and slows down, it really putters out\u0085pun totally intended.",

            "content": "In the 1970's world of Grand Prix racing, there is an intense rivalry between two top drivers - the intelligent and perfectionist Austrian Niki Lauda, and the charismatic and talented Englishman James Hunt. Things come to a head at the 1976 world championship when both men must come to terms with triumph and tragedy ...I love motor racing and so in many ways this is a dream movie for me, about one of the most famous and shocking seasons in the sport's history and two of its greatest and most iconic stars. Watching it sometimes seems like it's a made-up Hollywood fantasy - the dashing playboy versus the determined fighter, the high-octane competition that goes down to the wire, the troubled star whose personal life falls apart just as his professional one hits its pinnacle, the horror crash halfway through and the resultant fightback. If you were going to write a race car movie this is what you'd do, but astonishingly not only is it all completely true but the movie's real strength is its drama - the depiction of how the events affect the two drivers. When Lauda tells Hunt that watching him win races from his hospital sick bed was the primary motivation for his recovery, he is speaking with incredible honesty, straight from the heart. Here is man whose very essence was to beat everyone and be best in his chosen field, and no amount of pain or circumstance was insurmountable for him. Equally, on a technical level, the movie is an astonishingly beautiful recreation of the period - the cars, the sets, the visual effects, the costumes and every other aspect of the design contributing to an amazingly detailed Formula One time capsule. The recreation of Lauda's infamous and terrible crash at the Nurburgring and its aftermath is astonishingly painful to watch, and the movie documents every detail of the men's often bitter rivalry with incisive drama, humour and precision. Both Hemsworth and Br\u00fchl are marvellous in the leads, although for me Br\u00fchl is just mesmeric; he strikes an almost perfect balance between impersonating Lauda's unique mannerisms and finding the drama and passion within the man. In many ways it's an unusual two-piece picture which almost forces you to side with one of these heroes, and in my case it's Lauda - his return to racing at the Italian Grand Prix, a mere six weeks after a near-fatal crash and in unimaginable pain his subsequent fourth-place finish is in my view arguably the greatest sporting achievement of all time. Extremely well written by Peter Morgan, with a great jangling tense score by Hans Zimmer, this independent British-German-US production by Working Title Films is one of the best motor racing movies ever made. Filmed mostly in the UK, notably for race fans at Donington, Brands Hatch and Cadwell Park.",

            "content": "Greetings again from the darkness. Director Ron Howard and writer Peter Morgan are back in their wheelhouse with a film based on real people. Their previous collaboration was Frost/Nixon, and they also had separate \"true stories\": Howard with Apollo 13, A Beautiful Mind and Cinderella Man, and Morgan with The Queen and Last King of Scotland. Here they tackle personality opposites and fierce Formula One competitors James Hunt and Niki Lauda.The two lead actors are perfectly cast. Chris Hemsworth (Thor) slips seamlessly into the swashbuckling, rebellious playboy that was Great Britain's James Hunt. Daniel Bruhl (Inglourious Basterds, Goodbye Lenin!) becomes the focused, determined, meticulous Spanish-German Niki Lauda. You might think of Hunt as an X-Games type who thrives on publicity and fun, while Lauda is more scientist or engineer driven by the quest for perfection. Both were World Champions and their rivalry brought out the best in each.Do not think for a second that you need be a Formula One expert or even know the backstory of Hunt and Lauda to enjoy this movie. It is extremely entertaining and exciting. Morgan's script might hover a bit more on the oh-so-photogenic Hunt/Hemsworth character, but it also does a nice job of preventing the not-so-likable Lauda from being a bad guy. In fact, it demonstrates that champions are not all alike.The look of the film is exemplary. Beautifully photographed by DP Anthony Dod Mantle (Oscar winner for Slumdog Millionaire), the colors and grainy texture make this look like it was filmed in the 1970's, not just based then. While the racing scenes are stunning, it is actually an intimate look at this world and the men of this era. Without dwelling on it, we get a realistic feel for the fiery crash that caused Lauda's horrific injuries and his extraordinary fight to recovery while in the hospital.We also get a peek at the very different marriages of these two men. Hunt's short lived bond with model Suzy Miller (played by Olivia Wilde)ended when her affair with Richard Burton caused the final split between Burton and Liz Taylor. Lauda's relationship with his wife (Alexandria Maria Lara) occurred without the whirlwind, but in a very real and organic manner. Both are an additional touch of realism to a quite real story.There have been no shortage of racing movies over the years. Some good: Le Mans (Steve McQueen) and Grand Prix (James Garner). Some not so good: Days of Thunder (Tom Cruise) and Driven (Sylvester Stallone). Ron Howard's latest clearly finishes near the top at the finish line.",

            "content": "Most sports movies involve an underdog trying to defeat an established champion. We've seen a million variations of Rocky Balboa taking on Apollo Creed. But what if someone made a film about Rocky fighting another Rocky? That's what director Ron Howard has done with his excellent new racing movie, \"Rush.\" The most compelling aspect of this tale of two long shots is that it's not the invention of a screenwriter. It actually happened. The drama centers on the rivalry between two drivers, James Hunt and Niki Lauda, and the movie follows each man's unlikely rise to the top ranks of the Formula One circuit. The heart of the action takes place during the dramatic 1976-racing season during which the British Hunt and the Austrian Lauda vied for the world championship. They both overcame enormous adversity and risked their lives for the chance to win it all. Danger is a major theme hovering over the story, as the potential for death lurks around every turn of track. In this era of racing, an average of two drivers were killed each year.Howard seems to be at his best when he's telling true stories (\"Apollo 13,\" \"A Beautiful Mind\"). The Academy Award winner here re-teams with his \"Frost/Nixon\" collaborator Peter Morgan, a screenwriter who also specializes in films based on real events (\"The Queen, \" \"The Deal\"). Howard and Morgan resist the urge to embellish the story for dramatic effect, unlike some other filmmakers (I'm talking to you, Ben Affleck). The great script is paired with stunning visuals. Howard immerses us in the racing scenes. Cinematographer Anthony Dod Mantle's cameras put us on the course, on the cars, behind the wheel and even inside the engines. The track sequences demand to be seen -- and just as importantly, heard \u2013 in the theater.But the drivers themselves are the reason we want to go along for the ride. The two competitors could not be more different. Hunt, the charismatic, womanizing playboy, is played by Chris Hemsworth (Thor), while Daniel Bruhl plays Lauda, the quirky mechanical savant who has a way with machines, but not with people. Both actors create engaging portraits of the respective drivers, but Bruhl's performance is the one that will no doubt generate awards buzz.Audiences, however will root for both men. Neither is the villain. The intense competition pushes each man to excel beyond what they would have otherwise achieved. They make each other better. It's Sosa vs. McGwire, only with spark plugs instead of steroids. The only shame is that one of the men had to lose.",

The film is based on the true story of a great sporting rivalry between handsome English playboy James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth), and his methodical, brilliant opponent, Austrian driver Niki Lauda (Daniel Br\u00fchl). The story follows their distinctly different personal styles on and off the track, their loves and the astonishing 1976 season in which both drivers were willing to risk everything to become world champion in a sport with no margin for error: if you make a mistake, you die. The love interest are provided by actresses Natalie Dormer, Olivia Wilde, Alexandra Maria Lara and the supporting cast is full of fine actors, Pierfrancesco Favino as Clay Ragazzoni among them.The film focuses as much on the internal struggles these opposite drivers had as much as it does on the racing tracks. Philosophical questions are raised that pertain to any sport and Ron Howard knows ho to bring that into focus. Both lead actors are exceptional, with Daniel Br\u00fchl - false teeth and all - turning in a fully realized performance as the severely burned but not battered Niki Lauda.

I don't know when it happened but at some point in the last decade or so the bar was lowered. Now every moderately good film is lumped in with the greatest of all time. I'm no racing fan but I have enjoyed racing films before. Rush is overlong and doesn't build to anything really. The ending, or more to the point the last half hour, felt like a story searching for a powerful finish that it never found. I know this is based on real people and events, but I fail to see how that matters in the context of judging how they told the story. A dramatic film is not a documentary and artistic license is acceptable and, in many cases, desperately needed. What it comes down to is that this is a middle-of-the-road drama. Nothing exceptional and certainly nothing new. The performances are adequate, but nothing to rave about. The story, real or not, is fractured and lacking in any sense of a point in the end. I felt like I learned nothing of significance about the two men that the film focuses on. This is particularly true for James Hunt, portrayed by Chris Hemsworth. Other than being a walking clich\u00e9, what else was there to the man? The film has no answers. It has few more for Daniel Bruhl's Niki Lauda. Perhaps if they had chosen to focus on just one of the men rather than both, they could have told a more interesting story. As it is, it's a superficial drama about two men with unimpressive racing footage sprinkled throughout.",

I sort of turned up my nose and thought this was pretty low on the Ron Howard totem pole. I will see pretty much anything in theatres and yet I had no desire to go see this one. For one reason or another that I won't bore you with I ended up at Rush on a cheap night at the theatre. I should have put more faith in Mr. Howard. This was an incredible film. The acting was first rate (Oscar worthy even?) the story was terrific, the action riveting and being based on a true story made it all the more fascinating as it covers what sounds like one of the greatest sports rivalries in history that I had never even heard of. I am not a racing fan, I have never even sat down to see more than ten seconds of a car race and yet this story could impress anyone. This is about two larger than life characters that have this rivalry that leads to this incredible level of respect between them. At times it had a little bit of a Rocky feel to it as many sports films do but it was all around and excellent and very entertaining experience.A big part of that is Chris Hemsworth who literally gives the performance of his young career. Hemsworth was brilliant. Hemsworth was Oscar worthy. Best of all to me he proved he is more than Thor or a pretty face because he was amazing. His cocky and determined James Hunt was one of the best character portrayals I have ever seen. Not to be outdone Daniel Br\u00fchl is also extremely good as Nicki Lauda. It sounds like he really nails this portrayal of the former racing champion. The film is somewhat from his perspective and he narrates some of the film. The character of Lauda is fascinating as he has an almost anti-social, mildly autistic vibe to him and yet like Hemsworth's James Hunt you gain such a respect for him as a racer and what he goes through. The chemistry between Br\u00fchl and Hemsworth is perfect for the film and both men give A+ performances. The supporting cast are all decent though no one particularly stands out. Thank goodness Olivia Wilde is only given a small role as Hemsworth's wife. Wilde is not a great actress in my opinion and even in her small screen time she comes across as silly though she does alright and their chemistry is decent enough. Alexandra Maria Lara also does decently as Lauda's wife and she manages to do quite a bit in a very small role showing what she goes through as his spouse.Ron Howard is a storyteller. I should have remembered that. He has done some amazing based on real life stories that have been instant classics. Somehow he always knows how to capture the human spirit and the human condition and characters that are as vibrant as fiction. From the drama and emotion to the edge of your seat thrilling races he nails this. He also cleverly manoeuvres his way around showing countless and seemingly never-ending races by highlighting certain aspects of many different races and covering them fairly. Now my loss of a point to him is the adult content in the film. I am not a prude, and I can watch just about anything and it does not offend me. This film did not offend me but was the adult content necessary? No not even close. The gratuitous nudity and obscenities (mostly in the first half of the film) was completely unnecessary to earn an R-Rating. My issue is that it is distracting to a very good story and it also means a certain demographic shouldn't see this and it is a great story in sports history that teens, kids or even adults that don't enjoy that sort of content might miss out on because of the extremity of the R rating. That really disappointed me. Nonetheless this was a brilliant movie that seems to be a little under-rated at the moment which is unfortunate because both lead actors deserve accolades for their performance. Check this one out, you won't be disappointed!! A surprise gem for me that will likely land on my best 2013 list. 9/10 (three 9/10 films for me in the last week...impressive!!)",

A period biopic, it has a similar look and feel to Tom Hooper's The Damned United, and while it also shares a writer (Peter Morgan), this film isn't buoyed by the same standard of cast.The story concerns the rivalry between Englishman James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) and Niki Lauda (Daniel Bruhl) as they work (or buy) their way up from Formula 3 and compete for the 1976 World Championship. When a film is based on real events, professional critics have a habit of giving away the entire plot, as if we should already be aware of every twist and turn. Ignorance is bliss, as far as this non-professional is concerned, so all I'll say is that there are crashes and squeals on and off the track, and the Championship goes down to the wire.Some things about Rush are very good. Anthony Dod Mantle's cinematography is pristinely flashy and grimy in the right measures. Hans Zimmer's score is suitably stirring - and suitably drowned out by the excellent sound design. The performances are all solid.The problems are with the script, whose dialogue can be lousy at times; really clunky and by-the-numbers. Ron Howard works with workmanlike efficiency, concentrating on moving the plot onward, but never allowing a scene to breathe, perhaps for fear our attention won't hold before the next engine roar. I would rather have seen a tighter focus on fewer characters, and got more involved in Lauda's unusual relationship with his wife (Alexandra Maria Lara, making the most of a virtually silent role). The psychology of those who dance with death for a living is referred to without being explored.So we're left with a swift, visceral, formulaic page-turner - one that's worth a watch, for non-drivers and petrolheads alike.",

It is my hope that there be a sequel to this with the same crew perhaps based on the life of 7-time world champion Michael Schumacher as it is in the same genre and I'm certain it would be a wonderful watch like how this movie turned out to be!",

            "content": "\"The closer you are to death, the more alive you feel. It's a wonderful way to live. It's the only way to drive.\" James HuntAlthough in the mid 1970's, I was about to begin a satisfying and successful phase of my academic career, I had never heard of James Hunt and Niki Lauda, two world champions of formula one racing. Ron Howard's action biography of the racers and their milieu changes my ignorance in two invigorating hours called, appropriately, Rush, starring respectively Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Bruhl.Rush is one of the best racing movies of all time and rewards my cinematic demands as few biographies have ever done. Beyond the thrilling cinematography that couples the passions of the players with the sound of the engines and colors of the racing cars, director Howard and writer Peter Morgan give their two principals witty lines and restrained emotional confrontations, much as we would expect in real life with small poetic flourishes: \"The wind you can feel is me breathing down your neck. Next time, I'll have you.\" Hunt to Lauda; \"Happiness is the enemy.\" Lauda to his wife.A leitmotif about the value of having enemies (\"Trust me: watching you win those races, while I was fighting for my life, you were equally responsible for getting me back in the car.\" Lauda to Hunt) is expertly woven into the visceral racing story. That theme binds the characters into an unsentimental Apollonian-Dionysian competition that is more graceful than bitter. Even the inevitable clashes with lovers and wives who suffer the life-threatening races are not in the least obtrusive or annoying. In other words, Howard doesn't weigh his film down with clich\u00e9s, and he doesn't waste time with love interests or the usual significant-other obsessions about the dangers. What Howard does do is to give us a sense of the excitement and danger of arguably the world's most dangerous sport. And then he peppers that action with biography that makes sense but doesn't overshadow the main action.Rush feel like a summer blockbuster that was rerouted to the fall because it turned out to be more than spectacle. Some of the excitement of the drivers is reserved for the audience:\"The risk of death turns people on.\" James Hunt.",

            "content": "Rush is a biopic about the rivalry between F1 racers, James Hunt and Niki Lauda. Their story is pretty much known as remarkable and their personal character can also be worth looking. By looking at the filmmaking, you'll see that it's an ambitious piece of cinema full of style and fascination beneath the lives of these people. However, it picks some mainstream choices in its character study. Well, there's no denying that you'll call Rush a very well made film. The direction propels the storytelling, making it wholly entertaining, while the performances made the less faster scenes a lot gripping. I think those merits alone would already make Rush a great movie.The film contrasts between Hunt and Lauda by their traits and goals. Hunt is all brawn while Lauda is all wits. Though they both have the same obsession of winning mostly by their pride; one seeks for more fame and excessive pleasure, while the other tries to prove that he still got integrity even in the life as a star. The interesting part here is how these obsessions make them rise and fall, but that is the only thing where the character development leads to. The rest depends on the compelling performances filling the personalities and fortitude of these people. Chris Hemsworth did what he does best as a charming arrogant man, and it seems that's perfect enough for James Hunt. Daniel Br\u00fchl immediately steals the show, outweighing every acting around here. He's simply emotionally gripping as Niki Lauda.Above all, it's all about the craft. Ron Howard brings plenty of fortitude and thrill through the dangerous racetracks, while makes the rest so terribly engrossing. The film is also magnificent in production with all the props, cars, cinematography, and stuff. But the real deal here is the style, showing consistent speed in its editing through the camera angles. These skills simply made the overall film thoroughly entertaining.Rush can be worth rooting for in the end, it's a very well told story that embraces the speed of the cars without repelling anything, but when it slows down, it's still an interesting movie for exploring the characters, if only that part was less conventional, it would have been a lot stronger. But the strength is already kept strong by the filmmakers behind this film. It's just a marvelous experience that many would definitely find it engaging. It's easy enough to recommend it.",

            "content": "There's been a lot of hype surrounding Academy Award winning director Ron Howard's newest venture into the world of Formula One racing starring Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Br\u00fchl. It's safe to report that \"Rush\" from Universal Pictures is a thrill ride that will leave you entertained from moment one. Telling the dual stories of rival racers Niki Lauda (Br\u00fchl) and James Hunt (Hemsworth), two polar opposite personalities and their appreciations for the sport are put in the forefront by screenwriter Peter Morgan.Off the bat, one of the greatest takeaways from the picture is how confident Ron Howard has become as a director. He handles this sport and story with perfect execution, knowing exactly how he wanted to tell the story. He's never been as stylistically profound as he's been in this film. It's his best outing since \"Cinderella Man\" - a film I found massively underrated in its awards year.The technical team assembled debuts some of their finest works in years. From the first frame, you immediately recognize the power and execution of the Sound team. Polarizing, loud, and engaging, nothing makes the film sing more than aural elements put together. DP and Oscar-winner Anthony Dod Mantle has finally found the right vehicle that not only showcases his unique style but takes liberties and chances that pay off in a big way. It's not easy filming a racing movie, in what feels like 48 frames per second, and have the audience catch everything you're doing along the way. Hans Zimmer is on a roll. After infusing his own style into Superman earlier this year with \"Man of Steel\" and added tender qualities into the arsenal of \"12 Years a Slave,\" his work in \"Rush\" is just as impressive and awards worthy for a Original Score mention. Film Editors Mike Hill and Dan P. Hanley cut the film brilliantly. There's a consistent pace that keeps you at the edge of your seat. The editing duo have delivered time and time again in works like \"Frost/Nixon\" and their Oscar-winning works in \"Apollo 13.\" This stands firmly next to those films.What helps the film move along are the impressive turns by Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Br\u00fchl. Two outstanding actors that haven't been given their chance yet to show what their made of in the film world, nail each of their characters beats and motivations that are completely lively. Hemsworth, who has been quite successful in the \"Thor\" franchises and even dipped into the horror genre in \"The Cabin in the Woods,\" has all the goods as a leading man. Fascinating and layered deep with a silence under the glitz and glamour, James Hunt was a lonely person. Hemsworth illustrates all of it with a light sensitivity and a charismatic nature.Br\u00fchl fully understands the mechanics and precise ways of Niki Lauda. The co-leading man is just as charismatic, even when he's unlikable, the character actor who has starred in \"Inglourious Basterds\" and \"The Fifth Estate,\" displays his abilities when given the opportunity to do so in his own film. Motivating and awkward, Br\u00fchl gets what Niki is all about. It's a remarkable turn from the Spanish-German actor.Two things happened when the credits started rolling. The first was I got in my car, which is an automatic Toyota Yaris, and attempted to down shift like a race car driver. \"Rush\" does for Racing the way \"Rocky\" did for Boxing. The second was a burned scene in my brain of a lonely James and an apprehensive Niki speaking by an airplane about what they did for each other. A scene that stands as one of the best of the year so far. Where Morgan falters in the middle with weird character rhythms and missed opportunities for a stronger foundation into their lives, he nails some instrumental scenes that makes the film succeed.Read More @ The Awards Circuit (http://www.awardscircuit.com)",

It says a lot I couldn't finish 'ford vs Ferrari' but this one grabbed me immediately and didn't let go until it had me in tears. This film really proved Hemsworth as a good actor, and Br\u00fchl, who I've been a fan of a long time, an even better one. It's infuriating to me to find out only now Bruhl was nominated for practically every single award except the oscar. My only consolation is this is considered an industry travesty. Looking up the 2014 oscar year, it was inundated by 'Dallas buyers club', so no surprise there this film would be snubbed. It wasn't political enough. I'm also not saying Hemsworth deserved the oscar over mccaunghey, but Br\u00fchl definitely deserved it over Leto. C'est la vie.

The pistons firing, gears turning, and constantly changing camera angles made the scenes very captivating. Chris Hemsworth did a solid job as Hunt, but I think that Bruhl stole the show in his role as Lauda. The mannerisms and speaking style with the overbite made him the more enthralling character over Chris's Hunt. Olivia Wilde plays a minor role with a very convincing British accent in her limited screen time. This is an excellent movie for both racing fans, and non-racing fans alike.",

Although the bad blood aspect of this film might not be real. There is just way more tension if you don't do research on the outcome, before watching this movie.

            "review_title": "Incredibly intense and recommendable for everybody",
            "content": "\"Rush\" is definitely one of the best movies of the year and has many strong points to offer - even to those who aren't into motor sports at all. First of all, the acting is simply incredible. Chris Hemsworth performs the slowly dying kind of charming and charismatic pop stars among athletes that doesn't exist anymore in modern motor sports. He portrays a self-confident daredevil, playboy and sex symbol who seems superficial and unsympathetic at first sight but who turns out to be courageous and have more values than one might think. Behind his arrogant appearance is a breakable young man destined to live in the fast lane and die young. Many real persons from that time and especially the real Niki Lauda said that Chris Hemsworth acts and speaks exactly as the real James Hunt did which proves his incredible acting job. His antagonist is portrayed by Daniel Br\u00fchl who incarnates a young and motivated man who seems to be an arrogant and bourgeois nouveau riche at first sight but who turns out to be as breakable, courageous and determined as his concurrent. The two main characters are very different from each other but at the same time they have enough things in common to be at eye level during the most exciting Formula One season in history. I think that Daniel Br\u00fchl's acting is even better. He had to incarnate a real person that is still alive which is always tough. As a German he had to learn an Austrian accent to speak German and English in a credible way, he had to have the same gestures and he had to incarnate the same temperaments the real Niki Lauda. Thanks to a lot of details and time put into this acting job and many meetings with the real Niki Lauda, Daniel Br\u00fchl perfectly succeeded and delivers without the glimpse of a doubt the best acting performance of his career. The thing that impressed me the most was that the real Niki Lauda said that he thought of people being cruel and superficial when they have watched him with disgust or scare after his accident but when he watched this movie he had the same terrified reaction and finally understood why I all people had reacted that way so many years ago. His reaction proves how intense and real this movie is even though a few historical facts are of course exaggerated to put additional tension into this film. Next to the incredibly gifted two main actors who almost have the same screening time and are equally treated in depth even though the story is told by the film character Niki Lauda, one should not forget about a whole bunch of great supporting actors in this movie. There is simply no bad actor or actress in this film.Another strong point of this movie is the way it mixes the incredible true events by using many original settings from museums or archive footage with well integrated cinematographic elements such as an atmospheric soundtrack, intense dialogues and very well done special effects that are not overloaded with cheap effects but that feel as real as the rest of the movie. The camera work is quite perfect as it has a balanced mixture of cinematographic and documentary shots once again.And then there is the story which is highly based on true events. You don't need to be a fan of motor sports to get into this film. The story is about the clash of two very unique and different characters who seem to be antagonists and the roughest kind of competitors at first sight but who turn out to be more similar to each other than they might think. This movie is about competition, sportsmanship and more than all the precious value of life. It's also about the ups and downs that come with success. It's a movie about family values, love and friendship but also about extreme loneliness and despair. Many people don't understand why motor sport athletes are risking their lives for this sport. This movie gives us the answer. This sport is a lifelong dream of both characters and they entirely owe the lives they are living to their successful career. At the end, the movie shows us two very different ways how to deal with the risks of this dangerous job and where to stop playing with fate. This opens an almost philosophical and quite profound perspective that makes this movie something more precious than a simple action film or drama. It inspires you to think of which path you would have chosen as anybody should be able to at least partially empathize with the characters. In the end, I recommend this film to any movie fan. No matter if you are a fan of action movies, biopics, dramas or suspenseful movies, this flick has it all and even more for you and the incredible acting plus the detailed settings are the cherries on the cake. The movie even includes a few humorous scenes, erotic moments but also philosophical elements. It's hard to create a more complete movie than this one but at the same time, this film always feels consistent and never loses track of its clear guiding line. Right now, this movie is worth nine out of ten and time will tell us if this might even be worth the perfect rate. I think this might be the case and hope that the movie will win a few Academy Awards along with the superb crime drama \"Prisoners\". These two movies are definitely the best of the year until now and the year is almost over. If you were hesitating whether to watch this film or not, you should by now have made your decision to go to the cinemas as long as this film is still there. Needless to say that the great camera work and the impressive sound effects work even better in cinema than at home.",

With phenomenal storytelling, prefect direction and near flawless acting, it submerses the audience into a the F-1 Racing world circa 1976. The film showcases the bitter rivalry of James Hunt and Niki Lauda, the most memorable of the sport. Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Br\u00fchl were near perfect in this film, due to the fact that the audience is meant to view these people as both protagonists. It delves into the morality of both characters, not showing one or the other as a villain or a hero, just regular and ordinary. With the help of Ron Howard's direction, this film elevates the intensity of this rivalry with getting riveting performances from the entire cast all around the board. However, the real shining star of this film is Daniel Br\u00fchl. Br\u00fchl gives the performance of his career in this film. And I fully expect an Oscar nomination for him this year.Despite being about racing, Rush's best scenes are rich in texture and performances, rather than visual effects. By far the best parts of the film were through the characters and that is what Howard intended. While the racing sequences are high octane scenes, the smaller parts are what really shine throughout the film, even if it ever gets to feel too long. Its interesting as hell and a very entertaining watch. Rush is one of the best films of 2013, delivering Oscar caliber performances along with impeccable writing and direction, it stands as a heavy handed Oscar contender.",

When you hear those V12 engines start up in the opening scene, you get that Rush of testosterone in the pit of your stomach because of the sheer ferociousness of the sound in the theater. from that point on you are hooked. even if your not an F1 fan that scene will make you want more. every girl i talked to about the movie said they were seeing it for Hemsworth, and after the movie they were in awe about the awesomeness of Formula 1 and what it takes to succeed in the sport. from then on the movie moves at a good pace. as an F1 fan i wish there were a few more race scenes, but it is a Hollywood movie not a documentary so they have to appeal to everyone. the plot and the way the present it was great. i wish they went a little more in depth on Lauda and Hunts backgrounds and also went more in depth on the supporting characters like andretti and regazzoni. but since they didn't do that it lead to a better look at the intense rivalry between lauda and hunt. the small amount of comedy that was in it was very funny, it was somewhat unexpected. the Cinematography is amazing. so many different shots throughout the car and driver as an audience you feel like your right there with them, and as an F1 fan you get all the shots you expect and more. you also get a very good sense of the 1970s era, it feels like a movie made in the 70s with modern quality. some parts look gritty like they used 35mm film.overall i think this is one of, if not the best movie I've ever seen. i saw it 4 days ago and i cant stop thinking and replaying scenes from the movie in my head. i cannot wait for it to come out on blu ray. obviously go see it if your an F1 fan, but even if you aren't i guarantee you will like it. take your girlfriend or sister or mom to go see it and they will enjoy it no matter what. and you definitely wont be bored, it kept me on the edge of my seat the entire movie. not one person left the theater once it started.",

While we learn from the start that Lauda is the best in the world, and Hunt is right behind with more hunger to surpass the man he describes several times as a \"rat,\" we never learn enough about either, deep down, to make their stint on the rip-roaring Indy 500, composed of a year-long globe-spanning circuit shown in speedy montage sequences, really matter.",

            "content": "On the day I watched Rush I had just been listening to a film review show from Mark Kermode and Simon Mayo from early January 2014 in which they had discussed an acceptable moratorium for spoilers. Kermode's reasoning for always being careful is that even if something happened in real life, it is unfair to assume everyone knows this, so it is worth avoiding details of the ends of movies. At the time it was a discussion I just listened to but it came back to me when watching Rush because many months prior in their review, the pair did not talk about the outcome of the story or the fates of the characters involved. This was important to me because I did not know of these guys apart from their names \u2013 I was born in the 1970s and really only watched F1 for a few years when Hill and Schumacher were going at it, so for me this was a real thriller and not just a dramatic retelling of stories I knew already.And I watched it as such although I acknowledge that for those in the know, perhaps the film will have a different impact. For me though I really enjoyed it because one of the main things it does is to show how totally life and death the sport was back then, how unforgiving the conditions were and how everything was being driven right on the edge of what was possible. As it is an American film there is perhaps more explanation than was necessary, plus the races themselves are really cut down to be a handful of sequences of overtaking and dramatics; again this may annoy some, but as someone who drifted away from the sport after watching one too many processions around a track, this was fine by me. That said, the racing action is shot with urgency and quick edits around the cars and the driver POV to put the viewer in the middle of the action, although this is not the main weapon, because that is the sound editing.By another coincidence I had recently watched a show with Idris Elba about his passion for cars and speed and one of my complaints had been that the sound of these powerful engines had been impacted upon by unnecessary music, losing a bit of the sense of the power and speed. With Rush the opposite is wonderfully true \u2013 the music can be easy to miss because the main soundtrack is that of the engines. I can only imagine the impact of seeing it in the cinema but even for me the sound effects were great. Outside of the races the creation of the characters is solid \u2013 not deep or detailed but more than enough to make the point and engage the viewer. Hunt and Lauda are shown in broad but effective strokes and their rivalry and begrudging respect is clear \u2013 this is important because although it is a race, the film needs us to be on side with both of them, recognizing the flaws of each but also respecting them.The performances from Hemsworth and Br\u00fchl both work well at this level. I don't know the people from real life but from the clips and summary at the end it seemed like they got it pretty well as it needed to be. The supporting cast continues the \"broad strokes\" approach and are good enough to engage the viewer. Howards' direction is brisk and, although F1 purists may not appreciate the rapid edits and shots, I thought the approach helped build tension. I do think that knowing all the details of the true story will limit the impact of the film at a dramatic level, but I think it is strong enough to hold the interest anyway thanks to how well it tells the story full stop. It may not have a lot of depth and detail, but in the focus on the rivalry and these two men it is engaging with a good hatful of moments which were thrilling and moving.",

            "content": "Not being a racing fan, what intrigued me about the story was the head game rivalry between Formula 1 drivers Niki Lauda (Daniel Bruhl) and James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth). The film begins with Lauda's narration, so one assumes from the outset that he would be the principal character, but the picture is pretty even handed in it's treatment of both men. Diametrically opposed in both temperament and style, Lauda comes across almost boorish in his approach to racing, while Hunt represents the playboy sportsman looking to score with women virtually every moment he's not on the track. As far as that goes, the film probably overdid it in that regard, especially when an injured Hunt with his guts practically hanging out decides to have a fling with a hospital nurse. With all the name calling, middle finger waving and salty language between the two men, I wasn't left disappointed as the story was winding down, in as much as Hunt came to respect his rival as a worthy opponent on the race track. It appeared to go both ways actually, even as one or the other had to accept inevitable defeat from one race to the next. As far as the race footage itself, exciting enough I guess for fans who go for it. For this viewer it was an incidental part of the story.",

When Niki Lauda told the BRM guys the car was too heavy, it gave me a chill. When I hung around BRM, they were struggling to develop a new motor. They came up with a contraption called an H-15. It was massive, and it was heavy. The N\u00fcrburgring is not just dangerous, it wrecks cars with its dips and rolls. A heavy car bottoms out and destroys its undercarriage, and sure enough...well, so much for BRM. The H-15 was before this story. Obviously, BRM never learned their lesson.Of course, there's the human element. I've often thought that bullfighters and race car drivers are the only successors to the gladiators. The personal and professional rivalry between Niki Lauda and James Hunt reveals the mentality behind men who flirt with violent death. For one it's a means to an end, for the other it's the end in itself. And this is the hub of the story.Rush is the real thing. It is simply the best racing movie ever made.

No smoking on the screen because we don't want to set a bad example and somebody in the audience might be offended. Internal demons are overcome. Happy endings follow.\"Rush\" is a lot more textured than that, and Howard's directorial devices are muted but effective. Not a lot of time is given over to off-track romances. A couple meet and spend a few minutes together, then there is a cut to their marriage, sparing the viewer the agony of indecision and uncertainty and sobs. That comes later, but again it's just as quickly over with. And there are surprising grace notes. Before a more than usually dangerous race, there is the brief silhouette of a particularly venomous looking spider crawling in that deliberate spiderly way down a vertical surface. Just a second or two. More would have cheapened the shot. Less would have shrieked \"egomania\".The tale, of course, is based on a true 1976b story of rivalry between two Formula I racing car drivers -- Chris Hemsworth, an English playboy with long blond hair, and Daniel Br\u00fchl, an ambitious Austrian with a face like a garden gnome.Immediately, we like Hemsworth and dislike Br\u00fchl. Hemsworth is more handsome and has a more immediately appealing personality. It's a tribute to the director and the writer, Peter Morgan, that over time, as we get to understand both men better, they cross the finish line in a tie.The racing scenes are kept within bounds, sometimes skipped entirely and announced on TV or read about in a newspaper. The balance is just about right. And so is the explicitness of Br\u00fchl's injuries and the pain of his recovery. They aren't dwelt on or milked for a cheap gush of sympathy.The two women mainly involved with Hemsworth and Br\u00fchl need to be mentioned. Olivia Wilde is stunning in a felinesque way. Her birth surname is Cockburn and the family includes a number of well-known journalists and diplomats. She has dual citizenship with the US and Ireland, which perhaps explains why she is able to pull off her Brit accent with such conviction. She's the model who marries Hemsworth and divorces him to run off with Richard Burton.Alexandra Maria Lara meets Br\u00fchl by accident and they're quickly married. She's extraordinarily beautiful but in a quite different way from Wilde. Wilde radiates sexuality. She might consume you. But Lara, both in appearance and demeanor, suggests a gentler kind of love, quieter, less demonstrative, less feral, more nurturing. The women match the men they marry very well.It's a well done picture, not part of the usual Hollywood effluvium.",

            "content": "Friederich Nietzsche identified enduring dichotomies within and amongst us that make our world tick. These two attitudes, both named after Greek Gods, have clashing features. Apollo, son of Zeus, stands for order, logic and reason while Dionysius, the God of Wine, represents chaos, madness and drunkenness. Nietzsche thinks we need both. It emerges from nature itself and can be applied in our day-to-day activities, from art, psychology, ethics to politics.Apollonian way of doing things can be visualised how a scientist functions with his obsession with precision, discipline and punctuality. The Dionysian effect can be seen in music and art form, which may appear chaotic and not following the rules but nevertheless is music as it is, pleasant to the ears and emotive.Nietzche saw the fusion of frenzied energy of the Dionysian to be applied constructively inside an Apollonian framework as ideal.This biopic depiction of the professional rivalry between two F1 racing legends, Niki Lauda and James Hunt brings us to a time when F1 racing meant booze, girls and drug. Even though the movie depicts them as mortal enemies, in real life, they were close friends and had kept in touch for a long time.James Hunt is the impulsive hard-drinking, the hard-partying late-night bad boy of F1. Lauda, on the other hand, is a fastidious, calculative and disciplined racer who prepares his every move meticulously and goes to bed early.A memorable quote in the film goes like this. 'Drivers are revered not because of what they do, driving around in circles but because of their brush with death. The closer they are with death, the more people find them fascinating.' I suppose the same applies to other professions that deal with or hold people's life at the clutch of their hands. This would include people in the medical fraternity or in the mafia business.This opposing features in the drivers form a compelling narrative for a cliffhanging adrenaline-fueled, rubber-burning suspense at the F1 track set in the early to mid-70s. The excellent direction by Ron Howard makes the experience more enjoyable.Life would be boring if everyone conforms to a universal set of rules and practises fair play all the way. The Apollonian and Dionysian dichotomy remains a useful way to view art, psychology, society and every other aspect of life.",

I detect an unspoken bond of brotherhood between them, even though they appear to be sworn enemies.

            "content": "Director Ron Howard ('A Beautiful Mind', 'Frost/Nixon', 'Da Vinci Code', 'Apollo 13' etc) doesn't narrate the story of 'Rush' by letting you choose sides through one driver's perspective. In fact, with some adept writing by Peter Morgan ('The Queen', 'Frost/Nixon'), we travel in time to witness the events that lead up to the Formula 1 World Championship of 1976 and the formation of an unparallelled rivalry. Back then, racing wasn't as safe as it now is. It was rather an era when recklessness and flamboyance brought glory to some racers while two of the others on the grid, died every year. In the midst of this, are two men driven by danger; two rivals driven by passion; two legends driven by each other. Ron Howard is renowned for having a keen sense of the idiosyncrasies of his protagonists and here too, he depicts the influence of their personal lifestyles that shaped their racing styles. But where he really excels, is with the rivalry on track. The sheer thrill, excitement and dangers of Formula 1 racing are brilliantly captured as we travel the globe through stormy wet weather with cars screaming across the screen at 170 mph. They called him a loose cannon but his raw talent was unmistakable. James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) was aggressive on the circuit and foolhardy off it. Being an outspoken, alcoholic casanova was his way of having fun and believed that it was a necessary balance to the challenges of being a risk-taking race car driver. With an independent, small budget team, Hunt moves up from Formula 3 to the join the ranks of the F1 racers, only to meet his nemesis from the past season. The methodical, reserved but often brash and terribly fast Niki Lauda (Daniel Bruhl) enters Formula 1 by buying out a team with his loaned money and engineers his car meticulously to be the fastest man and champion in only his second season. The cool headed and thoughtful Lauda was quite the opposite of the aggressive and impulsive Hunt and therefore, their confrontations are a treat to watch and more often than not, they battle it out on the track. The film's turning point though is the incident at the German GP in Nurburgring (deemed to be too unsafe to race on by Lauda). 6 weeks later, a struggle for survival, the willpower to race again and the hunger for victory, bring the rivals together once more to fight for the title. In the spectacularly soaked Japanese GP, the engines rev up once more and the tyres spin over the track in a thrilling finale to one of the greatest rivalries in sports history.Ron Howard has made his most exhilarating and brilliant film. Peter Morgan's exemplary screenplay and dialogue make the confrontations between the drivers edgy while giving the story some good substance to keep the non-racing scenes interesting as well. Cinematography by Anthony Dod Mantle is quite simply, superb. The close up of rain drops against wheels spinning off the starting grid, the gloomy sun on a stormy race day in Japan, the slow motion effects of the crashes and the point-of-view angles during the races make for some compelling viewing. The essence of Hans Zimmer's background score is the theme of each race being a risk that is only rewarded with a victory. The tone somehow reflects the aggression and tragedy of the rivalry itself and is quite epic upon reflection. The ravishing Olivia Wilde and a well composed Alexandra Maria Lara support the racers on and off the track but the film is completely dominated by the two powerful performances of the racers. Chris Hemsworth is quite a revelation when one simply attributes his noteworthy work to being an angry, strong yet charming superhero. With his aggressive driving, impulsive drive for sex and outspoken brashness, Hemsworth appears well collected and mature to tackle the challenges of being the legendary James Hunt. Among his best scenes is one with some positive argument with Lauda towards the end of the film, where he justifies his lifestyle and his winning ways. While one sees the fun, reckless and victorious Hunt, there couldn't have been a better portrayal of his opposite. Daniel Bruhl has portrayed Niki Lauda in the most remarkable manner. With the prosthetics and speech, Bruhl emphasizes the technicalities and his focus to take racing seriously just as the living legend would. Much more reserved than Hunt ever was, Lauda was a dedicated and disciplined racer for whom mental focus and physical conditioning were key to winning in a well engineered car. Bruhl's performance showcases this keen understanding of Niki Lauda while adding the matter-of-factness to his dialogues. He seldom smiles because when he does, the joke is upon him. In being calculative, his emotion of happiness in love is a loss to him as he considers it a weakness that won't let him risk it all on the track. Driven by the actors' sincerest performances, 'Rush' feels more alive. Peter Morgan's exemplary writing gives the film its exciting moments and Mantle's superb cinematography brings the thrilling intensity of F1 racing on the big screen in epic fashion. Ron Howard pulled in some great talent and added his expertise of characterized drama with a surprising jolt of epic visuals to recreate the magical era of racing in the 70s. James Hunt and Niki Lauda conclude an important point of the story that they are both driven by each other. From their low points to their victories, what kept them going, was their rivalry and their hunger for victory. They often reached a physical and emotional breaking point but there was no margin of error when the championship was at stake. 'Rush' is a grand prize from Ron Howard and should be cherished by fans of Formula 1 racing as well as movie-goers who simply like a tale of triumphant human spirits. 9.14 on a scale of 1-10.",

            "content": "No motion picture in history has so accurately portrayed the anxiety, thrill, elation and perils of competitive motor racing as Ron Howard's excellent 'Rush'. A gripping drama based on the real-life rivalry between Formula One adversaries James Hunt and Niki Lauda that culminated in their history-making bout for the 1976 world championship title, it has the very rare honour of being a sports movie not just for fans of the sport itself, but a celebration of a universal need within every individual for purpose and achievement.That need is exemplified in the two duelling, diametrically opposite individuals at the heart of the film. Hunt (played by \"Thor\" star Chris Hemsworth) is a British playboy who loves the game for the chance again and again to live life dangerously close to death, the epitome - if you will - of a stereotypical F1 driver who lives and drives recklessly and fearlessly. Lauda, on the other hand, is a methodical tactician, constantly assessing the odds and \"looking at the big picture\", careful and calculating where Hunt is careless and cavalier.Their approach to the game isn't all that sets them apart; while Hunt is sexy and charismatic, Lauda is often terse and brusque. While Hunt hits the parties and downs the booze the night before and the night after every race, Lauda avoids these excesses, and cares nothing for hanging out with his team members to build camaraderie. The only thing they have in common is their family background, both racers hailing from distinguished families that did not support their racing dreams, a fact elaborated in greater detail in Hunt's case to illustrate the conservative Viennese upbringing that likely contributed to his chilly personality.Neophytes as we are to F1's history, that we are able to learn so much about Hunt and Lauda is credit to Peter Morgan's character-driven screenplay, which devotes an extraordinary amount of attention to fleshing out both personas and allowing his audience to draw out the obvious contrasts between them. This isn't a film where the only thing that matters is what happens on the race track; rather, Howard emphasises the fundamental differences between these two men, which makes their race on the track a battle not only for glory but one stemming from their divisive personal values and beliefs - and as we learn, the reason why either one eventually develops fierce mutual respect for the other.But before we get to that turning point, Howard recounts in largely chronological fashion their beginnings as brash newcomers in Formula Three racing and their ascent into the big F1 league. The briskly paced setup that covers Lauda's strategic entry into the Ferrari team by his mechanical ingenuity, as well as Hunt's more rocky start under the eccentric Lord Hesketh (Christian McKay) and subsequently Team McClaren, uses these key events to ratchet the tension between Lauda and Hunt, building up of course towards the seminal 1976 F1 racing season where their acrimony reaches its climax.Confidently allowing the drama to take centrestage for the first half of the movie, Howard leaves much of the race action for the latter half of the movie as the 1976 season gets underway. The highlight of it all is of course the dramatic centrepiece at the Nurburgring track in Germany - also known as 'The Graveyard' - where Lauda will be trapped in his burning car for close to a minute and suffer third-degree burns to his head and lungs. Those who know the story will also remember that he will get back on the track an amazing 42 days later, and Howard spares no detail in showing his extraordinary tale of tenacity - including the agonizing medical procedure of vacuuming his lungs he had to endure.It all pays off extraordinarily in an exceptionally thrilling and yet deeply poignant finish set around the Fuji Speedway amidst pelting rain. A quick search online will probably tell you what happened during that race, but we advise those who yet know the story to let Howard's film have the honour of taking you out on that breath-taking final race of the season that provides beautiful closure to the running theme of just what and how we choose our lives to be driven by. It is also by far one of the most emotionally intense cappers we have experienced this year, a perfect combination of Howard's masterful direction, Anthony Dod Mantle's expert cinematography (that uses compact digital cameras mounted within the cars to bring his viewer right into the heat of the action), and deft editing of hundreds of shots from various perspectives.And yet this remains through and through a story built on two fascinating characters, which Hemsworth and Bruhl nail with adroit precision. Best known for being 'Thor', Hemsworth brings impressive depth to a character that could easily have been cartoonish, balancing on a very thin fine line bravado and vulnerability to rise above caricature. German actor Bruhl shines in his first Hollywood role (he'll next be seen opposite Cumberbatch in the WikiLeaks drama 'The Fifth Estate'), and besides exuding determination and poise at every turn, he also brings a rough charm to his character.With 'Rush', Howard once again asserts himself as a maestro of smart adult-oriented entertainment built on complex but always compelling real-life characters. It easily stands out as one of his best, and the same can be said of Morgan, their second collaboration since 'Frost/ Nixon' paying off in a truly amazing film that is gripping at every physical turn on the track and every dramatic turn off it. Combining larger-than-life characters with white-knuckle racing thrills, 'Rush' Is not just one of the best sports movies we have seen, but indeed one of the very best films that you'll see this year.",

            "content": "Ron Howard delivers an adrenaline-high, well-paced, expertly photographed ode to 70s Grand Prix racing, following the thrilling rivalry between calculating, brilliant, but cold and not-quite-ingratiating Austrian, Niki Lauda (Daniel Br\u00fchl) and party-hearty, womanizing, handsome buck, James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth). The dueling egos, bravado, swapped barbs rippling with honesty, and incredible talent of both men makes for some high drama. Every cinematic trick (the ways Howard shoots the cars during races and reactions towards all the key dramatic moments, such as Lauda's tormented near-death experience thanks to burns from his car's fire consumption and agonizing hospital recovery and the rainy Japanese final formula race that Hunt narrowly survives to win the world championship) Howard uses to create a marvel of visual power. I think the racing is what many will come to this film for, and that will not disappoint. There's also a pretty damn good story here, too. It's a biopic about racing legends who drove each other to be as good as they could be. Howard knows how to recreate history on film and he carefully avoids the pratfalls that could belie a 70s biopic through cunning editing and avoiding taking Rush away from the track too much. Both leads match their real-life personas, not only looking like them but providing gravitas to these characters to give them dimension. I love fast cars and them racing in competition tugs at my testosterone. Rush would fit perfectly in a double feature with John Frankenheimer's Grand Prix (1966). The rehab and return to racing after the burning for Niki is absolutely harrowing. There's no doubt that Hemsworth is a stud and has the right charisma to portray such a larger-than-life person as James Hunt. Niki's courage and guts after such suffering is quite astonishing. I personally consider Howard's Rush superior filmmaking.",

            "content": "In \"Rush,\" Oscar-winning helmer Ron Howard returns to the subject matter that he cut his teeth on as a film director: fast cars. In 1977, Howard made his directorial debut with the hilarious manhunt comedy \"Grand Thief Auto\" (1977) for executive producer Roger Corman about characters careening around in cars. Like \"Grand Theft Auto,\" \"Rush\" focuses on fast cars. Unlike \"Grand Theft Auto,\" where amateurs did the driving, skilled professionals are behind the wheels in \"Rush.\" Not only do they travel at higher speeds, but they also tread more treacherous roads. This polished but predictable saga has to do with the historic rivalry between Formula One British speedster James Hunt and Austrian automotive genius Niki Lauda. \"Rush\" spends most of its leisurely 123 minutes on its protagonists and their clashes rather than the experience of hurling along European thoroughfares at homicidal speeds in the equivalent of bobsleds on wheels with rocket fuel. Aussie-born Chris Hemsworth of \"Thor\" has been cast appropriately enough as Hunt, while Spanish actor Daniel Br\u00fchl impersonates Niki Lauda. Historically, Lauda and Hunt jostled each other for the top position during the 1976 Grand Prix racing season. Ron Howard keeps the soap opera scenes with the love interests of both racers to a minimum so as to maintain momentum over the long haul. Consequently, Olivia Wilde and Alexandra Maria Lara look dazzling but have little to say. Ultimately, these two competitors would come to realize that their ruthless rivalry enhanced their racetrack performance. An enduring, universal, life-truth lurks beneath all the scenic cities, challenging racetracks, and the charismatic performers in \"Rush.\" In the self-help handbook for mercenaries and rogues in general, \"The Seventy Maxims of Maximally Effective Mercenaries\" observes: \"The world is richer when you turn enemies into friends, but that's not the same as you being richer.\" \"Rush\" unfolds in 1976 as our protagonists are poised to race at the Nurburgring track in Germany. No sooner has Howard and Morgan established this momentous setting than they flashback to show how Hunt and Lauda got their respective starts in Formula 3 racing. Hunt's father plead with his son to become a physician. Lauda's father had planned to take his son into the family business. Naturally, neither patriarch funds their sons' racetrack fantasies, and our heroes go out and make things happen for themselves. Hunt finds a wealthy sponsor enamored of racing to put him behind the wheel, while Lauda buys his way onto the Ferrari team. Hunt treats Lauda with utter contempt and refers to him as a rat. Lauda points out rats possess a highly developed instinct for survival. Howard cuts back and forth between these two and creates some palatable suspense as they chase each other throughout the Grand Prix. Mind you, the suspense doesn't so much lie in the actual driving sequences, where speeds of 170 mph is typical, but in their face-to-face confrontations. Lauda doesn't race to defy death as Hunt does. Hunt claims woman are attracted to him because he lays his life on the line in every race. On the other hand, Lauda races to survive rather than die. He has a twenty per cent rule that governs his decision when to race. Lauda refuses to participate if the chances are greater than twenty per cent that he may perish. Hunt challenges Lauda at one point when the Austrian tries to convince his competitors to cancel the rain-swept Nurburgring track. Hunt humiliates Lauda for urging them to cancel the race. Eventually, Lauda allows himself to be brow-beaten into the race with horrendous results. The courage Lauda musters to recover so swiftly from a nearly fatal accident is inspirational and a testament to his resilience. Lauda's car crashes during the race, and he is badly burnt. Painful skin grafts and having his lungs vacuumed out ensue, and Lauda watches in horror from his hospital bed as Hunt makes up for lost time. Hunt's quick string of victories brings him close to surpassing Lauda. The rivalry really kicks in at this point, and life becomes stranger than fiction.Hemsworth and Br\u00fchl resemble their real-life counterparts. If you delay your departure when the end credits roll, you'll see the actual Hunt and Lauda. Howard slips under their collective skins with \"Frost/Nixon\" scenarist Peter Morgan to explore what drove them. Each racer emerges as complex and three-dimensional. Basically, they are iconoclasts who became heroic legends. Wisely, Howard and Morgan never make either one appear more sympathetic than the other. Most Hollywood movies divide and conquer when it comes to competitors. \"Warrior\" (2011) pitted brother against brother, and one triumphed over the other simply because he generated greater sympathy. Hemsworth has the more ostentatious role. Essentially, Hunt was either behind the wheel or in a lady's boudoir. Comparably, Br\u00fchl creates a strong impression as Niki Lauda. The ascetic Austrian driver shunned all forms of hedonism. He constituted the polar opposite of the glib, fun-loving, skirt-chasing Hunt. Lauda was a perfectionist who constantly devised ways to lighten the weight and improve the performance of his cars. Unlike the milestone racing movies \"Grand Prix\" and \"Le Mans,\" \"Rush doesn't deal with a single race. Instead, Howard provides a tour of the European championship racing circuit. Anthony Dod Mantle's cinematography gives us some vivid glimpses of Formula One racing from behind the steering wheel. Although we come to understand how dangerous driving a Formula One car can be, we are rarely given stretches where the drivers scramble to get beyond each other. \"Rush\" contains the equivalent of a 'greatest hits' montage of the various races. Spectators who don't follow Formula One specifically or car racing in general may not know that these drivers harness themselves into the equivalent of rocket-sleds with jet fuel and roar through the countryside. While speed denotes the winner, skill keeps the driver on the course. Strong characterization, some narrative surprises, and scenic locales distinguish this interesting but sedate racing epic.",

            "content": "Being a fan of Ron Howard as a director, I would say his best films are his historical dramas such as Frost/Nixon, A Beautiful Mind, Apollo 13, and Cinderella Man. You can now add his newest film, Rush, into that group.James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) and Niki Lauda (Daniel Br\u00fchl) are both Formula One race car drivers with wealthy backgrounds. Hunt has proved himself to be a hard working and winning driver. Hunt is a Brit who has a habit of vomiting before every race and is a well known drinker and ladies man. Lauda first bought his way in to being a driver in the Formula Three circuit, and is a technical genius who knows what works best for the cars he races. Hunt and Lauda meet after a Formula Three race where both of their cars spin out of control and Hunt eventually wins the race. Immediately, they don't like each other. Both of them go their separate ways, only to meet again when they each join the ranks of Formula One. Hunt lands a deal to race for McLaren, while Lauda buys his way into a team that races Ferrari's. The film's primary focus is on the 1976 season, and shows us what Hunt's and Lauda's lives were like on and off the race track. Hunt is seen as a ladies man, who settles down with Suzy Miller (Olivia Wilde), while Lauda meets Marlene Knaus (Alexandra Maria Lara) at a party she is ditching. Both racers are very competitive of each other, but don't necessarily have hatred toward each other. They do trash talk to each other, and do their best outdo the other.Ron Howard's direction of this story, is crisp, rapid, and makes some nice choices that make Rush a very exciting film. Howard is great at showing us various shots of what's going on and gets very creative with the camera. Howard does a great job at keeping us interested in the lives of James Hunt and Niki Lauda. Howard also gets excellent performances from his cast. Peter Morgan, who previously collaborated with Howard on Frost/Nixon, delivers a fast paced and crisp screenplay. I like how Morgan managed to make the script feel like a race in itself when combining Hunt's and Lauda's stories.The standouts from the cast of Rush are the two leads, Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Br\u00fchl. Hemsworth excellently portrays James Hunt as more than a drinker who parties and hooks up with the ladies. Hemsworth makes Hunt to be a man determined to win and is ambitious to be the best. Chris Hemsworth gives the best performance of his young career. Daniel Br\u00fchl also gives the best performance of his career. Br\u00fchl shows Niki Lauda to be a sophisticated and knowledgeable driver who knows his cars. Br\u00fchl is also excellent at showing a man who wants to win, but eventually knows when to stop racing.Rush also has a lot of great technical aesthetics to it. One of them is a lot of very unique shots captured by DP Anthony Dod Mantle. Mantle does best at getting the races shown and things happening in the cars and especially point of view shots from the drivers' eyes. The editing by longtime Howard collaborators Dan Hanley and Mike Hill is fast and well put together to tell the story. The makeup department does an excellent job with making Daniel Br\u00fchl look like the real Niki Lauda. The music by Hans Zimmer is fast and electric and makes the races more exciting. The sound department does an excellent job of putting together everything, from the actors' dialogue to the music and the sounds of the cars.",

As a story of the two racers James Hunt and Niki Lauda, Ron Howard's deliberate pace is just right here showing two different personalities both likable and human. In fact because both are so sympathetically portrayed I wanted both to win and it the races had as much meaning as the Ben Hur chariot race. There is a good balance of humor and drama. There may have been some liberties taken to play up the rivalry between the two but it's forgivable.The acting is top notch. Chris Hemsworth gives charisma and charm to the role and shows he can do much more than Thor. Daniel Bruhl of Inglorious uglies up and gives such a touching performance especially after the accident. Olivia Wilde has a brief but effective appearance as Suzy Hunt.Even if you aren't a Formula 1 fan it's still very watchable especially on the big screen.

Here the subject is racing rivalry, not something that would normally having me rushing to the big screen, but that's exactly where 'Rush' should be seen.The topic here is the rivalry between posh boy and self stylised playboy James Hunt, and the more stoic and conservative Nikki Louder. Their competitive nature on the track was something even I vaguely remember, my mother being a James Hunt fan. He was probably a lot of Mums favourites at the time.Why the film works are largely down to two factors, a really well written script which captures the two contrasting characters brilliantly and makes them jump off the page. Chris Hemsworth is well cast as Hunt, despite occasionally missing the mark on the accent and no doubt the late Hunt himself would have been very happy with the casting, but its the German actor Daniel Bruhl who carries off the colours here with his portrayal as the determined no nonsense Nikki Lauda with a really perfectly pitched performance.You never entirely sure who too root for here, which could have been the film's failing, but its not, as Howard manages to convey sympathy for both his characters in equal measure for your capacity to dislike them. The approach of the characters towards life varies as much as it does to their attitude on the track, and this is the engine of this film. The icing on the cake is the racing sequences. Well realised and seamless from any special effects that may have contributed, by the end of the film you will be griped.It's an interesting, well acted film on a subject that I don't especially care for normally, but this film made me care enough to watch it and I am very glad I did.

You have mister hotshot himself points leader and ladies man playboy type the English man James Hunt(Chris Hemsworth). And aside from the hard life of drinking and partying and going to bed with beautiful women left and right he wins race after race around the globe all of a sudden James has a challenge and that's in the form of new driver the serious Austrian Niki Lauda(Daniel Bruhl in a great performance). These two rivals are different like daylight and dark their personal styles go like for one Niki is cool and calm and quiet and pretty boy James is never at a loss for attention. Yet the subplots of personal styles take a backdrop to the thrilling scenes of the heart pounding races the two have against each other on international tracks. This film really did a good job with it's recreation of telling the 1970's world of formula one racing which had a rivalry that not many people knew about. \"Rush\" is a film of personal connection and friendship proving that life is close and always a race on the track no matter what lap you finish in.",

Me and my ladyfriend were kids back then, and we spent those Sunday afternoons glued to the TV whenever there was a F1 race on, so this was a really nostalgic trip too - but the cameras are so much nearer to the cars here, you're inside the action and the angry engine sounds out of a theater PA system really make all the difference - there are moments of pure adrenaline bliss here. It's been a long, long time since I've watched any car race on TV but for my taste, they could have included even more race scenes, they were that good.All the adrenaline can't save a movie if you don't care, but in \"Rush\", we do. Both leads are excellent; of course Br\u00fchl as Lauda has the meatier and more dramatic role and more screen time but Hemsworth did a great job, too. Supporting roles are also good, with special nods to Alexandra Maria Lara as Niki's wife Marlene. There's a 50 minute doc available on youtube about the Hunt/Lauda rivalry and the 76 championship where you can see a bit of real-life Marlene and she really nailed it. What I missed were a few more of the legendary 70s drivers, only Regazzoni has a speaking part, most others only get a few background seconds.I liked Hans Zimmer's music, sometimes he's too foreground for my taste but in \"Rush\", he keeps it subtle.The real-life story gets a bit condensed for the screen and writer Morgan / director Howard often use a rather coarse brush to paint their characters, but that really doesn't lessen the enjoyment.

            "content": "'RUSH': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Director Ron Howard's critically acclaimed sports drama about the 1976 Formula One season rivalry between drivers James Hunt and Niki Lauda. Chris Hemsworth (of 'THOR' fame) and Daniel Bruhl star as the two champion drivers. Peter Morgan wrote the screenplay and he's well known for writing critically acclaimed award winning historical dramas, usually centering around the relationship between two people (like 'THE LAST KING OF Scotland', 'THE QUEEN' and another Ron Howard directed film 'FROST/NIXON'). This is another great example of the kind of storytelling Morgan is great at and Howard does an amazing job bringing it to life as well!The film traces Hunt (Hemsworth) and Lauda's (Bruhl) rivalry back to their first meeting at a 1970 Formula Three race in England. Hunt won that battle but Lauda then went on to 'buy his way in' to Formula One racing by taking out a loan and joining the Scuderia Ferrari team in 1975. Hunt's underdog team Hesketh Racing also entered the Formula One season that year but couldn't find sponsors and was forced to drop out after just that season (which Lauda won). Hunt then entered the 1976 competition as part of McLaren's team and (with a much better automobile to operate) became strong competition for Lauda that year. The film chronicles their obsessive rivalry and their lives off the track (Hunt being a wild 'lady's man' and Lauda being a calculated nerd). It also focuses on their relationships with two women (played by Olivia Wilde and Alexandra Maria Lara).I knew little about the sport (at that time, or any really) and hadn't heard about Hunt or Lauda or their rivalry (prior to seeing the film) but I was still glued to the screen and totally involved. I could really relate to the passion and drive of both characters (I find myself ideally wanting to be more like Hunt but could understand both men). For me the movie was very moving in that way. Hemsworth has mostly just been known as an action movie star up to this point but this film finally gives him the chance to show off his acting abilities for a change (which are impressive). Bruhl is equally amazing in his role (probably more so) and totally becomes Niki Lauda. I can't say how accurate the film is but I do know the real Lauda loved it (Hunt passed away years ago) and said \"There was no Hollywood changes or things changed a little bit Hollywood-like. It is very accurate. And this really surprised me very positively\". I think Morgan's script really made the film work but also Howard's directing. Howard is well respected by critics and audiences alike but some cinephiles (that think they're smarter than everyone else) like to call him a hack; 'a director that just tries to make commercial friendly Oscar bait'. I disagree. I think sometimes his lesser films come off that way but he's definitely put a lot of heart and talent into making a lot of great films as well (and this is one of them). The cinematography (by Anthony Dod Mantle) is gorgeous and the score music (by Hans Zimmer) is beautiful and breathtakingly moving as well (some of the best I've heard in any film all year). It's a film not to be missed!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-D0yOH-Zx4",

Although much more subtle and restrained than for example Cinderella Man (two adjectives you never thought you would see in a review of a racing film) this production is never less than hypnotic and viewer interest never wanes, not for a single frame. And a great story too -- some 30 years after the incredible Amadeus we have yet another rivalry for the history books. Hemsworth actually gets to speak entire sentences when he is away from Asguard, and, who knew, he is a very competent actor. Daniel Br\u00fchl is superb, especially considering his character is repeatedly described in the script as looking like a rat, and Bruhl has to compensate with raw unfiltered self-esteem, and pulls it off. Olivia Wilde is a treasure here -- it's not just the hair and makeup, it's like someone took her aside and told her that, unless she could find her inner Candice Bergin, her career playing tart after tart might just be over. For her first few scenes, she is almost unrecognizable, and she manages that feat by sheer force of will. Ironically, considering the theme, the finish is a tad weaker than the opening. Overall, however, a wonderfully entertaining film, timeless and memorable.",

            "review_title": "Gather ye forth to hear the epic tale of Hunt and Lauda, as told by Howard of Oklahoma!",
            "content": "Sport and the rivalry between champions has been an integral part of Western drama and culture since it's inception in ancient Greece, replete with archetypes of struggle, hubris, victory and loss, triumph and tragedy. With the advent of organised mass participation sports in the 20th century, the sports tales enjoyed a revival in popular culture, but their basic structure and purpose remained intact. \"Rush\" is just such a tale, taken from real life and made into an epic poem for the masses.The sport in question is Formula 1 (The world racing league popular especially in Europe, Asia and South America but largely unknown in the USA) which has all the required thrills of speed, skill and danger as well as brilliant mavericks at the wheel, the modern day epic charioteers. The story it tells is that of the infamous 1976 season - a period when danger and death still stalked the sport in a way that has been largely erased today -and the rivalry between two legendary drivers, the Briton James Hunt and the Austrian Niki Lauda. The two came from similar backgrounds (wealthy business families) which they shunned to pursue the chequered flag. However their personalities were polar opposites, Hunt was the typical Errol Flynn style devil may care cad gay-blade and libertine, living for the girls, the booze,the adventure and the Devil take tomorrow. Lauda on the other hand was the cold, clinical rationalist technocrat who calculated everything in terms of percentages, including risk, and who treated fun and happiness as enemies of a stable existence. The media naturally played up the rivalry and turned the season into a battle between the two. Their rivalry was indeed very personal, and the two never lost an opportunity to mock or belittle the other, yet like all epic enemies they not only respected each other but needed each other, one not whole without the other, day and night, ying and yang. Like all epic tales, theirs came complete with shades of both victory and tragedy. Lauda crashed and was terribly scarred by fire during the Nurburgring race, nearly dying, yet he fought back and even returned to racing mere weeks later, still contesting the title, and despite losing to Hunt, went on to win many more championships and became a successful business mogul and technological innovator to boot. Hunt fought back against seemingly endless hurdles and setbacks to claw impossible victory with sheer guts and pluck to take the world championship, yet his wild ways destroyed his marriage and happiness then eventually his whole life, ending up dead aged just 45.The film is a British-European one, telling a European legend, yet it has the most American of directors, Ron Howard. Surprisingly, the film is largely devoid of Howard's trademark sugariness and mawkish sentimentality save for the final coda, and even that feels strangely appropriate given the story he has told.Instead it showcases Howard's technical flare and experienced hand, telling the convergent and then concomitant stories of Hunt and Lauda, including their courtships and marriages, in just two hours in a time when even action movies with nothing to say scrape the three hour mark as a norm. His visual skill is also notable, not only in the all important Formula 1 scenes, which wisely follow Frankenheimer's example in \"Grand Prix\", but also in giving the film a good sense of period feel. For a cheap film, it looks great. The script by Peter Morgan also follows classical form and avoids making it a simplistic battle between a \"good guy\" and a \"bad guy\" (as many sports biographies do to their shame and detriment), instead giving us two great heroes, flaws and all.The score comes courtesy of the legendary Hans Zimmer, and is strictly in the \"Gladiator\" mould (aptly enough) with epic themes laced with anthems of struggle and victory, and laments of tragedy and loss. Complementing it is a selection of fantastic songs from the period from the likes of Thin Lizzy, David Bowie, Mud, Slade, Stevie Winwood, Clara Nunes & Rosanna Fratello.Of course everything hangs on the actors playing the mythic heroes, and here is the film's greatest strength, two well known skillful actors who also look remarkably similar to their real life counterparts. Chris Hemsworth, playing the dashing heroic Hunt with an upper class English brogue naturally evokes \"Thor\", yet the evocation is suitable, as both are mythic figures who start out as cads and grow into wisdom. He finds both the dash and the inner pain of the character and makes us care for him despite his many faults. Similarly, Daniel Bruhl, best known as the sniper in \"Inglorious Bastards\", gives us a Lauda who is cold, unlikeable, rude, very arrogant and superior, and a poor loser, yet also finds the buried spark of life in the man, a passion that is expressed in the language of mechanics but comes from a strong heart, especially in the powerful bond he has with his wife Marlene. She is played excellently by Alexandra Maria Lara, while Hunt's rather temporary wife, supermodel Suzy Miller, is played by an unrecognisable Olivia Wilde, emoting pathos for the love she hoped for but never found. The rest of the cast is well filled with excellent veteran character actors, including Pierfrancesco Favino as Ferrari teammate Clay Regazzoni and Christian McKay as Hunt's humorous aristocratic backer Lord Hesketh.A powerful and engrossing human story, epic poem and true life chronicle, it is enjoying great popularity in Europe and elsewhere but will inevitably face problems in F1-phobic America. Let us hope it can cross this cultural barrier, as many, many US sports movies have coming in the opposite direction, and be enjoyed for the universal tale it is, well told, thrilling and uplifting.",

You don't really need to be a F1 racing fan or even be aware of what actually goes on in that sport to truly appreciate this film because what it depicts in its two hours of runtime isn't something that is exclusive to this very sport; It's about how our rivals sometimes bring out the best in us when we have got something to defend or overcome.The direction by Ron Howard is brilliant, the screenplay by Peter Morgan is pretty authentic, plus the vivid cinematography & concise editing only added more depth to the film's storyline but the real highlight of this film is its two fabulous performances coming from Chris Hemsworth & Daniel Br\u00fchl as Hunt & Lauda, respectively, amongst which Br\u00fchl ends up stealing the show in a very closely fought battle. And the music by Hans Zimmer infuses an energy of its own into this film to enrich the overall experience.On an overall scale, this film is one of the best sports dramas to come out in recent years and is an immensely well-made & highly satisfying ride of adrenaline rush that delivers the goods in just the right doses with its vibrant pace, intense action, arresting music & solid performances from its cast.

            "content": "Now, before I start reviewing, let me just state that I'm a huge F1 fan. I followed this sport since I was 11, and more specifically I followed Kimi Raikkonen since the start of his F1 career. I thought this movie was a great representation of not only the rivalry but of the sport itself. Sure, they dramatised the rivalry between Nikki Lauda and James Hunt. In reality they weren't on each other's throat as they were in the movie. In fact, at one point they were even house mates. But I love the whole message of the movie overall; What Drives You. It is exactly what these drivers are. They look death straight in the eye every time they are on track, and that pushes them to drive to their best. I love this quote by James Hunt in the movie:\"Don't go to men who are willing to kill themselves driving in circles looking for normality\"The danger, the risks, and ultimately driving is an F1 driver's definition of normality. When you have a passion for something, no matter what happens you just can't stop. F1 drivers has pants full of passion. A lot of drivers had accidents in their careers whether it was a big one or a small one. Some almost led them to their death. On top of my head, I remembered when Kubica flipped over, that was a scary crash. He managed to walk out of it with just bruises and scratches and continued racing. How bout when Massa was hit by a fallen suspension spring and dove head first into the barriers, he injured his head and had a platinum plate installed in his skull. But that didn't stop him from racing when he was well enough. Ralf Schumacher injured his spine. Same story when Lauda crashed. He had third degree burns and still opted to drive even when he wasn't fully recovered. These people don't see any way out of it. Either you go big and win or you don't do the sport at all which is probably equivalent to death for them which is what this movie is about. At the start it might be about rivalry but at the end its what you risk for passion and how much it means to you.By dramatising the rivalry, the movie has come up with characters with completely different personalities. You have Hunt, the brash, aggressive and handsome driver, who is a loose cannon and feeds on the thrill of driving and also on the attention. Kinda reminds me of a couple of drivers in F1 *cough* Sebastian Vettel *cough*. Then you have the straight and narrow Lauda, who is more interested in the mechanics and precision of the sport. He works very close with the mechanics and with the car to optimise his chances of winning. Something that all the drivers has learnt from, you have to know your car and be one with it. He is confident and not afraid to speak his mind, which can make him look like an asshole at times. The movie is not very technical in the sense that it doesn't go very deep into the sport or even about the cars. It mainly focuses on the drivers aspect of it and in a way brings a human touch to the sport. Which is good as the audience does not need to be a fan of the sport to get it. It's not all about the machine and the cars. Its also about the drivers and how much skill they have to acquire to drive at 300 mph. And that's why I think fans love the sport, we respect how much these drivers have to put in and also how much it goes into building a car like that. Its a perfect marriage of man and machine. There was even a slight reflection of the politics that goes on in the F1 world especially when Ferrari was angry at Lauda for not continuing when Lauda thought it was too dangerous.The cinematography is great in this movie. It really gives a vintage feel to it but not overdoing it to make it look artistic. The colours and lighting was executed subtly but perfectly to really enhance the feel of the movie. I was actually very impressed by it. Good job on both the actors but really kudos to Daniel Bruhl for embodying Nikki Lauda. It was as though the part was made for him. I would say overall it was a great film, not only for F1 fans. If anybody has wondered why people love F1, I suggest watching this film.",

Yes, it has enough of a budget to include some (pretty realistic) re-enactments of motor racing from the seventies (when it's set), but don't think that that's all there is here.It's based on the real life rivalry between two formula one drivers in the seventies. Now, normally when you have a film like this, one of the drivers is the 'goodie' and one is the 'baddie.' However, here, both have their pros and cons and sometimes you'll find yourself rooting for Thor (joke) and sometimes for the other one (not Thor).It's basically a good drama with some entertaining driving scenes thrown in. If you can forgive Thor's (slightly dubious) 'British' accent, then you'll probably have a good time. I hear from what I've read on the internet that it's actually quite a historically accurate representation of what went on in the seventies, so bonus points for \u2013 apparently \u2013 getting it right.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",

But with Rush, it was difficult to find that something. It was just terrifically made. And I'm not being a biased gearhead either. Granted, I did not know too much about these two drivers until the movie came out. And maybe there were other highlights from the 1976 seasons that were not included, but that was not the point of the movie. First and foremost, a big shout out to the make-up crew and whoever else deals with the appearance of the actors because what they have done is marvelous. I looked into the way the real Hunt, Lauda, and others looked and there was not much of a difference. I have not seen a documentary type film be so accurate in that respect maybe ever. And the actors. Man, they really knew their characters well. Job very well done. What Ron Howard has done here is expose what really goes on in a driver's mind on and off the track and how he interacts with his competitors. For the duration of the film, the viewer is immersed in the world of Formula 1 and all the drama associated with it. It is impossible to not have your heart beat at an elevated rate and impossible to not develop a connection with the people and the time because everything in the film was very 1970s (at least, what I know of the 1970s), including the clothing and all the technology. All in all, Rush is probably the best motorsport movie I have ever watched and definitely one of the best overall. I was truly touched by the story of James Hunt and Niki Lauda and learned a lot in the process about the history of Formula 1. It is extremely genuine and not one to be missed at all!

Not so with RUSH. In what is the best film that Ron Howard has done in years, Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Bruhl give excellent performances as James Hunt and Niki Lauda: Formula One drivers whose rivalry gave each other purpose and motivation to succeed. As personalities, they couldn't have been more different. James Hunt was brash, more of a ladies' man and reveled in the fame that being a race car driver afforded. Niki Lauda was more cold, calculating and concerned with the technical aspects of racing, and he could also be quite blunt. What I liked about this movie, aside from the racing aspect, was the examination of these two polar opposite personalities and the way in which they pushed each other forward. There is plenty of screen time allotted to establishing their characters, and once they meet, sparks fly. I thought both Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Bruhl did an excellent job in portraying these two men, and made it seem very believable. Of course, this is a racing movie, so the other question would be how that aspect stacks up. No lie, this movie had some of the best, and most thrilling racing sequences I've seen. Ever. Apparently, they had actual drivers (and the actors) drive Formula One cars at high speeds and attached cameras to the outside to capture the feel of what it would be like to be in one of those cars. It was really exhilarating stuff, and it's a pity that I wasn't able to catch this in theaters when it first came out. I also should mention the incredible score by Hans Zimmer, who is quickly becoming one of my favorite film composers. He created an epic feel, not unlike what he did with Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy. Still, it was distinct from that iconic score and added a lot to the overall feel of the film. There was also a good selection of 1970's classic rock. Overall, there's not a thing I can think of that's even a little wrong with this film. Every aspect of it perfectly displays the skills of the talent involved, and the central story elevates it above your typical sports drama. Even if sports movies aren't your thing, you'd be remiss for not giving this one a try.",

Happily and wisely, I chose not to be any wiser on this subject prior to watching \"Rush\". Otherwise, it would have seriously compromised my enjoyment of this superb fact-based movie. Not knowing how the suspense turned out was obviously the most important. But almost equally important was the fact that there could be one and only one ending \u2013 the factual one. Put it in another way, regardless of whether a character survived or got kill in a crash (don't suppose it constitutes a spoiler to say that there are car crashes in a movie about Formula One racing), if this were fictional, I could always \"disagree\" with the way the story was written, or even go a step further to say: if I had written this, blah, blah, blah. The beauty of a biopic is that you can never quarrel with the ending and, ironically, it makes the suspense that much more exciting (assuming, of course, that you are in the fortunate position of not knowing what had happened when you walked into the cinema).Instead of plot twists, it's the character clash that keeps you glued to your seat. I confessed from the very start that I was not a Formula One fan. But I was fortunate enough to be a tennis fan during the same period, and entertained by a very similar personality clash, by two of the best in the field. Granted that Jimmy Connors was in no way whatsoever a womanizer such as James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth), there is a similarity in their flamboyant persona. And both were from the English speaking world, the U.S. and the U.K. respectively. At the other side of the court (or at the next lane, whichever you prefer), there are the ultra-cool, composed tacticians, Bjorn Borg and Niki Lauda, from Sweden and Austria respectively. I hasten to point out also the difference here, as Borg would never be caught raising his middle finger or flinging around the four-letter-word as Lauda so readily did. But still, in both cases, the fundamental similarity is prominent: fire vs ice, passion vs determination.Ron Howard demonstrates once again his directing versatility in offering this heart-pounding car race drama, something I don't believe he has done before. He did an excellent job in choosing his leads and in getting the scriptwriter, camera crew and everyone else to work together to create this first rate mainstream entertainment that is also intelligent. The classic conflict of two heroes who hate and admire each other all at the same time makes Howard's job a little easier. Just as an added bonus, as a little diversion from enjoying the excellent acting of the two leads, you can also try to decide which of their respective love interests is more attractive: Olivier Wilde or Alexandra Maria Lara. At the end of the day, that is really an \"eye of the beholder\" issue.",

In fact, many of his movies are my favourites. This time he picked up a true story of two rivalry formula 1 drivers from the 70s. This biographical sports drama was nothing short in all the aspects compared to his earlier movies. So his legacy continues with a series of masterpieces in his filmography. I am always fond of his works because the mix of sentiments in his movies is powerfully appealing just like I wanted. The emotion tool was very wisely utilized in this movie as well.The races from the movie were shot awesomely with the old automobile models and sets around. It was a perfect direction utilizing this inspiring true story with two great actors. It won't only tells about races but also the inexplicable friendship between them, which is hard to predict as we are not they. As per my observation I did not detect any flaws, especially races were exceptionally shot, totally top- notch. From the fast pace story narration due to the fine editing to background score and visual effects, we must recognize the A1 quality of the production house.This movie portrays about the 1976 Formula 1 season where two new comer drivers from Europe, James Hunt and Niki Lauda are considered the top rivalries to grab the world championship title. So their's stunning entry from lower class race to the big event, the clash between them were exhibited very well. Two equally great drivers with different mantras in their life as well implement in the race track was just mind blowing. The story was told from the perspective of both of them where narration frequently switches.Initially I was not favour to give it a shot. The reason behind it was the Chris Hemsworth, I am not a big fan of his performance. Most of his movies are commercially feel good kind ones so I was a bit hesitated to put my faith in this. And a couple of Ron Howard's last movies as well not like I expected but was just good. This movie completely reformed these two guys and redefined their's capability once again. Regretting for not saw it earlier, but feels good that I did not miss it after all. A highly recommended movie, which was one of the best sports movie from 2013 along with '42'.9.5/10",

The only problem that I found with the movie was that none of there personal stories were seen through. Hunt seemed to jump from one girl to the other and Lauda seemed to keep his personal life secret so there true personalities came out when they were racing. The scenes on the track were very realistic and they brought some intensity to the movie. I also liked the fact that you actually see the real drivers at the end of the movie. Anyway, this movie is definitely worth a watch if your a racing fan or if your into your intense dramas. Enjoyable!Round-Up: Chris Hemsworth played Hunt really well and he suited the cocky character very well. After all his fame from being Thor and the Huntsman, you can actually see him being like that in real life. Daniel Bruhl brought intensity to his role which made the rivalry realistic and great to watch. The only problem that I personally found with the film was the fact that I'm not really into racing so I didn't know that much about the characters. Of course, I have heard about them before, but I never knew anything about there careers. This is were Ron Howard done well by entertaining fans of racing and people who are not into that particular sport. Budget: $38million Worldwide Gross: $90millionI recommend this movie to people who are into there racing movies about the rivalry between Lauda and Hunt. 7/10",

Seems like the lower end of the nominee spectrum.Be that as it may, this doesn't mandate the dreaded slot on the back burner.At just a nose past two hours, the pacing's fast and smooth.Gravity's place in the Best Picture nominee list is nothing short of laughable. Captain Phillips and Her certainly deserve the accolade, but Rush is better than both of these films.Chris Hemsworth as James Hunt and Daniel Bruhl as the rat-faced Niki Lauda turn in exceptional performances.I love Sir Chemsworth, I gotta be honest.I'll say that Bruhl in the hospital is the slowest portion of the movie.

She glazes over Hunt's infidelity quite quickly, yes yes? I like her depiction of a strong woman in an nonviolent yet strained relationship.(This illustrates a well-executed, subtle and original character flaw for Hunt. James and Suzy have a magnificent argument midway through.)Did I mention Hemsworth's performance? It's spectacular.Olivia's furiously ascending the ladder of this reviewer's favorite thespians. She solely delights. And I first noticed her in Cowboys & Aliens, which was a hundred times better than anyone wants to give it credit for.

            "content": "Rush (2013) Director: Ron HowardThis movie narrates the true accounts of the sporting rivalry between Niki Lauda and James Hunt, F1 racing champions in the mid 1970's.Director Ron Howard returns to his brilliant version as a story-teller after crowd-pleasers like the two Robert Langdon movies and the middling movie 'The Dilemma'. His last real good movie was Frost/Nixon about 5 years prior to this one.This movie narrates the stories of two F1 legends who are not very popular to the post 1980's ilk. I actually read about Niki Lauda a few years ago in a story of guts and perseverance \u2013 Niki suffered severe burns when his car crashed in a F1 race in Germany with part of his face burnt off and his lungs damaged with internal burns. However 6 weeks after that incident, he returns to the race track in Italy and comes in 4th place. Just an amazing story. Didn't realize then that I was going to see it in a movie.Howard does a good job setting up the back story of characters \u2013 Hemsworth (Thor) as Hunt and Bruhl as Lauda \u2013 about their appetite for racing, cars and success. Their initial disdain for each other sets each on the path for achieving racing glory. While Hunt partied, Lauda engineered. The movie explores the dynamics and business of racing, the life of racers, the engineering marvel and the frenzy of the sport.Zimmer's music is outstanding, and the camera work & sound editing is simply brilliant. The race sequences are a stand-out and keep you on the edge of your seat. If you don't know your F1 history then it's even more nerve wracking.In my opinion, the movie focused on Hunt \u2013 how he was wronged and how he wronged. But my attention and respect was saved for Niki Lauda who was able to manage his fame and stature in real life. He is truly a living icon.Both Hemsworth and Bruhl give memorable performances and they live their characters on screen plus a fine return to form for our good old Richie Cunningham. :)This is one of the best movies released in 2013.

It's the only way to drive.\"Ron Howard is back on full gear after a couple of setbacks with The Dilemma and Angels and Demons. Rush is one of his best movies and he really does the title justice because you actually feel the rush of Formula 1 driving in this film. This is a great sports biopic that follows a lot of the well known sports clich\u00e9s, but it works nonetheless thanks to a superb story and some great characters. The difference with the sports formula here is that there is no clear villain as both characters are strong rivals who despite their differences are still likable and sympathetic. They are very different in their approach to racing, but the film doesn't seem to take sides or try to tell us which driver we have to cheer for. Howard's film is intense and exhilarating, one you will enjoy even if you're not a Formula 1 fan. If you have never heard of the real life rivalry during the 70's between drivers Niki Lauda and James Hunt then you are in for a thrilling ride here because the story is really gripping and powerful. If you are familiar with the story it is still enjoyable because the racing scenes are gripping with some insane camera angles and some great editing while the two lead performances are strong. This is the second time that Academy Award nominated screenwriter, Peter Morgan, collaborates with Ron Howard after Frost/Nixon, and once again they succeed in delivering a powerful biopic. This isn't Morgan's first screenplay related to sports either as he also wrote the script for The Damned United, one of my favorite sport movies of all time. These two should continue to work together because Rush is exciting and thrilling regardless whether or not you like Formula 1 racing. Ron Howard takes us back to the 70's to relive the classic rivalry between two successful Formula 1 drivers: James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) and Niki Lauda (Daniel Bruhl). Hunt is a British playboy who is passionate about driving and will do what it takes to win each race without considering the risks, while Lauda is a meticulous, extremely disciplined and calculating cold blooded Austrian driver. Despite their opposite personalities, they both have one thing in common: winning. Their rivalry began during the early 70's when they were both facing each other in lower divisions, and it escalated when they both reached Formula 1. The climatic moment takes place during the 1976 championship where a series of spectacular events unfold including a near fatal accident by Lauda and a nail biting season finish. The risks were high in this high speed sport where the safety conditions we have today didn't exist then. The film however doesn't just focus on their rivalry on the tracks, it also follows their personal lives off the track giving the characters more depth. We get a glimpse into Hunt's reckless marriage with Suzy Miller (Olivia Wilde), and Lauda's relationship with Marlene (Alexandra Maria Lara). The rivalry between these two men may just be the extra push they need to become better drivers, but it can also lead to taking more risks in a deadly sport. Rush was a pleasant surprise because it wasn't just another sport movie about two bitter rivals; it actually was a film about two rivals who brought the best out of each other and that is what made this biopic so much more interesting. It's that fierce competition between two talented drivers in a fast paced film that leaves you with a sense of rush and raises your pulse. Howard also does a great job at recreating the 70's and delivering some exciting racing scenes. Hemsworth proves he is more than muscles and Bruhl is just as exciting on screen. I wasn't surprised by Bruhl's performance because he had one small scene in Inglourious Basterds that really blew me away, but I really hadn't discovered this side of Chris Hemsworth who proved he has a career after Thor. Rush is such a dynamic and fun viewing experience, one you won't want to miss. The difference between these two lead characters and the way they play off each other is what ultimately drives this film to succeed. I can't think of any other racing movie that worked better than Rush, and I still haven't mentioned how exciting that final race scene played out in the rain with the slow-motion camera. It was breathtaking, give Rush a chance.",

While the film does follow the world of Formula-One racing, it is not what the movie is about. Where Rush really accelerates and manages to resonate, is in portraying the complicated love-hate rivalry between racecar drivers James Hunt and Niki Lauda during the early 1970s.This is a true story that is so fantastic that it almost seems as if it was fabricated, but the film never feels fake or Hollywoodified. Director Ron Howard and writer Peter Morgan go to great lengths to not make it the good guy vs. bad guy scenario. They present both the flaws and the things that made Hunt and Lauda great men of the sport. Hunt's a charming, easy to like playboy who is self-destructive, and Lauda is so calculating and abrasive he rarely shows emotion or vulnerability, and yet you've gotta love a man who is not afraid to say what he thinks. Featuring some of the most exciting cinematography from Anthony Dod Mantle since he won the Oscar for Slumdog Millionaire, and some genuinely whip smart editing, you really get the feeling of being in this world, on the track with these titans of racing. What manages to evoke this feeling is Howard's documentary like approach to the material.Ron Howard really is a chameleon of a director. He never makes the same movie twice, and there really is no other film in his filmography quite like this one. He sheds many of the genre conventions that you find in his other works for a stripped down, realistic approach. You feel as if you're a fly on the wall watching the ultimate racing doc that's all rock-and-roll. Then there's the rocking Seventies setting that's equal parts nostalgic and cool, by and large thanks to the surprisingly nuanced and of-the-times musical score from Hans Zimmer. However, there is also a heart to this movie that is both a testament to Howard's ability to shape smart characters and the performances of his actors. These two things combine to make these character's oddly likable, even when they aren't always the nicest of people.Overall, Rush is simply put, a phenomenal experience at the theater. It's a movie that can be fun, emotional, and thoughtful all in one. It paints the picture as to why we need rivalries in life. There has to be something pushing us to greatness, and very often a healthy rivalry is the only way to get there. Even if a Formula-One movie isn't your cup of tea, I implore you to at least give the film a chance as a character piece. Stars Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Bruhl compliment one another in their performances very much the same way that Hunt and Lauda did on the racetrack, and sometimes you don't need flowery words to express how much a performance, or in this case, two performances work. Rush is definitely a movie I will be revisiting in the future and is one that I will more than likely include, very proudly I might add, on my year end best list.I give Rush a 10 out of 10!",

The difference between this move and the previous 2 is that racing is really a backdrop to the clash of 2 very different personalities who came to respect each other.In one professional interview with Niki Lauda the UKs Guardian I believe, it was suggested that Hunt was Lauda's foil - I agree but if it is possible from a screen writing perspective Lauda was also a foil for Hunt.It has been said that the film highlights Lauda - I don't agree - it highlights the both with their contrasts.To me - even more than Lauda's brilliant driving, I will always remember him for his courage after his accident (hardly a spoiler alert since this is common knowledge).In Road & Track's interview with Ron Howard, Howard detailed the effort that he went to insure that this was an accurate portrayal - consulting people directly involved from Lauda himself to Ron Dennis and a dozen others.It has, from what I understand, been well received in the F1 community.Above all it is a fantastic film on 2 very different personalities and how they came to respect each other.",

            "review_title": "The Best Film of 2013",
            "content": "\"Rush\" stars Chris Hemsworth as colourful, charismatic playboy party-animal James Hunt who was also one of the all-time great in the Formula 1 circuit. Contrary to his lifestyle Daniel Bruhl stars as Hunt's rival, Austrian born racer Niki Lauda who is very aloof, arrogant and only cares about winning and nothing more. In fact he believes that happiness is a sign of weakness to his regiment. Though they've butted heads on the other minor Formula circuits, their real conflicts begin in 1976 during the granddaddy of them all, the ever-dangerous Formula 1 race tracks where many championships were won while many lives have been lost. Lauda utilizing his carefully selected cars and strategic acumen manages to win his way at Ferrari. His hopes of joy and confidence comes crashing down when he's ousted by his arch rival James Hunt who shows that his style is equally significant to his substance. With one of the most dangerous spots on the Formula 1 course, Hunt and Lauda will convert to extreme lengths to prove who's the best while not caring of the physical or psychological implications that go into the course.Filled with fast-paced action, high octane thrills, and a compelling story of one of the most bitter rivalries in Formula 1 racing, \"Rush\", goes beyond the excitement of the screeching of the tires and competitors striving to the very best, but is also a character driven drama that looks at how the closest of friends can be the bitterest of enemies when competition is in the air and that the motto of \"win big or die trying\" couldn't have been more literally said. If you lack knowledge of Formula 1 racing, no worries at all, the emotions of the characters and the character development between Hunt and Lauda will surely make you choose a side as to who wish will win in this most dangerous sport in the world and Hemsworth and Bruhl do an excellent job at conveying the conflicting rivalry between these two highly competitive racers.Under the direction of Ron Howard, he ensures his audience that will likely see the two leading rivals show both admiration for the athleticism and at the same time exhibit an obvious disdain for their ways of life. We both applaud and at the same time don't envy their career professions. Their lease of life consists of enjoying life like everyday could end unexpectedly and the other to achieve their goal to represent why they compete in this level to begin with.Under the wonderful script by Peter Morgan, we can get further invesed into the rivalry between Hunt and Lauda better and that the polar opposites between the two never looked better. We can easily be more invested into Hunt's character and Hemsworth as his partying ways matches his daredevil high adrenaline energy he brings to these race courses. His reckless style of driving is the perfect married couple to his wild lifestyle of partying, sex, drugs and everything in between. Underneath him we see a flawed man who fears life which contributes to his boisterous lifestyle. Olivia Wilde is wonderful in the role as his first wife Suzy Miller who uses Hunt as a stepping stone to eventually become engaged to Hollywood legend Richard Burton.Bruhl is perfectly cast as the no-nonsense racer Niki Lauda who's social interactions are virtually non-existent and carries this conflicted burden over his shoulders the whole time through. Not only does he look and act like the determined driver, he also plays off the obsessive compulsiveness his character goes through like choosing the right car that will win him championships even down to the weight and aerodynamics of the cars while he at the same time possesses a misanthropic way in life he sees the human and doesn't care what they think of him. The scene where he opens up to his first wife Marlene (Alexandra Maria Lara) we get to know that he's not a complete anti-socialite. The joyride in Italy is quite heart-pulsating. Lauda believes that happiness is his liability as he explains to Marlene that there is no happiness that comes in the career choice he made.The racing scene provide some the most in-your-face action you'll ever witness. It's like we're literally in the driver's seats that feels like a roller coaster ride as the wheels race through the tracks going way over the speed limit. The climax in the movie takes place at the Nurbrugring circuit in Germany which the racers from the past refer to as \"The Green Hell\" in which wet conditions on this track can deadly and rivalries within players can be a matter of winning big or dying trying. This track will determine who will compete in the World Championship in Japan. We ask ourselves is it worth it winning the grandest prize knowing that weather conditions are bad and that racers can get hurt or even killed just for the top prize? You bet it does! You think after all this time getting here you're going to to throw it away? I don't think so! Howard wisely observes the psyche between Hunt and Lauda as to see what's going through their minds as each are contemplating the consequences they will face in this challenge.This movie is truly and exciting and dramatic film that was sadly snubbed at the Oscars even though other awards shows gave praise to this movie. The competitive nature between James Hunt and Niki Lauda is brought to life which is more like a stepping stone to their winning ways as the more disdain they have for each the more successful they've become in Formula racing. With a fine blend of exciting races we have a movie that's high in drama, humour, romance and the poetic rivalry between polar opposites is the meal ticket to a gem of a film.",

            "content": "This based upon a true storyWe go back to the 1970s and see an intense rivalry between two Formula One (F1) racers: James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) and Niki Lauda (Daniel Bruhl). Hunt is an aggressive driver likes the spotlight, is a womanizer, and puts his life on the line in every race. Lauda is the more conservative driver, calculating, plays the percentages, shuns the spotlight. Rivalries. We like them and if two that we like are at the top of the profession we want them to be friends. Were Hunt and Lauda friends? Jack and Arnie are friends, Roy and Gene were friends, and Chrissy and Martina are friends. Connors and McEnroe respect each other but are not friends\u0085.. yet. In this movie we don't know who to root for. We tend to side with Hunt, until we see Lauda and Marlene (Alexandra Maria Lara) picked up on the highway by extreme fans of Lauda. These scenes are pure gold. Now we like Hunt and Lauda equally. See?This movie centers on the 1976 race for the Formula 1 Championship. Hunt wins, Lauda wins and Lauda has the edge in points. In the final race,in Japan under severe rainy conditions, for the Championship Lauda retires (this word is used when a driver leaves the race for reasons under his control) from the race and it is up to Hunt to come in at least in 3rd place to claim the championship from Lauda who is ahead on points. Will he do it?The acting and dialogues are spot on and one would think that Hunt and Lauda disliked each other, but we see glimpses of friendship too. Their views on how to race are like night and day and neither one will change. The racing shots are fantastic with superb editing and heart-pounding music. This is a very exciting racing movie and you cannot take your eyes away. However, this is also a study in personalities and who will win out? Hunt? Lauda? Anyone? No one?I am not a fan of F1 racing, but I am a fan of movies that show F1 racing like this one. Kudos to Director, Ron Howard, who did a fantastic and amazing job. And, now the answer: yes, Hunt and Lauda were friends, not real close but each wanted something the other had. In their early racing years they roomed together for about a year (Hey, I looked it up on Wikipedia). After Hunt dies at age 45 of a heart attack, Lauda says at the end of the movie that Hunt was the only one he envied. Lauda currently works for Mercedes AMG Petronas F1 Team.Both James Hunt and Niki Lauda are in the F1 Hall of Fame (I looked that up too). (9/10)Violence: Yes. Sex: Yes mostly in the beginning. Nudity: Yes, briefly in the beginning. Language: Yes, at times.",

            "review_title": "RUSH Was a Surprise Gem for this Non-Race Fan",
            "content": "I will always appreciate a movie that can generate my interest in something that I previously couldn't care less about. In the case of RUSH, that something is racing. Specifically, Formula-1 racing. RUSH is another in a long line of films based on actual events to come out in 2013 and it ranks right up there with the best of them. It receives bonus points for the fact that those involved in the original events claim RUSH to actually be pretty accurate in its details, with a little creative liberty taken by the filmmakers to jazz it up a bit. It's the story of a rivalry that captured international attention in the 1976 Formula-1 racing season. James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) and Niki Lauda (Daniel Br\u00fchl) are very different men and both of them are incredibly talented drivers. The movie begins as the two struggle to make their mark on the Formula-3 circuit and follows their rise into the spotlight of Formula-1 in the pursuit of the world championship. As the two battle neck-and-neck for position, their rivalry fuels them to push harder and faster until a disastrous moment changes both their lives and professional relationship. RUSH has become my favorite film from director Ron Howard (note: I've never seen APOLLO 13 so that could change. I know, blasphemy.) and is probably one of my top favorite movies from the year. It succeeded at both making racing interesting to a non-fan while crafting two incredibly interesting characters who are competing for polar opposite reasons.For starters, I'm one of those anti-NASCAR sorts who can't be bothered to watch a bunch of people \"drive in circles\" for hours on end. For me to willfully watch a movie about the sport of racing (and, yes, I'm aware there's a difference between NASCAR and Formula-1 racing), it took a healthy batch of glowing positive reviews. And RUSH received heaps of praise when it hit. When combined with Chris Hemsworth's rising stardom thanks to his role as Thor in the Marvel cinematic universe (of which I'm a fan), it was enough to get my attention and I'm so glad I gave it a shot. RUSH is a blast, from the edge-of-your-seat racing segments to the back-and-forth trash talk between two talented professionals on opposite sides of the coin. Hunt is a daredevil. He drives for the thrill of the ride and revels in how close he comes to death with each event. He's in it for the glory. Lauda is a meticulous man. He uses a keen business sense in conjunction with his racing skill to master his craft. He's in it for the respect. The two ideologies bumping heads is what powers RUSH and keeps the audience invested. As cool as the racing segments are, they're nothing compared to the moments with the racers themselves. As I understand, a lot of the racing was done in camera with a minimal amount of CG to enhance the visuals. It helps, as the Formula-1 races and fast and brutal and CG cars would've dulled any sense of danger. And the movie isn't shy about showing the downsides to the Formula-1 lifestyle. Racers died in the sport (at least two a year at the time, if the movie is to be believed) and the excitement of the race circuit is intercut with the occasional accident to remind the viewer of the stakes.Chris Hemsworth and, especially, Daniel Br\u00fchl should've received more attention for their performances here. There was a lot of praise when the movie debuted but it had fizzled before awards season hit. Chris Hemsworth is commendable but Hunt isn't exactly a character that strikes me as outside his wheelhouse. Hunt is boisterous and often drunk; he's a daredevil with a mean party streak and Hemsworth fills the role perfectly. He's your typical jock in most regards but he's got the added bonus of obsession of staring death in the face. But he's not a total jerk and we see a welcome change in him in the final third of the movie following the disaster at N\u00fcrburgring. Br\u00fchl has the meatier role here in Niki Lauda. His performance is mesmerizing whenever he's on screen. He's such a peculiar man. Born in Austria, Lauda is abrasively candid, unafraid to call out Hunt for his dangerous race habits or tell the owner of Ferrari that his newest racer is a pile of garbage. His no-holds-barred nature and the fact that he bought his way into Formula-1 with personal loans earn him some enemies and ultimately contributes to his near fatal accident. Hemsworth may have the star power and top billing in the film but this is definitely Br\u00fchl's film in the end. Regardless, Howard does a fantastic job of balancing each character in the film, giving us the film from both perspectives. There's no hero and villain here. Just two men with a drive to be world champions.",

Director Ron Howard who has given us classics like a beautiful mind , to name a few has delivered a directorial take resplendent with tight editing n in the process bringing us a slick, stylishly crafted, intelligently made n high on octane, edge of the seat thriller , accrued by some good confident performances by both the lead actors.. Even though i ain't a racing fan & till now haven't witnessed a single race even on TV but such is the intensity, racy feel to the movie, right from the first scene, that one doesn't even require an intermission.. Though the rivalry shown is guess, a tad exaggerated but who cares with the great view on offer!!! Not to seize any credits from both the lead actors, Hemsworth & Daniel, who as shown later during the end, look quite the champions they have portrayed on screen.. There is the flamboyant, boisterous & carefree maclaren driver, who believes in living life on the edge, making use of every min.available & never abiding by the rules.. Contrastingly, his competitor up next is a German , a boring , serious guy who stops in the middle of a race to avoid any mishaps, after images of his wife appear in his mind.. Who speaks not so fluent English but is a master at his work, knows his machines inside out n is a disciplined types.. Worth seeing is when he ,while driving a borrowed up car is questioned of not being a racy driver, since neither does he possess long hair, nor flamboyant enough to be called one!!! At this he retorts saying that he does not see any incentives /rewards on driving faster!!! Also worthy is the detailing, the picturisation of races, the cars itself, the background score by the famous zimmer.. In fact, the human emotions, fear & risks involved have been explored & presented to us in a never seen manner.. Indeed their rivalry is the highlight of the movie, which prompted each of them to give it their best.. They don't interact much with each other but do look the part ,especially at the end, seen conversing with each other.. It indeed is a great watch, & not only for some cheap action or some racy sequences..",

We get a quick and dirty intro into both drivers before we're thrown headfirst into their respective F1 careers, and specifically, the 1976 season that saw their on-track feud boil down to the final event in Japan, where heavy rain and treacherous road conditions provided a dangerous finale. Howard barely stops for a breath in the two hours of Rush; whether it's the edge-of-your-seat races or the turbulent personal lives of our competitive duo on screen, the movie never stalls or bores. One of Hollywood's newest A-list members, Chris Hemsworth, proves he can do more than hunky action roles with a wonderful and surprisingly subtle portrayal of Hunt, however it is, without a shadow of a doubt, Bruhl who really impresses. The underrated German actor imbues his Lauda with multiple layers and a slippery charisma in a spectacular performance that, with any justice, will garner him attention come awards season. Anthony Dod Mantle's cinematography and Hans Zimmer's score are expectedly first-rate, however a special mention must go out to the sound design team who have constructed a thundering and immersive aural experience that positions you squarely in the high-risk, high-octane environment whilst sending vibrations through your chest and getting your heart pumping at a million miles an hour. Don't steer away if you know nothing of the subject, this movie is accessible to anybody who loves their sporting biopics or great motion pictures in general.",

The movie basically chronicles the two racers lives right from when they were just petty F3 racers to when they competed together in the 1976 Grand Prix. This movie is absolutely flawless. If I had to pick one flaw then, it would be the fact that James Hunt vomited before each race. I didn't see the point of doing that. The way Ron Howard, the director, has shot the races is surreal & otherworldly. You feel like you're racing at the track. This movie keeps you on the edge of your seat right till the end. I liked the fact that even though Hunt & Lauda were rivals on the track, they had immense respect for each other off it. The viewer has no idea as to who is going to win the Grand Prix. Hunt or Lauda. However, both characters are equally likable. So, it didn't bother me as to who's going to win, in the end. Chris Hemsworth is charming & suave as James Hunt. However, the highlight of the film is Daniel Bruhl. His performance as Niki Lauda is mind blowing. Bruhl had a tougher role to play & he absolutely nailed it. Olivia Wilde is great as Suzy Miller. Alexandra Maria Lara is brilliant as Marlene Lauda. Pierfrancesco Favino is impressive as Clay Regazzoni. The supporting characters are effective as well. Rush is a must watch.

Their rivalry is similar too many others in formula one history. It is the classic battle between the racer who lives on the edge and the driver who accumulates points by not taking risks to ensure finishing in every race. The personalities of Hunt and Lauda reflect their driving styles. Their rivalry is bitter and personal and the film focuses on the world championship in the 1976 season.

            "content": "I was energised by the reviews for this seemingly out-of-water subject for director Ron Howard. Especially the talk of the technical advancement of small cameras that can give you a microscopic glimpse of the physics at play when racing a formula 1 car. I was almost stunned at how clich\u00e9 sounding the exposition was in the first act. I thought, OK it starts out by-the-numbers, but it will finish off a winner (can't help with the racing analogies). I was disappointed how little racing footage was shown. I have yet to see a properly made movie about the drama that occurs on the track during a race. I don't know why directors claim that watching racing is boring. We get glimpses of the forces at hand as the camera is jerked around when attached to the car. I suppose ultimately they are afraid to spend the money to make such action scenes.It was made clear in the reviews that this was not a film about racing, but about two prominent characters from the racing world. With the 70s period being depicted, it's almost like \"Forrest Gump\" or something as we relive 1976. I was also feeling kind of trapped in the script that insists on keeping the story factual. The movie spends a great deal of time on relationships, and exploring what their relationships are about. But I felt their was too much time in sacrifice for good old racing footage for the touchy feely stuff.If there was any talk of Oscars, the only one I would consider is Daniel Bruhl for lead actor. That is kind of strange that the marketing features Chris Hemsworth, despite the striking persona Niki Lauda displays as a major component to this film. Worth noting is the careful balance of action, tech talk, and marital relations the script adheres to. Such as a major race being shown through the wife watching it on TV.I enjoy racing movies sometimes, but not when it really isn't about racing. This movie spends less than half the time on racing, and the rest doesn't resonate in an award winning way. Despite my cynicism about this imbalance, there were certainly some poignant quotes that made me think. So credit that to the screenplay. As for director Ron Howard, the only sense of his style that helps perhaps is the pacing. He keeps the momentum going, deliberately sacrificing a beat or two that would normally allow a heavy moment to sink in. For this film it works, because it represents how shallow the main characters are. My final verdict is that it is a watchable movie, but still is not the definitive racing movie. I would wait for the DVD",

            "content": "Ron Howard delivers another broad slice of muscular, high-tension biographical melodrama (see previous CV entries: Apollo 13, and Frost/Nixon, both of which are touchstones for some of the thematic elements here), with the retelling of the professional rivalry between 1970s Formula One racing legends, Niki Lauda and James Hunt.Chris Hemsworth tackles the more showy, but actually rather tricky task of essaying Hunt: A cocky, risk-taking, rock-star playboy, who could have been frankly repugnant in less skilled hands, but is handsomely (in every sense of the word) fleshed out by the God of Thunder. Meanwhile Daniel Br\u00fchl quietly stamps his authority over the drama with a disciplined take on Lauda's acerbic, neurotic Austrian. The script trowels on the stereotypes a tad thick at times, but both leads deliver, pulling off the not inconsiderable feat of making the audience root for both sides in during their battles.Meanwhile Howard, and his DOP, the brilliant Anthony Dod Mantle, find all manner of extraordinary places to stick their cameras, wedging us into the cockpit in ways that give each race a distinct personality, as well as a tremendous vitality and urgency, and then matching this with a glorious, cacophonous sound design that places one deep inside the action.It ain't subtle. True or not, Hunt's team of amateur Hooray-Henrys appear to have been culled from the Four Weddings understudies list, and the leads' almost comically contrary character traits are perhaps spelled out rather too frequently. But nonetheless, this tale grips like a Brabham, convincingly delivering the thrills and excitement of an era when Formula One was a perilous and free-spirited enterprise.",

Usually, I now walk out of the theater saying \"Yeah, that was a great movie, but it's not one of the best I have ever seen.\"\"RUSH\" was different. When I walked out of that movie, I had those chills and that sense of awe and wonder again. Not only did that movie have me at the edge of my seat at every turn like a good racing movie should, but I can safely say that that movie had the best cinematography that I have ever seen in any film. More often than not, I was sitting there thinking \"Holy s**t, how did they get a shot like that??\" To this day, when I think about that movie, I still ask myself that question.

            "content": "There's much to admire in Ron Howard's biopic of the battle between Niki Lauda (Daniel Bruhl) and James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth), not least both actors' portrayals of the leads and Howard's, at times, brilliant action sequences. Sad to say though there's a lot that simply doesn't work.Act 1 (the set up - early years) has moments of cringeworthy scripting and acting with little that engages (in fact I found myself wishing it was all over).Act 2 (the action sequences when 1976 is dramatically recreated, race by race) is mostly enthralling and really brings together all that is good about this movie (Bruhl, Hemsworth and Howard's direction).Act 3 (the denouement) is a missed opportunity. It's desperately rushed - despite its two hour length. I suspect an order from the studio to cut the timelength came into play with the consequence that it feels like an afterthought.What makes Rush worth seeing is the most important aspect of the movie, the bitter rivalry between Lauda and Hunt. Both actors uncannily capture the drivers' individual personalities but the script by The Queen writer Peter Morgan sometimes leaves them with nowhere to go, at others it dazzles, \"You're the only man that is better looking after skin grafts\" quips Hunt to Lauda in Act 3; and Lauda's repeated statement that a 20% risk of death in each race is all that's acceptable is used well and resonates.It's the supporting actors that lets it down; an unconvincing Murray Walker, an unlikeable Lord Hesketh, Hunt's wife - all fail to convince. Only Alexandra Maria Lara, as Lauda's wife, strikes a real chord. At $38million this is a big budget movie for the UK. Its ambitions are clear to see. Just a shame the whole doesn't amount to more than the sum of its variable parts.Want to see a great motor racing movie?(There's very few of merit and despite my reservations this one's definitely among the elite.)

            "content": "Ron Howard's movies can be a hit or miss. They are either really good or not very memorable. Nonetheless, he is a director that will try anything. That reason alone makes him very versatile. Each of his movies looks and feels different than the other. His new film Rush is set during the 1970s\u2014about the Formula One racers. Its center focus is the rivalry between Englishman James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) and Austrian Nicki Lauda (Daniel Br\u00fchl). What could have been a bland sports action flick is an interesting and thorough character study of two men after glory. Both share the same goal of winning the championship yet they are both polar opposites on their outlooks in the game.James Hunt is depicted as a charismatic playboy type. He sleeps around with women, drinks, parties, and lives purely for the moment. Lauda on the other hand is an individual who sets himself to be the best. He takes his driving so seriously that he spends all nighters perfecting his race car, not even bothering to associate with his fellow acquaintances. One cannot help but wonder if he is an \"a--hole\" as most characters call him, or if he is just treating racing as an occupation. Hunt displays a persona that is easy to like and admire\u2014he is a bit of a showman and likes to have fun. Lauda is the opposite. He could care less about his looks or images and he is hardly ever seen elated. Seeing these two completely different personalities marks great character drama that gives the audience a purpose to watch the film\u2014unlike Days of Thunder, which was only fun because of the races and crash sequences. While the movie is well written by the great Peter Morgan, the soul rests on Hemsworth's and Br\u00fchl's performances. Hemsworth scores his best work as James Hunt. It is nice to see him break away from being Thor and doing something that requires a bit more depth. Perhaps this can be a shift away from the superhero schtik. Spanish actor Daniel Br\u00fchl had more of a challenge to develop with his character. One of which is the fact that he had to portray an Austrian racer. Though bilingual, his Austrian accent feels fake and overdone. That does not necessarily mean he is terrible. Acting wise, he is very good. He truly shines following the crash that almost leaves his character dead. He marvelously pulls off a touching scene in which he tries to fit a helmet over his head, but he can't due to the pain. Both the physical and emotional agony he endears of fearing he may never be able to drive again is borderline heart wrenching to watch. Many people are talking Oscar buzz for him and he might very well earn a nomination. The other factor that cannot be overlooked is the technical marvels that Ron Howard and his crew put together\u2014the fact that cameras were mounted on real F1's going 180 miles per hour is incredible. The type of camera angles and techniques are fascinating. We get to visually experience what it is like to be on a fast ride. As director of photography, Anthony Dod Mantle truly went all out on this picture. The sound design is equally top-notched, some of the best I have ever heard in a movie theater. The editing is crisp, appropriately building the plot's tension. The visual effects are sparse but effective during the crash sequences. Hans Zimmer's score is low-key for the drama and adrenaline pumping for the races\u2014a fitting mix. Most of all, the make up and prosthetics used for Daniel Br\u00fchl in the second half of the movie is shocking and realistic. The real Nicki Lauda saw this movie on its premiere in Europe and he even said after his viewing of the recreation of the crash sequence and his subsequent injuries was an authentic and intense experience for him. Rush is more than above the average sports flick and it is not watered down to the PG-13 rating. Aside from swear words and graphic race car-related injuries, the sexual appetite and drug/alcohol abuse by James Hunt is a strong force in the movie. Such things can happen to men in a dangerous occupation like F1 racing\u2014they often choose to live a wild lifestyle. As Hunt says in the movie, \"The closer you are to death, the more alive you feel. It's a wonderful way to live.\" Do not be discouraged by the rating. Rush is a very good movie. 8/10",

            "content": "In the racing circuit of the 1970s, drivers James Hunt and Niki Lauder were the fiercest of rivals and represented the sport's partition between glamour and science. Hunt was born in 1947 in London and Lauder was born in 1949 in Austria. Yet both men had similar economic and personal backgrounds. Hunt's father was a successful stockbroker and Lauder was from a family of businessmen. Their families were unsupportive of their decision to shun their wealthy heritage in favour of becoming racing car drivers. Hunt at one point considered being a doctor. 1976 is remembered to be one of the most dramatic years in the Grand Prix's history and by that point they had developed polar reputations for themselves. Hunt was a drinker, took drugs, vomited before every race and is said to have slept with over five thousand women. Alternately, Lauder was characterised as \"cold, hard logic\" and a technical expert on driving. He became a major advocator for driver safety in the sport. In Ron Howard's fictional account of this rivalry, Hunt and Lauder are played with great lucidness by Chris Hemsworth (Thor, The Avengers) and Daniel Bruhl (Inglourious Basterds). We come to understand the mindsets of both men and ironically how they complimented each other. As Hunt Chris Hemsworth brims with high charisma, cockiness, wit and arrogance. He doesn't care about others but uses them for a fleeting moment of joy or pleasure. In his first scene, he walks into a hospital bleeding with a bandage on his stomach and seduces the nurse. The danger of racing fuels this juvenile spontaneity because 'the closeness to death' reminds him of his own personal vitality and celebrity appeal to women. Peter Morgan's screenplay adopts a structure similar to Martin Scorsese's Raging Bull, where sex and sport have a synonymous relationship. For Hunt, both are a moment of passion, instinct and adrenaline and sometimes inspire each other. In one sequence Hunt seduces an air hostess onboard a plane and the scene is juxtaposed against a revitalised and energised racing performance. Outside of racing and sex, Hunt is bored and directionless. His brief marriage to Suzy Miller (Olivia Wilde) is a disaster because he can't handle a structured life. Ron Howard's camera makes deliberate note of the image of a bird trapped in a cage. It's an image representative of both characters because even Miller takes up with the actor Richard Burton to escape her life with Hunt. Comparatively, Lauder doesn't believe in popularity, partying or even friends. He is a lone wolf because it allows him to structure and discipline his life primarily around racing. Not only is Lauder unpopular with the other racers in the film, he is an outsider to his own racing team, an Austrian who is part of a major Italian racing company in Ferrari. He believes that 'happiness is the enemy' because when you are happy you suddenly have something to lose. His strength though comes in the form of his scientific approach to racing and his logic. He orders the material on his racing car to be changed so it runs faster and manoeuvres his way around contracts to improve his own standing with the team. Typifying his character, Hunt calls him a rat but Lauder reminds him that as disliked as they are rats are also very cunning creatures. The accident that left Lauder horribly burnt and scared on top of his head is a frightening story and powerfully handled because of the uncompromised staging. He returned to racing just six weeks later, wearing a special protective cap under his helmet to hide his burnt flesh. The physical pain is viewed in graphic detail but we also see a determination in Lauder that achieves obsessive tendencies. While having his lungs pumped, the point of view shots of the TV showing Hunt celebrating injects Lauder with unflinching tenacity and competitiveness. If there is any disappointment with the film it is that the female partners of both men, including Lauder's eventual wife Marlene (Alexandra Maria Lara), aren't given proper character arcs but are moral ciphers for their domestic issues or marginalised to the sidelines. The majority of the film's energy is spent on the racing scenes, which are an exhilarating from inside the cockpit, with cameras attached to the helmets of the actors, or over the top of the race through overhead shots. Occasionally, it is not always clear which driver is which. Pay attention to the colour of the racing cars. The most terrifying sequence in the film is when they race in terrible conditions during a downpour in Japan, forcing Lauder to reconsider his ideal that he has nothing to lose. The atmosphere in the racing scenes is heightened by an intensely desaturated colour scheme. The palettes are gritty and dark, focussing the sole primary colour red onto the racing car. This shows nothing exists outside of racing for these two men. The film is about their relationship and rivalry but also the way other people can teach us about ourselves. What they see in each other places a mirror onto themselves, reminding them of their own personal strengths. It breathes a small degree of respect between these two competitors. Hunt died at just forty-five but Lauder is still alive. He has said that he approves of the film because of its truthfulness. I haven't watched Formula One racing before but by the end I found it difficult to look away. It has the rare privilege of combining exciting Hollywood spectacle with two intimate and fascinating characters.",

Part of it is probably since it's based on a true story and not a fictional story with overally sappy or comedic moments that are totally unbelievable in comparison. The race scenes are very intense and totally captures your imagination.I like Chris Hemsworth in the Thor role but he was way more to sink into as an actor in this role.

            "content": "It's difficult to think of something more tedious than car races. If you could only appreciate this movie if you liked F1, than this would have a very small audience. Thankfully, that's not the case. This adrenaline fuelled drama is a high octane power house with great acting, writing and directing which manages to make a boring sport interesting. It tells the real life story of the rivalry between car racers James Hunt and Niki Lauda. Both are different characters and neither are especially likable, but they're both well rounded and excellent played. Chris Hemsworth, a promising actor who really is choosing his films well, is very good as Hunt, but Daniel Bruhl is even better as Lauda, and his performance might be the best individual element of the film. Rush is another drama film, and there are many points which feel somewhat predictable and generic, so it has detours, but otherwise it's first gear straight to the Oscars.... who decided to completely ignore it. Typical.The only other Ron Howard film I've seen is half of Backdraft, so I was sceptical but his direction and editing are astonishing. The race sequences are exhilarating and make you feel like you're in the car with the drivers. Most of the dialogue feels genuine and it keeps you compelled throughout. It apparently employs some artistic license with the real events but not enough to make it feel like total nonsense (It's no Braveheart). Rush is a thrilling and moving drama which is a superior sports movie and if Gravity isn't a British movie than quite possibly the best British film of 2013. This is predictable at times which makes it a four star movie but it's a high four stars. Despite the predictability you can't always tell what's going to happen and by the end Rush is surprisingly moving. The character rivalry and development are what make the movie so compelling, not the race sequences. Hemsworth and Bruhl should have received Oscar nominations for their performances.8/10",

You must be thinking why Chris Hemsworth is puking\nCause he was sick , who cares about james hunt's reason of death!?Director thought its useless so just fast forward through it and play 70s rocknroll whenever something joyful happensThe only moment i was excited was when Niki crashed at nurburgring and what happened after that , it happens when the cinema is left with only 35% of its remaining duration. The beginning 65 % was just plain bad , boring and stupid.Girls,chris Hemsworth vomiting,girls\nThe actor playing niki Lauda bursting with raging hate like yeah,\n& Showing an actual pic of NiKi and James proves they were both great with each other .But indeed great acting , great depiction of a race in those LAST 20% of the whole cinema ,it was the only time it felt exciting& m scoing 5 out of 10 just for that.Ron Howard made a gangster movie instead of a racing movie.

            "content": "RUSHI have been wanting to watch this movie ever since I saw the trailer. I missed it in the cinema, but now it has been released on DVD.The movie is about a rivalry between two Formula One drivers. This rivalry wasn't like other rivalries... these guys really took it to the edge. They disliked each other as well as wanted to beat each other... but they respected each other.The movie was very good. I am a big Formula One fan and have been for many years. I am not old enough to remember the Niki Lauda/James Hunt rivalry, but I have heard of it and seen video clips. Niki and James are both legends in their sport and will remain that way forever. Niki is still a presence at the track these days as he works as a consultant for the Mercedes team and can be seen at almost every race.The action in the movie was very good and the racing scenes were very well put together. Ron Howard really is good at making a great action film.The film stars Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Bruhl. Both actors did a fantastic job and it is amazing how much Chris and Daniel actually look like James and Niki. It really is the perfect casting.There are some scenes in the film that were a bit awkward to watch. When Niki had his accident he went through a really harsh time through his treatment. Some of which was really horrible to watch. Niki went through as really hard timer, yet he still got back in the car the same year to finish the season. That man is crazy! I have so much respect for him. He was very determined and focused for his passion.Niki was not a very likable person. He took his career very seriously and he didn't care who he had to walk over to get what he wanted. He didn't have many friends and he didn't care. He wanted to be world champion and that was all he focused on. Weirdly though, I really liked him. He was very blunt and said what he thought no matter who got upset. I like honesty in people and that is a very good thing in Nikis favour. James on the other hand was the complete opposite. He was a playboy. He liked women, drink and drugs. He was sometimes deemed dangerous in the car, but he had a talent and was very good at what he did. There were times through the film where I didn't really like James. I thought his attitude sucked and he wasn't a very nice man at times. In the end though I felt sorry for him. His life went off the rails a little bit and I thought he maybe deserved a little bit more help than he got from the people around him.According to Niki this film is very close to the truth, which is a very good to know. I hate the fact that most true stories are full of untrue parts.I don't really have anything bad to say about this film. You will enjoy this film if you do not like F1, but you will enjoy it more if you do. I don't think it is Rons best film, but it is up there with the best of his career.I will give this film 8 out of 10.\"The closer you are to death, the more alive you feel. It's a wonderful way to live. It's the only way to drive.\"For more reviews, please like my Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl",

            "content": "Ron Howard's \"Rush\" relates the true-life tale of two Formula One racecar drivers - Britain's James Hunt and Austria's Niki Lauda - whose intense rivalry helped to define the sport in the 1970s.As befits a pair of arch competitors, Hunt and Lauda were polar opposites in any number of ways. Hunt, the \"bad boy,\" was a hard-drinking, hard-living international playboy-type with a crappy marriage - his supermodel wife (Olivia Wilde) was having an affair with no less a figure than Richard Burton - while Lauda, the \"good-boy,\" was a work-obsessed, early-to-bed homebody with a terrific marriage to a beautiful and devoted woman (Alexandra Marlena Lara). Hunt was also devilishly handsome and sexy, a fact which garnered him a bevy of overeager groupies and celebrity status, while Lauda, with his self-described \"rat face,\" barely registered as a blip on the cultural scene. The movie chronicles their relationship - defined by incidents of high drama and near-tragedy - both on and off the track, with each developing a grudging admiration for the other's doggedness, tenacity and undeniable devotion to the sport over time.The movie has a number of things going for it. The screenplay by Peter Morgan doesn't dumb down the characters or overdramatize the conflict between them. In addition, Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Bruhl are excellent as Hunt and Lauda, underplaying rather than grandstanding their way through their roles. And, of course, it goes without saying that the racing sequences, though truncated at times, plunge the audience right into the heart of the action in a way not available even to real-life fans of the sport, be they sitting in the stands at the track or watching at home on TV. Once again, the intimacy of the medium of film makes itself felt in a major way.Why then the overall feeling of dissatisfaction with the film, the nagging sense that, for all the quality elements that have gone into it, the movie just doesn't amount to all that much in the end? Could it be that, when all is said and done, the story really isn't all that interesting or the characters all that compelling (Hunt's wife is given particularly short shrift in the screenplay)? Whatever it is, there is something about \"Rush\" that keeps us from giving ourselves over to it completely. So just enjoy the performances and car races and don't expect a life-altering experience from Howard's latest feel-good opus.",

I can see a sound editor's great effort on recording/editing the noise of machines back in these days.... flat 12 and DFV. When the film is based on a real story, its all about how to wrap it up with back stories that were not told on TV. The complex feeling of being a racer, inferiority and superiority, outside of their machines was nailed down perfectly. I also knew that actors were so carefully chosen. When I finish watching this film, I thought \"who else but Hemsworth and Bruhl could act Hunt and Lauda?\" While some films that based on a real story chooses to use the actor who is in totally different impression to the original person, this film makes you feel like you are watching real Hunt and Lauda racing each other again.Spectacular story (of course), awesome CGI (especially the \"heavy rain\") and again, the noise of engines....If you are F1 fan, watch it. If not, watch it.",

Heard some good reviews and wanted to see it, but I prepared myself to be disappointed.I didn't like any of Ron Howard's films which came after \"Backdraft (1991)\", but this movie shows he's still go it.Technical aspect is excellent: Score (didn't realize it was Hans Zimmer until I looked it up just now), editing, cinematography, sound editing and I assume there is a lot of seamless CGI. And makeup.All of the above really give energy to the races and put the viewer inside the race. Great job. I loved the rough cinematography and editing - it gave the movie a documentary-like feel.Daniel Bruhl is excellent in his role and gives one of the better performances I've seen this year. I just noticed that he's nominated for a Golden Globe - he deserves that. Wait, he's nominated in \"supporting role\"? wtf?Chris Hemsworth is basically playing himself, but he's a good casting choice and fits the role very well.Don't get me wrong: A #149 place on IMDb is ridiculous and 2013 was a very weak year at the cinema, but this movie gets my vote on the list of the \"Best Movies of 2013\".I'm surprised to see that it did so poorly at the cinema: $90m worldwide on a $38m budget. I was certain it made much more.7/10 Highly recommended",

            "content": "A new film by Ron Howard and written by Peter Morgen. I instantly added this into my watchlist when I watched the first trailer and avoided all the other ones, even though I knew some about the story through my brother.The story of two legends of Formula One's rivalry James Hunt and Nikki Lauda in 1976, and I love how the film starts introducing these main characters and the inception of their competition. I also really love how much they've stayed truthful to the true story and showing both sides of the characters, it's not like the usual films to have a bad and a good character and the audience would root for the good one, either of these characters are good in something and bad in other things, and both their weakness and strength are shown here. It's just so interesting to me how these two characters use each other to improve themselves, which is why their race in that season was very exciting,. Great performances by Christ Hemsworth and Daniel Bruhl, particularly Daniel Bruhl, if you watch any interviews of Nikki Lauda, you realize how much he has nailed this role; however, I've never enjoyed Olivia Wilde's performance, she's not terrible here but this is just a personal thing that I can't like it, she definitely looks astonishing and she has a small part, so overall it is fine. Hans Zimmer once again has done a wonderful job on composing the soundtrack, and I love the sound editing, the score and the cars' sound are edited so well and blended together that it doesn't bother or ruin the moments, in fact it makes those scenes better - I really hope it gets some recognition in the award season. I must admit the cinematography is done perfectly, otherwise the race scenes wouldn't look beautiful and exciting. I should mention that I'm so glad that Nikki Lauda himself appreciated the film and its accuracy, a big applause and thumbs up to Ron Howard.Overall, I enjoyed this film and it's one best films are made for this year so far (I'm glad they didn't go to PG13 rating, I think that would kill the tone), definitely check it out in theaters and own it on bluray, I give it 9/10.",

He's pretty amazing in the role and despite the contrary, he makes his character way more likable. He's undeniably leading, arguably more of a lead than Hemsworth, but I don't care... I want him to get that Oscar nomination. The film editing and cinematography are also pretty impressive, and Howard does a great job behind the camera. Highly recommended!",

            "content": "Rush tells the true story of the heated rivalry between two Formula 1 drivers; playboy and hot head James Hunt (Thor) and level-headed and calculated Niki Lauda (a brilliant Daniel Bruhl). Rush begins with their humble beginnings in Formula 3 and their instant distaste for each other, and continues with their rise to Formula 1 and Niki Lauda's infamous crash that almost claimed his life. After the accident, their rivalry evolves from being fueled by hatred to one of mutual respectRush gets off to a rocky start, but once it gets its footing it envelops you in an atmosphere that is gloriously 70's. The cars, the hair, and vibrate colors is pure time machine. Rush is a born entertainer, a natural extrovert, the people are beautiful, the cars are flash, the sun is bright, the locations are breathtaking and the action is remarkable. You are constantly bombarded with high quality sensations. It's a dazzling experience.Rush is fun in a superficial sort of way, but the script only sporadically delves below surface of its source material. It comes down to the script not spending enough time on Hunt and Lauda's rivalry and hanging around too long on some of it's side plots. Also, there is no reason this movie needed to be \"R\" rated; The sex scenes and cursing could have easily been toned down or cut all together and taken nothing away from the core of Rush's appeal. In fact it would have streamlined the script and made Rush appeal to a wider audience.Don't worry, you probably won't notice my complaints, and if you do you won't care a damn. Rush is entertaining, gloriously action packed, beautiful to look at and is exceptionally well executed. Ron Howard's directing, particularly during the racing scenes is stellar and Hans Zimmer's scoring is hair-raisingly awesome. Rush is refreshingly slick, suave and adrenaline-infused. I say you'll be beguiled by it like I have, but the feeling won't resonate.",

            "content": "In over 60 years of official competition, there have only ever been a handful of movies about what is one of the worlds most popular sports. It's not through lack of inherent drama \u2013 just the last few seasons of F1 alone we've seen a no hoper team come from being scrapped to winning the world title, a championship won on the last corner of the final race of the season and racers walk away from what should have been life ending crashes. But whether it be the subject matter often being almost too extraordinary or the fear that recreating the sport on screen could almost be as expensive as running a team for a year, in general cinema has steered clear of the sport. So with RUSH arriving in cinemas, from Imagine Entertainment, Working Title Films and in the hands of director Ron Howard, have they achieved what few had dared challenge previous and created a heart pounding thrill ride of a movie or was the task too much for what is a modestly budgeted British film from a company best known for making Hugh Grant rom coms?RUSH tells the extraordinary story of the 1976 Formula 1 world championship, and the merciless 1970s rivalry between the cool, calm playboy Brit James Hunt and methodical, driven Austrian Niki Lauda. Starring Chris 'Thor' Hemsworth and Daniel Bruhl, director and former Happy Days star Ron Howard has crated a film of such brilliance that, much like documentary Senna, it transcends interest of the sport it focus on and presents what is one of the best performed and most gripping stories of the year so far. It helps that this truly was a fascinating year \u2013 from Lauda's near fatal crash, to behind the scenes political manoeuvrings and some of the most fierce on track racing ever witnessed in the sport, a year if someone wrote it down without the facts to back it up you'd probably never believe it.But is this anything more than a love letter to the glory days of a sport now controlled by corporations and banks? Yes, in fact whilst the racing is expertly handled and form some of the films most intense moments, it's the story of two men's bitter rivalry (and friendship) that sit firmly at the heart of this story. Hemsworth, who no doubt will set hearts a fluttering all bare chest and flowing haired, proves he more than a man with a large hammer and tights matching his charismatic subject matter James Hunt smile for smile. At the same time not to be outdone Bruhl, whose credits mostly include European films few have seen other than a turn in QT's Inglorious Basterds delivers a performance layered and emotionally grabbing that you just know he will rightfully end up with a trophy cabinet of awards come silly season next year. The positives don't stop there: From the lovingly recreated period detail (and not just the numerous F1 cars dragged out if retirement and museums to once again roar for the crowds), to the sense of danger at every turn, Howard and his team recreate the era almost perfectly and when the cars do race, the film pulls no punches. Actual arial photography taken at the time, mixed seamlessly with some of the most innovative racing cinematography ever placed on screen, every gear change, every button push is a thing of beauty. RUSH's cinematography (by Anthony Dod Mantle) is genuinely a thing of beauty and does well to hide what is, by all accounts, a low budget by Hollywood terms. But don't forget this Isn't a Hollywood movie. It may be directed by Ron Howard but this is a Working Title film. A British film. Okay so at $40million USD it's the biggest film working title have put together, but this is more British that Potter or Bond could ever hope to be. In short RUSH is a directorial triumph and probably Howard's best movie for some years. Also special note should go to Peter Morgan, writer of The Queen and Frost/Nixon, for a excellent screenplay that allows the story to take shape through the characters whilst allowing the actors enough space to add their own flair to the film. Is the film perfect? No. It takes liberties with actual events, being more a story inspired by the truth rather than representing the truth and at times it's both predictable and obviously when it strays from what is obviously the facts. But these things rarely matter against the backdrop of a film that tells the story of one of sports best rivalries, presenting in what is probably the best film of the year so far.Like Senna, RUSH tells a story that transcends the sport that works as the backdrop, a story of dedication, desire, competition, death defying acts and men willing to give everything for the glory of success. In doing so it opens itself to a wider audience that it could have hoped and, when awards season comes, should hopefully see itself recognised accordingly.For more Check out www.thefilmpodcast.co.uk",

            "content": "Having seen the rating this film has on this site, I was expecting something much more compelling.\nFor starters, the film takes a few liberties with historical accuracy - such as shifting the races on the F1 calendar - but most of all, it fails to capture the shade of the period. Hunt and Lauda are starting their careers in the immediate aftermath of the Sixties, a period characterised by an increasing gloom. There were fuel crises, there was terrorism, economies on the downturn and people trodden over by capitalism, side by side with the events in the film (1973-76). Meanwhile, this film makes the period seem as rosy as the two main characters, essentially spoiled rich kids driven by their personal manias. Even in its treatment of the drama of F1 - the death of numerous F1 drivers during the 70s, before the sport was regulated into an entertainment behemoth by Ecclestone & co. - the film offers only the occasional piece of gore, making it really hard to feel for the bunch of a-holes sitting in those tiny metal boxes. The sharp editing and vivid colours turn this into a comic book fairytale, largely evading the underlying historical shifts that can well be personified by Hunt and Lauda.\nAll of this wouldn't be an issue if it wasn't for the fact that this film purports to represent a historically-accurate image of two actual historical personages during an actual historic moment in F1's history. To even out the narrative burden between Hunt and Lauda, \"Rush\" makes Lauda the narrator while focusing the attention primarily on Hunt. There's reason to that, since Lauda is being presented as a quiet perfectionist, while Hunt is the loud, romantic hero of the kind they don't make anymore. This might make it easier for the viewer to recognise the Austrian as someone who's looking out to the future, while Hunt is locked in the past. At the same time, though, the film actively sells Hunt as the hero we can identify with or look up to, selling his childishness and shallowness as evidence of some inner depths, while the thoroughly two-dimensional Lauda is afforded just enough screen time to deliver some of the blandest and most obvious lines about the heroism of an F1 driver. Hunt may win the title in the end, while Lauda will get it back the following year, but in this film, no one really wins.\nAs for acting, this is definitely Hemsworth's film. For all his undeniable talent, Bruhl is too quietly competent to steal the limelight. There's a whole list of decent cameos here, but they're essentially edited beyond recognition, and in some cases, so firmly circumscribed by the bland writing that they are limited to a gallery of nice faces.\nIf your choice is between \"Days of Thunder\" and this, by all means, go for \"Rush.\"",

A lot of stuff is CGI enchanced, mostly you don't notice it, but a couple of times you could notice they are in front of a bluescreen instead of in a car. They also used real cars and most of the racing shots look very real. Hans Zimmer provides a very functional score that doesn't draw to much attention to itself. I enjoyed this movie a lot and I would certainly recommend it to any car enthusiast or F1 fan but I won't put it in my 2013 top 5 film list.

            "content": "Making films about real life characters always presents a challenge; more so if one of them doesn't live to see the day his tale is made into a film. Coming from director Ron Howard, known for films like 'Apollo 13', 'A Beautiful Mind', 'Da Vinci Code', 'Rush' is about two great personalities in the high adrenalin Formula 1 racing. The story begins on the start line where Niki Lauda (Daniel Br\u00fchl) narrates the story of how James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) influenced his life and the days of Formula 1 in the 1970's where it was not uncommon for drivers to die in accidents. James Hunt, who in real life was known as a playboy is appropriately portrayed on screen. There's a scene from his early days where he walks into at a hospital to get his injuries treated and lo behold, he seduces the nurse in James Bond style! Then, we are introduced to his career in Formula 3 where he drives for Lord Hesketh's team. Although the film marks the meeting of Lauda and Hunt in the F3 race on a sour note, it is believed that the duo were actually friends and shared an apartment during their early days. Was this an error? Or was it deliberately avoided to bring about dramatic tension between its lead stars right from the start? We wouldn't know. The character of Niki Lauda starkly contrasts with Hunt as he is cool, calculating, working with the team on developing the car and isn't bothered about partying or popularity. In real life too, it is believed that Lauda never let the achievements get into his head and he gave away his trophies to a local garage in exchange for car wash.Discussing the story itself isn't necessary for the review as most of the critical elements of the plot are based on actual, well known events. Its most poignant moment is how Lauda returns to track merely six weeks after a near-fatal crash with bandages on his wounds and leads the championship till he pulls out of the season's last race at Fuji when the treacherous weather conditions made the race too dangerous. 'Rush' does a wonderful job in recreating the F1 races, the imagery of powerful engines, tires ready to zoom as pedal hits metal, and the infamous N\u00fcrburgring crash of 1976. In fact, Niki Lauda in his interviews has praised the filmmakers for portraying the crash and his treatments in a realistic manner and that the scenes 'shocked' him. Reportedly, the actors weren't allowed to drive real Formula 1 cars. So, the film makers are said to have used F3 cars with the bodywork of F1 cars of that era to make them look like the real deal. Still, they drove some mean machines. Wow! The actors have done a good job and look like their real life counterparts. Chris Hemsworth still seems like Thor with the long hair, but less bulky. Daniel Br\u00fchl, an acclaimed German actor embodies the role of Lauda, Olivia Wilde as Suzy Miller, Alexandra Maria Lara as Marlene Knaus and Pierfrancesco Favino as Clay Regazzoni have done a neat job and there's not a moment where it feels inauthentic. What works for the movie, other than the stunningly recreated visuals is the emphasis on its characters. At its soul is the portrayal of how Hunt and Lauda influenced each other's lives and careers. Although the two champions were very different by their outwardly lives, they shared a common passion for racing and winning and looking at each other to seek the much needed challenge and why you need enemies!Verdict: if you are one of those who like Bollywood family dramas branded as racing films, like Ta Ra Rum Pum, let me assure you that 'Rush' isn't for you. But, if you are a Formula 1 fan, don't even think twice; just go for it.",

No matter how beautifully artistic the film was pieced together, I failed to be completely enthralled until Act 3. In fact, I had a different experience with the film in each act. Rush never found a common ground of consistency, even if it's well organized. When the picture started, I was thrown back in my seat by the radical editing and the thundering sound, making some of the year's biggest technical achievements that don't come from Sandra Bullock in space. The film proceeded as I expected a typical sports film would, so no matter excited I got from the brilliance of Howard's directing or the compact editing, I didn't connect or care about to the story. In Act 2, the cinematography popped out at my face and made me recognize the beauty Howard captured on film with the picture. But, I remained untouched and unpropelled by Rush as plot threads began to pile. Give Rush time and it will pay off. Finally Act 3 became the stunning winner that took everything to the next level. The story finally locks you in to caring about the two leading men. This is the time when they finally become humanized and all the themes of the film hit me like Hemsworth's race car would hit anything in his way to glory. The script lets you dissolve into the personal feelings of the characters at this point and Rush becomes a great film.Daniel Bruhl's powers jealousy, determination, and levels tragedy into his role, forming a performance that stands three dimensionally apart from the rest of the cast. The make-up is frigid and ravishing and is another asset to the art in Rush. I have problems with the final scene as it is covered in unnecessary sentiment. It's purpose is to repeat everything we learned for two hours and smile about it instead of letting Rush have a potent conclusion, cutting with the scene before. Rating: 7.5Rating: B+",

Hans Zimmer's moves the story in a wonderful and pulsating soundtrack. The drama depicts rivals Hunt and Lauda and the incredible events that lead to the perilous Nurburgring race and finally the Japanese Grand Prix. As each driver accrues points in each race, they reach the dangerous rain drenched final head to head for the championship title. \"RUSH\" is an exhilarating film between two talented drivers beautifully performed by Hemsworth and Bruhl. The lives and personalities of these two drivers couldn't be more different and yet their respect and admiration for each other and passion for racing formula 1 is palpable. The film is excellent and accurate in its details of the true story and rivalry of Hunt and Lauda. \"RUSH\" drives and delivers!",

            "content": "Rush. Based on real story of rivalry between two F1 drivers of 70s, dashing James Hunt played by 'Thor' fame Chris Hemsworth and clinical Niki Lauda played by incredible Daniel Br\u00fchl.Like a F1 race, Rush is also a racy drive with lots of bends in the story testing the lead characters' spirit and temperament. Both lead characters are so well developed and well played that they leave an indelible mark on your minds. Director Ron Howard masterly organizes a wonderful show of technical finesse, sharp dialogues, uncluttered screenplay and cinematic thrill of F1 racing. The love-hate-respect relationship between James and Niki is electric and every now and then you feel the adrenaline rush that they are feeling. There is hardly any dull moment and emotional conflicts revolving around the love lives of both the racers is handled with a light hand so that you are never distracted from the main plot. I am going with fantastic 8 out of 10 for Rush. This is one of the best sports movies in recent times and will surely get a cult status in future. Rush for this.",

            "content": "I almost passed on watching \"Rush\" because I am not really a fan of F1 car racing. However, very positive word of mouth egged me to squeeze it into my schedule. The buzz proved true -- this is one excellent film.Austrian Niki Lauda is a straight-laced, super-serious and introverted man, already a world champion the year before. British James Hunt is a happy-go-lucky, smoking and drinking, and gregarious ladies man, looking for his first major title. During the 1976 F1 season, Niki Lauda was leading all the way on total points until a devastating event threatened not only his crown, but his life. Can he summon enough will to fight the mortal odds and recover in order to race to the finish, or will James Hunt just be handed the championship cup of his dreams on a silver platter?Even if we only see Chris Hemsworth's face in the posters as James Hunt, this film was more about Niki Lauda, played with devastating realism by Daniel Bruhl. The conflict between two racing arch-nemeses with contrasting personalities seemed to be too ideal a story to be true, but amazingly this film indeed was inspired by a real events. We would witness their relationship evolve from jealousy, enmity, challenge, admiration to respect.Their relationships with the women in their lives were so well-executed in order to further delineate our two main characters off the track. James and his whirlwind marriage to New York-based model Suzy (Olivia Wilde) again contrasted perfectly with Niki and his calculated marriage to the elegant Marlene (Alexandra Maria Lara). The racing scenes were very intense, so well-shot. Those scenes when you see the track in the point of view of the driver. You can smell not only the gas and the fumes, but the adrenaline rush in the air. You can feel the real danger as past accidents were shown in ominous graphic detail. These scenes will definitely be showered technical Oscar nominations for cinematography, editing, sound and sound effects mixing. Director Ron Howard takes full advantage of the inherent drama in these events to create a very tense film, not only on the race tracks, but also in their personal lives and their philosophies about winning. Even if I did not know Lauda and Hunt, I was drawn into their story complete with all the ingredients of epic action, drama, and romance. Howard does not lose control of his material as everything fell in its right place in the gripping final cut of the film.",

But I am sitting on the sidelines watching, expecting more. Looking forward to the next great Ron Howard adventure.Now, I have to say something about the technical side of the film. I like the camera angles. I like the vibrating strand of grass vibrating while the F1-cars are swooping past them. It really made me believe.The make-up of Daniel Br\u00fchl in the role as Niki Lauda is superb. Really superb. At least for those of us old enough to remember Lauda in the late 70's.Something else? The scene from the hospital where the medical staff are vacuuming Lauda's lungs, almost made me puke. It feels so real, that I could almost feel that pipe going down my throat.Well worth a 9'er.",

            "review_title": "Do You Feel That Rush?!",
            "content": "Wow, I never knew I'd be so engrossed in a film about racecars. The main reason behind that compliment is because the film delves into so much more than the sport itself, and that's essentially what makes a great sports movie and is why most of them basically suck, in my opinion. Rush, like Moneyball before it, fully concentrates on the drive (no pun intended) and soul behind the individuals who choose to take on such risky endeavors or sports in general. The picture overwhelmingly benefits from excellent performances from Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Br\u00fchl especially. Whereas James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) plays the stereotypical jock (ladies man, bad boy), Niki Lauda (Daniel Br\u00fchl) starts out as more of an underdog, at least, in terms of his social life. As he witnesses the environment James proudly surrounds himself with, that jealousy and bitterness can be clearly sighted in Niki's eyes. Thus, he gets down and dirty from the business side of things, and this leads to a momentous, highly personal rivalry where both persistently overpower the other with their own set of methods. As a result, the audience witnesses pure complexity and depth within these two characters with their own special backstories and circumstances; the film wisely takes the time to build each character's traits and personality up in order to create a much more satisfying ultimate showdown- the one element that always heightens the tension and popularity of a rivalry in sports: one where the opponents have fully- developed personas and distinctive characteristics. What only follows is the classic and brutal form of competition as the two racers threateningly eye each other before engaging in their next intense race. On this note, I just want to immensely praise the race sequences throughout the film, perfectly capturing the sheer adrenaline and danger of the lives these daredevils settle for. As the menacingly enormous tires of those cars loudly speed right by the camera, you immediately know you're in for the thrill of your life, meaning if you never receive the opportunity to experience such an event, this film will surely suffice. It is undoubtedly touching when the participants of these races suit up and equip those sizable helmets while knowing full well that their lives hang in the balance and their lives would mean nothing without raising the stakes. With that, the spectacular sound design considerably services these scenes with the thunderous rev of that engine and the sound of the aggressive pouring rain. Few sports movies (racing ones specifically) are able to pull off this downright level of excitement for the moviegoers are all invited to experience and participate in an incredibly immersive ride (again, no pun intended). As the adventurers race for the finish line, stoic and epically dramatic music (by the consistently-brilliant Hans Zimmer) kicks in, and as your eardrums sense the pleasure of the violins and percussion's presence, you look on to an equally grandiose occasion. Rush terrifically balances character development and characterization with these more exhilarating and athletically passionate sections. In fact, the pace is amazing since it never even felt like two hours had passed me by. You're glued to the screen from beginning to end, and there's not one segment that feels unnecessary or uneventful, and I'd go so far as to say that it's one of the best paced films of the last few years. In addition, the cinematography of the film is utterly breathtaking and beautiful, showcasing various weather conditions with the motivation of winning continuing and a display of power and vulnerability all at once as the characters resume their imposing nature. Last but not least, it's a gripping and powerful story, fueled by exceptional writing, in which two men commence a rivalry that would go on to involve numerous predicaments. I immediately identified with Niki (though ruthless in his rude behavior at first) as the underdog who feels defenseless but will go through whatever unconventional path it takes to furiously destroy his foe (who's a good man- don't be mistaken for a second- which avoids the clich\u00e9s that usually infest sports movies). With that said, since the film was a sports movie at the end of the day, it still happened to lightly follow that similar structure most sports films incorporate, which creates a tad bit of predictability with its execution. Another element I just couldn't tolerate was the portrayal of the film's female characters. I did not find any of them likable at all. Most of them only \"hooked up\" with the protagonists because of their fame and money, and it wouldn't be a detriment to the film if it was intentional but it seemingly wasn't. For instance, Olivia Wilde is befuddled when she learns that James Hunt isn't that big of a deal. \"Oh, you mean I'm not going to be sleeping with the biggest racecar star I thought he was?!\" They were repulsive- however, Niki's \"soul mate\" was a lot more tolerable even though the relationship didn't begin at the highest of notes. In sum, Rush is now absolutely on my list for Best Picture nominees. Damn, since the fall's start, that's been three fantastic films in a row (Don Jon, Prisoners, and Rush). This season will be quite competitive indeed.",

            "content": "For whatever reason, the sport of Formula One is one that hasn't been served incredibly well in the movies. Aside from Asif Kapadia's 'Senna', there haven't really been any shining standouts. Thankfully, 'Rush' the latest movie from Ron Howard (reteaming with his 'Frost/Nixon' screenwriter Peter Morgan) is excellent, managing to make someone with no knowledge of the sport (i.e. this writer) compelled during the race sequences and throughout the entire championship. The movie centres on the rivalry between two F1 racers during the 1970s \u2013 the British playboy James Hunt and the disciplined Austrian Niki Lauda, played by Chris Hemswoth and Daniel Br\u00fchl respectively \u2013 and particularly during the 1976 Championship. This chalk-and-cheese relationship is at the very heart of 'Rush', with the differences between the two painted broadly, but effective nonetheless. Hunt is a racing pop star \u2013 with a legion of screaming fans and tendency to the go to a party after race. Lauda, on the other hand, is socially-inept and rigidly determined to win the championship, consequently being unafraid to speak his mind as he calls an extremely expensive Ferrari made for him, \"a s***box\". Hemsworth plays Hunt in a way similar to how he played Thor but still gives a good performance, while Br\u00fchl once again proves him to be a great actor, delivering a terrific and always engaging performance as Lauda. It wouldn't be a great surprise if he picks up some major acting nominations.The race scenes in 'Rush' are a sight to behold \u2013 Howard uses every trick going to make them exciting and he succeeds. With the shadow of death looming over each race, they are simultaneously exhilarating and terrifying, particularly N\u00fcburgring in Germany, as Lauda and Hunt dart furiously around an incredibly dangerous track in extremely stormy weather conditions. Aiding these sequences, are Anthony Dod Mantle's excellent cinematography, some roaring sound design and Hans Zimmer's score, which sounds unlike much of his recent work, wonderfully sounding like The Edge from U2 at times and at others like Ramin Djawadi's score for 'Game of Thrones'. 'Rush' is easily one of the best movies Ron Howard has directed in recent years, (it's a vast improvement on 'The Dilemma', that's for sure) and possibly one of his best films in general. You could level numerous complaints at the film, that many of the characters are thinly- drawn or that the script isn't up to the standard of 'Frost/Nixon', but when said movie is emotionally engaging with heart-pounding races, such flaws don't even register. It may not break the mould, but 'Rush' is funny, intelligent, thrilling and moving.",

            "content": "Audiences love to watch two sports people at the top of their game battling out man to man, do or die on the sports field or track. If the two combatants have gone past friendly rivalry to mortal enemies or each representing the others nemesis, then so much the better for TV ratings.Formula 1 (F1) in 1976, when do or die could be taken quite literally. Driver safety was a low priority, cars were raw, everyone was learning and there was still room for a hard drinking, eccentric, drug dabbling, womanising, playboy with talent to make his mark.Enter stage left, James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) with an upper class English accent, skill to burn and a complete distaste for playing by the rules, working hard and respecting any form of authority.Contrast this larger than life character with Niki Lauda (Daniel Bruhl), an Austrian with an abrupt manner, almost no diplomatic skills and personifying everything Hunt was not.The two rivals fight small time battles in Formula 3 before Lauda buys his way into the fledgling \"March\" team as the second driver. Promptly overseeing the rebuild of his car, Lauda's real skill lay in setting up the car to be faster and better before he even started the race.Meanwhile Hunt eventually stumbles into F1 under the \"Hesketh\" team, all champagne and aristocratic privilege, completely at odds with the more corporate F1 scene.The pair race and the trackside enmity starts to build as the drivers jockey for position on and off the track, they eventually move to their respective premier race teams of Ferrari (Lauda) and McLaren (Hunt). The two drivers acting as polar opposites in their approach to their chosen vocation, lifestyles and attitudes.As most viewers with a passing interest in Motorsport will know, there is a serious accident followed by an astonishing recovery and then a climactic 1976 world champion clinching race in Japan.Director Ron Howard is a highly professional film maker and it shows here, the film is as meticulously tooled as the cars on display. The period setting is excellent, the on track speed is arguably the most exciting race footage ever shown. The sound and sensation of raw power waiting to be unleashed, the use of close ups and engine components, all add to perception of speed and nerve tingling raw danger. Tyres shimmying and scrabbling for grip on the tarmac on the start grid, drivers desperate to win or die trying.The film is helped by a solid turn from Hemsworth, clearly having a blast portraying someone doing just that, having the time of his life. Bruhl gets the more difficult role and nails a portrayal that could have been unsympathetic in the wrong hands. The actor managing to find and show the intrinsic humanity and professionalism that lay below a rough, uncompromising exterior.Hunt died in 1993 aged only 45 of a heart attack, ending a colourful, eccentric and unconventional life. In retrospect a world away from the current professional, in bed early, hit the gym and then eat well sportsmen and women, who tend to dominate the professional sports world. Out of place then and probably unemployable if transplanted to 2013.There is little to fault here, however the female characters do not get much to do. Olivia Wilde as James Hunt's \"on a whim\" first wife Suzy Miller, married apparently to settle him down. That's a fail right there. Miller is all big hats and tantrums, presumably not realising that marrying a womanizing, hard drinking F1 driver might have some ups and downs. Alexandra Maria Lara as Marlene Lauda, gets to look worried, long suffering and downcast but with not much else to work with.Overall as good as it gets, taking great subject matter, adding some touching scenes, state of the art (but not seen) effects and teasing out some great performances, what more could you want.Summary Accessible, sexy, dangerous and with lashings of 1970's glamour, there is much to enjoy with solid acting and superb racing sequences anyone can enjoy.Excellent, go watch it.",

The two men had a lot in common. They were fortunate sons of wealthy families. They were obsessed with winning. While Hunt was a playboy, he was willing to die on the race track to gain a split-second advantage over his competition. Lauda spoke of cutting risk, which he could quantify, but he accepted the risk of tragic consequences of piloting race cars at insane speeds.If you like auto racing, you will love this story. The story contrasts how Lauda and Hunt were different. Lauda was a serious person who never worried about people liking him. He called everyone an \"asshole.\" He was extremely frank and lacked any form of tact. Hunt was handsome, fun- loving, drunk and utterly charming. The desire to be better than the other man drove them to excel. Where once they really didn't like each other, they become more than rivals. Wonderful film. See it.",

            "content": "I'm not very keen on Formula 1, so the news of a biopic about the rivalry between Niki Lauda and James Hunt didn't strike a nerve. When the trailer for the movie appeared, I was even less eager to watch the actual movie since the trailer wasn't particularly good. Eventually, I did see Rush in a full theater on a Saturday night, and absolutely no one in the audience talked throughout the movie. It seemed that everyone, myself included, was amazed by the movie and enthralled by the story. Rush turned out for me to be one of this year's biggest surprise and, for now, one of the best movies of the year.Rush follows two very different Formula 1 drivers. One is the charming British partyboy/playboy James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth), and the other is the determined Austrian perfectionist Niki Lauda (Daniel Br\u00fchl). As the voice over \u2013 from Lauda's point of view \u2013 early in the movie says, he's most famously known for two things \u2013 the first being his rivalry with James Hunt and the second being his nearly fatal accident in which his face got severely burned. The movie gives us a little backstory about those men, about their backgrounds, personas and family life, and then spends the remaining time depicting the events that happened in the 1976 Formula 1 season.The best thing about Rush is that it doesn't have any major flaws \u2013 it's just a very good movie, as simple as that. Rush is a two men show: Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Br\u00fchl make this movie, no other actors or characters other than them are really important to the story. The casting of Hemsworth and Br\u00fchl in their respective roles was genius, not only because they look like their real life counterparts, but they feel very natural in their roles and portray their characters with ease. Of course, one may argue that their roles weren't extremely difficult to play, but they do it so believably and smoothly that I think at least one of them may get an Academy Award nomination \u2013 if not even both of them. I do hope that this movie introduces Br\u00fchl to the mainstream audience some more, since he is a talented actor and it would be great to see him in more mainstream movies.As for the plot of the movie movie itself, I was somewhat suspicious \u2013 can a rivalry between two sports figures be fascinating enough for a two-hour-long movie? Fortunately, I was once again taken by surprise. The story depicted in the movie was rather dramatic, inspiring and engaging \u2013 it was intriguing to watch two completely different men approach the same dangerous topic (or should I say problem?) of formula racing. So, yes, there is more than enough drama to fill the length of a two-hour movie. Interestingly, the only thing that's lacking in this sport biopic are the scenes of actual sport \u2013 there aren't much racing scenes. Those scenes are used selectively and to push drama forward, never to replace the actual drama. And when they were in the movie, you could see they were magnificently shot, with the just right amount of shaky cam. I would expect nothing less than technical perfection from an experienced director like Ron Howard. The soundtrack in the movie was also good \u2013 most of it was composed by the great Hans Zimmer. All in all, Rush is a truly excellent movie about an entertaining story and it features brilliant people who know how to do their job.",

That two hour running time goes by in a blink of an eye and it's never boring or padded out with any long winded drama moments. I truly enjoyed it.The movie was a little different in terms of story than I expected, because the promotional posters all have the Hunt character displayed prominently on them so I naturally assumed it was a tale mainly about him. This wasn't the case however, as I would say the film is actually more about Lauda than James Hunt. Both men are shown warts and all, and neither is put forward to be seen as better than the other. A fine feat really, and very well directed to deliver this position. I would certainly watch this movie again, and the film finishes leaving the viewer respecting both men for their achievements but with a tinge of sadness for James Hunt who seemed to burn out like a flare way too early in his life.

I was wrong, the story is brilliantly told, and the movie captures perfectly a less PC, less rigid, less technical, more colourful, more risky and more exciting motor sport era. Hemsworth turns out to be a charismatic actor who brings a sense of the dangerous (reckless) energy that Hunt had as the last off the. 'Gentlemen amateurs'. Lauda heralded a new era and proved that although less reckless, he embodied courage in a different way. The rivalry was real and fuelled a great seasons racing. The movie really caught the era for me, the background captured perfectly in flashes of news, fashion, and a general looseness that is missing from our photoshopped era. Supporting actors are great, Olivia Wilde even looks like Suzy Hunt as I remember her... But the main thing is that the pace is like a race, and the movie drew me in with real drama, no mean feat given that I already knew who won! I don't understand some of the pedants who think their view of this history does how supersedes all others. For me this was real as it should be and dramatic as it could be. As for some prurient type complaining at seeing Hemsworths buttocks, go watch the latest Disney film, and leave this for the adults amongst us. Fantastic.",

            "content": "Film is from StudioCanal who also made 'Senna' (2010). The Director is Ron Howard who in 1995 directed 'Apollo 13'.This film is set in the seventies world of Formula One racing and deals with the rivalry between the drivers Niki Lauda and James Hunt.Film opens appropriately at the start of a race before giving us some back-story. A slightly-bloodied figure, wearing something like an Apollo space-suit, looking something like a Greek god, enters a hospital. He is James Hunt the racing-driver.Chris Hemsworth plays the part of James Hunt. This is the first time this reviewer has seen Chris Hemsworth. He looks like Brad Pitt, he looks and sounds like Roger Moore, he would make a very believable Alexander The Great. He has a big presence and dominates in his scenes.Ever since the gladiators of Ancient Rome, right up to the present time, certain occupations, such as; gladiators, firemen, gangsters, soldiers and racing-car drivers, have held a fascination. Narration by the James Hunt character explains why. The precarious life-style is attractive, exciting and glamorous. It is never explicitly stated why this film is entitled 'Rush'. However the whole film implicitly tells us that it is about the adrenalin-rush that comes from the speed and the life-style. That is what attracts ordinary people and that is what drives the participants. That drug-like addiction to drive and race is shown well.James Hunt came from a comfortable background, but film shows how enthusiastic amateurs, with a modest amount of money, could build their own Formula Three racing-cars in their garages, and then race them. To succeed as a racing-driver though, required the good luck of being talent-spotted, and then sponsored, by rich backers.The young James Hunt meets Niki Lauda played by Daniel Bruhl. Lauda is Austrian,his character has a Germanic-like intensity which is the complete opposite of the debonair Hunt. Lauda is obsessed, in a German-engineering way, in the technical side of racing. A workaholic who expects the same from those around him. By contrast Hunt is a playboy, driven to drive, driven to take risks, but also happy to indulge fully in the life-style made possible by his occupation. The interplay between the two drivers is both entertaining and intense. The competition between their different philosophies is at the heart of this drama.Other drivers are just nameless faces in the background, and it is correct that this is so, as anything else would distract from the central struggle between the two drivers. There is one exception; Clay Regazzoni. He it was, who in real-life, contributed in a very important way to this story. This is not clear in the film but it is right that he features in it. Perhaps this is a tribute to him. Certainly he would be a worthy subject of a film himself. He is played, superbly, by Italian actor Pierfrancesco Favino.The actor with the top -billing in this film is Daniel Bruhl who plays Niki Lauda. He is the real star of the show. Chris Hemsworth showed well the intensity of the desire to drive by James Hunt, but playing a good-looking sex-symbol did not stretch him to the extent as did the Niki Lauda role for Daniel Bruhl. Much more was asked of him, and he delivered.This movie was filmed in such a way as to give us a truly authentic rich-colour seventies feel to it. All other seventies details strike an authentic note too. Younger viewers may be shocked to see hospital staff smoking, but yes, smoking was as ubiquitous as it is shown in this film. Cars, vans, haircuts and jackets too, all looked in place. Some contemporary seventies music, placed Scorsese-like, in the background, also hit the spot.Familiar with the seventies, this reviewer recently revisited them, when I went to see 'The Battle of the Sexes', a documentary about the famous tennis match. I was unsure the details of this event and was happily reminded of the seventies decade. I knew the general story of the documentary 'Senna' and so decided to avoid it. With the 'Rush' story, I knew the general details, but not the finer details, and so was genuinely excited about how things would turn out in the film. The second-half of this film is almost totally about the racing and it is very exciting.All racing-enthusiasts should enjoy this film. However there is something here for people of all tastes. Director Ron Howard, like he did in 'Apollo 13', has been able to take a true story, and craft it into a great drama. While sexual-athlete James Hunt does engage in a lot of soulless sex (see the mirror), this film does also have time for romance too. Film is at times very emotional, and as the film progresses, the two protagonists find out things about each other, so do we. The recent 'About Time' was a celebration of life, so too is this film. The decade of the seventies was crazy, dangerous and wild. \"Ayds helps you slim\" was then merely an advertising slogan for a slimming product. James Hunt was the largest of those larger-than-life characters. Niki Lauda by contrast was the process-obsessed technician with an iron-will but perhaps the most human. Brad Pitt's Achilles in 'Troy' (2004), said that the gods envied us for the way we lived our lives. Too true. Enjoy life, enjoy the rush, enjoy this film. Magnificent! 10/10.",

Ron Howard, i have to take my hat off to you, you have annoyed me on the grid walks at the F1 races for the last 6 months with his over the top American nature but his excitement must have been fuelled by his masterpiece that he has created.I Highly suggest, either prior to watching it or post film, you watch the documentary on them with the real life footage and you will see how to each minor detail of Niki Lauda's (Daniel Br\u00fchl) facial expressions, his rat like teeth, his confident yet calculated persona and James Hunts (Chris Hemsworth) arrogant, lavish, reckless aura. I would have given it a 9/10 as 10/10 is just virtually impossible in my book but seeing the documentary after, you just see how much research and detail has been put into this and how they have turned one of racing most incredible rivalries and tragedies into a living masterpiece.",

Actually portraits these two legendary drivers of F1. \"Niki\" Lauda was always my favorite, but I haven't really study his personalily. After this film, I searched a lot and because the amazing performance of Daniel (playing \"Niki\"), I understood more the legendary Lauda (as PERSON, as CHARACTER).Great movie; seriously, one of the best drama films I've watched.",

An F1 fan for more than a decade, the movie lived up to what the trailers had built up.Hats off to Ron Howard and Peter Morgan (writer) to write and make a film about F1. F1 as a sport I believe has never captured the eye on Hollywood and that's a pity considering a fact that its a very popular sport worldwide.The story set in 1970s when as James Hunt (played by a brilliant Chris Hemsworth) tells Olivia Wilde's character that a F1 car is a coffin on wheels. F1 today is a far safer sport than what was it in the 70s. The rivalry between Hunt and Lauda was at its peak. They both came from similar backgrounds of rich parents who wanted them to choose normal career paths. They objected. But where Hunt was a playboy and risk taking driver, Lauda was a risk calculating restrained driver.But the best part of the story is how they drew inspiration from each other to beat each other. Even the women with their small roles inspire the men to become better drivers. The performances are brilliant. Both Bruhl and Hemsworth shine especially Hemsworth who is sad and lonely from inside in spite of all the attention around him. I would seriously urge the producers of the Bond Franchise to seriously look at Hemsworth to replace Craig in the future. And finally, the icing on the cake is the brilliant cinematography.I took a friend along who doesn't watch F1 and questioned me why do the drivers take such risks at the beginning. By the time the film ended, he understood the madness in the sport. Rush is for F1 fans but a must watch to all those people who think its a stupid sport !! Hope like my friend they understand F1 at the end !!",

It was so intense I was literally clutching my glass of wine! The visuals are amazing, the soundtrack was just perfect for the movie that takes place in the 70's. It also has superb acting! Ron Howard did such a great job directing, and the pace of the movie just flowed naturally and at a good clip! It was exciting, dramatic, and thrilling. The movie is based on a true story and I was so impressed with it that I looked up the added details about the cast, crew, awards because I was just sad that it had ended! Watch it!

It is very rare that I find any film that I can find little fault with, but this is one such movie.Historical nuts may take umbridge that the film is not 100% geek-accurate and correct (most films seldom are) but I was very happy with what Ron Howard has done here (I am one such geek!). The casting is so spot on that you genuinely believe that it is Niki Lauda and James Hunt. Chris Hemsworth was never going to quite get Hunt's public school boy accent absolutely bang on but he's done a cracking job nevertheless, and Daniel Bruhl is quite simply spectacular as the matter of fact, calculating Lauda.The race scenes are particularly realistic and it's great to see that genuine period F1 cars were used in the filming rather than the generic \"racing cars\" one normally sees. The film brings home the danger that these drivers put themselves in during the 70s; Lauda's crash is particularly graphic, being seen from both an outside vantage point and the driver's point of view. There are enough grisly bits to make you wince but you do realise the driving force behind why they did it.The support cast is also fantastic; Lord Hesketh is EXACTLY like real life, and the likeness of the actor playing Clay Regazzoni is uncanny. Olivia Wilde, playing Hunt's wife Suzy, is smouldering and has an excellent English accent.Ron Howard has always been about telling an accurate true-life story which keeps you glued to your seat, and here he tells a story of two World Champions the way it should be done. Even if you don't like Formula 1, this is a MUST SEE film. It will be worth it - it is the best film I have seen in 10 years.",

            "content": "\"Rush\" mini-review\"Rush\" is a compelling look into a relationship between two formula-one drivers, Austrian Niki Lauda and Britain James Hunt. At first blush, \"Rush\" appears to be like any other sports movie, this time about car racing. However, it's also about perseverance and about what's important in life beyond the race track. Anthony Dod Mantle's (28 Days Later, Slum Dog Millionaire) cinematography is top notch. During the movie, we see the cars from every angle, inside and out. The audience feels like they are part of the race. I will go on record right now giving Mantle the Oscar for best cinematography. Nearly as spectacular is the sound in the film. We feel and hear the roar of the formula one cars without loosing a word of dialog. The complicated blend of multiple engines, pit crews speaking, fan reactions and other ambient noises as well as the sound track makes this a challenging mix. The sound mixing is also Oscar worthy as is perennial nominee Han Zimmer's sound track. Unlike some movie composers, most notably John Williams, Zimmer can go full bore, but he knows when to pull back and let the scenes play out in near silence. Poster boy Chris Hemsworth portrays playboy racer James Hunt like a pro, but it is Daniel Bruhl as the serious, workman-like Niki Lauda that truly shines in a more challenging roll. Director Ron Howard, along with Peter Morgan's script, help us care about the flawed main characters. That is no simple accomplishment. The ending of the movie is bitter sweet as the real-life drivers play out their roles, the playboy and the technician, to the end. Rating: Pay Full Price Peace, Tex Shelters",

When I first heard about it, I didn't have the greatest of hopes, worrying that Ron Howard wouldn't portray the sport correctly, or do it a disservice, but after seeing various interviews & him popping up at various events throughout the Formula 1 calendar, I was starting to go along with the hype & was in no way disappointed. This is the best movie I've seen this year. I was gripped from start to finish. It really had it all, from the authentic racing perspective, to the drama on track & the off track lives of both Hunt & Lauda, being portrayed excellently. This is the first film I've seen in a while where I can see myself watching this over & over again in the years to come.The movie is based on the unbelievably true story of James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) & Niki Lauda's (Daniel Br\u00fchl) rivalry during the 1970's in Formula 1. The story follows their starkly contrasting lifestyles both on the track, as well as in their personal lives off the track. James Hunt is your charming English playboy, living every day like its his last in both his driving and his party going lifestyle, whereas in contrast Niki Lauda is the consummate professional, having that extraordinary ability to know exactly what's required to get the utmost performance out of his car. They both push each other to strive for the world championship, to outdo each other, from their Formula 3 days in the early 1970's to the dramatic 1976 Formula 1 season.I don't believe there are enough superlatives to describe this movie, from the fantastic cinematography & the staging of the racing scenes. Yes there is a bit of use of CGI, but strip that back, there were real stunt drivers driving the real cars, with cameras mounted in ideal positions to get great shots. Even both Hemsworth & Br\u00fchl both entered into driver training to prepare for their roles, which added to the authenticity. I think Ron Howard nailed this, from the look of the cars, to capturing the spirit of 1970's Grand Prix. I was especially impressed with the detail in the sounds of the cars. You can tell it was crafted to hear the sound from the drivers perspective during shots focused on the drivers. You top off all this with an incredible story, which is even more impressive that its based on a true story.I really felt gripped throughout the movie, from the highs of the racing and the rivalry, through to the excruciating pain Lauda went through on his recovery, I really felt like I felt every emotion, good or bad throughout the movie. This is an incredible movie and I'm sure even if your not a Formula 1 fan, or even a sports fan, you will find something in the drama of the legendary rivalry between Hunt & Lauda, that is Rush!",

            "content": "Rush is a biopic drama based on the real-life rivalry between the famous Formula One drivers James Hunt and Niki Lauda during the 1976 Formula One season. First and foremost, I'm not a Formula 1 fan as I find the sport uninteresting and I don't know much about the sport itself.But, I find myself drawn into this film.Different than many typical racing sports film found out there, Rush actually shows the clash between two distinctive, contrasting personalities, the passion that brought them into the sport and fears that come with it. James Hunt is a highly sociable British playboy who loves to live life dangerously close to death, have the willingness to do whatever it takes to win, a seemingly typical F1 driver. On the other hand, Niki Lauda is an eccentric, methodical, disciplined, and seemingly unsociable perfectionist, constantly assessing the odds and potential risks and outcome of things.Watching these two characters constantly pushing their limits to be the world's best racer and what drives them to win truly makes this a very engaging, entertaining, interesting drama to watch.With a great character-driven script by Peter Morgan, brilliant direction by Ron Howard, good acting performances by the two leads to provide impressive character depth and gripping, intense score composed by Han Zimmer (again), the film successfully showed both personas, allowing the audience to draw out the differences between these two men, in terms of personal values and beliefs and how they eventually develop mutual respect for the other by the end of the film.Technically speaking, it seems like Lauda is the better driver as he knows the specifics, modification, requirements of a Formula 1 car compared to James, but James' bold and determined personality also shows that he's a good driver who certainly deserves respect.The racing scenes in the film was intense and beautifully filmed. The injuries sustained by Lauda during the Nurburging crash in 1976 looks about the same in real-life. It's definitely a compelling drama worth watching, not to be missed.Rating: 8.5/10 \"When I saw it the first time I was impressed. There was no Hollywood changes or things changed a little bit Hollywood-like. It is very accurate.

Everything feels perfect in this move. The acting, the tense cinematography and editing, Hans Zimmer's music, just all of it; but the one element that makes this the best movie of 2013 is the Character Development for both Niki and James. Niki starts out as the emotionless professional while James starts out as a \"bad boy\"/Adrenaline Junkie; both don't care about each other but that changes throughout the entire movie. For example: Before Niki's crash, James encourages everyone to let the race continue despite the rain and Niki's disagreements, showing us that both characters are at their lowest points; Niki showing some hints of fear for the first time and James, having nearly lost everything trying to beat Niki and is barely in the lead. During the final race however, James attempts to call it off, saying that its \"lethal\" out there with heavy rain and during the press conference, showing some hints of worry for possibly Niki. And Niki even forfeits the race rather than usually finish it. That kind of character development is executed well here and it elevates the film to a whole new level. And Ron Howards directing is great.Overall, the best movie of 2013. 10/10",

The relationship between Hunt and Lauda was a little bit over-dramatized for the movie, but not too much. In real life, the two drivers were good friends and had immense respect towards each other, and the film, although antagonizing them with each other, manages to show how deeply these two guys respected each other. Chris Hemsworth does a brilliant job as James Hunt and Daniel Br\u00fchl is simply phenomenal as Niki Lauda. I think it was unfair that he didn't even get the nomination for the Academy Awards, and this snub might be the biggest embarrassment in the history of Ocars.'Rush' captures the essence and the period, and the dangers of racing perfectly. Film's fast pace makes the viewer feel excited like watching a real race. The movie jumps right into the story without spending too many extra minutes for introducing the characters. Yet nothing is left unsaid, and the viewers who are not particularly familiar with the history of Formula1 racing will be perfectly informed. The characters and story are set with minimal time, but with maximum intensity, thus leaving more room for the racing on (and off) the track.Leave it to Ron Howard if you want a historically accurate biographical movie on the epic scale. Racing fan or not, 'Rush' will not leave you untouched with its sleek visual style and inspiring story that races on with 200mph. Racing fan or not, you will like this movie, as it is as much about real people than about the racing.P.S. The first time I saw the film was in its initial run in 2013. Its impact was still present in 2019 when I watched it the second time. It is interesting how the person's values change over time - in '13 I liked Hunt because of his easygoing rebel attitude, but in'19 I sympathized more with Lauda and his straightforward attitude, concentration and dedication for work.",

Yes, there are a few of those, but the film as a whole, portrays in a vivid manner all that made F1 racing so great in the '70s.Some of the unrealistic facts that caught my eye: - Hesketh, as a Team, did not pull out from F1 at the end of 1975. James Hunt simply left them for a better team. - The driver that was killed during Watkins Glen GP 1975, is Francois Cevert and was not decapitated. - Nurburgring 1976. Lauda did not lose his helmet and no driver was hurt in the qualifying session, before the race. There are a few more, but Ron Howard managed to knit those events so nicely in the story, that you could pretty much believe that things happened that way!Another area that really impressed me, was the resemblance of the actors to the real people and the amount of work that went into Daniel Br\u00fchl's make up, in order to make his scars look the same like Lauda's did, after the accident. It is really amazing!In conclusion, everyone can enjoy this film, no matter how much into F1 he/she is. But you have to remember one thing, this is not a documentary, it is a movie.",

            "content": "I have to admit I watched this film for reasons that had nothing to do with it, it was a completely random choice. I even looked it up first just to see what it is about before I started watching it and was kind of put off by being a sports movie about car racers. I have to also admit that I think the sport itself quite silly, even amongst other silly sports. But the film was so good that I had to rate it top grade.The story is a classic conflict between the clear headed unpleasant man racing cars for money and the maverick charismatic risk taker that does it for the kicks, but unlike most American movies, it does not turn one into a hero and the other into a villain. Instead it presents the world of racing as it was back then: high risk of injury and death, the glory and the pain, the races that are not cancelled if people paid too much for viewing rights no matter the risks, the gladiatorial adrenaline filled world of the racers themselves.But what was better than great acting, great directing and a wonderful story was the refreshing perspective from actual people with actual lives and problems and emotions. It was so personal and so touching that I believed it to be Lauda's own biography and searching for it I see that he actually published one, called To Hell and Back, yet the script is not based on that, but on the work Peter Morgan did with constant input from Lauda. Daniel Bruhl's extraordinary performance was also honed by him spending time with Niki Lauda.Not everybody is happy with the film, though. Some think that the film pales in comparison to John Frankenheimer's Grand Prix, a movie that I have no watched. It might make a good viewing if you like this one.All in all, I really appreciate the effort done in researching and planning the film as well as the wonderful performances and directing. Carjack TV videos show Lauda and Hemsworth and Daniel Bruhl interviews of the film which might come nicely after watching the movie. Great job all around!",

            "content": "When you think Ron Howard, you think Richie, obviously; and then you think blockbusters. He's made a quite a few of them. Apollo 13, A Beautiful Mind, Frost/Nixon, Cocoon; and those are just the films that I like. Pretty much all of his films are commercial and/or critical successes, and every new film is met with a lot of hype and fanfare. We can now add Rush to that list of blockbusters.For those that don't know, Rush is the true story of James Hunt and Niki Lauda, Formula 1 drivers in the 1970s. The two men were at the top of their game, which led to a very personal and merciless rivalry both on and off the track.Rush follows the same pattern that all of Ron Howard's films seem to, which, considering his track record, is probably a good thing. The main similarity is the very strong story, and Rush has a fantastic one. The rivalry between Lauda and Hunt was a vicious one, with incidents that arguably could only have been the stuff of fiction. The fact that it's all true is incredible, and you don't need to be a racing fan to appreciate it. Another similarity. Like with Apollo 13 and Frost/Nixon, Howard is able to take a subject with a niche interest and make it appeal to the masses.In Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Bruhl, we are also witness to two very good performances. If you've seen Inglorious Basterds, then you probably already know that Bruhl is a very good actor; and here, he's excellent as the cold, boring Lauda. The real star, though, is Hemsworth. After a filmography that includes superhero and horror movies, this might be seen his breakthrough as a serious actor. It was very impressive. The supporting cast were decent enough, but nobody else really stands out beyond the top two. What was nice to see is Green Wing alumni Stephen Mangan and Julian Rhind-Tutt make appearances. But, at the end of the day, you're watching the movie for the two leads, and they're very good.Here's the problem, though. As good as the story is, and as good as the actors and the performances are, Rush falls down where so many of his films have done. The script. They're not awful, don't get me wrong \u2013 his films wouldn't be successful if the scripts were horrendous. The problem with the scripts are that they're overly sentimental and, at times, very cheesy. It really gets a little hard to watch when the stuff being said is so full of exposition.However, if you're happy to forgive the filmmakers for that (and most audiences seem to), then you're still really going to enjoy this movie. Despite the subject matter, it manages to balance a good amount of humour and drama. Add in some excellent performances, and you've got a fun film to watch.This will never go down as one of Ron Howard's best movies, and he won't win any awards for it probably, but it's a great effort. Give it a look.",

            "content": "Sure, cutting edge is sexy and gets a lot of attention from both critics and casual movie goers\u2014it's easy to recognize and even easier to talk about. However, there is a place for supreme competence and Ron Howard is one of the most supremely competent. But just because he isn't pushing the limits of style or technique\u2014which can sometimes be little too calculated and self conscious\u2014doesn't mean he's not versatile. Consider the impressive Frost/Nixon and his latest effort, Rush\u2014about as far from each other in style and scale as you can get\u2014even if they do share a common theme. Both films are, essentially, about two men, rivals, who need each other in order to reach their full potential and self awareness. Rush is the story of one of the greatest sports rivalries of all time\u2014 the battle for title of the best Formula 1 racer in the world. The sometimes friendly, and often bitter, rivalry between Britain James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) and Austrian Nikki Lauda (Daniel Bruhl), captivated the racing world through much of the seventies, reaching a dramatic peak in 1976. Note here that in Europe, where Formula1 racers are accorded rock star status (something Hunt's overactive libido takes full advantage of), it captivated far more than the racing world\u2014it captivated an entire continent. One of the best scenes in the film shows, in amusing fashion, that for Italian men the only things in the world more exciting than a beautiful woman are a fast car and Formula 1 driver.Jame Hunt, a brash and sometimes offensively arrogant playboy, navigates his McLaren \"bomb on wheels\" by instinct and guts; Nikki Lauda, a calculating and sometimes offensively arrogant technician, drives his Ferrari by the book, assessing risk and reward like a bond trading statistician. When the car isn't what he wants it to be, Hunt berates his mechanics to make it better; Lauda tells his mechanics precisely what is wrong and how to fix it. Hunt is the charming bon vivant, comfortable in any social situation because he makes it his own; Lauda is an acerbic social misfit with no idea that he repels almost everyone he meets.Daniel Bruhl's portrayal of Lauda transcends the genre, elevating the film to more than just an action-filled biopic. He plays Lauda as humorless, but with a subtle, squashed wryness behind the eyes. It's a nomination quality performance. Chris Hemsworth proves himself to be better than the pretty boy roles he's had until now\u2014much better. This guy can really act. One problem throughout the film is that Hemsworth is just too damn good-looking, distractingly so. The casting smacks of manipulation. It feels as if the film uses every angle to make us like Hunt as much as we dislike Lauda , to the extent of making Hunt overly attractive and Lauda, well, not so much, in order to set us up for self- chagrin when, later in the film, Lauda faces a personal disaster that can invoke only the most profound sympathy. But in retrospect it makes sense\u2014actual footage of the two runs behind the final credits and it turns out that Hunt was strikingly handsome and Lauda.....Howard brings together his standing team of Anthony Dod Mantle, cinematographer, and Daniel P. Hanley as editor\u2014and to good effect\u2014the three work together seamlessly. The colors are bright and saturated (A red Ferrari is a damn red Ferrari) with with almost garish seventies style banners flashing on the screen announcing the location of every race\u2014and there are a lot of races. The film does not want for road action. One of the reasons for going to a race movie is to see racing. Rush delivers, and delivers well. To the credit of Hanley, the scenes on the track are exciting and tense in just the right proportion and show in visceral detail how these machines work and just what they and their drivers are capable of\u2014truly awesome, and not in the pop sense of the word.It's hard to come up with a criticism of Rush. After all, it is a racing movie and a story of a spirited rivalry between two of the best in their field\u2014each a time-worn genre and somewhat limiting in their strict forms \u2014so it gets a little room for having a few clich\u00e9s, which it does. But, having said that, it is one of the absolute best of both types. It's fun, it's exciting, there are no slow spots and it's got some really cool cars in it. (Maybe the Italians have their priorities in line, after all.) It's definitely worth seeing, and worth seeing on the big screen\u2014the racing scenes deserve far more than a small screen can deliver.",

            "content": "Along with being a film guy, the other passion in my life is sports and the credit for that has to go to my family. My dad played baseball throughout his youth and we have been Detroit Tigers season-ticket holders for years. My mother's family is a hockey family and my uncles and aunts have won numerous high school championships. My younger brother is a baseball and hockey player and I enjoy cheering him on during his games. One sport my mother and father were into before I was born was Indy Car Racing. Unfortunately that sport has declined in popularity and these cars no longer race at our local track, the Michigan International Speedway so I never had a chance to get into it.OK, so I went to see the movie Rush which is a movie from Ron Howard about Formula 1 Racing. Being a film person, I knew every actor in this movie but I knew absolutely nothing about the actual people depicted in this movie nor Formula 1 Racing which is a European and not an American thing. Frankly, this is a movie I should have not liked nor cared about at all.Rush is based off a true story and set in 1970's, about Formula 1 race car drivers James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) and Niki Lauda (Daniel Bruhl). The movie tells the story of the fierce rivalry of these drivers who were opposites in just about every way and how they interacted with each other and eventually became friends.As he did in \" The Cabin in the Woods\", Hemsworth plays playboy, fun-lover James Hunt. Hunt is a partier who drinks heavily, is frequently hungover, takes drugs and has a new woman every night. He is still a very good driver who is very fun to watch and in the last act shows a high level of determination chasing the championship. Olivia Wilde plays Hunt's wife Suzy Miller though the movie does not allow any development of their relationship as they are married shortly after she is introduced in the movie.Where as Hunt is just thrown to you as a character and given no back story, Niki Lauda is depicted as a very in-depth character with a detailed history. Lauda is a character who's family has given up on him after choosing to be a race car driver instead of going into the family banking business. He is the exact opposite of James Hunt. Lauda is mean, anti-social, disagreeable and a \"my way or the highway\" type of guy. After throwing in the towel at a party, on his way home Lauda meets his wife Marlene Knaus (Alexandrea Maria Lara). The love and chemistry between these two is strong and the exact opposite of the empty marriage of Miller and Hunt. Lauda's character also endures a terrible fiery crash with extreme burns to his face and the movie does an excellent job with his makeup and the story of his very painful rehabilitation and return to the track.For someone who had no knowledge of Formula 1 Racing, this movie was a perfect introduction and a way to get into it. The movie also depicts the 1970's realistically with the men's long hair, fashion and drug use. Formula 1 Racing is shown through the various racetracks and the film show it's cultural impact and popularity in Europe. Rush includes strong cinematography showing high level racing and anybody would be entertained by this movie whether you are into automobile racing or not.When it's all said and done, Rush is a moving and powerful movie by director Ron Howard to add his already great resume. Howard makes us care about a story that most Americans don't even know about. Rush is likely one of the top films of the year. No caution flags or pit stops are going to stop it.",

He has a script written by the same guy who has written other films for him (like Frost-Nixon). The drama gets very strong here.As for the sex sequences, they are laughable. One thing Hollywood does well is portray hugs, love, and kisses. One thing it does poorly is the sex beyond. Luckily there is only a minimum of it in this movie.The casting of the leads is excellent as both actors are solid in their roles. The film does start a bit slow but moves along well at the end. Being shorter at the end is an asset as you leave the theater with the illusion the entire movie was speedy.Strong finish at the checkered flag sends off the viewer with a good feeling.",

            "content": "I saw an ad for this film in the cinema foyer and I thought to myself that the man in the racing car looked like Niki Lauda. I had no idea who the good looking blonde driver was meant to be though. Maybe that comes into it. Anyway, turns out the ad was for a fact based dramatisation of actual Formula 1 racing car drivers...so, Daniel Br\u00fchl already has some credit in the bank for his portrayal of the multi-time world champion Formula 1 driver Niki Lauda. This movie got a good review on \"At the movies\" so that also made me more inclined to watch it. However, seeing Australian Chris Hemsworth as the \"other\" driver (James Hunt) in the clip for the movie on that TV show made me think that his English accent seemed quite contrived...sort of a clipped, aristocratic accent...I'm thinking ball park Prince Philip territory here! In any case, this wasn't so marked to me in the movie proper, so it wasn't a negative for me.Especially early on, this movie has a sort of comic book feel to the proceedings...or perhaps \"Boy's own adventure\" is another way of saying this...perhaps a bit of a 1970s English movie feel to the movie as well...or swinging 1960s style. In other words, it seems pitched more as entertainment than gritty, realistic drama. Personally I found the racing in the movie lacked much detail, insight and intensity, but on occasion the racing presented was all those things...as when Niki Lauda weaves between F1 cars after coming back from the hospital.Where the movie does hold great interest and drama is in the factual information presented to the audience via on screen text...i.e. who won a certain race or what the season leaderboard looks like. It's this aspect which makes the movie engrossing when the actual driving scenes don't. You're made aware of where Hunt stands in relation to Lauda in their fight for the F1 crown.Also fascinating is the insight into the business of racing at this time in the sport's history. You see what Hunt and Lauda were doing before they made it into the big league of racing...their time in Formula 4 (I think it was \"4\").Watching the movie, it occurred to me that it quite easily have been all about Niki Lauda and his journey. I can't say that I could have associated the name \"James Hunt\" with the phrase \"champion F1 driver\" but the movie is very informative in making a case for that proposition and justifies its approach of making the theme of this movie the rivalry between these two disparate drivers.In creating an approach based on rivalry it also occurred to me that perhaps the movie fabricated the interactions between these two drivers. On screen, they appear to be in each other's pocket most of the time and I really couldn't believe it was like that in reality. However, at the end of the movie there was some archival footage of Hunt and Lauda chatting to each other at a racetrack, which makes me wonder if there is more truth in this movie than I thought.That being said, there were many times when my credulity did not come easily. For instance, did Hunt really give that reporter an answer like to that to what the reporter asked Lauda at a press conference? Did that actually happen? Did Lauda really watch that on TV when he was receiving treatment? They had televisions in those rooms? Really? Those scenes make for good drama and narrative motivation, but still, I was wondering where truth ended and fiction began. To a lesser extent, I found it hard that Lauda accept the premise of the barbs Hunt would throw at him pre-race at times...surely, if that happened, Lauda would just ignore such a prat, right? If all this stuff happened though, than it is a terrific representation of the duality of Hunt's relationship to Lauda.Overall, this movie is like a philosophical representation of two competing life philosophies...in the form of two extreme, polar opposite personalities. No doubt the middle ground between them would be the ideal in life...perhaps. It would be lovely to think that Hunt and Lauda did have their conversation at Lauda's jet inside the hangar as depicted in the movie. I also liked in that scene how Lauda puts into words something that I was thinking about Hunt's status. Whilst unsure of the actuality of the scene, I also liked how Hunt proffered some home truths to Lauda when the latter unsuccessfully tried to have a race cancelled due to rain.Perhaps it was in \"At the movies\" where director Ron Howard admitted having doubts as to whether Chris Hemsworth had the acting chops to pull off this performance. I found Chris performance engaging but he also has a couple of scenes where he gives good reaction shots to the dramas he faces...he really 'inhabits that moment' so to speak.\"Rush\" has a climactic race between Hunt and Lauda at the end of the movie. Initially I thought Lauda's action implied something, but on reflection I found it a cagey move perhaps worth the gamble, even if the movie posits an entirely different motive for his action.Just in passing, I'll note that Niki Lauda did get referenced in a song by The Music Men on the audience performance segment of the TV show \"Hey hey it's Saturday\". Seeing this movie, it does now seem cruel in retrospect.As mentioned in my opening paragraph, even though I am only slightly aware of F1 history and even less of James Hunt as a player in it, this movie does a sterling job of rectifying that situation.",

I was dubious about the epic battle coming to the silver screen and yet after watching it, concluded that I'd just seen the best motor racing film of all time.We have been in this territory before. Both Steve McQueen and Jack Lemmon have had a go and in recent years we've seen NASCAR as well. But none have come close in captivating the sense of romance, danger and sheer bravery of the two protagonists in question.So why does it work so well? For a start, watching Daniel Br\u00fchl as Nikki Lauda was like watching the great man himself. A dead ringer who portrays the great man impeccably and who is the very antithesis of Hunt, the flamboyant, heavy drinking womaniser and maverick. Hemsworth looks great - not a dead ringer for Hunt but good enough and his accent is perfect.Of course, anyone who knows their motor racing knows what happens in the end. But it is the journey that is taken, from Lord Hesketh privateering a young James Hunt in Formula Two where he first comes to race with his Austrian counterpart, to the 1976 F1 Season and the tragedy of that day at the Nurburgring.It would be easy to focus on the climax of the film with Hunt being the winner, after nearly losing the title with a double puncture. But it is Lauda who is quite rightly the hero. The crash, the horrendous rehabilitation, the shocking press conference, the fear at his return at Monza, and then retirement in the final race. To come back from those injuries in only 6 weeks and to come so close to another World Championship is testament to the bravery of the man who went on to become a racing legend.The film also pays a great tribute to Hunt, who whilst affectionately known as 'the Shunt', was far more than just the stereotypical playboy. By Lauda's own admission, Hunt was a highly skilled driver who was incredibly quick. He lived his life on the edge both professionally and privately. To lose the great man at the age of 45 from a heart attack was a tragedy in itself, especially as he had been sober for four years.Whether you like F1 or not is irrelevant. Rush is a brilliant true life story which is expertly crafted by Ron Howard. The race scenes are fantastically reproduced and the sound is epic. You are left under no illusion that these guys put their lives on the line every time they turned up at the track.Rush has been tipped for the Oscars and quite rightly so. You will not see a better acting performance than from Daniel Br\u00fchl and I hope that he receives the coveted golden statue as it will be well deserved.If you haven't seen the film give it a go. Its a fabulous story, has some truly comic moments at times (the broken down car scene is a belter!) but also drama, heartbreak and triumph. And it is the fastest two hours I've experienced at the movies for many years.",

Unfortunately, Ron Howard's 'Rush' takes a simplistic approach to representing both the character of the two men and also the intricacies of racing, sometimes combining idiocies in both departments simultaneously (in the first race we see, Hunt is beating Lauda to some championship - the cumulation of a season's racing - without apparently even knowing who he is). You won't learn much about motor racing from this film, nor what makes a good driver, nor even much about the two men's characters beyond a tabloid characterisation.

Bruhl's focused, steel-eyed stare and effortlessly executed diction is filled with a sly sense of irony and sets apart what could have been a routine impersonation of a cold, clipped Germanic workhorse. After all these years, Howard still can't figure out how to deliver action without having to explain it to you and, as such, relies heavily on screenwriter Peter Morgan's heavy-handed exposition to tell you what you need to know. Morgan accomplishes this by having sportscasters yell into microphones about how the action taking place is so exciting; the result is condescending. Other than Bruhl, there isn't much else to recommend, with a couple of Howard's collaborators worth noting, cinematographer Anthony Dod Mantle and composer Hans Zimmer, turning in lesser work than they are capable of. Being a racing movie, it's edited within an inch of its life by longtime Howard colleagues Dan Hanley and Mike Hill; but their work is at least clean enough that you can reasonably follow along. Which is all Howard requires from you.",

            "content": "I don't care for car racing and know nothing about Formula 1, but I thought this movie was OK. There were lots of race scenes and they were shot well. It gave the feeling of seeing these cars race at hundreds of miles per hour plus you got a feel of what it was like from the driver point of view.So the film is about a rivalry between 2 guys that first met at Formula 3 races. Then they move up to the big time, and are in a heated battle for the most points. Lauda is the more serious and trying to get points taken away for breaking rules. Hunt is the party boy whom is competitive and more lax. During the racing season, Lauda gets hurt and brings drama as this lets Hunt get back in the race for point leader. Lauda has already one the top spot before, so Hunt has real drive and risks his life to win.There is also a little about each drivers' wife and how their personal relationships functioned.FINAL VERDICT: The acting isn't too great, but the racing scenes are. Plus Chris Hemsworth is very good looking in this. So if you like fast cars, check it out.",

            "content": "Rush This is a film review and there not any plot spoilers.I went to see this film and had no idea what to expect. I knew Ron Howard could direct a great film, and I knew Chris Hemsworth is perfect for the role of the god of thunder, but beyond that I had done little to prepare for this film besides watch the TV spots; I did not even watch a full trailer. I was amazed and taken aback by how much I enjoyed this film, it is a film that grabs you quickly and keeps you tied to it the entire run time. To keep things spoiler free I will be very brief about the story, this film is just as much, if not more, about being a man as it is formula 1 racing. It follows two drivers as they try to figure out how to be successful men in the world, through wins, losses, women, marriage, drugs, anger, and gaining and losing control. This is what makes this film so engrossing, the film takes us deep into the lives of two drivers and focuses and explores so much more than just their racing. However, the racing in this film is some of the best I have seen depicted on camera. The cars are loud, very loud, and at times you think you can feel the heat off the engine, or the body bend under the pressure. The camera effortlessly switches from all angles during the race and it does it well to try and give you the full experience as if you were at the race. The real bright spot of this film is the acting. All give astounding performances. Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Bruhl present these men with full, nuanced, careful, and honest performances. It would have been very easy to let the style and tone of the film drift off the track with inflated and overacted performances but both men fire on all cylinders and hold tight lines the entire film. Olivia Wilde is smart and memorable with her screen time, and Christian McKay fills a very important role in the film and does so splendidly. There is something very tangible about Rush, it is based on a true story, but it goes deeper than that. This film is an adrenaline rush in and of itself, but it is also very humanizing. This film is definitely not for the fast and furious crowd, but that's another reason that it is so great, it has fast cars and yet a story that is emotional and worth exploring. Add up a great script, good directing, and stellar acting and you get a film that drives just as fast and true as the cars you see on the screen.

            "content": "Ron Howard has returned to the big screen with his latest film, Rush. Rush is an excellent film, one of his best. He surrounds himself with an excellent screenwriter and an excellent cast to come up with a product that is larger than life. I totally despise auto racing, so I thought the film would be a major turnoff. The only reason I saw the film is Ron Howard and the phenomenal reviews. The film goes deeper than just the racing aspect of the sport, as it focuses on rivalry of the two biggest stars. The characterization is layered and for that reason alone is what gives this movie a heads up over the formulaic sports movies.Howard's latest film tells the story of the most intense rivalry of any European sports figures in the 1970's: Formula Racing Stars James Hunt and Niki Lauda. Each man have polarizing personalities which fit into their rivalry. Hunt is a self-centered social party-goer who relies upon his relations with everyone and Lauda is a serious, hidden man who achieves his victory in a more intellectual manner.The acting is very, very good. Chris Hemsworth sheds his Thor persona and delivers his best performance to date. That being said, there is someone who does even better and that is Daniel Bruhl. First recognized in 2009's Inglorious Basterds, this role may have achieved Bruhl stardom. Olivia Wilde is a good actress, but if there is any complaints at all, she is underused and only seems to act as eye candy.Overall, Rush is an excellent movie as it rushes past formula to deliver something entertaining and original. It is hard to put out an original sports film these days, and Rush does just that. The film brought the intense rivalry to my eyes and I am keen on learning more. The film has excellent direction, acting, and writing but I also must praise the technical side of the movie. The visuals and sound effects are strong and Hans Zimmer creates another magnificent score. This is Howard's best film in years. I rate this film 9.5/10.",

Set in the 70s amongst the glamorous world of grand prix, Rush is so much more than a movie about car racing. It tells the story of the rivalry between Niki Luader(Daniel Bruhl) a disciplined and anti-social trust fund baby turned race car driver and James Hunt (Chrris Hemsworth) a charismatic and part- loving playboy. Their relationship is compelling viewer as they push each other forward to achieve their individual dreams at great personal sacrifice. Both Hemwsworth and Bruhl are outstanding in their individual roles. The footage and camera-work are compelling and the depiction of the 70s era will make you feel like you belong there. This is a movie that both men and women will enjoy (albeit for a very different reasons) and, despite the fact that I detest car racing, it will go down as one of my most favourite films of all time.",

The names sounded familiar but I just thought they picked a similar name to real drivers like they usually do in racing movies. In a way, I think the director Ron Howard targeted the movie for viewers like myself as the movie didn't have the typical \"Based on a true story\" title at the beginning. Only the real pictures at the end was what caused me to think 'could this be true story?' and look it up to my surprise once again that such dramatic story is in fact true.Again, as I was not aware this was true story, mid way through the movie, I thought, 'wow, this is very well written drama'. This was completely opposite of modern day Formula 1 races and certainly unlike any Hollywood movies these days. Ending was completely unpredictable.Attention to detail was amazing. All the criticisms about shameful racing movies like Days of Thunder and Driven were well addressed. Crashes were so well reproduced that I thought the crashes in the movie were from actual footage.But then again, core of any movie should be about story telling. And there's no one better to tell such drama than Ron Howard. I don't give out perfect score often and this is only my second movie to be rated 10 stars on IMDb.com",

            "content": "Based on the rivalry between James Hunt and Niki Lauda, Rush is a magnificent movie that will grip the audience even if they have no interest in racing.Nicki Lauda, played by Daniel Bruhl, gave up the chance to manage his family's business back in Austria in order to become a racer. In a Formula Three race in 1970, he meets the flamboyant Brit James Hunt, who is played by Chris Hemsworth. The two develop a rivalry and eventually cross paths in the Formula One. The movie takes place during the 1976 Formula One season, where Lauda and Hunt try to not only win the World Championship, but prove who the better racer is. Along the way, we see that both men are polar opposites of each other. Lauda is a more calculating, vigilant racer who only races because it's the thing he does best. Racing is almost like solving an equation for him. For Hunt however, racing is his passion. He wants to \"stare death in the face, and to cheat it\".One thing I loved about Rush was that it didn't have a good guy for us to cheer, and a bad guy for us to boo. Both of these men have flaws but in the end, they're human and it really felt like it in the movie. You'll find yourself cheering for Hunt at times and for Lauda at other times.Before the movie was released I saw pictures of the cast and their real life counterparts. I thought that the casting was perfect. They looked almost identical. But I didn't know that the acting would be so good. This movie wouldn't have been nearly as good if the acting was sub-par. We needed to believe that we were seeing James Hunt and Niki Lauda, and that's what we got. If the movie wasn't released in such a stacked year, I think both of them would've got an Oscar nomination.But you need more than good actors and a good premise to make a good movie, you also need a good director who is capable of bringing everything together, and this movie has just that. On his day, Ron Howard is one of the best directors working right now, and he shows why with Rush. The movie looks beautiful. The racing scenes where masterfully captured and along with the great work of Hans Zimmer, you felt like you were right in the middle of the action.All in all, Rush is an outstanding movie. Anyone who appreciates wonderful cinematography and acting, or even just wants to see a good sports movie, should check this one out.",

It was all about the vicarious thrills of speeding of the cars, crashes, shunts and the chequered flag. We saw the drivers spraying large bottles of champagne around, but we did not get to care what they were really like or much about the technique of racing. So the full enormity of Nicki Lauda's quick recovery from his burns to getting back into the driver's seat did not get properly examined at the time. Ron Howard's film redresses this by revealing the brilliant mind of Lauda, his crises, his struggles and his professionalism. It also, of course, shows the swashbuckling bravado of James Hunt and the glamour he brought to F1. The only criticism I would make was the film's budget could have been used to better bring alive some of the exotic locations, such as the final 1976 race off next to Mount Fuji, which heavily relies on computer graphics.",

Acting is just top notch by lead characters.From human psyche to emotions to passion everything is just in right amount ,never exaggerated. To create a story of real life events and famous people require a talent,never even heard about this two formula biggies ever but characterizations and story is so compelling that for me now Nikki Lauda and James Hunt are more dominating better Michael Schumacher and Fernando Alanso the F1 drivers who i have seen driving and know about.Power of movie is that it seems literally like a biopic as happens with food everything is refined and balanced to create a perfect taste.Racing sequences of 70's are portrayed authentically.Acting almost flawless: Both drivers in reality were pole opposite;Nikki lauda as more serious and unsociable taken to a awesome performance by Daniel Bruhl and reckless James Hunt played By Chris Hemsworth to a new degree of For me one of the best movie of the year till now,many will not agree with me,but its based on real people and as per that frame ,Director had created masterpiece.

            "content": "Formula 1 racing is the World's top motor sport, its the pinnacle of all motor racing, its also the most dangerous. Ron Howard's new film Rush, scores on many levels and fails in a few. First problem is the marketing for the film. They give Chris Hemsworth's character all of the spot light on the billboards and posters, when Daniel Bruhl should be the one. There are a few advertisements with Bruhl on them, but he needs to be front and center, because he is the leading actor in this film and outshines the whole cast. Hemsworth is just a more marketable face. Nikki Lauda (Daniel Bruhl) and James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) are two of the top Formula Three racers in the 1970s. The film Rush spans over six years and chronicles their rise to Formula 1 drivers and their infamous rivalry that fueled them.Chris Hemsworth is no doubt a talented actor. I wanted to hate on him just cause he is who he is, but I can't. Hemsworth's acting is most certainly something to admire, his egotistical confidence and cockiness is pitch perfect. He truly impressed me with every scene. Daniel Bruhl nails it with his performance. The directness and care that Bruhl takes in every hand and face movement is absolutely precise and a pleasure to watch. Bruhl is miraculous, so spectacular that he needs a nomination, I loved his character work.Ron Howard does a fine job at keeping the film vibrant and energetic while adding extremely dull environments, that make the beautiful bright colored textures pop out. Howard stylizes the race sequences expertly, he never really takes you out of the crash, a lot of tight close- ups on the drivers and car parts. Its also an excellent screenplay by Peter Morgan, I just felt there should have been something more to it. Rush is a very straightforward film, that doesn't push the boundaries, it definitely stays within the lines.Rush came close to being a fantastic film, don't get me wrong, I still throughly enjoyed the film and highly recommend it to anyone. There were just a few more (unknown) things I wanted out of it. I must see it again. I give Rush an 8 out of 10.",

The relationship between both drivers is one of the main focus points of the movie, and was the main reason i love this film, because even though they both race against each for the F1 title and frequently call each other a***h****, the clearly have a profound amount of respect for each other and you could go as far as saying they were friends.The actual racing shots were at times beautiful and had my adrenaline pumping and on the edge of my seat in the cinema. another thing i loved about this film was the way that, as well as being about races, the film was paced like a race, a fact I didn't realize until i came out of the cinema and thought about it. Hunt and Lauda both in the lead at different points. Lauda when he beats Hunt in the first half of the F1 season, Hunt when Lauda crashes and melts half of his face off, a scene which had me wincing in my seat, as well as a particular scene wear Lauda tries to get his helmet back on having only half healed, his ear still incomplete. the last point I will make is the fact that you don't have to be a F1 fan or have any previous knowledge of Hunt or Lauda's historic feuding to be amazed by this film, as well as learning a tremendous amount!

I give you, that my two and only reasons to go and see this movie were the leads - Chris (think Thor)and Daniel (ah, Good Bye Lenin and 7 dias en La Habana, and boy I'm happy I did. I must say that my interest in F1 was quite superficial, and only in the 1990s I was somewhat caught by the sport when the statistically (and statistically he IS) the best driver of F1 ruled the track,and I've never really troubled myself with F1 history and all those discussions of who's the best and all, thus the story behind 1976's F1 championship was totally new to me. Getting back more closely to the movie, I'd say just this - in my opinion Rush is the best 2013 movie I've seen, Chris and Daniel did wonderful jobs, and if this movie won't get any nominations (think Oscars) I'll be very very surprised.

Howard clearly has a passion for sports competition and wants to make a film comparable to the best sports films. In that, he succeeds. Beyond that, it's little more than typical sports propaganda, complete with product placement as if the film itself sold out ad space.It's clearly designed to promote racing and persuade some to become fans and racers, trying to make it seem like a sexy outlet for rule breakers and full of something other than physically talented morons sniffing too many fuel fumes. The screenwriter and Howard do that by giving the characters more depth and faults than usual.Amongst other failures, the Formula 1 scoring system is never explained, so it feels as if there's some sort of back-room manipulation going on like in \"pro\" wrestling. That and the leader board mishaps might make for a more interesting story.Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby is still the racing, and maybe all sports, film of choice.",

Everything has been scripted and played to the point of perfection. Bruhl's accent deserves special appreciation.With a script that rolls both on and off the track exploring the love life which is affected by the rivalry on the race, this is definitely a front-runner for the Oscars next year.A must watch for all petrol Heads.",

He captured, what appeared to me as a conflicted driver who was like a horse chomping at the bit, ready to fly forward at tremendous speeds. In films such as Thor he is restricted, Thor doesn't really express much emotion, much personality (love Thor 1&2 btw, not criticising the film or Thor as a character). But as James Hunt he came into his own, a masterpiece of acting. In regards to Bruhl, phenomenal too. Brilliantly captured Lauda's reserved personality, the way he's strict with himself and his limits, but hold his passion for the race and the car. Together they managed to make the bond between the two racers exciting and you felt like you were there with them, feeling their emotions towards one another. Especially when Lauda came back from hospital. One thing I think they could have done with this film is added a bit more original footage, especially in the racing scenes. Would have been fantastic to have seen some of it integrated with the crisp film work. I did like the ending, seeing the original film, but more would have been very welcome.Last point, WHY THE HELL HAS THIS NOT BEEN NOMINATED FOR AN Oscar, MORE GOLDEN GLOBES AND MORE AWARDS?! This is a damn fantastic film which I feel has been very underrated in its coverage. Plan to see this? Then what are you waiting for, it's bloody amazing.",

            "content": "I had zeroed in on Rush as one of the movies that I was going to watch on the big screen (the Ron Howard & F1 union factor), here in Dubai and was waiting for it eagerly. And boy it was the worth the wait. Rush is not your run-of-the-mill movie in the sporting drama bandwagon which caters only to F1 enthusiasts.F1 fan or not, the way Howard has showcased the legendary rivalry between F1 greats, Niki Lauda and James Hunt makes for compelling and intense viewing. The banter and the doses of humour interspersed throughout the flick form the crux of the \"foe-mance\" between Hunt and Lauda (played exquisitely by Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Bruhl respectively) & are the high points of film. Howard is spot on with his depiction of the events surrounding this fabled rivalry. His portrayal of the 2 legends, with contrasting personalities who are poles apart and yet are driven by equal love for the sport and ambition makes the flick, an interesting and exhilarating ride. The movie is crisply edited and moves along at just the right pace for a biopic.Apart from all this, in my opinion, ultimately what clinches it for Rush and catapults it into the \"bench mark\" shelf of movies; making it one of the great sporting drama movies of all time, are the parts just before the climax and the climax itself. The miraculous & awe-inspiring recovery of Lauda(after the life threatening crash in Nuremberg) culminating into the final race of the dramatic 1976 season in rain soaked Japan(with the stunning Mount Fuji in the backdrop) has been shot and executed \"jaw-droppingly\" well. It's a spectacle to say the least. Expect cinematographer, Anthony Dod Mantle to win a few accolades for his staggering work, as Howard's team on the whole excels in executing & pulling off breath-taking F1 set-pieces to perfection.In Rush, we have a film which Ron Howard & his team have managed to steer just about correctly at every corner/chicane of movie making. The flick has almost everything, right from the movie score to the acting, working for it, like a well drilled F1 car. In the end what it all boils down to; the essence of Rush, the movie, lies in its two protagonists. It's thrilling, funny and unpredictable just like Hunt and meticulously filmed, is blunt but with touch of emotional and inspirational edge to it just like Lauda.Formula 1 buff or not Rush to the nearest movie theatre to catch this un-missable adrenaline edge of the seat ride.",

As I toddler I have seen him on TV and described all F1 cars as \"Niki Lauda\".With the director, the cast and the trailer I had huge expectations and I wasn't disappointed. The script is great, the director does a fine job to get you to the edge of the seat as you watch the racing scenes as well as the strong dialogs.Hunt and Lauda are the most interesting characters since a long, long time. It's refreshing to have heroes not based on a comic! Hemsworth and Br\u00fchl do a superb job, Br\u00fchl even manages to talk in the viennese dialect of Lauda, which is really really hard(trust me, I am from Vienna and I couldn't do it).The story is a kind of modern Shakespeare drama, with two actors giving us their best performances as actors so far. This movie should get a bunch of Oscars (Director, Music, Sound Effects, Hemsworth, Br\u00fchl, Script).Do not miss it on the big screen!",

You care about these characters through their all dilemmas and triumphs. I am exhausted after seeing it. And I have seen it 7 times. Go to U-Tube and look over videos which are 1 hour long regarding the rivalry between Niki Lauda and James Hunt.

How it is that anyone could criticize it in any technical or dramatic fashion is beyond me. Every scene is finely crafted.

            "content": "Rush is Ron Howard's best up to date, a visceral thrill ride. It is an exceedingly well crafted sports drama movie, that focuses on the rivalry between two distinctly different men in the gladiatorial world that was Formula 1 racing in the 70s.\"25 drivers start every season in Formula One, and each year, two of us die. What kind of person does a job like this? Not normal men, for sure. Rebels, lunatics, dreamers... people who are desperate to make a mark and are prepared to die trying\"- Niki LaudaIt is 1976, Bernie Ecclestone is yet to take center stage, race car drivers are superstars with low life expectancy and all that is worth looking forward to in Formula 1 racing is the competition between James Hunt and Niki Lauda. Both of them supremely, almost inhuman racing talents, with arrogance to spare. Yet they could not be more different- Hunt's brash style versus Lauda's cool discipline. Hunt's live life to the max philosophy, versus Lauda's switchblade efficiency.James Hunt: The closer you are to death, the more alive you feel. It's a wonderful way to live. It's the only way to drive.Niki Lauda: A wise man can learn more from his enemies than a fool from his friends.Shot in documentary style, Rush does not seek to establish deep human connect, but instead etches out the story of two diverse personalities competing for the same prize. Whose side are you on? Never mind that because even if you do not understand the difference between motor sports and basketball, or even if you are not a petrol head, you will still be enthralled. Rush is a blur of exquisitely choreographed races, a palette of gorgeous cars and women, a fight for racing immortality between two crazies. Ron Howard has been churning out tripe lately (The DaVinci Code, Angels & Demons). Here is back in form in adrenalin pumping style. The pace is snappy, the editing brisk, the soundtrack is racy, and the dialogs memorable. But the most crucial aspect of a gripping conflict was getting the casting spot on. People would believe this is Chris Hemsworth's breakout role, irrespective of recent past involving Norse gods, hammers and other superheroes. While he is great as the bodacious Hunt, it is actually Daniel Bruhl's Niki Lauda who steals the show, creating sympathy for a self absorbed, myopic, rude and an essentially unlikeable person.Who was the better racer- Hunt or Lauda? Does not matter. What matters is Rush is an un-missable movie, and hence is, quote WWE's Road Warriors- \"what aaaaa rush\"- 10/10",

            "content": "Biographical sports drama Rush tracks the strictly competitive rivalry between Formula One racers James Hunt and Niki Lauda during the 1970s.Even before you've arrived at the starting line, there may be understandable scepticism on whether Rush is really a race you wish to run with. However, like Moneyball (2011) before it, I was pleasantly surprised at how investing a story about a sport I know nothing about and care nothing for could be. Cars are useless without people to drive them. Rush is a vehicle painted with a core theme of the professional and personal consequences of fierce rivalry, between it two primary passengers. Formula One racing is just the fuel to push the vehicle to its eventual destination.It is a story worth telling, both for those who were spectating during the 1970s, and for those like myself who are still taking driving lessons and didn't know the names Niki Lauda or James Hunt until this film existed. Behind Ron Howard's careful direction and sensitivity to the story, Rush invites its audience to witness the depth of competitiveness that Lauda and Hunt travelled through. Its expertly crafted pace, detail and tone complement the (f)actual events also, with Niki Lauda even expressing his positive reaction to the film's look and accuracy.Despite a 123 minute run, your legs feel motionless. Rush is a timeless tale in two senses: 1. Its great display of the triumphs and pitfalls that competitiveness can have are accessible and applicable throughout history, throughout the modern world, and probably will be throughout the future 2. The film is so engrossing that not once did I question how much time had passed nor how close we were to the end. Rush has enough continuous momentum to take us to the end of the journey without exhausting emissions, as we cruise through seamlessly to the finish lineWith its fantastic editing and storytelling techniques to push the story along without making it feel, dare I say...Rushed, Rush masterfully places its two protagonists in lanes so far apart that only their egos are able to fill the empty space. Like Batman and The Joker, Hunt and Lauda are represented as polar opposites whom were almost destined to become competitors, as it is only their mutual rivalry that fuels their motivation to win. Without one competing with such passion, the other wouldn't have the passion to compete at all.The story is only complemented further by the enthralling performances of Daniel Br\u00fchl (Lauda) and Chris Hemsworth (Hunt), in addition to Olivia Wilde's brief yet brilliant supporting role. Rush's arrival at the finish line is as smooth as the ride that Ron Howard takes us along throughout. Thrilling, investing, interesting and well-made flawlessness, is about all one could request of a biopic that centres around such sensitive source-material. Rush is exciting, frightening but most of all the right thing to catch up to in theatres as its release seems to be on its final laps around UK tracks, so rush to see it. Oh dear I wrote it again.",

            "content": "Capturing the true spirit of Formula 1 on film is challenging. The sport does not lend itself easily to the medium of cinema- it is a popular genre but it's still seen as a niche market in some ways. Yet behind the corporations and money men there is a deeply human side to the sport that Rush captures perfectly.Racing drivers are human beings, subject to the same forces as the rest of us, and back in the 1970s, the sport was far more dangerous than it is today. To become an F1 driver was to know that two out of twenty-five drivers would die each year- with the risk of serious injury never far away. To take such risks on a regular basis meant you had to be a certain type of character to jump into the car.What Rush does is tap into that human side of racing. Chris Hemsworth takes on the role of playboy James Hunt, who drinks, smokes and sleeps (with several women) through F1, and who is fully prepared to put his life on the line is pursuit of glory. Chris, formerly of superhero Thor fame, is great as the arrogant yet likable Hunt, capturing his fragile side too- beneath the partying and exuberance is a man who needs the thrill of dangerous racing to feel alive.Daniel Bruhl is Niki Lauda, a no-nonsense, ultra-serious guy who takes a keen interest in the cars he drives, seeking to maximise their potential whilst minimising the risk. Whilst for Hunt it's all about the thrill, for Lauda it's about business and professionalism. Yet both desire victory and championships. They are polar opposites and push each other hard- Bruhl captures Lauda's attitude and strict approach really well, sounding just like him, acting just like him.The film pulls no punches with driver accidents and Lauda's own serious accident either. It gives us a glimpse into what Lauda went through and into his recovery and bravery as well.In short, both actors give a good account of themselves as two of Formula 1's most amazing figures- and Ron Howard has done a fantastic job of recreating the cars and scenery of the era. The cars are faithfully reproduced and look incredible. The blend of real machinery and CGI is done so well that you almost can't tell the two apart. The film is great, whether you love Formula 1 or not.",

            "content": "Firstly, I'll just say I'm not a huge F1 guy. I very rarely watch it and when I do it's solely because there is nothing better on. I had only heard of Niki Lauda in passing without paying that much attention to it but this film really blew me away.The film centres around the two rivals Niki Lauda and James Hunt through the 1970s as they both became famous and known for their intense rivalry for the world championship. This is not usually my type of film, I like suspense thrillers usually involving crime or mystery of some kind. However, the story in this is done so well and you can't help but become engrossed in the lives of the characters. I like the fact that no one is really painted as a bad guy in this film but I couldn't help siding with Lauda throughout most of the film, whereas a friend who saw it with me came down firmly on Hunt's side. I think praise must be given to the developers for this as they ensure that the viewer is always able to empathise with one of the two lead characters be it the fun loving playboy James Hunt or the calculating professional Niki Lauda. This ensures interest is sustained throughout.The other characters are pretty much left on the sidelines but I never really noticed as the film is solely about the lives of Lauda and Hunt and how they influence each other. I do think the film ended rather abruptly but it certainly prompted me to research around the film a little and any film that can make me want to know more after it has finished must be good in my book.The directing from Ron Howard was fast and exciting it really helped to create a tense atmosphere during the race scenes but unfortunately made some of the slower scenes feel a little rushed.Overall, it's hard for me to point out from a cold critical perspective what it is about the film which makes it so good, especially seeing as I have no real interest in the subject matter. However, Rush was a really good film and I enjoyed it from start to finish. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good rivalry with fantastic characters which drive the story. You don't have to be a fan of racing as the race scenes only really seek to build up the tension and tend not to get technical. So sit back and enjoy the Rush you'll get from watching this film.",

It's now been three days since i've seen the film and I must say, it resonated with me unlike any movie i've seen recently. With a masterful script, fantastic acting, a very captivating score by Hans Zimmer, and great direction by Ron Howard(who is apparently a big F1 fan. Who knew?), \"Rush\" delivers in every facet a good movie should. \"Rush\", based on real events, takes place during the 1970's, centering around two up and coming Formula racers by the names of Niki Lauda and James Hunt. Lauda and Hunt serve as the protagonists of the film(or protagonist/antagonist, depending on how you wish to look at it), with the story revolving around their lives starting in the lowly F3 racing circuit all the way to their legendary 1976 F1 season showdown and beyond. What makes this story so compelling is the relationships and forces that occur between Lauda and Hunt. Both are vehement enemies on the track, but it's quite obvious that they hold a mutual respect for one another. The competition that unfolds between the two rivals over the course of the film is part of what makes \"Rush\" shine; both racer's desire to win is fueled by the success of the other. I came into this movie knowing almost nothing about F1 racing, yet I found myself completely enthralled in the details of the sport, and what made both Lauda and Hunt incredibly successful during their careers. Ron Howard truly did a fantastic job keeping me captivated despite my ignorance of the sport coming into the film. While the script and direction of this film is indeed very good, the acting is even better. Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Br\u00fchl are simply stunning as James Hunt and Niki Lauda, and are a big part of why this film succeeds. Both actors nail their respective characters, delivering truly life-like recreations of who these people were. After watching the movie, I looked up several videos and interviews with both Lauda and Hunt and was completely awestruck at how accurate they were portrayed. Daniel Br\u00fchl was especially convincing as Niki Lauda. You must also give a great deal of credit to the casting crew and makeup crew for picking and crafting such perfect actors for the job. At the end of the film you will see a few clips of Lauda and Hunt from the 70's, and the resemblance between them and the actors who played them is pretty astounding. The supporting cast is also good to very good, with some very well known names such as Olivia Wilde and Natalie Dormer. Overall, the acting in this film is simply top notch. With a witty script supported by some truly inspirational acting and directing, \"Rush\" delivers an intense, realistic experience of the 1970's F1 racing world. While the actual race scenes only account for a portion of the film, they are immensely exciting and only add to the overall experience of this character driven movie. You don't have to be an F1 fan to enjoy \"Rush\", and you may even find yourself interested in the sport after watching it. Whatever your interests might be for seeing this movie, don't let the subject material sway your decision. If you do, you may just miss out on one of the best movie's made this decade. For a truly encapsulating and resonating experience, I give \"Rush\" a rare 9/10.",

The plot is pretty straight forward and inspired by the true events portrayed authentically.The story moves at decent pace and i also kind of liked the way the season is depicted race by race in a tight gritty manner. Technically the film is good, visually authentic, with decent film editing and good cinematography.However, what seriously limits the film is mediocre dialog, and the lack of an emotional connect to the characters. The women and pretty much the entire cast have precious little to do both in terms of dialog or impact.Chris and Daniel are good in their roles but at some level fail to make us deeply care about them. They do of course have their moments but they are few and far between.If you are an avid F1 fan like me, you d be aware of how, much up to the 70's (hell even 90's till senna's death)F1 was a very dangerous sport with few security regulations, high risk tracks and an indifferent FIA. The film touches on these themes, but alas, fails to draw the kind of emotions/empathy for the drivers.So, all in all a good film which could have been so much more :)",

            "content": "\"Rush\" (15) Director: Ron Howard Starring: Chris Hemsworth, Daniel Br\u00fchl, Olivia Wilde, Natalie Dormer and Alexandra Maria Lara. Running time: 123 minutes. Rated: 15, for containing strong language, sex and bloody injury detail. Out now in UK cinemas.Set during the 1976 Formula One season, \"Rush\" explores the rivalry between James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) and Niki Lauda (Daniel Br\u00fchl) and the respect that they had for one another. Back in 2010, the Formula One film was re-born with \"Senna\", an interesting documentary which looked into the final years of Ayrton Senna's life. Received extraordinarily well by both fans and critics alike, \"Senna\" was considered to be the (by some people) best film about Formula One in cinema history. Three years later, Ron Howard (\"The Da Vinci Code\") decided to direct a film which would appeal to fans of Formula One and the general film fan. It is definite that he has succeeded. The film begins by telling the viewer the interesting stories behind each character. Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) always acting the playboy routine and Lauda (Br\u00fchl) being a straight laced man who goes to bed early and performs well. Entirely different people.The biopic genre of film is not unfamiliar territory for Ron Howard; as he has directed the powerful political drama \"Frost/Nixon\" which was a return to his biopic films.Both actors play their roles extremely well. Chris Hemsworth performs to a degree which we have never seen him before, adapting the playboy persona like a duck to water. However, it is Daniel Br\u00fchl who steals the show as Niki Lauda. Olivia Wilde delivers a solid performance as Hunt's wife, Suzy Miller, despite her clearly underwritten part. Alexandra Maria Lara portrays Lauda's wife in a larger role than Wilde's which gives her character time to flourish. The racing sequences are shot brilliantly. Cameras are placed everywhere on the cars, from gear sticks to the hood; Howard invites the viewer to really take a look into the world of Formula One from a completely different angle.As the film continues, we are swept along a dark road in which James Hunt takes, whereas Niki Lauda does not; and explores problems with the pair's relationships.The only problem that I had with \"Rush\" was that it never explored the undeniable respect which Hunt and Lauda had for each other. In footage of past races, Hunt and Lauda were always close and rarely shared bad words, but here they act like bombs just waiting to explode.VerdictDespite a minor blip, \"Rush\" performs just the way it should. Delivering great acting, fabulous set pieces and exhilarating racing, \"Rush\" runs ever so smoothly.9 stars out of 10.",

It depicts a time when every race could possibly be the last one for many pilots and how differently the men tried to cope with this fact.I'm really impressed by this movie because it lives up to its good critics. The focus here is not so much the sports even though it plays a huge role of course but rather the portrayal of two very different men and their complicated relationship with life and each other. The acting is done greatly and even though it looks like your typical blockbuster in many ways, it's always a bit more than that. Even though I only have basic knowledge of the formula one, I was pleased to see a racing-based film that shows more than just the typical story of an outsider making it to the top.All in all this is a great example of how sensitive and empathic filmmaking can form a strong story and make audiences question own decisions without becoming boring or pretentious. A definite recommendation.",

I saw it back then and loved it, saw it again recently and still love it. It really does capture James Hunt and Nikki Lauda uncannily. It was the (pre-AIDS) 70's when girls, alcohol and a little danger was what every young man aspired to, and Hunt provided the example for all. Lauda was of a different order, the taciturn Austrian who was the exact opposite of Hunt.You could not imagine someone like Hunt getting a drive in a modern day Formula 1 team. \"My name's Hunt, rhymes with **** \" nearly had me off the chair laughing. Today's drivers are more like car managers and driving is more like going to the office. Hunt, for all his charisma, was the last of a breed. Lauda said that to win a world championship you need to be methodical and consistent. Hunt put a lie to that. But today's world is Lauda's and there is no room for a Hunt.You know, I'd rather live in a world full of Hunts than Laudas.",

A stunning performance that deserves a standing applause, Br\u00fchl's portrayal of the eccentric sociopath, Niki Lauda is just outstanding.

            "content": "Turbo is a movie I really detest more then ever, because of what it did to Indy car racing. Nothing intense was blown over into the racing sport, but I think that my making a snail the better racer, this will actually prevent any interest in children to look into the actual human racers. I've said before that even though I don't follow much racing (I find NASCAR a total bore), but the Indy car circuit is something that holds a lot of nostalgic memories. I've attended the Long Beach Grand Prix almost every year ever since I was five, and I already have my ticket for next year.I can understand why a lot of other people don't find the same passion that I do. It can be just as boring as NASCAR and being that it's under stricter rules then Hogwarts, then where's the sense of rebellion? I tell those folks the followingDriving an Indy Car is more dangerous then NASCARThe track is more difficult to navigate and requires more focusI find the high-tech design of the vehicles fascinatingThe races are not as longWatching the dialogue of the sponsor leaders is like watching senators fight each otherThere's more pressure on the driver to impress with their racing and their instinct.This all happens to also be the rules of the Formula One circuit in Europe in the historical drama, Rush.James Hunt (played by Chris Hemsworth) and Nick Lauda (played by Daniel Br\u00fchl) in 1970 are both skilled drivers that build a rivalry at the start of their careers in a Formula Three Race in England. Hunt is a very brash, philandering playboy, while Lauda is more focused, determined racer who uses his own technical genus to develop a better car.Lauda goes as far to get a large loan from the bank so that he can buy his way into the Formula One circuit. He later becomes discovered by Ferrari and joins them, where he wins his first championship in 1975. Hunt spends time on and off his team when they fail to secure a sponsor, but manages to get a spot on the McLaren team when another quits. Each driver manages to rack up points from each race, furthering their revelry through the 1976 season. During the German Grand Prix, Lauda meets a terrible demise as he ends up in a critical crash that leaves his face heavily scarred with burns and terrible pain. He decides to race two months later, not wanting Hunt to win the points as easily. Both guys may have more respect then hatred when the final race in Japan proves to be more treacherous then ever.I came in knowing I was going to watch a good movie. I didn't think that this would be great. Director Ron Howard must be a fan of Formula One car racing, as Rush just looks gorgeous. This is a beautiful looking movie, as it's doing a mix of a seventies television style tint along with a stylish tone.Both Hemsworth and Br\u00fchl both work out great as these two rival drivers. What I like about the story is that even though that the racing audience loves them, they are both two different kinds of jerks. Hunt may have more of a likable appeal to the cameras with his quick skills, Lauda is the better racer, knowing his own car better then his mechanics. The pacing here manages to flow just as well as one of the Formula One machines, knowing when to be loud and when to slow down and allow it's story to be told.I'll give this ten Formula One helmets out of ten. This could be the best movie about auto racing around (I don't care for Days of Thunder). Rush is thrilling, tragic, and respectable; just like the two racers of the movie.",

And with that in mind I feel that with this movie Ron Howard has done a great job portraying as much of the real-life events as possible while keeping within the confines of Hollywood movie-making (and the inevitable box-office considerations).Both Hemsworth, and especially Br\u00fchl, turn in fine performances as Hunt and Lauda respectively, and I feel both men truly captured the essence of the two drivers as well as the rivalry and respect they both held. That said I'm not exactly sure why Hemsworth is the only one shown on the promotional posters as Br\u00fchl is arguably the more important (and certainly better acted) character of the two. Requirements of pretty-boy marketing I guess.The effects in this movie are all first rate and truly add to the spectacle without overpowering it. The fateful and horrendous Lauda crash at the N\u00fcrburgring is particularly well executed.One thing worth noting is that you don't need to be steeped in motorsport knowledge to enjoy this film as the emphasis is definitely on character and relationships, rather than fast cars. As I said at the top, my girlfriend who is no motorsport fanatic by any stretch of the imagination, loved this film as much as I did.Overall a really great film about an intense and interesting friendship/rivalry during one of the great eras of motorsport.",

            "content": "I flip flopped quite a lot on this film. When I first saw the trailer, I thought it looked like another cookie cutter Hollywood film, particularly because of Chris Hemsworth. Then I read up on the backstory about the great rivalry between Lauda and Hunt, which actually created some anticipation. I went into the theater expecting it to be a modern classic after reading the reviews, but within the first ten minutes I was aware of its flaws.A slightly insipid music score by go-to-guy Hans Zimmer, a seemingly unnecessary voice over that holds the viewer's hand throughout the opening, and a rather rushed beginning. The computer effects for the recreated stadiums and the car races were below par as well. I didn't even get a good 1970s vibe from the atmosphere of the piece. The period seemed glossed over with some by the numbers pop songs to demonstrate different ups and downs in the character's lives. James Hunt is struggling with his celebrity status, so let's play \"Fame\" by David Bowie, seems like a good match! The whole experience appeared to be very vanilla, as is usual with Ron Howard. But I hung in there, and by the second half of the film, it had improved dramatically. Daniel Bruhl's performance as Nikki Lauda was extraordinary. He captured perfectly the raw determination, the slightly misanthropic nature of the Austrian rival. He was a bastard, but relatable, and his emergence as the protagonist made me concentrate more on their relationship, which was really the crux on the film, than my petty remarks about the cinematography or score. Besides, the sound design was top notch. While I absolutely detest montages that were used to artificially speed up time after each competition, the races did improve so that by the end, the tension had reached exponential levels. The tragedy suffered by the characters gave insight into the nature of sport and what makes the daring feats and psyche of these men so alluring.The performances of Chris Hemsworth and Bruhl, and their likeness to the respective people, were extraordinary. The exploration of their personal lives added verisimilitude to the story as well.Rush is a good film, and while it isn't the best in the past 10 years like some are saying, nor is it Ron Howard's most accomplished work (that honour still belongs to 'Apollo 13' or even 'The Missing') it's certainly one of the better releases this year and a sure fire Oscar contender.",

The film captures the atmosphere of the 1970s and things like the weather conditions on the track, really well, without resorting to gimmicks or 3D effects. It's a revelation to see how dangerous conditions on the track actually are if you are not that interested in car racing. It will also appeal to women (I'm one) as well as men, since the action on the race track and 'car speak' are not too dominant.The performances by the two male leads are sterling, and it is a nice touch to see the real Hunt and Lauda towards the end of the film. Chris Hemsworth shows that he has a broader range than just fantasy films, and Daniel Br\u00fchl is excellent as Lauda. The acting by the supporting cast is otherwise good throughout, but \u2013 rightly in my view \u2013 the film focuses on the two key personalities of Hunt and Lauda.",

The film moves at a perfect pace, providing us with insights into both characters while never painting either of them as a villain or hero in the audience's eyes. The film's major success comes through in the development of it's two core characters, and the contrast Howard places between them as competitors. The action sequences are incredibly tense and exciting, and yet they never take precedence over the film's central mission of developing the rivalry between these two great men. The driving sequences involve the audience to the point where we develop an understanding for the kind of utter danger these men put themselves in to live out their dreams, as Hunt says in the film of his car, \"It's really just a coffin on wheels.\"Strong performances from Hemsworth and Bruhl also help drive this thrilling piece of cinema along. Hemsworth certainly impressed me with his brash and overt Hunt, but Daniel Bruhl stole the show for me; his performance conveys the completely mathematical and emotionless nature of Niki Lauda to near perfection. Strong supporting performances from Olivia Wilde and Alexandra Maria Lara as the men's respective lovers also add to the film's momentum.Overall Rush is a thrill ride from start to finish, never getting lost in itself and providing excellent character based action both on and off the track. In my opinion this is Ron Howard's best work to date (yes, including A Beautiful Mind!) and a film definitely worth catching in cinemas while you still can.",

            "content": "I am old enough to remember the real duel between Lauda and Hunt, and am delighted that someone has finally spotted what a great story it was. I loved the film because it took me back to being an impressionable sixteen-year-old who, in common with most of my friends had fallen completely for James Hunt's charm and offbeat good looks. We hadn't been Formula 1 fans - or fans of blokes with posh accents, being northerners - but we definitely were now! I remember following the whole season on the radio, deciphering Murray Walker's near-hysterical commentary to find out what was going on. Needless to say, I loved the film and I thought the two main characters were unbelievably good, especially Chris Hemsworth, who pulled off the depiction of something close to a national icon incredibly well, getting Hunt's public-school drawl and round-shouldered walk perfectly, as well as his dangerous mixture of immaturity and charisma. I also thought that Daniel Bruhl made an unlikeable character, - frowning, earnest, pedantic and generally irritating - much more accessible than he could have been.The atmosphere of the 1970s was captured perfectly - leather miniskirts, dubious haircuts, rampant sexism, and incredible freedom and glamour for those who could afford it. I also liked the way the grime and scruffiness of Formula 1 came across, as well as its hazardous and uncertain nature: it's hard to believe that nowadays the Nurburgring simply isn't used any more because it's too dangerous. My only caveat was that some of the other characters in the sport, like Enzo Ferrari, and some of the other drivers like Fittipaldi and Scheckter could have been used to greater effect, but maybe that would have detracted from the leads, who were just electrifying. I hope Ron Howard can collect some kind of award for this film because he certainly deserves it. As to the warts-and-all depiction of Hunt, I hope the film stirs memories of a great sportsman, so British he was almost a clich\u00e9, but who in addition to being insanely brave also had humour and intelligence way beyond the capacity of many of the much lesser characters in the media nowadays. His family should be really proud.",

The race scenes are far & away the best ever put on film & that's only half the movie.The scenes off the race track are as equally effective due to the contrasts between Lauda & Hunt. Peter Morgan's screenplay gives you a deep understanding of these two rivals. They're intense competitors who have a grudging respect for each other despite their polar opposite personalities. I liked each of them for entirely different reasons. Hemsworth & Bruhl do a great job at capturing their charms & quirks.The cinematography is gorgeous throughout.

The accident at the Nurburgring in Lauda ( think of a GP 22 km long that unraveled in the middle of a forest creeps ) is reconstructed in detail . At the same time the film does not skimp on the track of great shots and sequences of the GP in Monza with the Austrian return to racing after a month and a half from the terrible fire of his Ferrari with a sensational fourth place and the epic final race to Fuji is a real treat for the eyes. Howard said that gives us a very good film ( and make movies about Formula 1 is not at all easy ) the cast behaves really well : Hensworth finally stops on the role of Thor and it shows all. Top of the situation and the real surprise is Bruhl perfect in the role of Lauda and with a great trick for the aftermath of the accident. Well the female protagonists and a mention also to our Field bean that appears in some scenes in the role of companion Lauda , Regazzoni . In short, a tribute to the Formula 1 that was where the pilot was also mechanic and engineer but unfortunately where death was tragically commonplace.",

Watching it in German, I tended to forget the fact I see an actor and not the original most of the film. Stunning!I also loved the racing scenes, filmed with excellent camera work and cutting, something I have never seen before in a Hollywood feature like this. I found the film very well balanced concerning personal scenes and the racing sport. The film made you not sympathize too much with one of the characters, at another point I found myself liking them both. One of the major aspects for the film being so intriguing from my point of view is, besides all the above mentioned points, that it does not take itself too seriously. It has no universal or fundamental message to convey and the film acknowledges exactly that. It's fun to watch, exciting, appealing and sometimes disgusting at the same time!",

The writing and the acting were so brilliant that I fell in love with each character, and I debated throughout the entire movie, \"Which character do I like better??\" (I would swing back and forth, but ultimately my heart went to Niki) The acting was spectacular. While I knew Chris Hemsworth would be outstanding, I was AMAZED by Daniel Bruhl! WOW. Both actors had fantastic chemistry and I totally believed they were lifelong racing brothers who had love/hate feelings for each other, leading towards boundless respect in the end.On some level, this felt like a Love Story, a story of redemption, and a story of brotherhood and loyalty.I walked out of the theater feeling inspired. Happy. Deep in thought. And most amazingly, CURIOUS and eager to know MORE about the world of Formula 1 Racing, cars, and the real life Niki Lauda & James Hunt!",

What makes this movie is it's only nominally about racing--the interesting angle is the complex rivalry between James Hunt and Niki Lauda (and I would actually recommend NOT reading up about these two before you see the film--there is a major spoiler at the end if, like me, you check into their biographies first). They liked each other, they hated each other, they were polar opposites in their approaches to just about everything--racing and life--and yet they absolutely needed each other. What an interesting character study that elevates this film over the typical Days of Thunder-type of action film. I'll give a cheer for Chris Hemsworth, who does a great job portraying James Hunt--Hemsworth is one of the best actors at playing the Good Time Charlie-type of character (which I would argue is much of his charm in the first Thor film, except Thor grows up. Hunt doesn't). Okay, I do love looking at CH, and he can wear that long hair and those 70s outfits any time . . . but he's a darn good actor, too. How unfortunate this film didn't generate the popularity it deserves. I'd rate it one of the better films I've seen in the genre.",

The movie is more about the rivalry between those two and how far someone goes to be better than the other. James Hunt just want's to prove he is the best and when he does he's done with it. Nikki Lauda on the other hand also want's to be the best but he want's to stay the best and will continue to fight for it. He's not there to prove someone a point other than himself and i think with that attitude you can achieve a lot more because he is more motivated to win more often.

The fact that he died so young and in such obscurity makes this story so tragic and moving. I was so pleased that there was a clear demonstration of mutual respect by the two protagonists if only in the very last minutes of the film.Nikki Lauder remains quite rightly one of the most influential men in F1 , a portent of which is clearly demonstrated by his early genius.Personally I found the whole experience of watching their story incredibly emotional and brilliantly portrayed on every level,directing/acting/ filming and effects, oh yes and not to forget a superb soundtrack by the ubiquitous Hans Zimmer( how does he keep doing it?).I will go again, and buy the blue-ray as soon as its available.....well done everyone involved.",

            "content": "First of all, I have to accept that I am not an F1 fan. So I am completely ignorant about the history of this sports and the famous rivalries associated. What I liked about \"Rush\" was the movie can convey its subject to those who doesn't really need to be F1 fans. The film is about the famous rivalry between 2 F1 stars, James Hunt & Nicki Lauda. Now more than their achievements on the track, it was about how their rivalry commenced and what may be the factors that led to the rivalry.Ron Howard is quite aware about the subject he was going to handle and the possibilities to become a stereotyped sports drama comprising of phoenix rise, great fall etc etc, if not handled smartly. As mentioned earlier, I have no idea about the rivalry so whatever I understood is what I got from the movie. Ron and writer Peter Morgan initial conveys their background (both hailing from wealthy families with different ambitions) and the cultural differences. Also we can see how their attitude towards their life results in their positives and negatives and how the outcome plays during some of the important points of their life. The common feature in both the characters is the extreme self confidence.A balancing act was well performed by Ron and his writer Peter and thus kept the audience away from an absolute clich\u00e9d sports drama. I will not claim that the movie was flawless but chances are rare for you to get disengaged from the experience due to boredom. This is the strength of the presentation by Ron Howard and it is simply terrific by the fact that its a real life rivalry. Also he didn't opt for a docu-fiction style and used possible cinematic liberties without affecting the realism of the subject. Now there is a particular scene where Hunt punches a journalist which I found a bit \"filmy\". I cannot confirm whether it happened in reality (since the character sketch of James make it possible) but currently I like to see it as one of the cinematic liberties. After all its based on an \"incredible\" real life story as credited. A major highlight of the movie along with the performances from the lead cast are the well choreographed pulsating F1 races especially the German Grand Prix & Japanese Grand Prix. Some brilliant dialogues between James & Nicki towards the end conveyed the rivalry with a silent mutual respect between them.I may not have seen many of Chri Hemworth's performances but from what I saw, I rate this as Chris's best performance till date. He literally lived as James Hunt. But the actor who got a more meatier character, more one-liners and overshadowed Chris at places was Daniel Br\u00fchl as Niki Lauda. Alexandra Maria Lara (as Marlene Knaus) portrayed the role of Nicki's supportive wife while Olivia Wilde portrayed Suzy Miller (James's wife).But the biggest highlight is the score of Hans Zimmer. I just have no words to describe that score and I am sure those who watched this experience will surely notice the score. Anthony Dod Mantle's used a color tone to suit 70s and he along with Daniel P. Hanley & Mike Hill's editing delivered a terrific job with the race sequences. Just like the F1 races, the movie moves at a breakneck pace. The make up and costume department justified their presence by providing the 70s look to all the characters while the production designing team came up with a similar effort by providing us the feel of 70s.Overall, the movie was a terrific experience as if you are in an F1 race. This will surely engage you even if you are not an F1 fan or follower with its theme and the emotions associated with it.",

This is NOT a \"Fast and Furious\" movie, either a \"15 minutes\" movie ( Robert de Niro ). This is NOT just a movie about F1 and looking at the laps the cars make. The F1, although present in the movie, is not the main subject. It is the rivalry between 2 pilots, Niki Lauda and James Hunt, which started from the moment they met through 1976, the year of the F1 accident. Their different ways of living, their work and social life. 2 completely different characters put on the screen by Daniel Bruhl and Chris Hemsworth. Both not that well known, but they both make a great role, they work fantastic good. It was not a moment boring, it was a pleasure to see Daniel and Chris doing their job and they do it very good !!! Niki Lauda is Austrian and German speaking. Daniel Bruhl talks English with a German accent and parts of the movie is originally spoken en German. This means that it is highly advisable to see this movie in original version and not dubbed.So, it is really a different movie of the other \"racing movies\". We have special effects, we have a bit racing, but moreover : This is a movie about 2 pilots, their life, their target, their professional attitude.

I am an avid fan of sports films, but this isn't really a sport, so Rush doesn't get any benefit of the doubt from me. That's not to say there's nothing good in this movie. The character work from Daniel Br\u00fchl and Chris Hemsworth is great, and that's what gets you invested in the story. Niki Lauda (the man that Daniel Br\u00fchl plays) proves to be the most fascinating person in the film, because he has such a uniquely abrasive personality, and yet shows that there are some emotions underlying that rough exterior. I was definitely interested in where his journey would end up. The fact that this was all based on real events made it that much more powerful, knowing that he had overcome so much in his life to be a success.James Hunt (the man that Chris Hemsworth plays) is much less fascinating. He is simply a jerk that seems to care about no one. That's where Rush lost me. The one lame \"save the cat\" moment that they give Hunt is not nearly enough to make me like him. The end didn't click all that well, because I couldn't buy that one conversation and a single good deed could turn their rivalry into a friendship. I was afraid he was going to remain the protagonist for the entire film, and his tedious relationships would become an important plot point. Thankfully, later on the movie focused in on Lauda much more, and his intriguing marriage. I enjoyed aspects of Rush more than I expected, particularly the acting, but it never could get over the hump to be a movie I loved. Frankly, I think an ESPN documentary on the subject would be a bit more effective.",

            "content": "Loud, proud, and relentless in its portrayal of sport rivals, Ron Howard's Rush is another entry into his formulaic and conventional directing resume. Like any well oiled machine, Howard is an expert of giving audiences a fundamentally linear narrative with striking and beautiful aesthetic choices, even if the narrative follows the rivalry between two Formula One drivers whose careers and competition is anything but straight-cut.Rush isn't the best film of the year by far, and in terms of narrative the film suffers from clich\u00e9d plot-points, predictable sport film tropes and by-the-book autobiographical rules, but one of the highlights of Rush is the effortlessness of telling the story of two incredible men's lives, without making one or the other the lead protagonist or antagonist. Rush is the true story of two passionate and talented drivers whose race to becoming the Formula One World Champion is something quite unbelievable.The film begins in the middle of its narrative, at the beginning of the 1976 German Grand Prix in N\u00fcrburgring, mere moments before Niki Lauda (Daniel Br\u00fchl) experiences what is suspected to be a rear suspension failure that hospitalized him for a month and a half. We then flashback to 1970 at a Formula Three race in the Crystal Palace circuit in England where the rivalry between Lauda and James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) begins. Destined to be rivals since their initial meeting, the film follows the trails and tribulations of Lauda and Hunt's fight to the Formula One circuit. Lauda, a mechanical genius who uses his skills on cars to earn his spot beside Clay Regazzoni (Pierfrancesco Favino) and the Scuderia Ferrari racing team, shows skill as a engineer but suffers socially, proving to be somewhat inept when it comes to interacting with people. While Hunt, an unapologetic, globetrotting playboy, seems to have no problems interacting with his fans (maybe a little too often). Where Hunt lacks for meticulous calculations and mechanical understanding, things Lauda posses, Hunt makes up for in raw talent, ambition and \"balls\".The film chronicles not only an intense rivalry set in the dangerous world of Formula One Racing, but the film also depicts a rivalry of wits between two men, who suffer and sacrifice so much for respect in a world inhabited by high-adrelanline, death-defying racers.Rush is definitely a return to form for Howard, who, after the problematic and chaotic The Dilemma, had a lot to prove aesthetically and narratively. Aesthetically, Howard had his wheels spinning uncontrollably with inspiration. From the film's 1970\u2032s grainy look, to its very artistic slow-motion racing scenes (which acts as a nice irony to the sport), to the choice of camera angles when covering the pivotal scenes of the race, usually shooting at a very low angle, Howard does use the film to solidify his place as a stylistic filmmaker again, as he did previously with Cinderella Man, Apollo 13 and A Beautiful Mind. Howard surrounded himself with the best this time around, and made no mistakes. With a modest $38 Million budget for a Hollywood film, Howard was able to create an high-octane Formula One film, grounded as a character piece. Written by Peter Morgan (The Queen), shot by Anthony Dod Mantle (Slumdog Millionaire), Scored by Hans Zimmer (The Dark Knight trilogy), and produced by film-extraordinaire and longtime collaborator Brian Grazer, Rush is assembled just like any other team in the Formula One cockpit, meticulously and strategically.It also did not hurt that Howard was able to get Hemsworth out of Nordic armour and deliver his finest performance to date. The real star of the film is Br\u00fchl. Underrated and overlooked since his career-defining role in Tarantino's Inglorious Bastards, Br\u00fchl inhabits his rat-like character and shows the intolerable side of a man obsessed with perfection, discontent with happiness, and who shows no emotional response to the fast pace world which exists around him. Br\u00fchl's transformation into Lauda is one that will hopefully be acknowledged come award season.Rush is a good film. More of a solid entry into the autobiographical sport genre, much like 42 earlier this year, the film lacks an intensity most great sport films have, which is the intensity of the sport itself. Some of the greatest sport movies ever made use the sport to elevate character progression, intense emotion or moments that audiences cheer for. There was never a rousing moment of triumph, pleasure or extreme emotion with our characters that took place on the racetrack. Unfortunately for the film, some of the best scenes happen on the streets of Italy, in the hospital, or in restaurants and furnace rooms where the characters grow and evolve; the racetrack is just a forum for winning.Unfortunately for the audience, between near-fatal crashes, personal lows and tragic endings, Rush never emotionally resonates with us. Lacking for a connection with Hunt and Lauda, Howard doesn't give the audience much time to connect with his drivers the way they do with their vehicles. \"Men love women, even more than that, men love cars!\". I don't think there could have been a more accurate way to describe the film and the world where testosterone, ego, and fuel, pumps the veins in the hearts of each racer.Night Film Reviews: 7/10 Stars",

            "content": "This film is recommended.Gentlemen, start your engines! The need for speed is the mainstay in Ron Howard's cinematic ode to racing, Rush, a well crafted, if formulaic, Formula One racing car drama. \u00a0The film tells the true story of two racing champions, British playboy James Hunt, and temperamental Austrian driver Niki Lauda, and centers on the on-going rivalry between the two drivers. Both are Type A personalities: ambitious, energetic, and competitive. And both are unlikeable characters, which throws the audience's sympathies askew from the onset. \u00a0They act predictably petty and selfish throughout the film with no real maturity or growth to speak of. There is no real surprises in the character's development, actions, or motivations in Peter Morgan's straightforward script. It also doesn't help that the dialog never builds any real conflict or resolution.Yet what makes Rush so watchable are the purely technical aspects of the film. Howard knows how to set up his shots for maximum effect and he skillfully keeps the action sequences exciting and tense. The Formula One racing scenes are wonderful and quite exhilarating. \u00a0Particularly impressive is the rain-soaked Grand Prix racing sequence an expect blending of visual images. His biggest misstep is incorporating the real footage of Hunt and Lauda which seems a tad jarring in comparison.The film boasts first-rate production values. The editing by Daniel P. Hanley and Mike Hill is just terrific, as is the stunning photography by Anthony Dod Mantle. \u00a0Special mention also goes to the expert sound design, the strong makeup work, and a music score by Hans Zimmer which is never overdone or intrusive. The period art direction and costumes help to capture the 70's era with clever subtleties. As long as Rush stays literally on the course, the film is highly entertaining. But whenever it detours into the realm of the human drama, the film is a bit of a bore. This is not the fault of the actors involved. Liam Hemsworth and Daniel Br\u00fchl bring the right degree of vanity and physically posturing to their conventional roles. Both actors make their stilted characters more believable. Manyl of the supporting characters are underwritten and rarely seem authentic. This is especially true with the female love interests played by Olivia Wilde and.Alexandra Maria Lara, fine actresses that aren't given enough to do.Although Rush may veer dangerously off trackage times, it does cross the finish line, just not in the winner's circle.

You have both action and meaningful dialog. RUSH tells the true story of the inexplicably long rivalry between two race car drivers in the 1970s. We follow Mr Hunk (James Hunt), and Mr Rat Face (Niki Lauda) as they fight to maintain their first place Grand Prix title from each other.Thank the heavens this isn't a 3D movie, the action was intense enough. RUSH goes deep into the weighty topics of life. You will find your brain grappling with the meaning of friendship, ambition, even marriage. We watch Hunt and Lauda mature and adjust their priorities in life. Well at least Lauda does. Chris Hemsworth, playing James Hunt looks every bit the Bad Boy with boundless energy for women, booze, drugs, and looking death in the eye with every race. Daniel Br\u00fchl plays the contradictory Niki Lauda, equally motivated to win, but by his own strict set of rules calculated to avoid death.As the story unfolds we meet girlfriends, managers, drivers, investors and assorted 1970s stereotypes that serve to flesh out the incalculable motivations and pressures involved in keeping the show on the road. Everyone has something to lose. Niki learns that happiness is the enemy. \"It means you have something to lose.\" James seems to be suppressing his thoughts and feeling throughout the film with his physicality.Trust me, RUSH is, well, a rush.

I saw this movie tonight with great expectations, most fulfilled.The story begins getting to know the two main characters and their vastly different lifestyles. James Hunt, the dashing, charming, handsome, exciting, womanizing, witty adrenaline junkie race car driver. Niki Lauda, average looking, very few people like him, intense personality, extremely logical, always afraid of complacency, comes from extreme family money in Vienna, Austria, is supremely intelligent - so much that he is a bit socially awkward, and told his family he wants none of their money and he'll make it on his own. Lauda gets a $2 million dollar bank loan, buys his way into a partnership with a broke car owner, mechanics report to Lauda per the contract and Lauda with the mechanics work round the clock to rebuild the race car. Then he knocks Hunt out of #1 spot, Hunt has no respect for him initially because he didn't pay his dues. The fierce competition begins.The movie takes you through the lives of these guys in one season of racing - as well as the business of car racing. Dealing with sponsors, owners, mechanics, watching fellow racers deaths and dramatic injuries, track officials, race tracks, weather, and the media. Then to the crash at the rainy race in Germany where Lauda was badly burned, including the inside of his lungs from breathing in 800 degree fuel induced fire. He was read his last rights by a priest, and somehow endured. Movie gives a glimpse into his treatments including vacuuming out the fluid from the burns in his lungs, not for the weak stomach. While he was going through skin graphing and these extremely painful treatments he is watching TV and Hunt creeping up to his first place spot. Motivated and hungry to win Lauda is back on the track about five weeks later still bandaged and healing. It's a media frenzy and no one is more glad to see him than Hunt, although disturbed by his face. They compete again with a mutual respect, a few races later in Japan the weather is rainy again. Due to media and viewers they decide not to cancel, risking the drivers. Lauda starts the race, he recognizes it as too dangerous and bows out, Hunt competes to take home world championship and needs to come in third or better to do it. Great ending and finish.Two things I felt this movie left out. First, why were these guys drawn to racing? Movie never established the attraction, tried but fell very short likely due to bad editing. Second, did not actually show cars passing each other and what the competition is really about - it is why these guys love it and anyone watching or involved in racing is drawn to it. Otherwise fantastic film and very under rated by critics. I highly recommend seeing this human story, a true story.",

Rush is a movie where your heart starts pumping each and every second the participants start racing.You move your head left and right not because you are driving but the races are so engaging, you just cannot stop yourself to do that. James Hunt,a playboy who loses his contract to the sponsors after losing the WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP and then begs to MACLAREN(the only car which could beat Ferrari then) to give him a chance so that he could beat Niki Lauda. Niki Lauda who is more of a realistic kind of a guy is a businessman from Austria who has rejected to take forward his father's empire just because he only knew about F1 then and wanted to do something big.Yes, the world knows them (James Hunt and Niki Lauda) as biggest rivals but as Niki Lauda once says \"He(James Hunt) was one of the few whom I liked. The only person I envied.\" This movie is not all about racing, It's about the life of two professionals who on the outside are opponents but deep down they care for each other. They respect each other.This is a movie where even if you are not a Formula One fan you'd love it because it has elements. Elements that make a movie thrilling,heart pumping and keeps you on the edge of your seat.Chris Hemsworth(Thor) steals the show as a playboy and a racer but its Daniel Bruhl(Inglorious Basterds) who is the real show stellar in Rush. It's his Austrian accent and I-know-everything-about-cars attitude which makes him pleasing to the eyes. He is just excellent in the sequences where he suffers in the hospital after his accident.Add to that Hans Zimmer(The Dark Knight,Inception,POTC) is there for the Background Score which just sets the mood exceptionally well and Anthony Dod Mantle(DoP) is also there without whom this movie wouldn't have made that impact as those camera angles and movemet did.RUSH which totally engaging and an edge-of-the-seat thriller.

Sure there are a few reviewers who are self-described Formula 1 \"aficionados\" that lament the racing scenes. Not sure why; I found them riveting. But whatever.

I was fooled into thinking that I was about to watch a movie about Chris Hemsworth's character, which isn't too much of a stretch considering he must have at least 75% of the scenes in the trailer.But this was not Chris Hemsworth's movie, far from it. This was Daniel Brole(?)'s movie. I added a question mark because I still don't know his name after watching the trailer, the movie and consequently obsessing over the information surrounding the actual events. It's either Brole or Brule and it has an accent. I'm still on the trailer, there's more to be said. It was one of the best trailers in recent history, simply due to the fact that it didn't give the entire movie away. If I hadn't seen the trailer before watching the movie, I don't think I would have had the same experience. Not only did it not spoil the movie, it prepared me for some obscure historical event from the bottom of the bag being massacred into a motion picture.wow incoherent rambling review much? such amaze so wow. All I've done was talk about the trailer. 10 stars 100% on rotten tomatoes. There are some amazing movies that you'd never want to watch again, I'll see in five or ten years if this one is one of them. I've watched National Lampoon's Senior Trip (Jeremy Renner's first role) at least a dozen times, but it's a pretty terrible movie. Rush is good rush is great it was my favourite movie this year it kinda played out like an Ayn rand novel and I wonder if Niki Lauda was into her at all, since he seems.... kinda fricked (WHY CAN'T I USE PROFANITY IN MY REVIEW, THAT'S INSANE IT'S 2013 GET YOUR STUPID STUFF TOGETHER GUYS.

In fact, it interests me enough that I can't wait to look up more information once the movie is finished. I didn't know anything about Niki Lauda or James Hunt or any of the film's events. So everything was fresh and exciting for me. It's quite a cool story. Such a close year between two racers who are so different with so many ups and downs.It's incredible how perfectly cast this movie is, especially the two leads. They look just like the real people, it's uncanny. It's so great when film-makers can show this level of respect and appreciation for the real people and world their film is based on. Rather than turning to standard Hollywood climaxes and one-liners, they invest time and soul into the story and all of the real details. I believe Lauda was involved with the production and confirmed the end result is very accurate.There are some great quotes in this movie. All of the dialogue between James and Niki is sharp and surprisingly thoughtful. It's often venomous but even more so, it's truthful and playful. Best mates seem to be expected to insult each-other pretty heavily as a weird kind of way of showing how close they are. Niki and James seem to settle into this kind of a relationship. They get on each-others nerves because they can. At first, they hate each-other but gradually they realise the competition between them can actually be a good thing, something they might even need or desire.They are opposites and parallels at the same time. They share feelings and experiences that very few others do, risking their lives time and again, being the best at what they do, surrounded by people that don't fully understand. Enemies and personal friends. They have to talk big, that's part of the sport. And they legitimately get angry with each- other several times. But when things are serious, they look out for each-other. In one scene, a journalist asks Niki a rude, personal question and James decides to privately teach him a little lesson. They protect each-other but might not openly admit it.Their lifestyles are extremely different. James is a playboy, living everyday literally as if it were his last. He believes part of his appeal to women is his closeness to death - that it makes him all the more alive. Niki is much more up-tight. He is efficient and logical. He falls out with his father who won't support his passion for racing. His confidence and focus help him rapidly establish himself independently. It's really interesting when he explains why he doesn't drive fast off-the-track. He's always thinking, aware of all the options he has and picking the best one. He's also very lonely and kind (although he can be harsh and direct). I felt I could relate to him a lot.I thought the acting was really good all-around. The editing and style of the film were unique and suitable for the story. The way the story built up was very exciting and fascinating especially since you know it's based on a true story. You care even more about the characters than you normally would. There are plenty of funny and sad moments but the movie is never preachy. The pace was appropriately high for a movie called Rush - you never have a chance to get bored. Meanwhile the film itself comes across as anything but rushed. I think it has one of the most entertaining and memorable rivalries in film.",

In one scene Niki's dad says he don't want him to race and thats the end of it. where did Niki got love and talent for racing, we don't know. where did he became such an expert on cars, we don't know.James, how did a drunk playboy become the best driver out there, we don't know. who trained him or did he just woke up drunk and said, f**k yeah i will drive the car in the best car race ever and win the title.Niki goes through s**t accident and he is back on race, which is total madness, nothing been said what was that, which motivated him to take such pain and come back. Sure, he had love for race, but the pain and the level of accident he went through was so big and it was not well justified.other then James and Niki, all other characters are under developed. there is nothing romantic in the film. both James and Niki meet some hot random chick and they are married or in love in next and nothing has been shown the marriage or personal life of two character. Olivia Wilde goes on a ski trip and ends with another man, only 1 scene was shown to reflect the difference between a married couple. heck married couple have 10 fights every day, and that was not even a fight.at the end, i felt like i was watching two racers competing for something. not much detail was given why 2.3 second is so critical when in everyday life we don't even think about 2.3 second. i agree in race every second counts, but how the 2.3 second was such a moving number. so, in the end if you know James and Niki, know all about F1 race, and wanted to see quick summary of their race life from that era, this is good movie. if you want to know them, what bring them to racing ground and why they were ready to put their life or why they were better then 10 other drivers on the ground, then in my case i had to go and read Wiki article on them. good luck for yours.",

It accurately depicts F1 racing in those days which was packed with thrills. Not just focusing on the race battle, it also captures the characters' details and presents their different ways of thinking interestingly.Daniel Bruehl is always my favorite, and this time he has done a great job playing Niki Lauda. The way he speaks (with accent), the way he acts, really resembles that Lauda I'd seen on German TV. He portrays the character really well that I hope he will get nominated for Oscar in Best Supporting Actor.Other than Bruehl, the film is also awesome in sound and cinematography. I loved the engine revving sound as well as the way they made the film in the 70's look, just like we were watching the real racing scenes.At the end of the exciting racing scenes, the film shows us how the friendship comes out of the rivalry. How they have a true respect for each other, although they were battling to death in races. Fortunately, F1 safety nowadays has improved tremendously from that time, and Senna remains the last driver to die in race.",

Special effects were limited but tastefully done. Ron Howard did a masterful job. The two actors made the characters very believable and come to life just as one expected them. the pace was very gripping (pun intended!) and all of the supporting cast were excellent. Caution on the language and bits of nudity for those who may think of taking the young ones along for the experience.

            "content": "This film tells the story of the rivalry between two very different racing drivers; Austrian Niki Lauda and Briton James Hunt. The former is very precise, studying the track in detail and doing everything he can to optimise his car and his performance; the latter is a bit of a playboy, living life to the full and willing to take a chance if it might net him a victory. This isn't set in the modern era, where serious accidents are rare, but in the seventies when crashes were common and every year saw drivers killed on the track.We see how Hunt and Lauda first meet in Formula Three before finding their way to the top flight in Formula One. Once there Lauda has the better car and becomes world champion first. By 1976 they are both in great cars but Lauda still takes a large early lead but after a horrific accident in Germany he is hospitalised and Hunt starts to close the points gap; it looks like, barring accidents, Hunt can't fail to overtake Lauda's point score. Then Lauda defies all the odds and medical advice to return to the race track\u0085 it looks as though the championship will be much closer than expected.Director Ron Howard does a great job of capturing the '70s feel and the tensions between the two rivals; somewhat exaggerated for the film. Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Br\u00fchl are great, as Hunt and Lauda respectively, they make their rivalry and subsequent growing respect utterly believable. As well as seeing the pair compete on the racetrack we are also shown their personal lives and how that affects their performance and attitudes on the track. The race scenes are utterly gripping and even those who know what happened in 1976 will feel the tension. These scenes felt real; something helped by the fact that the English race commentator sounded just like Murray Walker, possibly the most famous F1 Commentator. Overall I'd recommend this to anybody looking for a great story with plenty of excitement; being a fan of F1 certainly isn't essential.",

It was loud and flashy and fast. Just like all car racing movies should be. He has directed some great movies like a Beautiful Mind, Da Vinci Code and Angels and Demons, the Missing, Cinderella Man and one of my top 10 movies of all time Apollo 13. Great story with great acting to back it up, especially the 2 leads. Chris Hemsworth in my eyes is shaping up to be a fine actor. He deserves to go far. I still remember him as Kim from Summer Bay and then as George Kirk in Star Trek.Loved, loved, loved the camera work. Flipping around showing multiple shots of the inner workings of the car and an inside look from the driver's seat and what's ahead of them. Great use of slow motion sequences and a terrific sound track. Some cool songs from the 70s. The intense rivalry and gradual feelings of respect these two men had for each other was entertaining to watch with each race building up to a satisfying conclusion. Of course I had heard of Niki Lauders near fatal accident and I knew how it all turned out, but I didn't care. It was just that much fun to watch.I will defiantly give this movie multiple viewings over the years. And will absolutely recommend this movie.",

Chris Hemsworth - the flamboyant James Hunt. Perfect! Daniel Bruhl - the serious Nicki Lauda - Perfect as well!What I expected was that I'd love this movie for its amazing and intense Formula 1 racing scenes as seen in the trailer. And let me just say, they couldn't have been better. The direction is AMAZING. Focusing on those curves, gravel from the tires, head to head racing views, the audience enthusiasm, weather conditions, the pit crew, the celebrations, everything was spot on!But to my surprise that's not what I loved about the movie. What I absolutely loved was the portrayal of Hunt & Lauda by the actors. Their friendly rivalry, the passion, the courage, the decisions, the situation handling, the press conferences. But mostly the passion for the sport be it for different reasons. The ending was incredibly suitable and great too.I simply loved it. An undoubted 10/10",

I remember Niki Lauda's accident when it happened, but never knew anything else about the ins and outs of F1 back then.

The soundtrack was excellent, I watched the credits to see who did it, and of course it was a main player. Highly recommend it for a fun afternoon movie. I would say it could be watched by families, some parts of James' amorous life are a little iffy but disguised enough that young ones would not totally get it.",

I like when I remember an actor from a role he played (ex. Thor) does something the opposite, something that you wouldn't expect at first. He acts like he lived through the seventies, he acts perfectly.On the other hand this other guy Daniel Br\u00fchl managed to act as the complete opposite of Chris.If this crew ever decides to make another F1 title, I'll wait eagerly to watch it.

That's reserved for machines. Curves of metal, humming engines and the adrenaline. This week at the movies, Ron Howard's 'Rush' pays tribute to the Man- Machine relationship and it doesn't get more intimate than this.Rush is inspired by real life rivalry between Formula 1 racers James Hunt (Hemsworth) and Niki Lauda (Daniel Bruhl). Them ruled the tracks in the 70's and it was their riff that kept them ahead. The film boasts of well written and performed characters. Hunt is a partying brat, a womanizer who believes in enjoying the life to the fullest. Niki Lauda on the other hand is a complete contrast. He's disciplined, knows his tech inside out and being the son of a businessman, knows the economics of the trade. One's a British and the other a German, even the accents are different. The only thing common between the two is the passion to drive, and unconditional love towards their machines.Its a simple story of these drivers trying to beat each other with their rivalry acting as the main catalyst. Look out for their interesting verbal conflicts for lighter moments.Now for the hero of the film. Cinematographer Anthony Dodd Mantle takes us to places where no one has ever been. Close ups of axle joints, acceleration pedals, exhausts of the engine breathing fire and screeching tires as the cars move at the speed of 170 mph are breathtaking. Especially the starting of the last race in Tokyo where the tracks are wet after rain, the first skid of the tires are shown in slow motion throwing water droplets away from its periphery. I mentioned intimacy, didn't I? All he does is use his experience of handling primitive digital cameras right from the days of Dogme95. Never has being seated in a cinema hall been so thrilling.

            "content": "I am an F1 fanatic - I not only follow the current events, but also the background stories and history of the sport. Therefore I am fully aware of the dynamics of the sport throughout the decades, and the details of the Lauda and Hunt careers.As such this film was a must-see for me, in the hope that it gives justice to F1 as a film topic, and also to see how this fantastic story is told.The performances of Hemsworth and Bruhl are superb...without doubt the best thing about this film...both performances are Oscar-worthy. I had already heard acclaim for Bruhl as Lauda (and he was great), but for me Hemsworth as Hunt was surprising - he really nailed the accent and mannerisms.The second success of the film is its authenticity. Clearly a lot of effort has been made to get the details of the era - the cars, the sponsors, the fashion, the F1 facts, the characters. Without this authenticity, real F1 fans would hate this film, but I believe they will be satisfied.The look and sound of the F1 action is pretty good. Some of the CGI is not the best, particularly when used to make a car spin more dramatic that it perhaps was, but overall it does not ruin the film.The film is more about the characters of Lauda and Hunt, than the sporting action, and that's fine. If you want to see more about the racing events and actual footage, watch the season reviews. This film does not provide a detailed insight into what happens throughout the seasons, nor events beyond the main characters. There are some weaker aspects to the film: 1. The film feels fairly clunky, almost like a series of movie trailers stitched together...it does not flow from chapter to chapter. I think this is because the makers are trying to cover all points in 2 hours - character background, on-track action, news events, etc. Perhaps it would work better as a TV mini-series (episode 1: pre-F1 careers, episode 2: pre-1976 F1, episode 3: 1976 up to German GP, episode 4: 1976 and career climax). 2. The commentators are simply annoying. There is a continuous commentator narration around the race events, and also a poorly cast Stirling Moss character pops up at each race. These are supposed to provide an update on what is going on in the season, but it could have been done better - at least with variety. 3. There is a little poetic license. Non-F1 fans or even casual F1 fans probably will not notice, but if you know the details of the era, how F1 operates, and Lauda/Hunt as drivers, you will spot them. Obviously these are there to add to the drama, and in general they can be accepted.Documentaries aside, I believe this is the best motorport movie so far. Sure it is not full of action, but it's a drama...a character study. When the action does intervene, it is heart (and ear) pounding.F1 and motorsport films have been a challenging topic, and there are not many about, so I hope this will encourage more, because there are some equally fantastic stories to be told.",

            "content": "There are no spoilers in this review of Rush, for the 1976 Grand Prix championship was settled long ago. That it was done in the most unexpected fashion under torrential conditions by the shadow of majestic Mount Fuji, in the legendary racing circuit of the same name, has perhaps made it all the more a hallowed story of Formula One history. Books have been written and documentary films have been made recounting the lives of James Hunt and Niki Lauda many times over. Even the tapes of the live broadcast still exist. A tricky thing, making a story interesting despite everyone already knowing how it all went down.Yet, Ron Howard does just that. As expected, there are embellishments, so let's get the biggest one out of the way: Hunt and Lauda never met in that particular F3 race. It is something that has been pointed out when production photos were leaked revealing just that fictional encounter. Certainly not the first nor the worst type of creative license.Surprisingly, aspects of Hunt's personality are actually toned down. By all accounts, his sexual appetite was more of a compulsion, and his hard drug use and alcohol consumption more than recreational. He was renowned for enjoying all these to excess, even before having to nurse the pain of a broken marriage. His temper was described by Sir Sterling Moss as \"volatile\", with Hunt punching many a poor marshal who eagerly rushed to help Hunt after a shunt \u2013 an oft repeated rhyme for this was a regular occurrence throughout his career. Instead, Ron Howard relies yet again on re-imagining another encounter - his version of Hunt's aggression slightly more noble.Despite these, Hemsworth's Hunt is still pretty much like the real Hunt, from the pre-race nerves, the vomiting, right down to the witty, politically incorrect, off the cuff remarks. In all, the James Hunt of Rush is a highly sympathetic character, one with real fears and tangible feelings underneath his playboy persona.Daniel Bruhl's Lauda on the other hand, is on the verge of one-dimensionality. Throughout the film, the Lauda of Rush is too uptight, too much of a straight edge. While the real Niki Lauda's methodical and no-nonsense approach is renowned, Lauda is a respected figure then and now. His then wife, Marlene Lauda, said of the ever escalating competitiveness of F1 late in Niki's career, \"All the drivers are so serious, it's no longer fun. Niki is the only one who likes to smile and be friendly with the other drivers\" \u2013 a far cry from his on-screen depiction of an insufferable pedant.Only the real Lauda's act of self-preservation truly hints of the film version's human side. A decision borne out of fear, Tyrrell driver Jody Scheckter, called the real Lauda's actions as true bravery. Lauda got out of his Ferrari, defied Il Commendatore, and did not make any excuses. He just could not finish that race and he owned up to that decision.My biggest complaint is that for a motor racing film, Rush shows very little racing, with any long sequence only occurring about an hour into the film. Instead, races are abbreviated as quick flashes of blurred landscape and overused shaky in-car/on-car camera footage \u2013 likely added post-production. Devoid of wide angle shots and any form of continuity editing, it's hard not to call attention into the shakiness as a crutch to depict frantic excitement. With the availability of such stable cranes and booms mounted on various high speed chase cars (such as the ones seen during production!), I was hoping for Rush to break from the \"action equals shaky camera\" trend of Hollywood filmmaking. Show me real driving! Alas, we are treated to quick, jarring cuts. Inevitably, I could never quite tell where the hell they are in the iconic racetracks of F1's yesteryear, were it not for the captions. Save for Monaco (which only appears in Hunt's visualization) and Nurburgring, all the other racing sequences could have been shot in Brands Hatch for all I know.Nonetheless, even though shot in digital format (Arri Alexa and Canon C300) I must commend the colour grading. The temptation must have been there to make it look orange and blue, or perhaps excessively filtered, like oh so many disgusting instagram photos. Instead, there is a subtle warmth to the whole film, as though it were shot in 1970's film stock.Yet, I really only point out these minor annoyances of Rush's action driving sequences because I am such a big fan of Frankenheimer's Grand Prix (1966) \u2013 still to this day my benchmark for any racing flick. There have been many car related movies, few have been about racing, and all have failed because they pandered to the lowest common denominator of automobile fans. Because despite these embellishments, glossed over details, and current action filmmaking clich\u00e9s, Rush is a masterful work of storytelling. Foregoing long drawn out and realistic driving sequences, Rush's plot moves very fast indeed, all whilst largely staying true to the actual historical turn of events \u2013 Frankenheimer's Grand Prix was a notoriously slow burn. Nonetheless, perhaps in homage to Grand Prix, Rush also utilizes track announcers, reporters, and print headlines to advance the exposition (As an aside, I am unsure whether Simon Taylor plays Murray Walker or is he playing himself?).If anything, the mere fact that there is a slick new racing movie out will leave motorsport fans and racers alike thankful. So used are these fans and racers to have their love, their passion, and their pastime being mangled and misrepresented, that anything close enough to the gritty realism of the sport is a very welcome and refreshing change indeed. For those of you who feared this will be Stallone's Driven, redux, then you need not worry. Go watch it! You won't be disappointed.",

If you do; then you've the opportunity to get the full visceral fly-on-the-wall experience of what was happening behind-the-scenes (artistic licence seems to be within a fair margin of error).Ron Howard seems to flit between the sublime and the ridiculous, with Rush most definitely being the former rather than the latter.The casting of Hemmsworth as Hunt was always going to cause ructions, but to my taste he manages to effortlessly embody everything about the racing \"superstar\"; from the 70s swagger to the clipped speech pattern Hemmsworth delivers a memorable and driven performance.The real star of the show however is neither Howard or Hemmsworth, but the excellent Daniel Bruhl as Austrian racing legend Nikki Lauder. Having been an admirer of talents for a while, it was only a matter of time before the promise shown in Goodbye Lenin, the Edukators, Inglorious B's etc led to leading roles in major international productions. His performance in Rush is as measured as it is passionate and (admittedly helped by the story) it's Bruhl who comes out with the most credit.With an admirable lack of profanity Ron Howard and counter-parts have skilfully delivered the best racing movie in many a long year.Rush is a film made with enough craft to draw you in and entertain you, and far more than enough guile to keep you intrigued long after the credits have rolled.",

True story of the battle between two Formula One drivers. Chris Hemsworth plays English playboy James Hunt who boozes and hooks up with several women. Daniel Bruhl plays the focused Austrian driver Niki Lauda who is appalled by the actions of Hunt. Set mainly in 1976 with Ron Howard creating exciting racing action as well as tension when weather creates a major crash. One narrative element that isn't examined to its fullest is the married lives of the two driver. Both drivers react differently to this. Hemsworth creates the flamboyant competitive personality of Hunt while Bruhl is equally great as Lauda who survives a nasty crash that leaves him scarred. One big flaw is that Olivia Wilde, as Hunt's wife who leaves him for Richard Burton, and Alexandra Maria Lara as Lauda's loyal wife seem like an after thought and are too much in the distant background. Pierfrancesco Favino plays another racer named Clay Regazzoni from Switzerland, who died a few years prior to this film's release. This is not a film about Formula One. It regards a rivalry so fierce that the two factors can do no more than nod and respect each other. Ron Howard began his directing career with an inferior race car comedy called Grand Theft Auto. Here he raises the rod with intense focus as two champions pit against each other in a struggle for fame, triumph and hopefully dignity. Score: 8 / 10",

Director Ron Howard chose two actors who, not only resemble their real life counterparts, but also embody their characters and the drive (no pun intended) to be the best. The dual narrative followed each of the drivers as they overcame struggles and challenges along their journey, which worked perfectly for this film. Lauda and Hunt both viewed the world, risk and racing completely differently, which ultimately gave me two very different possible ways that I could look at life, either as if I will die tomorrow or with cost-benefit analysis, acting logically.Prior to watching this film, I knew absolutely nothing of the Formula One rivalry or the tragic crash that very nearly ended the career of Lauda. This made the film much more exciting as I was never sure what the outcome of the races would be or who would die and when and left me on the edge of my seat for the whole two hours. I would highly recommend this film to any one who, like me, enjoys biographical films.9/10",

            "content": "This is the best movie of 2013 so far and I doubt an upcoming movie will take this spot (maybe Gravity).The balance is poetic in every form: the balance between the two protagonists, but even more so the balance in sequences of the two. You never get bored watching and just when you're about to get bored, it switches brilliantly. The story is, for me, one of the strongest points and one of the best sports film stories ever.But that's just the plot and the balance and pacing; the achievement in cinematography is just stunning. Engines being fired, ultra zoomed cameras attached to the car's gear where you see every little thing moving, rain falling in slow-motion... everything is so, so beautiful.But that's just graphically: the sound is so deep, so real, it reels you in and echoes afterwards. In combination with the music, just brilliant.But that's just the cinematography: the actors deliver an astonishing performance; you hate them both, but you wish them both the best, they should both win. Hemsworth is truly arrogant and believable, Br\u00fchl is truly driven and professional. The chemistry, although I hate that word, is just spot on.",

            "review_title": "Hope from Ron Howard",
            "content": "I begin this post with a vow: I will not, no matter how tempting, make a pun based on the title of Rush. To my surprise, even creative writers such as Bill Simmons employed such a method. But I will not. I will rise above the appetizing pun. Last weekend I saw the film Rush. Let me tell you, it was a rush. (Sorry).I took the bait. Like many other movie-lovers, I had been waiting for Rush to come out for quite some time. It was directed by Ron Howard, and considering his last two films were less than subpar, it had to be good; he was past due. Beyond that, the trailer was a mess. A good mess. As I have shared before, Blake and I have a theory: ambiguous movie trailers produce great films. Of course there are always exceptions but I believe there are a lot of good examples. The next film I believe will fit this bill is The Counselor. Watch the trailer. You probably have no idea what the movie is about but I reckon it'll be pretty darn good. I felt similarly about Rush. I knew it was about racing and philandering, but not much else.Rush had a rudimentary story; there was nothing too complex about it. In many circumstances that would be considering a shortcoming, but excellent acting and precise storytelling made the basic plot impressive. As with most racing movies (Days of Thunder, Talladega Nights), this film was about a rivalry and a traumatic accident.James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) is a handsome English free-spirit who enjoys his booze and women. Willing to risk his life, he often makes moves on the track others would not dream of, progressing him through the ranks of professional racing. Then there is Niki Lauda (Daniel Bruhl). Lauda is a calculating, cold individual who views racing as a mathematical equation. Despite the threat of losing the right to the family fortune, Lauda becomes a racer. Hunt and Lauda first meet in Formula 3 racing, two steps below Formula 1. Their personalities clash. Hunt pulls a risky move, winning him the race and knocking Lauda out. Lauda develops animosity.Despite his initial failure in Formula 3, Lauda takes out a personal loan and buys his way into Formula 1. Lauda excels and Hunt eventually follows suit. Their rivalry ripens in Formula 1 until Lauda gets in a fiery wreck. Because of tumultuous weather conditions, Lauda wanted to cancel the race. However, Hunt swayed the other drivers to vote to race despite the less-than-ideal weather conditions. Throughout Lauda's recovery, Hunt gains formidable ground in the standings while developing an admiration for Niki. Ultimately the season comes down to the last race. Hunt is still three points behind Lauda, but can secure a World Championship with a top 3 finish so long as Niki receives zero. Battle wounds and all, Lauda participates in the final race while another torrential downpour ensues. After a couple laps, however, Niki pulls into the pit and decides he is finished; the film suggests it was for the love of his wife. In dramatic fashion, Hunt finishes third and secures the World Championship. Months later Hunt and Lauda run into each other at an airport. Hunt tells Niki that he has no reason to race anymore since he has reached the top, but Lauda implores Hunt to stay in racing. The rest of the film includes informational text over actual photographs of James Hunt and Niki Lauda. If you want some actual historical context, look here.One may hear this tale and decide that it wasn't very original and/ or compelling. Normally I would agree with that sentiment. I am all for fresh perspectives and stories that have not been told before. Yet, no matter how much Rush reminded me of other tales, it was compelling. Many racing movies appeal to a certain type of moviegoer; the Transformers 2 super-fan-type. They are a special breed, not in it for the story line or the character development, but for the explosions and over-the-top sixty-minute ultimate battle scenes. They are the type of people that prefer the episodes I, II, and III of Star Wars (just despicable if you ask me). Rush, amazingly, was able to be a movie both for the aforementioned individuals and those with a more sophisticated palate. (Wow, I hope I don't sound too much like a snob). Ron Howard did an amazing thing: he took a very basic story and created a fascinating drama intertwined with titillating race sequences. He made an old story appear crisp. Obviously this was not without some help. Another reason you should definitely check out Rush is because of the acting. I had seen Chris Hemsworth in a few roles before Rush but none of which hinted that he was capable of the performance he displayed. On more than one occasion, I thought that this could be a breakthrough role for the young actor. It is not as promising when you look at what films are on deck for him, however. He has the second Thor movie, The Avengers: Age of Ultron, and Snow White and the Huntsman 2. Don't get me wrong, Thor and The Avengers were decent movies; they're just not roles that generate acclaim for being a great actor. There is always the chance he will break from his current mold soon, though. Rush was a taste of that. Alongside Hemsworth was Daniel Br\u00fchl.Overall, Rush was a fun film. It masterfully balanced many different aspects of cinema in one production. It was a great example of how to execute storytelling. I would definitely see this again, though I would want to make sure I had a large screen television and surround sound. 9/10",

It needed to be trimmed by at least 15-minutes. Ron Howard is a master at his craft & 'Rush' is another glowing example to the fact. Cinematography is rich. Editing needed more sharpness.

Die-hards will immediately spot the film's minor inaccuracies and dramatic licence taken with certain aspects of 1970s F1, but, for me, these didn't detract from the movie in the slightest (I personally loved seeing my local racing circuit, Cadwell Park, standing in for other circuits in some scenes). If you're a motorsport fan it's a must watch, but the drama of this true story coupled with incredible cinematography and great acting make this the sort of movie that should appeal to everybody.",

It was biblical and very aptly shown by Ron Howard. He knows how to direct a biography and this was no easy task. He has used appositely filters to get every emotion from every scene. There is hair rising, spine tingling excitement from the race scenes it's like actually being there to experience the races.With some people you just can't fight and win, you just can't blame your lucky stars, u just can't compete with all the power in the world; some people are just born to do what they do, some people are just Great!",

Sometimes you hear contrived dialogue in films of this type but here the dialogue was delivered as fast as the action on the screen. No long monologues here.The two leads had to carry the film...and did. Showing rivalry without it being too bitter or really getting nasty and ultimately having utmost respect for each other. Out of the two I thought Hemsworth was probably the better, nailing the British accent especially that which has a plum in its mouth. The supporting cast did not really have a lot to to other than look concerned as they raced or whoop or otherwise when race over.Motor racing scenes will not disappoint the motor racing fans amongst you...with plenty of noise and pulsing music to go with it.Was a bit worried of someone as long in the tooth as Ron Howard directing; thought a young jazzy/visionary director would stamp himself all over this one, but no Howard directed with gusto and at pace.So yeah, jump into the driving seat on this one for a couple of hours as it is based on a good, true story with the rivals being two totally opposite characters.",

Of course liberties have been taken with the facts, but this is inevitable when the events of several years are compressed into a couple of hours. The recreation of racing in the seventies is generally well done but for those who lived through the 1976 season the movie lacks dramatic impact. Hemsworth and Bruhl do a good job as Hunt and Lauda, but the other roles are virtually bit parts. The portrayal of BRM's Louis Stanley (a notorious tyrant) is particularly poor. If you know nothing of seventies racing you may enjoy it, but if you are not a racing fan it probably has little to offer.",

So, the story was promising (getting into deep dungeons of friendship/rivalry/antagonisms of main characters) but it ended up wandering around almost random scenes from their lives and ending ,as usual, just when it becomes interesting. Now something on the \"technical aspects of the craft\": Cast is very good and so are the performances (two main characters only), as well as editing. The direction can be described as \"somewhat too nervous and erratic\", probably following the script. There were some good ideas but, unfortunately, not developed properly. As if producers said: no money for a second more. Too bad. It could have been a really good movie. But it isn't.",

Hunt wont be and neither will his girlfriends, who got a ridiculous amount of screentime in this movie.Any good?

Daniel Br\u00fchl did a very good role and he manged to makes us hates his character but at the end maybe loves him and feel proud of him.

Well, I read an article on it in GQ, but that was a while ago, so whatever. I think it helped. This really is a brilliant movie. The way it's all done was pretty much flawless. The intensity of the racing and drama really made you feel invested, as did the brilliant performances by all the cast. Hemsworth and Bruhl portray such a dynamic yet intriguing relationship, that when it comes to the races, you just can't decide who you want to win, but you want to see where this rivalry goes. It was good to see Stephen Mangan take a prominent supporting role, too. I've only see him in 'Episodes' and follow him on Twitter, so I hope the other stuff he's done is like this. The style and direction also make this film so impressive. There are times when the camera literally doesn't stop moving, whether it be during a race scene or straight-forward dialogue scene, and you don't even notice it. It like you're on a constant ride. There are films where directors choose unconventional shots just to add diversity or for the sake of it, but not this one. Howard knew what he was doing. Kudos to you, man.

At least Ford vs. Ferrari (which was also extremely tedious) had one good actor (Matt Damon) in it. This travelogue has no such stellar talent.As I mentioned in that review, racecar films have a long history of failure at both the box office and for critical acclaim. The only really good racecar movie ever made was Mad Max, and that was more of sci-fi film than a racecar film. Fifteen minutes of Mad Max is worth the entire contents of this turkey.",

I'm not a racing fan, so I had very little background or context, but it all made perfect sense as it unrolled, and now I know a lot more about Formula 1 racing and World Championships.A couple of short scenes of injuries were hard to watch.",

            "content": "RUSH (2013) :\nBrief Review -One freaking fantastic heck of a racing ride but in very much rush while finishing the line. Rush is a fine pacy ride with no damned slow moments at all but it's not errorsless. The film depicts a rivalry between two Formula 1 Champions Niki Lauda and James Hunt. As expected one guy is disciplined and the other one is wild and it should be like that otherwise face off doesn't make it look like having two opposite poles. Niki Lauda played by Daniel Bruhl is a man with discipline, schedule and rules in his life and Chris Hemsworth as James Hunt is wild, beasty and man with no freaking rule in his life. This rivalry doesn't have a single man coming out as a dominant winner instead there are ups and downs as far as this screenplay with fictional changes is concerned. From reality it is pretty much different of course for the sake of cinematic liberty but it still has some unnecessary dramatic portions in it. The use of adultery was completely rubbish because it took away all the dignity of Hunt's character causing majority of people losing excitement from one of the only two main characters of this film. Second mistake is skipping lots of important racing events and putting love and melodrama in those spaces. I don't see why Hunt's wife has to be shown in the climax scene when she was already done with him. Now the plus points, first is the pacing of the film, second is Entertaining quotient, third is Daniel Bruhl's amazing Performance and fourth is Ron Howard's convincing direction. In 2 hours Rush doesn't look boring at all but then it looked like in very much rush in last 15 minutes. Actually that portion needed more explanation and screenspace to have high end climax but unfortunately it goes away quickly like a blink. Overall, Rush is an impressive film and definitely a recommendable stuff but with few countable lapsus.RATING - 7/10*By - #samthebestest",

The basic premise of the movie is healthy, competitive and life altering rivalry between Nikki Lauda and James Hunt. Famous F1 drivers of mid 70s who went on to become world champions.Nikki Lauda is world champion and is competing with James Hunt for the title for the year 1976. Ron Director of the movie has given such brilliant portrait of both the drivers. Nikki is shown as technically correct, focus and highly skilled driver. James Hunt is flamboyant driver, who is more courageous and has nothing to lose. The Championship is a critical junction when Nikki meets with an accident and gives opportunity to James Hunt to cash on and he does. James Hunt wins the World Championship for the year 1976. One of the capturing moments in the movie is when Nikki Lauda makes a come back after getting seriously injured and wins the fourth position in race. Daniel Bruhl gave fantastic performance. little do i know why he was not nominated for Oscars. Nikki was true star though he lost the Championship but still remained the winner. Amazing heart capturing movie. Loved the way it was directed.It is sometimes great to have rivals who can make you excel in life. Story of Nikki and Hunt. Must Watch...",

I would urge anyone to watch this film, even if they are not Formula One fans.The casting is absolutely brilliant if you compare the actors with the people they are based on. The acting is also great, with Daniel Bruehl picking up on small traits of his character that make him even more believable.\"Everyone needs an enemy in life\" Someone to bust his balls and push him further. The themes in the story are about working hard and never giving up. But also about enjoying life after having worked hard. There is no antagonist in this story, only two equally great but very different protagonists and the audience has to decide who they identify with more.",

            "content": "Thoroughly enjoyed \"Rush.\" Ron Howard creates an energetic, compelling, and highly detailed world, and populates it with equally vivid real-life characters. I'm a film and motorsports geek, but rarely do the film and motorsports worlds intersect to produce anything good. \"Rush\" is, happily, the exception to the rule.The film avoids all the tired old \"racing movie\" pitfalls: the nearly-irresistible force dragging producers and directors toward the action movie genre, the romanticized homage to historical figures living and dead, the dumbed-down \"good guy vs. bad guy\" duel, ad nauseam. Instead, Howard knocks us back into our seats with an intimate, visceral impression of the the speed and danger of 1970s Formula One racing. He captures the essence of motorsport, that melding of the human will with the brute force of the machine, like no one else ever has. And he also shows the unavoidable, painful truth. That the technology of speed has always advanced more rapidly than the science of safety.So Howard creates a nearly perfect movie universe for Rush. But that's only the director's 3rd most important task. The two most important tasks are hiring the right actors, then getting the best possible performances out of those actors. I think Hemsworth and Bruhl are excellent choices. The former has the charisma needed to portray Hunt, the latter the intensity needed to play Lauda. And Bruhl absolutely nails Lauda's accent.But if there is a weakness to Howard's work in Rush, it is that he sometimes doesn't get maximum performances out of his actors. Occasionally, simply hiring the right actors is enough and much of the production just falls into place. Other times, the director needs to work his or her voodoo to get actors to cry, laugh, and achieve peak performance. Several of the film's scenes fell flat emotionally (especially the ski trip argument scene and subsequent restaurant scene.) They could have been big acting moments, they could have added more depth to the film, but it just didn't happen. It felt like Howard either told the actors to pull it back a little to keep the film \"lighter\" or simply didn't feel like expending a lot of energy shooting alternate takes.I doubt the lack of a big acting moment will have even the slightest effect on the film's box office, but it's just about the only thing preventing me from giving the film 10 stars. I enjoyed the film on many levels, and I think there's something for everyone to love about the film. And yes, I expect Rush to get a best picture Oscar nomination.",

It's a curious and unanswerable question when one is to ask why Rush was so overlooked, but it's also not hard to see why the film was perhaps just merely forgotten about.Rush is a film that from a production stand point would be graded in the highest order yet there is an element amiss in the film that stops it from being an emotional movie, a movie that transcends whatever scene it is set in and gets viewers to appreciate it on a whole different wave length. The sound editing, visual effects, stunts and Anthony Dod Mantle's at times ground breaking and stunning cinematography (after this effort and his work on films such as 127 Hours and Dredd 3D Mantle is quickly establishing himself as one of the best in the DOP game) in Rush are without question A grade efforts but Howard has somehow miss\u2013stepped when concentrating on the lives of these two different and amazingly driven men.In one of his first lead roles outside of the Marvel universe Hemsworth as playboy James Hunt is a solid presence in the film but one can't help but feel it's pretty much Thor in a fast car and therefore not much of a stretch of his acting ability. Daniel Bruhl as the much more stoic and professional of the two racers Niki Lauda does a fine job of portraying a man that at times is extremely hard to care for and that's where the film becomes an enjoyable one not a classic. These two true life men lead undeniably interesting lives and the focus of the events in the film are at times edge of your set moments but to transcend a film to another level (and get those Oscar nominations) you need to have people that no matter how vile or arrogant they get they still draw your feelings out, and James and Niki sadly just don't have that.A never dull and visually impressive piece of movie entertainment Rush is another fine entry into the increasingly broad film catalogue of director Ron Howard who is one of the most consistent and interesting directors working today. Rush is also a film that could have been so much more but as it stands is a thoroughly entertaining and enjoyable night in with a movie, just don't expect to be thinking about it in the days following.3 and a half lung cleanouts out of 5 For more movie reviews and opinions check out - www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com",

The two main stars are making a good work with their characters, especially as the film gets to the accident, when the characters must overcome their superficial status that they had for the first part of the movie and focus on the emotions and how deep actually their rivalry goes.

I wasn't even around in the 1970's so I probably couldn't have picked him, or Lauda, from a line up, but as with a lot of Chris Hemsworth films that I've watched lately, I haven't seen much diversity from him and wasn't keen on his British 'Thor' (2011) impression. As much as he annoys me now though, I still don't understand why anyone would leave Chris (Hunt) for Richard Burton, especially with that non CGI'd butt, which was very cute.James Bruhl (Lauda) was alright too, but also very much like his Marvel character, Baron Zemo.I personally preferred 'Le Mans '66' (2019), because there was too much machismo in this one. Their testosterone was almost flying across the screen. 'LM66' also seemed to be better acted and directed too, although this film did have a cracking supporting cast of actors. They didn't feel appropriately used however and because a lot of them were comedians from the small screen, there was an air of humour about the whole thing.This one didn't grip me as much either. I'm not sure I felt the tension and I wasn't really behind either of the lead characters to win any of their races. Neither personality was shown favourably.At least I wanted Christian Bale to do well as Ken Miles in 'LM66', despite his brusque character and his reputed off screen demeanour.There were also some medical moments that I really didn't need to see. Anyone with squeamish tendencies would do well to avoid this one.As a racing film, I'm sure that this would appeal to those that follow the sport and perhaps those that remember the events portrayed in particular and while it was all delivered well enough, it just didn't have that extra element that would have made it special for me. As a middle of the road biopic, the story didn't really have enough interest on its own. Maybe if I'd seen this film before 'LM66' I might have preferred it, but I don't think so. Perhaps it just didn't deliver the drama effectively enough for my tastes?606.02/1000.",

I was worried at first that this would be another typical macho sport-racing film, but I am glad that I was proved wrong, the story of the rivalry between James Hunt and Nikki Lauda had my eyes glued to the screen. To me, the movie is perfect all around, some might complain of the pace, but to me I didn't see it as a problem. This film is directed by the amazing Ron Howard, and this will go down as one of his best films right up there with Apollo 13 and Beautiful Mind. With him on the journey is Anthony Dod Mantle who gives the film beautiful visuals with the perfect light, Peter Morgan gives us grade A writing, and Hans Zimmer gives us a masterful yet subtle score that comes in at all the right moments.The acting is nothing to complain about either, Chris Hemsworth gives us a character that we can both love and loathe, Daniel Bruhl gives the best performance as the tragic Nikki Lauda who is also the narrator of the film, he also gives us a performance that is both likable and unlikable. The scenes with his wife were amazingly well acted which leads me to the supporting female characters, the wives of Lauda and Hunt played by Olivia Wilde and Alexandra Maria Lara. Both are beautiful eye candy and both add their talents amazingly to the film.Watch out for this to be a favorite around awards season, it has the capability to be nominated in a handful of categories (Picture, Director, Supporting Actor for Daniel Bruhl, Cinematography, Score, Editing, and Sound Categories). The Academy has always loved Ron Howard and I feel that they will nominate this amazing film, and in my opinion it deserves every nomination, it is that good!My grade for Rush: A",

            "content": "Although the world of this film is, one might say, rather trivial - racing serves very little purpose any more, other than diversion for fans and advertising for sponsors, this was absolutely not the case during the heyday of the sport, the 1960s through 1980s, when dramatic improvement in automotive technology emerged from racing and found its way into the family sedan. Many drivers paid for these improvements with their lives. So in a sense, the background of this film is not only serious, it is deadly serious.But the real depth of the film comes from its exploration of the age-old polarity between the Dionysian (Hunt) and the Apollonian (Lauda), and the well-lived life to be found somewhere in the balance between the two. Hunt and Lauda together make up a complete person. Each was incomplete without the other. And it is a very fascinating exploration of this idea, because it does not call attention to itself.I find this to be one of Ron Howard's very best efforts. I was glued to the screen and leaning on the rewind button. I was once a great fan of all racing - not so much today, in light of global warming and the necessity of retiring the internal combustion gasoline/diesel engine. It was pleasant to have my old hairs stand on end again. I think it makes a wonderful pair with \"Ford vs. Ferrari\", which has some of the same elements. Neither film can be compared to the classic, objective but melodramatic racing films, such as John Frankenheimer's \"Grand Prix\". This film is not really about racing as a sport - it is about living a useful life. Both films in a sense end in tragedy for all the participants - the loss of a dear friend, the untimely death of a beloved figure, the battle scars which never really heal. Be careful what you wish for, because you might just get it.",

A poll suggesting it should have gotten some award buzz and a rating of over 8, I was expecting good old fashioned story telling. captivating character development. Something classic. Instead I got a really great Sunday night movie. One reviewer said \"captivating story of two world renowned people\", but I never heard of them before \"Rush\". Sure, F1 was, and is, not part of my life but at the end of the day this is a film. Regardless of knowing the characters a film should make one want to get to know them, and admittedly the characters were not captivating enough which was by no means a lack in acting skill. Rather, struggled drawing interest out of a famous driver that a non-F1 fan could relate to. Maybe the problem is that Niki is far more interesting than James Hunt? Nonetheless, to spite my lack of connection to the characters the film was well worth the watch. The cinematography was at times so avant-garde in the sense that I was hating it, then loving it, then hating, then loving - so I appreciate it, and respect it which is far more superior to just loving it.The acting was on point - to spite the lack of interest, i mean the characters weren't interesting enough to google anything about them that the film didn't tell me. The music was good, not too memorable nor distracting so fair in its delivery.The locations were nicely covered and the production design was (especially in the pits) well realised in terms of the fact that its a period drama. \"Rush\" cannot be faulted in its entirety, my expectations was the disappointment.",

            "content": "'Rush' is the true story of the legendary rivalry between Formula-1 drivers James Hunt and Niki Lauda. This film takes place over the course of about five years, highlighting the most important time in these men's lives.1. Ron Howard truly is a master of his craft (and has raced his way to the top of my 'favorite film directors' list) as he succeeds massively with this biopic of the decade. He captures the sheer intensity of what and how dangerous the world of Formula-1 racing can be by putting the audience in the driver's seat. 'Rush' is a prime example that proves just how utterly ridiculous the 'Fast & Furious' films are by grounding itself in the harsh reality and challenges faceb by both Lauda and Hunt.2. Apart from the incredible cinematography and spectacular racing sequences, the real force behind this film are the performances. Hemsworth and Bruhl lead the pack with the latter being the more outstanding. Daniel Bruhl is spectacular with his spot-on portrayal as Niki Lauda, from the accent to his mannerisms, Bruhl deserved an Oscar nomination for this particular performance. Hemsworth on the other hand does prove that he has acting chops when it comes to dramatic roles in his portrayal as James Hunt. The reason why Bruhl stands out more is due to how different Hunt and Lauda are, with him just being more of a driven character with his highly focused attitude.3. Olivia Wilde and Alexandra Maria Lara round out the cast as Hunt and Lauda's respective wives. They play important parts in the lives of these men within the years of them chasing the Formula-1 'World Title'. Their stories can seem crow-barred in but it's hard not to touch on some of the lighter events in the lives of these men. The transitions between the love stories is my only nit-pick of this film (only by reflection), but it's hard to find many flaws when the movie speeds past such things with perfect editing.Next to 'A Beautiful Mind', 'Rush' is (without a doubt) Ron Howard's best film to date, and in years to come, could very well be considered a classic. Powerful, moving and outstanding, 'Rush' delivers an incredible cinematic experience, no matter if you see it on the big or small screen.\"The closer you are to death, the more alive you feel;)\"",

            "content": "Rush is such a pleasant surprise! I have never much cared about Ron Howard's intent and style as film director, yet admire his ability to zero into what sells now - whenever now is - in Movieland. His populist touch once made me thoroughly dislike A Beautiful Mind (2001), a film that has everything in it for me to love and was deluged with awards. Cryptography, mental illness and Russell Crowe as John Nash seemed a perfect match, but a tendency to ease the audience's experience by spelling out the future drove me away. That tendency still exists. In less subtle territories such as Apollo 13 (1995), Ron Howard really does himself justice. And in Rush where sports history serves as guide, kudos to him for straying from philosophical considerations and going for pulsating material, hand-held camera first.Formula 1, a compelling rivalry, 70's glamour and serious speed with Thor/Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Br\u00fchl at the wheels cannot fail. In principle, that's what Rush is. However, in the hands of Peter Morgan who wrote The Queen and the adapted screenplay for The Last King of Scotland, something incredible happens: the perfect Saturday date night movie scripted as if the author personally knew James Hunt and Niki Lauda when they put everything on the line in 1976.Rush is the closest most of us will ever come to driving a Formula 1 race-car. It excels at giving the audience a genuine sense of the speed such finely engineered machines generate and the relative lack of protection they offer. The polarity of James Hunt's gregarious rock 'n' roll persona played by a charismatic Chris Hemsworth with Br\u00fchl's technically brilliant but emotionally remote Niki Lauda, eventually feels more like a duality. Both these extreme athletes from before the X Games era may have had more in common than they probably ever acknowledged. In 2013, they are revisited by two actors who for disappearing into their respective roles could find themselves sharing centre stage with Ron Howard and Peter Morgan in March 2014. I would not be surprised for Julian Day's costume design to receive an Academy Award nomination too. Frida Giannini's period-evoking looks for Chris Hemsworth and Olivia Wilde (Suzy Miller) are so in tune to the glamour of the times they represent, they are desirable now. Rush is a beautiful movie to watch and Gucci can expect a stampede for several bespoke items. I wish product placement was always this subtle!Like the absorbing Senna (2010) by Asif Kapadia, Rush does not require in-depth Formula 1 knowledge. One is a meticulously crafted audiovisual memoir in documentary form and the other is a cool action flick for a cosy night spent in good company. The journey starts with Rush.",

There was however a technical issue with the crazy editing, which left me dizzy and confused about what some perceive as action versus razzle dazzle. In essence, the film explores what the world of car racing offers anyone who participates of its thrills. As the audience, we are witnesses to the speed, the car designs, the sudden arrival of tragedy. The film goes in deeper and looks at how the drivers become enamored of the rush, and what what would be the ultimate goal.There are two young man who challenge each other to be the best. Each has his own personal agenda and constantly tries to do outdo the other, sometimes, defying family and conventions. It is easy to admire one but not quite like him. It is fascinating how the other can throw a spell on us in minutes. Once they are behind the wheel, they are not that different from each other. They both mortal and vulnerable and liable to have each race be their last. One scene in particular shows a fan being honest as he request that an autograph be signed, just in case...There are emotional moments in the movie, as one of the stars is involved in a fiery crash which could mean the end of his career, and this experience is an epiphany for both leads, as one discovers his own strengths and the other, for a moment, steps back and recognizes the best in both. In the end, both learn to appreciate what is really important, and the final race of the movie is a testament to both courage and stupidity because there is no other reason to have that to placate people's greed and morbid instincts.It is a pity this film shows up the same week \"Prisoners\" come out which shows a heart stopping race to a hospital in a crucial scene of the movie. The editing there is superb, where in \"Rush\", we rarely get more than three seconds of the camera focusing on the intense moments we are supposed to witness. Thank God for the actors, the costume design, and the technical aspects here. It is a faithful depiction of the world of the 70's, its decadent culture, and the world of racing. Unfortunately it is presented as if we were in the middle of a twister because it is hard to stay focused on an object, a person, or catch that rush that should be an essential part of this experience.",

            "content": "Ron Howard has a thing for movies based on true stories (see Apollo 13, Frost/Nixon and A Beautiful Mind), but none has been quite as high- octane as Rush, which has a very different feel from his previous work. I'm not saying that's a bad thing. After all, Howard is arguably one of the most consistent directors working today as far as quality goes, and Rush is a high-quality film. However, it feels like it's lost somewhere between a drama and an action movie. There are a lot of scenes representing both genres, but the two somehow seem out of sync. Something holds Rush back from being a truly great film.Being that it's Ron Howard in the director's chair, I had high expectations for the movie, especially because it stars Thor himself, Chris Hemsworth, who is quickly becoming a household name and is deserving of a role in which he can flex his acting muscles rather than his biceps. For the most part, he does a convincing job as Formula 1 driver James Hunt. This is probably because he has Daniel Br\u00fchl to work with as his arch rival, Niki Lauda, who shares tremendous chemistry with Hemsworth. And yet, the two are comically different from each other. Hunt is the playboy, partying it up and living each day to the fullest, while Lauda is cold and calculating, as finely tuned as the machines he drives. Really, it would have been next to impossible for these two not to be rivals, and indeed that's the focus of Rush.The film takes a firm look at what it takes to be a champion and, more importantly, the cost that such a drive can have on a man. The best example is the brutal car crash Lauda experiences mid-season, from which he miraculously recovered in order to return and finish the last of the races that year. While Niki's cost was more physical, James has quite an emotionally driven journey as well, as he literally destroys his life in pursuit of that championship title. Really, it's as though the two drivers represent different aspects of one person, and the movie represents the personal tragedy from which all great tales are built.Visually speaking, this is Ron Howard's most unique film to date. It's a lot more visceral than his previous films, with sex scenes and even a few stomach-churning wrecks (Niki Lauda suffers horrifying injuries as a result of his crash). It's also a lot bolder than his previous works. Howard adopts a style meant to mirror the high-adrenaline lifestyle that these two men enjoy, with plenty of slow motion and tight editing. With all this, though, I have to ask: \"Why does it feel so slow at certain parts?\" I'm not normally the type of guy who shrugs off a movie's story, but I couldn't help feeling impatient waiting for the dialogue to end and the racing to begin. This is one reason I don't feel like Rush was a truly great film.I'm not saying that it's a bad film, though; quite the contrary, Rush is a very good movie, and probably one of the best racing movies ever made. It pretty much gives the audience everything they expect, and in some cases even more (props to Hemsworth for being so much more that a pretty face). I'm almost positive that it will pop up for some sort of award during the Oscars. For me, though, the film never really shifts into high gear. It doesn't cross that line into greatness, and I'm pretty sure I wont remember much about it when 2014 rolls around. That doesn't mean that it isn't worth seeing, though, and I would actually highly recommend it. After all, it's a very human tale, and it's one about which I can imagine everyone finding something to enjoy. It's just not something that echos with the viewer after the end credits.",

Let me start by saying that I have limited F1 knowledge, and the guests I brought to the first pre-screening had zero racing knowledge. That being said, we honestly didn't expect to really enjoy the movie - to us, it was just a free movie. Let me tell you though, we all came out of the theater and just said, \"wow\".The movie has racing scenes, yes, but the movie is not a racing movie. Racing fans will appreciate the mild technicality of the F1 scenes, but EVERYONE will love the meaningful message and themes that Ron Howard successfully portrays through these two characters.I wasn't fully familiar with the Hunt-Lauda rivalry prior to the movie, but even if I was, I really think this movie is a fresh new look at these two important F1 figures and their interaction with each other. The casting was just spot on and you can just see a glimpse of that if you ever watch live interviews of the characters after seeing the movie (which I did, admittedly).So, I saw it again. I got to really focus on the background scenes and the beautiful cinematography the second time around. It's really just a well crafted movie, and you need to go see it. Don't let the F1-ness of the movie turn you off. I almost let it, but I'm glad I went. Bravo to Howard, Hemsworth, Bruhl and the rest of the cast!",

It's simply proof that a good story/movie can exist in any genre or subject. Though I think even the most distant auto racing fans will find Howard's race sequences exhilarating, they're not the focus of the movie nor what makes it great. It's a character story examining the racers and they're rivalry. Daniel Bruhl's portrayal as such a fascinating (and likable) character Lauda is what drives this film but Hemsworth's Hunt is the perfect contrast to him. Just as in real life the absolutely contrasting figures elevate and play off each other beautifully in what made great races and a great film. From Howard, Morgan through Bruhl, Hemsworth, Zimmer and many more, Rush is excellence.",

            "content": "Rush is written by Peter Morgan and directed by Ron Howard. With the film focusing both on James Hunt and Niki Lauda, played brilliantly by Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Br\u00fchl. We get to see rivalry unfold in a nice way with some phenomenal direction, editing, cinematography, sound editing and musical score.James Hunt, and his methodical, brilliant opponent, Austrian driver Niki Lauda. The story follows their distinctly-different personal styles on and off the track, their loves, and the astonishing 1976 season in which both drivers were willing to risk everything to become world champion in a sport with no margin for error: if you make a mistake, you die.So I walked into the film with little to no knowledge of the events or the people it's about, but I did read a couple of things about the rivalry and Formula One drivers. The film took a lot of liberty and exaggerated a lot, it didn't bother me very much though, but for the people who are interested in motor sports I can easily see why the exaggeration can be a bit of off putting. But the movie is fantastic, from the screenplay to the direction, everything is perfect and the two lead actors impressed me with their acting performances. The film is gripping, dramatic and entertaining. Rush is a biopic worthy of your time with or without any interest in motor sports. Ford v Ferrari is in my opinion better, but Rush is superb in so many ways. The pacing is great and it never slows down, keeping you both engaged and entertained during every minute, every second. The real Niki Lauda claims the film was entirely accurate. However, the film took creative liberties of the James Hunt and Lauda rivalry but it should be noted that Niki Lauda was a big fan of the film and he thought James Hunt would too. Though I liked Hemsworth's performance as Hunt, I think Daniel Br\u00fchl's transformation and the overall performance was one of his best, both of them did justice to the events and real people, it's what's most important with a film like this, honoring the people.",

Those race sequences are just amazing and lifelike and dialogs are sharp and succinct. Cinematography puts you in the driver seat and Bruhl as Lauda and Hemsworth as Hunt are chalk and cheese. Hemsworth's roguish, play boyish, devil may care attitude provides the perfect antithesis to Bruhl's composed, demure persona. Ron Howard has pulled all the right strings to make this movie an epic, just as the rivalry between Lauda and Hunt. This is a must watch for any F1 fan. P.s:- I almost forgot Coimbatore is the hometown of the only F1 driver to represent India and that's whom we(me and Nithin Pbv) exactly ran into.

Their opposite approaches to winning makes for a fascinating rivalry and pulls you in where you actually care for both drivers and you respect them equally for different reasons. Both drivers have their own strengths and weaknesses, but they share a wicked competitive spirit that tests them to the edge of their lives.Aside from excellent character development, the sights and sounds of both the cars and the era are convincingly captured.

            "content": "Ron Howard's \"Rush\" tells the true story of the rivalry between Formula One drivers James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) & Niki Lauda (Daniel Br\u00fchl). Focusing mainly on the extraordinary 1976 season, the film shows both their fierce competitiveness on the track and their struggles off of it. In a sport that could turn deadly at any minute, the stakes are high throughout the entire movie.The lead actors are two of the film's biggest assets. Chris Hemsworth is ostensibly the star of the film, effortlessly playing the flamboyant but reckless Englishman James Hunt; however, Daniel Br\u00fchl's portrayal of the cool & calculating Austrian Niki Lauda practically stole the show, resulting in Golden Globe & BAFTA nominations. Ultimately, though, much of the film's success depends on the opposing styles of these two actors and their interplay with one another, so both of them are deserving of praise. The supporting cast is mostly made up of lesser known (but by no means untalented) actors, with the notable exception of Olivia Wilde as Hunt's love interest.Ron Howard's direction is as sure-handed as ever. The main characters come to vivid life in the dramatic scenes and, as a result, we're riveted whenever an adrenaline-pumping race scene rolls around. Speaking of the race scenes, Howard and cinematographer Anthony Dod Mantle came up with some novel angles to keep the action fresh. On the audio front, the sound design is impressive while the Hans Zimmer score provides another crucial (though largely unheralded) element.In the end, though, despite quality acting and technical prowess, the strength of the movie arguably resides mostly in its gripping storyline. If you're aren't already familiar with the incredible true story of the 1976 F1 season, I'd recommend knowing as little as possible going into this movie. It's one of those stories that was just crying out to be filmed and, thankfully, Ron Howard and company did justice to it.",

            "content": "There's always an interesting story to be told, and with directors like Ron Howard, the mastermind behind the Academy Award-winning 'A Beautiful Mind', working behind the camera to bring these compelling tales to life; a powerful biopic supplemented with solid craftsmanship and stellar performances can only be expected. To all justice, Howard gracefully accomplishes this feat. Howard's telling of the historical events of the fierce competition between two Formula One racers comes off as a compelling thrill ride that not only feels original rather than your average sports underdog story, but also boasts plenty of substance as well as some graceful performances by its two likable leads including Chris Hemsworth of 'Thor' and Daniel Bruhl of 'Inglourious Basterds'. Set in the 1970s, this film tells the story of the rivalry between James Hunt (played by Chris Hemsworth), a handsome English Former One driver, and Niki Lauda (played by Daniel Bruhl), a methodical Austrian Formula One driver. WIth both men desperate of earning the championship title on the Grand Prix tracks, Hunt and Lauda go to great measures to outdo each other on and off the tracks in a fierce competition that threatens to not only hit the brakes on their careers, but destroy their own personal beings.This Ron Howard biopic is not an extraordinary picture, at least on the level of his magnum opus 'A Beautiful Mind'; but there is no doubt Howard sparks honest ambition in his translation of the compelling story of the legendary race car drivers James Hunt and Niki Lauda to the silver screen. Teaming up with the fine director is Peter Morgan (previous collaborator with Howard in 'Frost/Nixon') who breathes strong energy in the story with his screenplay. As the beautifully crafted plot sprawls through the friction between the two lead characters, we are introduced the complexities that define who these two are and builds up their labyrinthine relationship. Neither of them come as heroes as they both demonstrate flaws that conflict with not only each other but also themselves and their loved ones, one of which is thinly demonstrated in James Hunt's unrest relationship with his wife Suzy Miller (played by Olivia Wilde). Arguably the biggest irony that comes between their rivalry is the respect the two eventually gain for each other towards the final stretch, especially after one of them is involved in a horrible accident; and Ron Howard makes solid effort on illustrating this without executing it in a way that feels contrived. Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Bruhl are both phenomenal in their roles, and the performances they are the driving source of the film's emotional resonance. And lets not forget the slickly edited racing sequences which provide the thrills and exhilaration, though one of them take place in the rain which ends in not-too-pretty results.Rush is superbly crafted blessed with an outstanding execution by director Ron Howard and screenwriter Peter Morgan, and demonstrates an incredible deliverance of powerhouse performances by Hemsworth and Bruhl. This is brilliantly crafted film that does not require the viewers to be fans of Formula One Racing(or any motor sports for that matter) to appreciate. Overall, this film certainly delivers what it needs to.",

            "content": "It's my firm belief that if you have to start a movie in medias res and go back to the beginning, then your original beginning isn't strong enough. This holds true in Ron Howard's latest film about F1 racing legends, the Maverick Brit James Hunt and his prickly Austrian rival Niki Lauda, where the movie opens at a critical moment only to immediately go back in time to recap. Ron Howard knows how to create drama, pace and suspense perfectly but there seemed to lack a cohesive narrative thread that would have made Rush outstanding.What I liked: The movie is as slick as a race car and the racing scenes are wonderfully executed, especially when there is poor weather conditions. The movie is certainly entertaining. The characters and relationships however are underdeveloped and, frankly, a little wasted; except for Daniel Bruehl who plays Niki Lauda and adds all the heart and soul to this film. He is brilliant and seemingly reaches beyond the written character, if I am to compare him to Chris Hemsworth's less dynamic portrayal. Somehow, while Hemsworth is convincing his character, ironically, lacks the charm to carry the emotion of each short scene, whereas Bruehl's Lauda grows on us and stays with us. The best moments of the film come late when we come to respect the rivalry as they do. I enjoyed that there is no definitive hero and both characters make for a series of well captured scenes but\u0085What I didn't like: The film unfolds like a feast of tasty appetizers that never settles into a meal. The story is interesting and there are well-executed moments of real connection and emotion but they never last long enough or fit properly to create a fluid whole. The camera-work by Anthony Dod Mantle was electric and worked very well in some seems but, again, seemed to piece together different moods or ideas that contributed my overall sense of disharmony.My rating: Wishing for an Oscar nod for Daniel Br\u00fchl.http://canyoutellastory.wordpress.com/",

I can't even drive, but the dialogue in this film is how race car drivers explain racing, from too fast in the corners, to rain on the track, to the grip on the tires. It's ironic that Lauda wanted to boycott the race he was hurt in. And I like how the film shows the way the right kind of adversity makes people better at what they do. The dark clouds covering the sun seem so literary I don't know how I feel about them in a film, but it was a good way to show the dread involved. I think the film could've been longer. I saw an interview with Ron Howard where he said it was hard to get it down to two hours, and I wish he'd made this three hours or so. It felt like a sample tray of these two men's lives.

This is one of those movies that are made for the big screen too, I highly recommend that you see it in theaters if you get the chance.The film is severely under-valued to have made as few box office sales as it did. I went on a Friday night, the night it was released, and the theater was only about 10% occupied. It's a shame that people flock to crap like Harry Potter, Twilight, Transformers, etc. and don't but nearly as much emphasis on truly well rounded films like Rush.",

            "content": "Every sport has its memorable rivalries. Boxing has Ali vs. Frazier. Baseball has New York vs. Boston. And in the world of Formula 1 racing, for at least one year, there was James Hunt vs. Niki Lauda, and that is the story told in Ron Howard's Rush. And I got to tell you, I loved every bit of it.The last Ron Howard film that I actually liked was 2005's Cinderella Man, which is also a sports film. In Rush, Howard takes a well-crafted script from Peter Morgan (The Queen, Frost/Nixon) and makes a film that is more like a shot of pure adrenaline.The film takes back to the early 70's when the hard-partying, aggressive driving Brit James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) and the calculating, somewhat arrogant Austrian Niki Lauda (Daniel Br\u00fchl). Hunt is what race car drivers were stereotyped as back then. He sleeps with all the hot girls, he drives with a left foot, and he looks more like a rock star than a driver. Lauda was a perfectionist who viewed racing as a business and preferred working on his car in the garage over smooth talking business people at parties.As the film progresses, we learn about Hunt and Lauda separately. They rarely share screen time and when they do, they make it clear that they don't like each other. But they have similar backgrounds. They both came from money, their respective fathers wanted them to go into the family business, but they decided not to and worked their ways up to the big time. Hunt will stop at nothing to win, literally. I don't think he knows where the brake is. Lauda, on the other hand is aware of the dangers of the sport. He knows that every time he's out on the track, there is a 20% chance he won't make it.Hemsworth shows us that he can do more on screen than just throw a hammer around as his performance here as Hunt is great. He looks and sounds like the late, great racer. And Br\u00fchl's work as Lauda is nothing short of brilliant. They're nomination worthy pieces of acting that I consider two of the best performances of the year.Aside from the lead performances, there are a few worthy supporting performances of note. Olivia Wilde, in all her beauty, does great work as Suzy Miller, the British model who married hunt after the 1975 season, only to leave him a few months later for Richard Burton. Alexandra Maria Lara is terrific as Lauda's wife, Marlene. And Christian McKay, one of my favorite character actors working today, does fabulous work as Lord Alexander Hesketh; the owner of Hunt's first racing team who I wish had more screen time, because he doesn't show up at all in the entire second half of the film.Howard proves once again that he can make good movies after the disaster that was The Dilemma, but, despite the great performances, Rush, like the people it is about, is absolutely gorgeous. The cinematography from Anthony Dod Mantle (Slumdog Millionaire) and the great Hans Zimmer's score form a deadly combination, the engines of the F1 cars sound incredible, and the hair and makeup people deserve recognition as well.Rush was one of the most exciting movie going experiences I've ever had. Terrific performances, pitch perfect direction, outstanding music selection (even Gimme Some Lovin'), and everything else come together to make this movie a memorable one. This is one of the best sports movies I've ever seen, and I've seen a lot of them. See Rush, you'll be glad you did.FILM GRADE: A",

            "content": "Recently getting into Formula One back in 2010, I found the historical aspect of F1 back in the 1970's. Before this movie I had no idea what happened and I had no knowledge of James Hunt or Niki Lauda. After this movie I couldn't wait for it to come out on iTunes so I could watch it all the time. I have watched it 6 times since I got it last week and I recommend this movie to the fullest. Greatest movie of 2013, Ron Howard did amazing.SPOILER (Summary):So it starts off with Niki Lauda (Bruhl), waiting in his car for the start of the German Grand Prix in 1976. He then flashbacks six years when he and James Hunt (Hemsworth) first met and their rivalry started back in Formula 3. Lauda bought his way into F1 with a bank loan and Hunt worked his way in by racing in the lower series longer. In 1976, Hunt signed for McLaren after Emerson Fittipaldi left the team. Hunt stated that the number one thing on his list of priorities was to beat Niki Lauda. The first 5 races of the 1976 saw the two battle on and off. At Spain, Hunt wins the race but Lauda gets his team, Ferrari, to make a claim that Hunt's car was illegal. The officials looked at it and deemed it illegal and was disqualified. The McLaren team began to adjust the car but it turned out to be \"a big, stinking turd\" in Hunt's own words.The penalty that led to Hunt begin disqualified in Spain was overturned after a series of appeals by the McLaren team. Leading back into the 1976 German Grand Prix, Lauda thought the weather at the circuit was too dangerous to drive at and called a drivers meeting to petition the race, but in the end, he and the drivers decided to race. After one lap on the rain tires, a majority of the field made pit stops to change on to the option tires. Lauda falling behind tried to make up time on Hunt who was far ahead. While pushing his car to the limit, his car broke part of his suspension and crashed into the barrier, resulting in near fatal injuries.After recovering from his injuries, he would lead the points going into the final race in Japan. Again, the rain was torrential, but this time Lauda retired after the second lap and handed the title to Hunt.",

The two personalities are a contrast between the disciplined, serious Lauda and the partying, fun-loving Hunt. The film-making was spectacular as it showed the view behind the wheel as cars race at terrifying speed. In one event, won by a Hunt, Lauda literally crashed and burned, resulting in serious lung damage and permanent scarring. (Lauda opposed holding the event because of the poor race conditions but entered against his better judgement.) Later, he returned to show his unyielding drive as he continued to compete and win. Both became world champions and beat one another in fiercely contested races. What stays with the viewer is the image of two highly driven young men whose rivalry brings out the best in each other as they mature and come to respect one another. They are not only great racing drivers but become men of character. Once again, director Ron Howard has created a movie that speaks to the heart with this great addition to his many directing achievements.",

            "review_title": "'Rush' is a solid film with two brilliant performances from Hemsworth and Lauda.",
            "content": "There's no doubt that Ron Howard can make great films. His movies have won numerous awards and have starred some of the biggest names in the business at one point or another. That said, with only a few exceptions such as 'Apollo 13\u2032 or 'Parenthood', most of his movies tend to be forgettable after the first year or so and begin to collect dust in people's movie collections. Unfortunately, that's also the case with 'Rush'. People may love it at first, but I doubt that anybody will mention it next year.Much like Howard's first film as director, 1977's 'Grand Theft Auto', 'Rush' is a race car movie. However, instead of focusing on the races, this one hones in on the two main characters and their transformations at the height of their careers.The film tells the true story of the rivalry between Formula One champions James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) and Niki Lauda (Daniel Bruhl) in the 1970s. The incredibly handsome Hunt leads a playboy lifestyle and is not above drinking, doing drugs or having sex with multiple women right before a big race. He takes dangerous risks and is a superb driver, which leads him to win quite a bit. On the other hand, Lauda comes from a very wealthy Austrian family that has disowned him for going into racing. He's the complete opposite of Hunt, and is only concerned with winning and working 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. He has no time for friends, love or parties.Naturally, these two collide in more than one way and actively dislike one another. However, each respects the other's amazing skill in driving. After several races, Lauda is severely injured in a crash on the track and receives major burns to his leg and face, after which Hunt indirectly helps him return to racing in under two months.Howard's camera follows these two daredevils through their successes and failures. We forge bonds and gain respect for both, even despite their faults. Bruhl is phenomenal as Lauda. People used to call the real Lauda a rat because he had bucked teeth and mousy face, and acted like a rude prick most of the time. Nevertheless, when Lauda recovers in the hospital, Bruhl gives an exceptional performance. As the doctors vacuum out his lungs with a long pole, or when Lauda tries to put his helmet on over his newly burned face, the actor makes us feel the character's pain.Of course, Hemsworth is the Thor-like god we expect him to be. He's deeply charismatic, funny and devastatingly handsome, but there's real pain behind all the charm and beauty when his widely publicized marriage doesn't work out and his friends turn on him. One of my favorite scenes comes when Hunt brutally and deservedly attacks a member of the press for asking Lauda how his wife can look at his ugly face now that he's burned.'Rush' is a solid film with two brilliant performances from Hemsworth and Lauda. It's worth the price of a movie tick and I expect decent returns at the box office, but it rarely feels fresh and the racing scenes aren't particularly suspenseful.",

            "content": "Captivating, breathtaking, beautiful. This is how I would describe Howard's latest project, \"Rush\", a movie which tells you about the passion of sports as much as it tells you about life and death.Set in the 70's, the movie explores the real life events of the legendary rivalry of James Hunt and Niki Lauda. An English playboy and an Austrian professional, respectively, these two men with direct contrast in their lives and views had one thing in common: their passion for racing. Their explosive competitive nature begins when they meet in a Formula 3 match in 1970 and culminates on the World Grand Prix of 1976. During the course of those six years, they both learn what it is to live your life and cheat death, while looking it straight in the eye, as they set their lives aside to take a risk in what is one of the most dangerous sports. Emotionally, this film is one that you will hold your breath for more times than one.The cinematography is compact and panoramic, and it grabs every aspect of the racing track and its components seamlessly. From the moment the credits disappear, you are transferred back into the 70's, from the vintage cars of the era to the colours of each detail. The music is fitting, and when you find yourself losing tiny details, it draws you back to place, and your focus is once again at its peak. Chris Hemsworth (Thor, Star Trek: Into Darkness), proves that he got the part thanks to more than his likeness to the real James Hunt. He fluctuates wonderfully between the passionate and fearless driver and the party animal who wants to live a good life. In comparison, Daniel Br\u00fchl (Inglorious Basterds) as Niki Lauda is icy, professional, ruled by rules in every aspect of his life. Wonderfully executed by Br\u00fchl, don't be surprised if you root for him in the end, especially after the race of Nurburgring in 1976.If you are a fan of F1 and this particular rivalry, this movie does it complete justice and it adds a bit of drama to carefully narrate a story that has been told amongst racing cycles for years. If, like me, are no interested in racing, you will still appreciate this movie for its sheer emotion, its beautiful story telling, its 70-esque settings and wonderful acting.Don't miss this movie. And don't be surprised if it ends up receiving some Academy Awards as well.",

If there's any justice, this film should triumph at the Oscars, and pick up more attendance/DVD revenue as a result.The movie looks like it cost far more to make than ~$40 million.I think Ron Howard made a master stroke in choosing the 70s F1 era to set his film, and picking the '76 Hunt v Lauda season as the main focus. The race scenes are so brilliantly done. Fantastic camera angles, in car shots, helmet cam shots etc. that really bring home what monstrous and dangerous beasts those 70's F1 cars were to drive. There's a touch of very well done CGI to make the vintage track scenes super realistic. The Nurburgring and Fuji rounds are brilliantly done.An appreciative shout out to all the owners of the vintage 70s F1 cars, who allowed them to be used in the making of this film.But it's not just about the cars and racing, it's also the very human story of two ultra rivals who disliked each other intensely, but needed each other to draw the best from themselves. Set during a time when F1 had more characters, or certainly a time when characters were ALLOWED to show their character!! But perhaps the most compelling human aspect to the story is just how the F1 drivers coped with the extreme danger, literally risking their bodies or lives to win. Lauda rationalized it, Hunt embraced it.Hunt and Lauda were a few years before I started to follow F1, so I can't comment to the absolute accuracy of the screenplay, but I'd guess it's pretty damn close. I do remember Hunt as a commentator with Murray Walker on the BBC though! Anyway, the acting performances all round are superb. Bravo. The costumes are awesome, who says the 70's weren't cool? I walked away from the cinema awestruck!! Some more like this please Ron Howard!",

The racetrack scenes showing the rain pouring down makes you feel something out of The Lord of the Rings. Now, the story line and driver rivalry seemed a bit average and not necessary entertaining.

But the real star is Daniel Bruhl, who has the meatiest role as the forthright, stubborn, super-confident, ultra cool rival Austrian driver Niki Lauda. Director Ron Howard has a tough task, balancing the need to satisfy motor sport fans' need to see all that sweaty racing up on the big screen. But Howard also tries to portray real life events and people in a faithful and meaningful way, while keeping the scenes coming at a cracking pace. And he does a great job. The script is excellent. Apparently the writer dined with Lauda 30 times, and won his trust, and so the movie is filled with little details that make the characters seem human, as opposed to the two dimension, superhuman idols they could have been. It's really interesting to realise that Hunt and Lauda both rebelled against their families, and both had an almost insane desire to win. And the film also explores, very well, the extent to which both of them were willing to ignore the normal warning signs of extreme danger to their lives in exchange for fame and fortune. Hunt did it in driving in extremely wet conditions in the Japanese Grand Prix, and Lauda did it in the German track where he crashes and almost dies, and then, during his comeback, when he ignores the pain from his burn scars to get back into racing again. But as the film makes very obvious, to drive Formula One in the 1970s was very much to risk death. Everyone accepted it, and on any given day, either your number might come up and you die, or you win the race and get international praise and a big payment.",

His last movie \"Rush\" shines the light on the competition between James Blunt and Niki Lauda, both on the F1 circuit, and off the tracks.Howards manages to draw the interest of viewers, even of those who thinks that Formula 1 is a remain of the past, like safari, fur-coats and tobacco.The main actors are really good, and never once did I question their impersonations. Niki is described as a sensible, reflexive person ; whereas James Hunt is shown as childish, self-centered and sometimes toxic for his entourage.My only dislike is related to the direction of photography. The balance of colors, the composition, the choices of focal lengths, the vibration of the image to convey emotion (trembling hands, engine vibration, etc) ... I like none of those.But the story and acting saves it all.",

            "content": "Considering the unfortunately many poorly executed attempts at making racing inspired movies, my expectations of 'Rush' weren't all too high when I pressed the 'Play'-button on my DVD-player's remote control. I'm not familiar with Ron Howard's oeuvre, and with Chris Hemsworth being the only name on the cast that actually rang any bells, expectations from that side weren't very high either. I'm not saying that Hemsworth is a bad actor, but the movies I've seen him play in, weren't exactly my cup of tea.However, only a few minutes after the opening credits things started feeling right, very right. The movie, which tells the story of the legendary rivalry between F1 half-gods James Hunt and Niki Lauda, lends itself perfectly for a highly entertaining and interesting movie. Everything that Rush is. In terms of historical correctness there are a few things that aren't 100% correct, but these are minor and very few in numbers, but after all, this is a movie, not a documentary.The scenery is excellent, and features a very high attention to detail, especially concerning the race tracks and their respective environments. Also the cars used in the movie are spot on in terms of historical correctness, as well is the information concerning the actual races that took place back then. The director makes great use of historical footage from back then, such as television and radio broadcasts.The acting performances are superb, with special credit to both Hemsworth and Br\u00fchl, but also Alexandra Maria Lara gives stunning performance, especially when it comes to the emotional expressions that are probably spot on in terms of how a spouse of an actual race driver feels when he once again risks life and limb in pursuit of victory. The other actors and actresses showed great professionalism as well, and helped carry the movie to it's high quality status.Also the camera work is excellent. Nothing overly fancy or exaggerated bling bling, as I initially feared would be the case. On the contrary even, the director makes use of fairly standard filming techniques, but all catch the spirit of the movie, the characters and the actual races spot on. About the races : they are truly excellent, and brought to image in a way respectful to the day and age they took place in. The intensity of the duels is transmitted towards the viewer without the loss of even a single drop of sweat of the drivers faces. If I would have any complaint at all about the racing scenes in the movie then it is that there are too few of them, but then again, that's probably just the racing enthusiast and car nut inside of me that's speaking. For the movie itself the mix between high-action driving scenes and the more dramatic ones is near perfect, they support the depiction of the actual plot, which is the rivalry between two highly talented and competitive men in just the right amount.For those that aren't into cars or motor sports and that think this movie is nothing for them because of it's racing theme, don't fool yourselves. This is a great movie about the drama of two men in pursuit of their ultimate personal goal, and the effect this has on their respective surroundings. But it is also an excellent movie about mutual respect, braveness and chivalry as well as it is a respectful tribute to one of the most legendary pages in F1 history.My expectations were quite low before I started watching this movie, but they very quickly turned out to be totally mistaken. This is a truly great movie, and very well worth two hours of your life. Apart from that, as a car enthusiast, I am truly pleased to finally see a movie again that honors the love people like us have for these machines and the sport of racing them. It clearly shows that this movie was made by people who share this love and respect.Watch it, I promise you won't be disappointed.9/10",

I didn't know about the rivalry between JAMES HUNT and NIKI LAUDA in the '70s. And second thing is i didn't know its a Ron Howard movie. So i started watching the movie with an open mind. Thought, lets see what The Thor has in store for me. But boy i was wrong, so wrong. This is not some Chris Hemsworth show. The character played by Daniel Bruhl was incredible, and stronger than Chris Hemworth's one in some extent. From the get go this movie will suck you into the world of this two mad rivals. I thought, \"okay this is a movie about formula 1, but in the end the hero will come out as a winner.\" Again... how wrong i was! Both characters are so strong and so well acted by Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Bruhl that you will be confused, which guy to root for. They have their own reasons for their battles. Its story of the rivals from their point of views. I assure you that, you will love this rivalry and there growth in the process with your heart in you hand. Hunt is a playboy and a hot headed driver, on the other hand Lauda is calculative and great in setting up car. This is really battle between Heart v Brain. Though they are arch enemies but they have a certain respect for each other. When James Hunt beats down a reporter for humiliating Niki Lauda, that will give you chill. And for those who love Olivia Wilde, GOOD NEWS! She looks hot in this movie too. And Ron Howard did a great job, he is a great director and he proved it once again. Music are sublime and the color effect he used is amazing. I will give RUSH a 9. Go watch it, its worth the money and time.",

            "content": "As a little girl, I actually wanted to be a race car driver. My step-dad watched every race in the 60s with Mario Andretti in it. But since those days, I haven't spent a lot of time watching racing as a sport. This film caught my eye because Howard directed it and Chris Hemsworth is in it. He reminds me of kind of a cross between Brad Pitt and Jan Michael Vincent from my era . The film was interesting and mostly engaging. But, overall, I feel knowing the story before hand on at least some level would make the film more enjoyable. I had only a vague knowledge of Lauda or Hunt and the film had uncomfortable tension for me that was probably unintended since I wasn't sure how many bad accidents to expect. It also wasn't clear what actually caused that horrific accident since the film intentionally seems to show the pit-stop crew being hurried beyond their ability and showed parts of the car from the undercarriage as if something was wrong. Perhaps it was saying no one really knows what caused the crash.As some have noted, this is not a racing film as there is scant racing shown. It's more about, as the write-up states, the rivalry between Lauda and Hunt, as well as respect for each other, and the personal highs and lows of their lives. It doesn't even bother to tell the viewer how much money was involved in each race although it does show some of the cars up close where the discussion centers around the car's ability etc. Definitely aimed at those more familiar with the sport and the highs and lows of it. One review says you might not want your kids to see this. No doubt - - it's rated R! But even if you don't mind your kids watching sexing, smoking, cussing, or violent crashes, I agree you should be concerned with the graphic close-ups of Lauda in the hospital after his near-fatal crash. It's a good film but not something just anyone can really enjoy or appreciate.",

The racing in the movie was captured beautifully, this was a dangerous time in auto racing, before Nomex, crumple zones and safety standards, and they did a great job with it. The relationship between Lauda and Hunt is also captured beautifully, a love/hate, but respectful relationship.

The cinema and storytelling make the audience feel the intensity and danger of every race.

Each character responds differently as they grapple with the peril of doing what they love. I didn't expect to enjoy this movie, but the true story of Niki Lauda and James Hunt, told with Howard's powerful realism and grit, was incredibly captivating. The racing scenes are beautifully filmed and framed with compelling character-driven storytelling. Be wanted, the R-rating results in some nudity and sex scenes, but if you are willing to fast forward or skip ahead, the rest of the film is worth it. I mean, Thor vs. Baron Zemo in race cars?

Yes, you get great shots from the drivers perspective, okay racing scenes, decent character development, but not your leave the theater in deep thought and feeling like I took something with me from the theater like mostly all Ron Howard films. I actually saved the ticked stub right after I purchased it as a kind of memento to say I saw this film in the theaters, maybe 20 years down the road, but I actually threw this stub away in major disappointment that I Just spent 11.50 for this movie. yes, the plot is there, and I understand its a true story between these 2 racers, but this should have made it even more excellent of a movie that Ron Howard takes on. I should have known when I saw three other companies that were part producers of this movie besides Imagine, that right there should of shown that Ron didn't have full say when it came down to certain decisions. Has Ron finally sold out for money, instead of great film. It seems that way, and I have lost a lot of respect from him from this film he just put out. I had a feeling since I haven't heard much about this movie from the word of mouth movie chatter that I normally pick up on, I thought maybe it was because everyone has broken bad and that is all there was to talk about, but I see now that I couldn't even be excited to start a conversation or be involved excitedly to discuss this movie with friends or family. I gave it 6 and that's pretty good just based on the okay visuals you get and how hard it is to shoot fast driving scenes. Say it ain't so Ron, is this what we should be expecting from here on out. What is with all the other partnering companies we saw with your Iconic IMAGINE company in the beginning of the film? Remember when we use to see just that one single IMAGINE logo before all of your other movies and there we knew we were in for a great one? Im not sure where these other band wagon companies came from but please just make sure your next movie is from IMAGINE alone or I can Imagine Ron Howard losing all his credibility for great movie making.",

Now enough with the silly jokes and puns, the movie progresses through with the introduction of Stephen Hunt with Niki Lauda appearing later on to rival him, severe tension arises between them along with their romantics events then slowly but surely the movie builds up to a ultimate series of events which begin crash down on us, I did say i'd stop with the puns right?Anyway I have to applaud the way the movie is compiled and how the ending is shown. Without spoiling anything I have to give credit to Peter Morgan/Ron Howard for their superb avoidance of portraying a jolly, joyful and friendly ending, instead they showed a mutual understanding between Hunt and Lauda, in which after doing my research was pretty accurate to what occurred in real life.Overall great movie, and yes, as the Summary Title says I can assure you an Oscar or two will be dealt out here, possibly Daniel Br\u00fchl and Chris Hemsworth will have a rivalry of their own for an Oscar?

The reality of the Hunt vs Lauda battle was a cracking story and I remember following it at the time, but most of the film left me cold - possibly because of a truly abysmal portrayal of James Hunt, but also the rather paltry amount of awfully CGI track action and the fact that every facet of the story was portrayed in a very naff stereotypical fashion. In fact were it not for a masterful performance by Daniel Br\u00fchl who really does capture some of the essence of Niki Lauda, I'd have probably scored the film a couple of points lower. I was hoping this would be a racing film that might finally outshine Grand Prix, instead, its really only slightly more watchable than Bobby Deerfield.",

If it wins an Oscar for something I'd expect it for the music first, then perhaps an acting nomination to Daniel Br\u00fchl (Niki Lauda) second.You do not need to be a formula 1 racing fan to enjoy this movie. I have never watched an F1 race in my life, nor even seen an F1 movie before this one. What makes the movie interesting is not the sport, but the main characters and their relationship with each other.It's a brilliantly acted rivalry between Niki Lauda (Br\u00fchl) and James Hunt (Hemsworth). Both turn in A+ performances. By far the best performance I've yet seen from Hemsworth. He proved to me, with this movie, that he's more than just an action star. However he is outshone by Br\u00fchl. The film succeeds in showing both the tough exterior and the still tough but different inside personality of Lauda. That's a major accomplishment for both the director and the actor.What makes Rush worth watching isn't the suspense of what is going to happen next. It's perhaps one of the most formulaic sports movies I've ever seen. It succeeds in spite of that. It's the depiction of the main characters, their rude exchanges, and their underlying respect for each other, that makes it worth the 2 hours.",

            "content": "So, here's the thing, I'm a bit of a movie brat. If the film isn't rated at least a 7+ here, I'm probably not wasting my time on it. There are of course exceptions to that rule, a Luc Beson action film, Asian gangster films with Donnie Yen, anything with Liam Neesom and so forth. But for the most part, I'm very picky.I finally had a chance to watch Ron Howard's Rush. I'm actually watching it right now. I actually had to stop watching to the movie because I just needed to rate it RIGHT NOW. Maybe I should see a doctor about that...Irregardless(Puff Puff Pass reference), Seeing an 8+ rating, I already expected it to be a good. I would have to decide for myself if it was great, and I certainly didn't expect it to be near flawless. As a director, Ron Howard has a way of not only capturing the detailed reality of events whether real (Apollo 13) or fictional (Ransom) but to also show deep character development through dramatic events and vivid cinematography. Rush fits into all of those perfectly. For any car/racing enthusiasts, this is as clear and realistic as a movie will get for some time, non of these fake Fast & Furious physics. For action buffs, the racing scenes rival the heart pumping fury of any Action film (maybe with the exception of The Raid, because that was craaazy!)For fans of detail and story, the movie seems accurate (as quick as I can wiki stuff) and well sculpted. Using something grand like F1 racing as a blanket, Howard shows the many true events and outcomes close-up that changed the lives of both drivers while the world watched them race from a distance. OK, so I waited to finish the film before giving my final rating, and without giving any details away, I would say nothing I wrote above has changed. This is on par with any directors masterpiece. I would not rate this an absolute 10, but it is certainly well over a 9, and given that IMDb does not use decimals, and given the fact that you can clearly see the effort put into this film, I will round up to 10.Cheers.Tig in SF",

I hadn't seen the trailer, I only knew that it was a film about F1 drivers, but I didn't know anything about the drivers or F1. From the first minutes of the film I was hooked. It's simply amazing.The director, Ron Howard, tells this story with a nonlinear narrative, which gives the audience (or at least me) more of an excitement for the characters, I wanted to know what caused the rivalry between these two men. The cinematography is superb in my opinion. The setting is magnificent, the cars, the locations. He does a great job representing the era, shows its ups and downs.As much as Ron Howard deserves a pat on the shoulder for the movie, the ones who made me feel sympathetic and excitement was the performance from the strong leading actors, Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Bruhl. Chris Hemsworth showed his impeccable talent and passion for acting, with the strong performance of James Hunt, nominations should be lining up for him. Daniel Bruhl also gave a strong performance of Niki Lauda, a unsociable rat (as said in the film). You don't have to be a great F1 fan to favor this film, as it isn't only a film about cars, but human nature, hatred, and love. The whole film is magnificent, the beginning, middle and ending. It's thrilling car scenes and magnificent directing and acting give the film such emotion and excitement that you feel as if only half an hour has past when the film finishes. A must watch film!!",

Niki Nationale has given Br\u00fchl his sanctus.On the same day, when Lauda crashed and burned in the Green Hell, in Vienna collapsed a famous bridge into the Danube. I was a five year old boy living in the suburbia of Vienna and honestly the bridge affected me more. The Death-Toll was one in Vienna, almost one in Germany. When Lauda realized that a priest was at his bed in the hospital, he mobilized all his mental power and came back from the valley of death.

It chronicles the rivalry between James Hunt and Niki Lauda in the '76 F1 world championships and the effect that the drivers had on each other and the rest of the world. I'm glad to say that this film is a great success and ticks all the boxes in regards to pure entertainment. The first thing I noticed when watching rush was a distinct stylised filming method. The world of 1976 is represented with an amber tinting, and a layer of gloss on top. The racetracks buzz with excitement, the machines look menacing and the editing is frenetic with quick takes to boost the thrill of the races. The film looks glorious throughout and I applaud Howard for achieving this on such a low budget. The whole cast play their parts well and I was truly impressed with Chris Hemsworth, who adds a maturity to the role and displays the many sides of Hunt. Bruhl is also fantastic as the cool and calculated Lauda. I read that Bruhl spent time with the now ageing Lauda and learnt his mannerisms and accent to the point, and this is evident in the film. The pacing throughout was great and the story had a near perfect blend of humour and drama. The dialogue and banter between Lauda and Hunt is scathing and brilliant, representing their ongoing competition on and off the track. The exploration of this rivalry is the films crowning achievement, documenting each characters growth during the progression of the season. The viewer is taken on the journey and forms their own opinions on the different philosophies of both drivers. Whether or not you are a fan of F1, you will love this film. It showcases the drama, the passion and recreates a bygone era of playboy drivers willing to risk it all. The races are tense and the acting first class. Howard has crafted something special here and I recommend it to anyone searching for a great time.",

That is one thing - among others - that this film does remarkably well.

            "content": "It is more than just a basic racing movie - I'll give that much credit.People praise this movie for being a character study. I don't know about that... It got the main characters right - but only individually. Let's examine:Niki Lauda is a fascinating figure: methodical and no-nonsense. Br\u00fchl spent a lot of time with him and nailed his younger character. According to an interview the actor immediately recognized the importance of learning the Austro-English accent to get his mannerisms right (a fact even Ron Howard did not get). With the incredible make-up he really turned into Lauda.In contrast to Lauda, Hunt really was a pop idol of his time who is said to have slept with 5000 women in his lifetime, which is the impression you get from the very start of the movie. I'm not sure if Hemsworth did really portray him well, though. Maybe a bit too overacted for a real person. Br\u00fchl, for me, clearly steals the show.The way the movie shifts its focus between Hunt and Lauda feels like an \"either/or\" deal. There are actually surprisingly few scenes where they interact directly. This is where the movie fails in my opinion.According to an interview with Lauda, the movie got 80% right. So what did it get wrong? Sure, on the track they were rivals but they had a lot of respect for each other despite their different attitudes. However, the movie makes it look like they hated each other (up until the last scene where they exchange cheesy Hollywood dialogue). Obviously you have to call your opponent an a**hole all the time, otherwise how should mainstream audiences know they are rivals?! The scenes with both together fell flat for me - what a missed opportunity to elevate the movie!The music is by Hans Zimmer - effective but sometimes I thought to myself this sounds more like a war movie soundtrack. The editing adds to the fast race feel, but sometimes they looks slightly off. Obviously no real footage of Formular 1 looks like that and I wish they had toned it down a bit.There are obviously a lot of real-life highlights in the movie: Lauda's famous crash of 1976 and his manic \"recovery\" are on the very top. However, the high point of that season - the Grand Prix of Japan - felt very rushed without realla showing the motivations of Lauda's quit.Well, looks like I will always have mixed feelings about Ron Howard's Hollywood-washed movies.",

This was an excellent effort, in the portrayal of Niki Lauda's roller coaster life and fascinating Career in Formula One. It is a great insight into his rivalry with James Hunt and portrays the dangerous levels these guys took themselves to, in their efforts for success.Chris Hemsworth's performance was outstanding, he played the part of James Hunt brilliantly, but the star of the show for me was Daniel Br\u00fchl. His performance was truly exceptional! He deserves a lot of credit, and he isn't your typical A-list Hollywood actor either, so that makes his performance even more special. Even Niki Lauda himself loved the guy who played him. They became close in real life as a result of this movie and the time they shared during its production. Niki was impressed with Daniel's professionalism and the effort he went to portray him, as he did it in such a meticulous way.However, when Niki saw an uncut version of the film with no music etc. He wasn't impressed at all. Furthermore, He was angry that there were errors showing some of the technical aspects of Formula One. He insisted that they were to be rectified, in order to match real life, as it was important for the audience to get a true perspective. Niki also wanted to make the audience aware of all the struggles and skills it takes to be a Formula One driver. This was so imperative to Niki, he threatened to walk away if these issues weren't resolved. Luckily, they were resolved, and he was delighted when he got to see the audience's reaction to it when it premiered in the cinema.He also said in an interview that 80% of the movie is true and all the main and critical parts of the film were included. The technical aspects were corrected, and the other 20% of the film was necessary and acceptable from his perspective. He understood it was needed in order for the narrative to be as entertaining as possible for the audience, as well as factually correct.This movie was fantastic, and for me, it was so close to achieving an 8/10, and who knows upon watching again in the future, I may update my rating. A very entertaining story that I otherwise wouldn't've been aware of, to be honest, as it was before my time. I, personally, think Formula One has gone majorly down hill with each decade that has passed. This was a snapshot of some of the more interesting times of the sport. Overall a professional film with good acting, direction, production, cinematography etc. And it was a very enjoyable and fascinating film to watch.",

The principal story line is the contrasting personalities of Hunt and Lauda. One cold and clinical the other spontaneous and a showman, this applies to both on and off the track.Lauda's crash is horrendous and is recreated painfully, likewise his recovery also. Hunt's hedonistic lifestyle is beautifully recreated in all its tabloid glory.Growing up in the 70s so many of the racing drivers are still so fresh in my memory, the Fittapaldi's and the Schecters and that wonderful John Player Special car. I must have liked Grand Prix racing at some point. It is very tense, the actor who plays Lauda looks more like Lauda then he does himself.To show how much Grand Prix racing was part of British culture and presumably on TV a lot at the time, a boy at school was bullied something rotten by being called Niki Lauda (and this was before the accident) I guess he must have rodent type features!Ultimately the films has a sad endin, due to Hunt's early death and not from racing but his lifestyle like a lot of sporting stars of their day tarnishing their legend. A big plus point is the 70s glamour and the plethora of woman that chase the stars, a bit like premier league footballers it is so easy to loose focus when temptation is so easily available.

James Hunt, mastered by Chris Hemsworth, is an extroverted, confident driver who dominated the racing industry in the early 1970's. Niki Lauda, played by Daniel Bruhl, is rather the opposite, introverted and reserved in his ways, he slowly becomes one of the greatest drivers of his era, creating a fierce rivalry between himself and Hunt. The film initially begins in 1976 before cutting back 6 years to 1961, where James Hunt's success in racing is expressed through the watch, victory after victory, the British driver conveys his dominance in the sport as the man to beat. He is pictured in celebration arrogant and smug, reinforced by his many sexual interactions with different women. In his home town Vienna, Austria, Lauda's approach to driving is seen as inconvenient from his father, a wealthy businessman, who ridicules him for his dream to drive at the highest level. He is outclassed in his first encounter with Hunt who wins comfortably, afterwards, an argument between the furious Lauda and the conceited Hunt breaks out, with the British driver, who derides the Austrian, leaving him aggravated in defeat. Lauda's determination and ambition to succeed is appealing, leading to Ferrari signing him. In 1974, Hunt marries Suzy Miller, a successful British model, but the marriage is shortly lived lasting only 2 years as Miller leaves Hunt to partner with actor Richard Burton in New York City. Lauda on the other hand, experiences a loving relationship with small-time model Marlene Knaus and married in 1976. Before the 1976 Formula 1 series, Hunt and his racing team fail to provide the required sponsorship deals prior to the deadline in November, leaving a vulnerable Hunt who may miss out on the season. An offer from McLaren is pounced upon by Hunt, who convinces to a reluctant racing manager Alastair Caldwell, that he will bring success to the company. It was set to be Lauda's Ferrari against Hunt's McLaren. Over the past six years, the pair had already endured in a battling rivalry, each driver having their own achievements to boast about. Setting the tone for the season, Hunt takes pole position in S\u00e3o Paulo, however, he crashes out allowing Lauda to start is title defence with a victory, Hunt failing even to make the podium. At the Kyalami circuit near Johannesburg, South Africa, Hunt finishes second behind the dominant Lauda. Clay Regazzoni, fellow Ferrari driver, wins race 3 with a Lauda in second. In Madrid, Hunt wins convincingly with Lauda in second, but his victory was met with disqualification with his car found to be too wide, this was overturned two months later after resulting that it was due to the expansion of the tyres during the race. Hunt misses out on the podium once again in Belgium with Lauda finding victory in race 5. In Monaco, Lauda takes a 33 point lead in the championship over Hunt and Regazzoni. Sweden saw the relentless Austrian finish third and Hunt fifth, Scheckter winning meant he went second in the points behind Lauda. Race 8 - held in France - left Lauda in despair after his engine failed, likewise with Regazzoni, allowing Hunt to win. In his home country, Hunt wins race 9 but credit went to Lauda, who finishes second despite reoccurring gearbox troubles. Race 10 was a big controversial turning point in the season, Lauda complains about the extreme weather conditions and how that will ultimately affect the track, reinforcing that there is always a 20% chance of death as a driver, and the weather is only increasing that possibility. The race goes ahead after Hunt's popularity gathered other drivers to overrule the Austrian. Lauda starts slow and loses places to others, in the second lap, he loses control at high speed due to a suspected rear suspension failure and crashes into the barriers before bouncing back onto the track and the car catching fire, Harald Ertl and Brett Lunger crashes into the car that was spreading profusely in flames, along with Arturo Merzario and Guy Edwards who stopped their cars and rescued Lauda, pulling him out the burning vehicle. Niki is sent to hospital with serious burns and is fighting for his life. Undergoing many operations, Lauda watches Hunt drive to victory in the Netherlands (race 12), closing a two point gap between himself and Lauda. Miraculously, Lauda returns for race 13 in Italy and in a pre-race press conference he is disrespected by a journalist, who asks the Austrian if he thinks his marriage can continue regarding his facial deformation, this resulted in Hunt pulling the reporter into an empty room and beating him up, standing by his fellow driver. Lauda beats Hunt and finishes in an incredible fourth place, he states to Hunt before the race that he isn't forgiving him for allowing the German GP to advance and that he in fact is to blame for the incident. James wins race 14 with Lauda slipping up, meaning the gap was just 8 points. The penultimate round in the USA sees Lauda make the podium for the first time since his absence, finishing third as Hunt finished on top spot. The final race (16th) in Japan, southwest of Tokyo beneath the intimidating Mount Fuji, the conditions similar to in West Germany, leaving Lauda nervous yet aware of the opportunity to be crowned champion. Before the race, Lauda is leading Hunt by 3 points. With rain heavily plummeting down, Hunt gets off to a great start and Lauda, who initially started the race, pulls into the pits and withdraws, stating it is too dangerous. Hunt requires at least 3 place to win the championship. Finishing the race strongly, Chris Hemsworth's character appears to finish 3rd, but the scoreboard sees him 5th, a conservative Lauda looks on as Hunt's 3rd place finished is confirmed, meaning he was F1 Champion for 1976. As Lauda exits, he tells Marlene that he has no regrets, not one. The pair are spotted later on, with Hunt heading to a weekend in Italy, accompanied by many different women, he stops by to see Lauda, mutual respect between them, they talk about that championship and as Lauda narrates over the top, he mentions that he liked Hunt, he wasn't surprised about his sudden death at the age of 45, but he liked him and that the pair were good friends. The sensational comeback story emphasises Niki Lauda's resilience and relentless nature, an adjective used by Hunt to describe him. The pair are different generically, Hunt, enjoys the luxury lifestyle that accommodates success, whereas Lauda is fixated on racing, improving, maintaining and pushing for achievements. Putting their differences aside, the two were extremely good friends and used their bitter rivalry as motivation. Bruhl captures in essence, the credibility and determination shown by Lauda in that 76 championship, likewise with Chris Hemsworth, en asphalting that Hunt was, driven by his own self ambition, if you pardon the pun. Their friendship only making their driving careers more impressive, two greats inseparable on and off the track. Two world class drivers epitomising an oxymoron. Splendid.",

The merciless rivalry between the two bears witness to the rigors of the racing sport.Presenting the rivalry of two top drivers, the film does not detract from the tension of the race itself. By portraying two different and opposite personalities, the film is great for explaining the film's two main characters, James Hunt and Niki Lauda. The feud between them is indeed interesting to follow. The conflict is densely and neatly constructed which is capable of producing such a heated and fierce race tension. In addition, the personal conflicts of the two characters are also able to be told well. All problems both in terms of rivals and personal conflicts provide a competitive and competitive nuance that makes us continue to see the excitement of rivals between them.Chris Hemsworth's performance, which is like a playboy, is an attraction in itself. Chris's look is indeed so flamboyant. Likewise, Daniel Bruhl, who has a serious and ambitious impression, is a counterweight to two different characters. The competition of the races also gives a good impression in watching this film so that the competition between the two feels real.",

But you'll want to find them yourself, when you see the film. Big screen is highly recommended.Only problem with RUSH is that I now seem to driving a bit too fast on my way home from the supermarket.

            "content": "There's been a lot of hype surrounding director Ron Howard's last venture into the world of Formula One racing starring Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Br\u00fchl. It's safe to report that 'Rush' is a thrill ride that will leave you entertained from moment one.Rush tells the true story of a single season of Formula One racing in 1976 featuring the intense rivalry between playboy superstar James Hunt (Hemsworth) and science-focused misanthrope Niki Lauda (Br\u00fchl). The film progresses as the two work pit their dichotomy of passions for racing against one another on a world stage that eventually leads to Lauda's near-fatal accident and subsequent return to the competition. It's the battle of the Formula One alpha males as the real-life rivalry between the hard-nosed Austrian and the British playboy is given full, glorious vent in Ron Howard's exciting car-race movie.While Howard follows both men's romantic lives, the focus is really on the love-hate relationship between two bitter adversaries who can't help admiring each other. And what a relationship! It's a duel of dualism, with audiences leaning into the corners to decide whether to ally themselves with Hunt's hedonism or Lauda's hard-headedness. Howard's triumph is that the choice is never an easy one. Howard has a way of wringing human tension from a story even if you have no great interest in or knowledge of the setting. Apollo 13 was set in space; Cinderella Man was (and yet wasn't) about boxing; and Rush mines the noisy, gasoline-and-testosterone world of the Formula 1 circuit in ways that even non-gearheads can get their heads around. As well as brandishing his usual mastery for pacing gutsy dramas, Howard's command over his division of digital artists results in some great sequences once the action moves to the track \u2013 the recreation of Lauda's fatal crash is stunning! What helps the film move along, are the impressive turns by the two leads. Chris Hemsworth is very convincing as the flaky, womanizing Brit who puts fun before everything else. Fascinating and layered deep with a silence under the glitz and glamor, James Hunt was a lonely person. Hemsworth illustrates all of it with a light sensitivity and a charismatic nature. Daniel Br\u00fchl fully understands the mechanics and precise ways of Niki Lauda. Serious to a fault, his Lauda is a study in straight talk, calculated risk taking and common sense, qualities that often put him at odds with everybody else. Bruhl gives his character soul with the occasional smile and showing of vulnerability.When seen on the big screen, Rush is an absolute thrill-ride. When the lights went down, my heart-rate was inexorably starting to climb. After about half an hour I was having difficulty breathing. I wasn't the only one. The whole row I was in sounded like an outing of emphysema patients!",

The script is amazing and I really have no complaints about the movie, whatsoever. What really intrigued me about the movie and kept me on the edge of my seat was basically that I knew nothing about the real story behind the film and because it is so well written, acted and shot I just needed to keep watching. The film features some of the best footage of cars and engines and racing that I have ever seen.

            "content": "\"Rush\" is another cinematic success for its director, Ron Howard. It is a 2013 film written by Peter Morgan and is currently available on NetFlix Instant Download Streaming. The film is just over 2 hours long, but when it was over it seemed like I had been in the cinema about 30 minutes. The film centers on the battle for the 1976 Formula 1 World Championship, and the rivalry between the Austrian \"professor\" Nikki Lauda and the British playboy James Hunt. The two are depicted as enemies, but in actual fact they were good friends who trusted and respected each other on, as well as off- track. This bit of artistic license does not spoil the film and is reasonable in order to make the battle between the two for the F1 crown more intense. The film is nicely paced. We are introduced to both characters through their own narrative and scenes that leave the watcher in no doubt as to their background and philosophy on life. The two are first seen in competition in 1970 at a Formula 3 race at Crystal Palace (where they have a coming together) and sets the scene for the rivalry throughout the film. I'm not sure if this is further artistic license. The two definitely did race each other in F3, but I am not convinced as to whether this actual incident occurred. After that we are given a whistle stop journey between 1973 (when Hunt came into F1) to 1975. We are shown the dangerous nature of F1 at the time with the Francois Cevert accident at Watkins Glen in gory detail \u2013 although this does not seem like gratuitous, but necessary to bring home just how unforgiving the sport was back then \u2013 and it truly was (of the top 12 points scorers in 1976, F1 cars were to claim 3, 1 ended up in a wheelchair and 1 had his career ended by a leg crunching crash).

Peter Morgan and Ron Howard should take a bow for steering clear of obvious pitfalls and crafting something truly insightful and cathartic from this material. Like many admirers of this film, I have no interest in F1, and actually rather despise the sport as the plaything of airhead rich fools. This film works because it is a classic odd couple formula. It also has in-built drama from the life-and-death activity these men earn their crust from. Then there is that whiff of authenticity they garner from basing this on a true story. The actors inhabit their roles completely, and the sense of mutual loathing and respect is finely conveyed. The narration is slightly annoying, but bearable. Clever, insightful and engrossing.",

The characters are really were the film gets good, there is always a tension between characters that continues to grow as the characters develop further. The characters petty feud is amazing to watch, and made me feel like I wanted to pick a side but in the end couldn't decide...maybe both characters were equally as good or bad.

I did worry at how Daniel Bruhl would take his character in the first few moments but soon relaxed into his portrayal. The cinematography of this film is noting short of stunning! As an attendee of many forms of racing, they capture the blood rushing adrenaline that accompanies the sport in the races and sometimes left me on the edge of my seat waiting to see what would happen. Not only that, but the angles on the racetrack that captured leaves blowing or other simple transitions throughout were absolutely breathtaking in their simplicity and design.

It wouldn't be a film I'd watch many times (because of the subject) but it is absolutely one of the best I've seen in a while. Notes: ~Fellow viewers (mostly female) reported they thought it was \"too long\". ~Some scenes may be too graphic for younger and sensitive audiences. Both gore and the lovely view of Chris Hemsworth's deliciously chiseled backside. ~Counting websites will take note on the number of times arsehole was said. It became comical! Also, nipples. There are quite a few so see note above.",

Rush is a really great, moving, and funny movie about a truly different time in Formula 1 history which is set apart by a truly brilliant performance by Br\u00fchl.Even with the tragic story Rush manages to also be funny at times, with funny one liners and hilarious scenes. Rush is not a racing movie but is still able to convey the feeling of Formula 1 and what it is about and what it means to its fans as good as the emotions and the personalities behind the characters, sugar coating nothing and showing them as real people not as characters in a movie.Br\u00fchl managed to transform into a second Niki Lauda, really getting the gestures and the voice and even the accent to match up with the real Niki Lauda. A must see for every motor sport fan and deserving a definite 10/10!",

The electric and flamboyant Englishman, James Hunt(Hemsworth) and the brilliantly driven and methodical Austrian, Niki Lauda. On and off the track these rivals clash yet while maintaining the upmost respect for one another and the sport of racing. With a hair pin margin for error, both men are willing to risk it all for the ultimate glory of becoming champion.The great Ron Howard had certainly cemented himself as one of the greatest directors of our time even before this glorious film. The set up of shots during all the races were impeccable leaving you feeling like you're in the race yourself, bravo to the cinematographer. With Hans Zimmer helming the score we hear the tone set beautifully. The deep introspects of each respected driver was also very well done with no wasted moments. Daniel Bruhl played his role with magic portraying the real drive and obsession it takes to be champion. Chris Hemsworth is also quite impressive also, portraying the hotheaded, overcompensating playboy quite naturally.All in all the extreme attention to detail makes for a completely perfect film.",

It shows how two rivals need each other to push themselves, which keeps you interested throughout.Thor or sorry Chris hemsworth puts in his best performance yet portraying, from what i have heard, James hunt excellently. Arrogance, wittiness, respect and determination described this performance, making Chris my new favorite actor. Daniel Brul was excellent, no more be said.

The two lead actors did their job perfectly, you can really see the time they invested to be perfect replicas of Niki Lauda and James Hunt. This is probably the most accurate movie inspired by real people, there is almost no Hollywood in this movie, and that is a good thing. I like that they didn't use only English, so you could hear actors speaking German and Italian. And a word about the music, Hans Zimmer did a brilliant job, his music fulfills the movie.

            "content": "From the theatrical trailer, it appears that Ron Howard's first directorial project since 2011 will appeal only to sports and Formula One fans. It is a pleasant surprise when this proves entirely untrue. Rush follows the intertwining on-track careers and personal lives of James Hunt (Hemsworth) and Niki Lauda (Br\u00fchl) - one a carefree playboy with great natural talent, the other a brilliant tactician willing to work his way to the top - throughout the 1970s, culminating in their battle for the 1976 world championship. The compelling narrative, centering on the drivers' clashing personalities and progression from bitter rivals to mutual admiration, would be an enthralling tale even without the dangerous thrills of Formula One.The supporting cast all deliver strong performances (Lara is especially stunning as Lauda's ever-supportive wife), but the film belongs to Hemsworth and Br\u00fchl; thankfully their dynamic performances prove more than worthy of carrying the film. Hemsworth's Hunt wins the heart of racing sponsors, several ladies, and the audience through embodying the British superstar's wild ways, witty self-deprecation, and exuberant confidence. However, he keeps his portrayal from devolving into caricature by imbuing Hunt with a sense of loneliness underlying his charisma, perhaps an emotion he attempts to fill with the track's life-or-death thrills. Br\u00fchl, who met with Lauda several times to prepare for the role, effectively changes his accent and mannerisms to become the endlessly determined, brusque-to-the-point-of- offensive Austrian. Anyone familiar with the 1976 championship will know that Lauda's career takes a terrifying turn; Br\u00fchl keeps every ounce of characteristic blunt stubbornness whilst giving viewers glimpses of (understandable) mental distress. His nuanced performance may well be awards-worthy.While some of Howard's recent projects have not lived up to the greatness of Apollo 13, A Beautiful Mind, and Frost/Nixon, Rush is arguably of their higher calibre. Howard's eye for cinematography and framing shots is particularly striking, notably in the harrowing hospital sequences and exquisite melding of archival footage at the end. He is aided by Peter Morgan's smart screenplay and Hans Zimmer's effective score; the former keeps the plot's pace moving briskly whilst the latter evokes both the excitement of 1970s Formula One and its lethal undercurrent.Rush's greatest achievement is arguably its ability to make two deeply flawed protagonists incredibly sympathetic, involving viewers in their fierce competition and often equally tormented personal struggles. While the film centers around the ultimate contest, it is hard to take sides whilst wishing for both drivers to succeed.",

            "content": "The movie \"Rush\" is about the rivalry between two racers; James Hunt and Nikki Lauda. We get to see the story from both perspectives and get to know both racers better. But who will be the number one racer? Hunt or Lauda?So that was my little synopsis of the movie now let's talk about the directing, cinematographing and some other 'technical' stuff in this paragraph. Let's start with the directing. Ron Howard has directed the movie and he did a very good job at it. With Howard it's most of the time a hit or miss. Howard has made good movies like \"A Beautiful mind\" but also bad movies like \"The Da Vinci Code\" (eventhough it was based on something good) This time it was definitely a hit. He used some good camera movements and long takes. The long takes were not that often present. But I still think it deserves a mention. He did a good job at the racing sequences, but at times this was a bit to fast paced for my taste and you couldn't really see which was which. The cinematography was pretty good. It was way better than the last movie I saw, in fact, everything is better than that movie, but I wouldn't call the cinematography fantastic or Oscar-worthy. It was just really good. This was done by Anthony Dod Mantle. Let's continue with some visual aspects. The CGI and make-up. The CGI-crash of Lauda was really good. It was very convincing and very near to the real crash. This brings me to the make-up of Lauda his face after the crash. Wow. This was done fantastic. It was hard to watch, so hard that I even switched to the next tablat. But the amazing sound choice didn't make it less gross. The sound design was done very well. The editing of this too. The soundtrack was fantastic, but I wouldn't expect anything less of Hans Zimmer. The editing too was done good.The acting now. I will talk about the two protagonists James Hunt and Nikki Lauda. Lat's also talk about them in that order. Hunt was played by Chris Hemsworth. Hunt was a playboy and a complacent asshole. Hemsworht absolutely nailed the part. He was very convincing and on the plus side, he also looks very similar too the real James Hunt. He may sound like a very annoying character but no. He wasn't annoying at all. Thanks to the fantastic writing you care for him. We see that he has his own problems. His drinking problem, and how his playboy characteristic backfires. His counterpart and also protagonist is Lauda played by Daniel Br\u00fchl. He was way better than Hemsworht in the role. Br\u00fchls accent was really convincing and I thought that he really came from there his acting may have looked stiff, but that's where they were going for. This fitted the character of Lauda perfectly. Br\u00fchl was cast perfectly. His appearance wasn't as close to his real counterpart as Hemsworth was, but the fantastic acting weighs up. Lauda is a smart man who uses his intelligence to beat Hunt in comprising to Hunt who doesn't think about his actions and just does them. This brings forward some very good dialogue.With that last sentence I will go over to the last 'Big' paragraph of my review. The script will be discussed in this part. Peter Morgan was responsible for this. And credit to him, because he did a fantastic job at it, in case you didn't notice from my last paragraph. The dialogue overall was good, but the dialogue between Lauda and Hunt was really good. The chemistry and friction between them made this only better, but this was of course thanks to the amazing acting capabilities of both actors. The way the story was told was also very good. It was a good choice to switch between both perspectives and show both characters imperfections. Doing this they made the characters more real. All of the characters were also well developed due to this. And thanks to all of these things combined you get sucked into the story and get invested into it. The film overall was very thrilling, surprisingly this was thanks to the directing but also editing the score and actually everything combined. But it is much more than just a sport film. It's a gripping movie with a meaning and fantastic characters. The movie makes you care about them and understand their actions. But as I've said: It's much more than that. Due to the things I've just said in the previous paragraph I will definitely recommend this movie to anyone! Even if they are not interested in F1, just like me, because the movie will pull you in and make you interested. The movie is also overall well crafted, as said in my title. That's why this movie get's an 9.25/10.",

My interest in F1 has now started thanks to this marvellous film that focuses on the relentless rivalry between stars James Hunt and Niki Lauda that took place in the 70's racing scene. Ron Howard directs with energy and flair, carefully balancing flashbacks and current moments together to create a fast moving movie, plus the camera-work is something to behold, especially when focusing on close ups of car engines revving, glass being blown in the wind and rain water flicking up into the air. The stars look as good as the cars, with Chris Hemsworth delivering a performance I never thought he'd pull off, not to say he's a bad actor, he's not and he proves this playing James Hunt, Hemsworth is so unforgettable. Daniel Bruhl is just as powerful as Hemsworth, playing the somewhat lonely but driven Niki Lauda who proves fierce competition to the cocky Brit driver. Would I watch Rush again?

Yes there's quite a bit of artistic licence and a poor script in places - but that doesn't matter - the events actually happened. Nikki Lauda suffered those horrific burns following that crash and James Hunt liked sex, drugs and alcohol (the former a bit too much) but they were both 70s icons and it's good to see their rivalry, their story on celluloid.

I can relate to both since I was there in the 1970s and I've been through the intense rivalry that comes with steep competition with a group of adept people that face possible elimination. Without even trying, it's all too easy to be identified as someone's enemy. It's only when it's all over and done that you realize that your enemy wanted to be your friend.Right from the get-go, the cinematography and audio mix hit you. That was my first indication that this was a high-quality film. Then, after a while, it becomes apparent that the characters are really strong. There's a definite sense of authenticity to this film and the later races really get the blood going. I actually worried about the drivers and was 'hanging on the edge of my seat' as the old expression goes. Be sure to check this film out -- even if you're not really a fan of racing.

In this movie, the ladies love him and he loves the ladies. He gives life to what could of been a one-note character. But it is Bruhl who steals the show in his Golden Globe-nominated performance as Niki Lauda. In my opinion, Bruhl should've also been nominated for the Oscar in the same category. He gives the performance of his career here, way better than his performance in Captain America: Civil War. You care about his character; as a matter of fact, I found myself cheering for both drivers. That's the mark of a good movie for me about rivals; when you find yourself fascinated by both sides of the spectrum, you know something was done right. And something was definitely done right here.All in all, an amazing piece of work that is capped off by stunning direction and brilliant performances by the two leads. Why this wasn't even considered for Best Picture at the Oscars, I will never know.",

Also you can sense the decades from the vintage quality and colors. But most important you can feel the power of the cars as if you were right there on the race track and your heart literally stops a few times during the 120 minutes just to start beating fast again!! You'll end up understanding how this two amazing drivers gained each and everybody's respect and admiration both on each particular lifestyle! Very exciting, by far the best movie I've seen in a long time! Absolutely recommend to watch it especially if you're a F1 fan like me! You'll want to watch it again and again!!",

Stunning showcase of special effects, flawless screen play, and a story that Shakespeare couldn't match, OK that may have been a bit extreme, but you catch my drift. This movie is the Days Of Thunder of Formula One and the modern movie era. The rivalry is there, the love, the tragedy, and most of all, the moving compassion that nearly anyone can find themselves in. This movie is a must watch, or a must have. An instant classic, not only involving two of the best drivers in any race sport, but also covering the most renown and loved race sport ever. This is a movie I would recommend to everyone, especially those who like, biography, drama, action, and history.Definitely worth the watch.",

            "content": "I can't recall having watched many dramas or movies about Formula 1 and this actually surprised me with it's depth of story line and intense character rivalry based on a true story. James Hunt and Niki Lauda were polar opposites - Hunt British Formula 1's reckless playboy of the time and Lauda the methodical, determined and arrogant Austrian. Hemsworth and Bruhl delivered outstanding performances to give so much depth to the fierce rivalry that drove one another to ultimately becoming world champions. Although there are major differences we also see a singular similarity in both characters of the unnerving belief that they will be world champion. This is something that bonds them - even if they would never be friends there is an underlying respect beneath the banter. Bruhl in particular was fantastic - especially after the major accident. His performance shows how obsessive such rivalry in sport can make a person become. And he also shows how a near death experience can make a person more aware of the life around him he could have lost. Cue the repeated shots of his wife played by Alexandra Maria Lara(who outside of the main two I thought was absolutely superb in a supporting role). Lauda realised at that point he had achieved what he had wanted to achieve and nearly paid the ultimate price in trying to achieve it again. He decided he had nothing left to prove and only everything to potentially lose and left the ball in Hunt's court. Hunt delivered and achieved his ultimate goal - something that he only had to experience once to prove to himself that he could do it. The party lifestyle never stopped and sadly he was lost to the world at only 45. Rivalry can push others to go further than they ever would have. But it can also be dangerous. This drama recognises both of these factors. It can also leave a lifelong respect between those who experienced it and when it's over leave a gap that can never be filled. For me the viewer - I was left with a lasting respect for the rivalry of two polar opposite champions - who never tried to change themselves or the way they operated. Who had true inner belief that one day they would be world champions. And although it can be deemed as reckless - who had the courage to lay it all on the line and risk everything to achieve their goals.",

            "content": "Chris Hemsworth pulls in an immense and startling performance as the womanising \"party guy\" James Hunt. This is due to both the actors and characters changes and versatility during the film as he doesn't stay as this fun loving hot head but easily adapts to show a deeper and somewhat subtle version of the character. It is this sort of flexibility within the role that gives Hemsworth his edge and keeps you gripped to the screen during the intense scenes on and off the track.Hemsworths performance is easily matched by that of Daniel Br\u00fchls as the rule abiding and overly serious Niki Lauda. Br\u00fchl performance may seem a bit dull compared to the liveliness of Hemsworths take on Hunt, but this just adds to the authenticity and the chemistry that occurs between these two polar opposites.Despite this film revolving around the rivalry between these two characters, it is the great chemistry during their conflicts that keep this going and this is realised at the end when Lauda states that Hunt \"is one of the few drivers he liked, and even fewer he respected\". Ron Howard has a great knack for taking a subject that may seem dull such as an interview (Frost/Nixon) and making it seem incredibly intriguing. This applies greatly to Rush as it is a real fast & furious film that pulls no stops in being daring or taking it slow round the corners.This brings me to my really only criticism; it is very long winded. I say this in the same sense that a film like Django Unchained feels long, but still keeps you engaged and ready for anything the film throws at you. Rush is exactly like this as it does move slowly, but it doesn't matter as you are too intrigued in this startling story to bother about the time going by.Visually, this film is spectacular. By this I don't mean that there are startling graphics and visual effects, but the cinematography and directorial style is top notch. Ron Howard had for some reason decided to put a golden yellow haze over most of the film, which gives an authentic feel to the film similar to the likes of Frost/Nixon or Argo.In the end Rush is an exhilarating thrill ride that keeps you enticed, even during the parts that seem slow. Visually the film is brilliant and there are stellar performance from both the lead and supporting actors and actresses.",

            "content": "****SPOILER ALERTS****Growing up in Indiana the only racing I really ever followed was one ... actually only one race that is: the Indianapolis 500 -- I occasionally would watch another Indy-class race or even a stock car race but growing up in the 60s and 70s, Formula 1 racing was hardly ever shown on American TV ... perhaps only on ABC's Wide World of Sports but I can't remember too many of those even (this of course was long, long before cable TV was even available and all-sports channels let alone all-auto-racing channels were ever thought of or dreamed of I imagine) ... even Sports Illustrated, the biggest and most popular sports magazine of the time, gave piddling coverage to Formula 1 racing ...That is until one moment in time: the horrific crash of Niki Lauda ... let me remind everyone of the tried-and-terribly-true journalism credo: \"If it bleeds, it leads\" ... and so Sports Illustrated and even TV sports shows were quite suddenly very interested in the state of Niki and of Formula 1 racing ... cover stories were even devoted to this crash and the weekly sports magazines and shows were regularly doing in-depth coverage of Niki's recovery and then his amazing comeback not to mention the dynamic dual of Lauda and James Hunt for the world title that year ... and yes, even as a young teen, I too was engrossed in the monumental recovery and courageous return to racing that Niki made that year only to drop-out of the final race that season due to what he deemed to be unsafe racing conditions, that being a fairly heavy and constant rainstorm ... Hunt was able to win the world championship that season by only a single point having gained many points during Niki's (only) two race absence after the severe burns he received inside and outside his body which drew the sporting world's attention to him and Formula 1 racing that season ...This movie not only covers the pure guts and determination of Niki's will to be a champion but shows the sport of auto racing better than any other movie I have ever seen ... it makes you feel the power of the machines, the speed and the mere inches these drivers operate within at those speeds, and the frightening results of a single miscalculation of the speed and inches they compete within ... But I was further surprised that this film was directed by Ron Howard ... this is not to say I am not a Ron Howard fan ... I usually enjoy his films though some can be rather sappy etc (imho) and not to my taste but I do not shy away from watching most of his movies ... but thinking of joining his directorial skills and style with this sport and story was surprising to me and so when I came across it through some accidental luck on IMDb, I made sure to see it purely out of interest to see how all of these ingredients would mix ... well, the mix perfectly and this is a film to be admired and one that I would think would make most people's pulse jump a bit from the fine editing (credited to Dan Henley and Mike Hill) and perfectly planned racing sequences which, I have read, were a mix of principal photography, cgi, and archival footage ... a flawless blend to my eye and many kudos to all the folks involved on that side of the production ...This is the best racing film I have ever seen and I would imagine the best one out there if judging only by the racing sequences alone ... I am not including the standard car chase scenes that pollute so many movies these days as frankly, those are most typically tiresome retreads (pun intended) of all the other car chase sequences done in all the other movies where you basically wait around for fifteen or twenty minutes for the next car chase to begin (let's take the \"Fast and Furious\" franchise for an example ... as one critic on this thread complained of the \"wooden acting\" in between the race sequences in this movie, I can't imagine what could be more oaken than the \"acting\" which interrupts the car chases in F&F franchise ... and for the record, the acting in \"Rush\" is not wooden but well done and the interplay and sparks between Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Br\u00fchl (along with their counterparts) do not make it so you sit around only waiting for the next action sequence ... it is well done and each of the stars have a firm grip on the character and \"character\" of the man they are portraying ...This is one of Howard's very best films, the best auto-sports film around, and a rock solid 10 in my book ... highly recommended for racing fans, of course (who have probably sought this out already) but also for fans of movies of people overcoming inner and external injuries and shortcomings to achieve their goals and it is quite certainly not one of the oh-so-many sappy, Hollywood cookie-cutter \"oh golly he got grievously injured or had inner demons he had to overcome to finally win the big one and get the girl and have millions of adoring fans and the old-time trainer who never got his shot at the big time but knows everything it takes to get to the big time and finally found the one pupil he could impart all of this knowledge upon, etc, etc, etc\" movies ... it is high-quality storytelling of each character's striving to become the best at what they do ...definitely one to keep a copy of as it is worth watching on a semi-regular basistake care, cormac\"One star in the sky so I named it Otis Redding\" -- John Hiatt",

That film brilliantly presented the thrill and drama of F1 in all its glory, excitement and tragedy. Grand Prix's story line is generally considered rather weak but that is a very small concession for it incredible racing sequences.

Well oiled, excitingly noisy and machine-tooled for maximum popcorn appeal, Howard's roaring drama depicts men risking life and limb in insanely dangerous circumstances, although the film itself prefers to play it safe in order to court the widest possible crowd.Scripted by Peter Morgan, whose stage play Frost/Nixon formed the basis of Howard's previous real-life 70s grudge match, Rush paints its dueling antagonists with the most baldly oppositional black-and-white brush strokes. While Hunt is a handsome playboy with a champagne lifestyle and shagadelic reputation (his badge bears the legend \"Sex: Breakfast of Champions\"), Lauda is a \"rat-faced\" systems analyst who goes to bed early after sweating over the mathematical permutations of success.As the former, Chris Hemsworth appears on occasion to be channeling the spirit of Austin Powers, a Merrie English swinger for whom naughty NHS nurses in stockings provide more than first aid, while saucy stewardesses offer obliging membership to the mile-high club at the drop of a polo-neck sweater. Toning down his performance only marginally from that of his hammer-swinging thunder god turn in Thor, the Australian Hemsworth is ready for action on and off the track, although his posh- school British accent sometimes slides like slick-tyred wheels on a rainy racetrack.But it's Daniel Br\u00fchl as the rigidly locked-down Lauda who is arguably the more interesting of the two; while Hunt's boyish enthusiasms are all on the surface, the enigmatic Austrian's driving forces are more elusive, causing us to wonder about his true motives. Like his eternal adversary, he is a son of wealth rebelling against a privileged past, the common bond that joins this odd couple. But whereas Hunt wears his passions on his sleeve (or, more often, his underpants), Lauda's demons are somewhat internalized, leaving Br\u00fchl to wrestle with an emotionally distant character, something he manages with aplomb.Juxtaposing the world views of its yin and yang heroes, Morgan's script treads a fine line between intrigue and overstatement. At its best, this makes for much entertainingly abrasive drama as the rivals' love-hate relationship provokes sparky interaction at pre-race meetings (another flag wave to Senna) and social gatherings alike. Yet such clear-cut divisions can also become an obstacle, with credibility stalling somewhat as simplification wrests control of the narrative steering wheel. It doesn't help that Austin Powers' Basil Exposition himself seems occasionally to be in the commentary box, providing the aural equivalent of subtitles for the hard of thinking.But Howard has always been a die-hard populist, whether serving up the sparkling romantic fantasy of Splash or delving into the murky waters of psychosis in A Beautiful Mind. With such notable exceptions as the dismal The Da Vinci Code and the painfully unfunny The Dilemma, his back catalogue bears testament to his ability to blend solid thematic meat with easily digestible fluff. As such, Rush (which cost a modest $50m) may prove to be a hit with American audiences for whom the subject matter is still something of a foreign country.Significantly, Rush also marks a return to Howard's roots, which are firmly grounded in cinematic dreams of cars. Having starred in American Graffiti, with its nostalgic evocations of drive-ins and hot rods, Howard made his directorial feature debut, in 1977, with Grand Theft Auto, a motorized romantic caper publicized with a cartoon pile-up poster proudly brandishing the tag line: \"See the greatest cars in the world destroyed!\" \u2013 a promise on which Rush makes good. There are comparisons, too, with Apollo 13, another 70s-set true story about men in all too flimsy machines traveling at speeds that are likely to cause them to burn up and worse. Despite the fact that (most) audiences knew how that particular adventure would end, Howard did a brilliant job of keeping the crackling tension alive by concentrating on the relations between the astronauts, his dexterity with both the mechanics of action cinema and the nuances of dialogue paying dramatic dividends. It's a winning combination that is once again to the fore in Rush.Much credit goes to the ace team of cinematic mechanics whom Howard has assembled to fine-tune his vehicle \u2013 from Anthony Dod Mantle's typically deft and probing camera-work, always finding the unexpected perspective, to the collective efforts of the sound department, whose crunchy gear changes and booming engine throbs put the audience right there in the driver's seat. Visually, the film has an access-all-areas pass to every nook and cranny of the cars, but it's the pulsing baseline of that soundtrack that provides the dramatic chassis of the race sequences. Solid supporting performances add to the appeal, with Alexandra Maria Lara and Olivia Wilde making the most of their twin \"muse\" roles, while Christian McKay reminds us that we have seen too little of him since his breakthrough role in Me and Orson Welles.Bright, brash and unashamedly formulaic, this is thrillingly accessible fare, aiming more for the straight lines of the home stretch than the tricky curves of those treacherous corners, with Howard keeping one eye always on the grandstand.",

The F1 GP's ambient and the environment (costumes, scenarios, tracks, etc...) is perfectly recreated (surely after a true and huge researching job), but noticing that fantastic job, the director reaches to let it all stay in a second frame when Hunt or Lauda come into the screen. Just as it should be!!Thanks to Ron Howard and all his team to make the first true Car racing movie and to establish a new standard in quality, entertainment, and commitment to transfer the sportsmanship spirit, the pilot personalities and the story to the big public with responsibility and care.

            "content": "Rush is the kind of movie that filmmakers and audiences dream about!! I say so because it is based on a true story - the true story between Formula 1 racers Niki Lauda and James Hunt, two of the biggest names in the game in the mid 1970's. Having a movie based on reality brings authenticity to it, audiences know that at least part of the movie is real, something like their own lives making it easier to identify with some of the characters on the silver screen. What a contrast of characters we do see on the silver screen in Rush, directed by Academy Award winner Ron Howard. On one side of the coin we have Niki Lauda, played wonderfully by Daniel Bruhl who was nominated for a BAFTA Academy Award for this performance in the category of supporting actor. Lauda is, how shall I say this kindly, something of the conservative, he stays at home with his wife and does not go out and enjoy the partying lifestyle that most Formula 1 racers enjoy post race. On the flip side of that coin is James Hunt played terrifically by Thor's Chris Hemsworth. Hunt is the antithesis to Lauda, flirting with women left and right, bedding women left and right, and enjoying the lifestyle of a successful race car driver. Surprisingly both lifestyles make for good racers on track as the 1976 season showed. If you are a fan of auto racing or sports in general you will like this movie. If you are a fan of good movies you will like this movie. Secretly this movie is both a period piece (albeit a short one) and a slice of life. It's also the type of movie that will teach you valuable life lessons while entertaining you at the same time. Extraordinary writing, superb directing, excellent acting, fine music, excellent sound editing, and a great sense of fun and suspense make this an excellent film to enjoy!! 8 out of 10 stars!!",

To see Niki Lauda walking at the Mercedes AMG Peytonas paddock's giving advise to the drivers of today is amazing. The rhythm of the movie both in thrilling moments, personal drama, and driving is combined almost perfectly.

A cool and calm man who is always in control of himself regardless of the situation, something he brings to his racing. But there is a deeper layer to him, a drive to achieve beyond what is given to him. To create his own achievements from scratch which leads him into racing and causes him to design the cars himself.Then James Hunt, portrayed by Chris Hemsworth. The best performance of his I've ever seen; he embodies a madman who is involved in racing for two things. He wants glory and he wants thrill. He entirely opposed Lauda and strives for the public's approval through his reckless and eye catching driving, rather than self-approval through perfection like Lauda.The brilliance of the story of the rivalry between these two paired with the seasoned direction of Ron Howard creates a brilliant viewing experience. The racing is extremely tense and engaging, genuinely heart pumping stuff, but the film really excels as a character study.All in all, \"Rush\" is an amazing film that explores a tale that will stun you and amaze you with every turn, which is made even more unbelievable by the fact its true.",

Both of us expected to be pointing our inaccuracies throughout the movie. Instead we left the theater thinking this is a great film and a true tribute to Hunt and Lauda and formula 1 in the 1970s. Yes, there were a few inaccurate moments (Hunt and Lauda actually liked each, but its more fun to make them insult each other whenever they meet), but that did not detract from the overall excellence of the movie and the fabulous photography.

Bruhl and Hemsworth looked near identical to their real life counterparts and their mannerisms resemble the duo perfectly. Ron Howard rarely disappoints and this movie is no exception. Ron presents both of these larger than life men and gave them an equal playing field. You will undoubtedly find yourself rooting for one or the other throughout, supporting their every move, then somehow have your opinion switched.

            "content": "Finally. Just when I thought that this year had been without a single highlight with respect to Hollywood (co)productions in general, I had the pleasure of watching this little marvel.The story is fast paced, well thought of and does not paint its characters entirely in black or in white, like we are used to from other \"blockbusters\". The effects are great, but without bludgeoning viewers to death with unlikely and unconvincing CGI. The movie lasts about two hours, but it's one of the few instances where I wouldn't even have minded a 2h30 or 3h production, had it included more details about the drivers' lives, their competitors and some more background. It was a gripping mix that left nothing to be desired.But the most impressive part of it all was the acting of the two main characters (Hunt & Lauda): Truthfully, I would not have expected such an impeccable characterization work from Chris Hemsworth, who is generally known for solid, but certainly not for overwhelming performances (e.g. Thor, Star Trek). His work here is admirable, translating Hunt's playboy on the one hand and his insecure side on the other hand to perfection.However, it was Daniel Br\u00fchl's brilliant performance as Niki Lauda that put everything else into perspective. Having met Niki Lauda personally and, as an Austrian myself, having seen him interact many times on T.V. and on the radio, Br\u00fchl just nailed it with flying colors. The resemblance not only concerning Lauda's appearance, but most of all with regard to his mannerisms is almost frightening. Br\u00fchl, as a German, had to learn to talk with an Austrian accent in English AND in German, including Niki Lauds's very specific and rather odd pronunciations. Needless to say he mastered everything flawlessly. Heck, if he ever chose to stop acting, he could start a career as a Lauda imitator. To summarize it, his whole act was extremely convincing, the interactions with everybody else appeared genuine and most of all his enemy/friend chemistry with Chris Hemsworth was brilliant.I'd like to see one more competition between these two: Br\u00fchl & Hemsworth should be nominated, Br\u00fchl should win this competition and get the Oscar.All in all, I'm glad to see that not all hope is lost for cinematic productions and that some movies still focus on their stories and their characters instead of regurgitating the embarrassing tripe that we've been served as \"blockbusters\" this year (e.g. World War Z, Elysium, Oblivion & many more).",

            "content": "This film, directed by Oscar-winning director Ron Howard, focuses on the intense rivalry between 1970s Formula 1 drivers James Hunt and Niki Lauda, particularly the 1976 Formula 1 season that saw both men push themselves to unthinkable lengths as they fought for the championship.But this film is not simply about a rivalry between two drivers. It is about determination, persistence, and the will to win\u2013-it's about just how far some men are willing to push themselves in pursuit of victory and respect.Chris Hemsworth (Thor, The Avengers) plays British party-boy driver James Hunt. Cocky, arrogant, and known just as much--if not more--for his off the track exploits as his ability to drive a race car. If you were to write a book about Hunt's life it would be titled, Beer, Babes, and Breakneck Speed.The opening scene of the movie is an exceptional portrayal of Hunt. He walks into a hospital wearing his fire suit and sporting a bloody nose and black eye that he sustained not from a crash, but from a scuffle with another driver--supposedly because Hunt had slept with the other man's wife. In true James Hunt fashion, he wastes no time hitting on the nurse who comes to his aid. Hemsworth plays the role with ease. His pretty-boy looks and swagger make him believable as the party\u2013boy, ladies' man who hasn't a care in the world.Niki Lauda and James Hunt are on complete opposite ends of the social spectrum. A consummate student of his craft, Lauda cannot be concerned with parties or nightlife of any kind. Lauda is driven by one thing: being the best. Daniel Br\u00fchl (Inglorious Bastards) plays alongside Hemsworth beautifully. Lauda's character can be best summed up in a scene where he makes his first test-run as a member of the Ferrari racing team. He finishes his test run and promptly calls the car a \"shitbox\" and says that he doesn't understand how in Ferrari's facilities they built such a piece of crap.Like Hunt, Lauda is arrogant, but in a way different. Lauda doesn't think he was the best driver. He knows he is. He doesn't think he can set up his car the best, he knows he could and he isn't afraid to tell you. Br\u00fchl's accent and delivery capture Lauda's personality with precision. The 1976 Formula 1 season is all about Lauda vs. Hunt. The two battle every race--with Lauda capturing early season dominance. A controversial disqualification because of an illegal car vacates Hunt's first win of the season. In the following weeks, he experiences a slew of blown engines as his mechanics struggle to reconfigure the car.Then, at the Grand Prix in Germany, Lauda fights to have the race canceled due to weather, but Hunt uses his vast popularity to sway the other drivers to vote to continue the race as planned. In this race, Lauda has a crash that left him trapped in a burning car for several minutes, severely burning his face and lungs. As Lauda recovers in the hospital, Hunt charges up the leader board, closing the gap between himself and Lauda. Despite opposition from doctors and his wife--and still wearing bandages from the burns on his head--Lauda returns for the final weeks of the season.Everything in the movie leads up to a Hunt vs. Lauda showdown in the final race of the season, which takes place in a torrential downpour that forces every driver on the track to ask the question, \"Is this race worth my life?\" This race that pushes both Lauda and Hunt further than they have ever pushed themselves, and it pushes one of them past his breaking point. A beautiful and tragic film all at the same time, Rush is a winner. The camera work is excellent. The racing sequences are exciting. But the story and portrayal of these two bitter rivals is the real selling point. Hemsworth and Br\u00fchl play their roles brilliantly and make this film worth multiple views.",

Though the movie only shows part of their journey, you can feel the warmth in their relationship. A healthy rivalry, and how important things can be for you when you are on the line.I would any day be ready to watch, and re-watch this film again and again, and the soundtrack, just the though of it gives me goosebumps. Hans Zimmer' Music, astounding visual, and I don't have any words to describe the performance by both actors. It will never look as if it was a film shot with actors, I didnt think so, it felt surreal to me, as if I was watching a documentary of two racing legends and how both their lives made them choose what they did.I would die to see further details of it, may be a series or a sequel or even a spin-off film. I hope writers/makers consider that.",

            "content": "Can you handle the speed? If so this movie is for you. Rush an action based movie with an amazing storyline to keep you clenched to that seat, but makes you feel as if the movie just started. I saw Rush for the first time a few weeks ago through a screener copy and after feeling so exhilarated I just had to go see this under the big screen with the roaring speakers. Written by Peter Morgan known for Frost/Nixon in 2008 and The Last King of Scotland in 2006. Morgan puts on the big screen, a story about the challenges of two formula one drivers and their race to be the Champion of the World. The movie covers the 1976 season of racing that is known as one of the most intense seasons raced by two formula one drivers. The movie starts off in a Formula three race in 1970 where our rivals meet for the first time. After just a few minutes Morgan already painted a picture for us as to what the two racers will partake in. As we progress through the movie we learn a sense of who James Hunt and Niki Lauda are through their lives on and off the track. The playboy Hunt engages himself in the many affairs of woman, parties and paraphernalia, where Lauda is yet the simple man enjoying himself and remaining focused on the races ahead. Rush is narrated through each character really giving the feeling of growing a personal relationship with the racers and how they felt day in and day out.Rush makes you feel as if you are right there in the pit with the racers and their team. The fast passed scenery captures you and immerses you into the movie, experiencing what the characters are feeling and the emotions that come with each scene. The casting was wonderfully done, Chris Hemsworth plays James Hunt illustrating and capturing the essence of the playboy philanthropist and the many struggles he goes through fighting the adrenaline junkie within. Daniel Bruhl playing Niki Lauda the business man that means to win, but not at the cost of his life. Quickly we learn the differences between the characters off the track but as soon as they are engaged on the track we know it is all business from there.This movie does a fantastic of keeping the viewer engaged in the material. The director and cinematographer did an eye capturing depiction of what it would be like to be a racer in the 70's. The simple details of the logos on the cars to the color of the film bring this whole movie to life. If you're looking for some heart pounding intense scenes with a side of humor and lust with love this movie is for you. Don't sit at home and watch it, go out and see it on the big screen!",

There are some great rivals in formula one like Niki VS Hunt\uff0cSenna VS Prost and Schumacher VS H\u00e4kkinen. Among them,Niki and Hunt are the most dramatic.They are very different from each other and at first they were hostile but after a series of events, they started to understand each other and became real friends.For me,I like Niki.He was brave enough to give up game and be good at IQ and EQ.Although he was not good-looking, he was tough and be responsible for his family. Hans Zimmer's background music is really outstanding and promotes this movie.It's the best motor sport movie much better than The Fast and the Furious.

The two are depicted as enemies, but in actual fact they were good friends who trusted and respected each other on, as well as off-track. This bit of artistic licence does not spoil the film and is reasonable in order to make the battle between the two for the F1 crown more intense. These two characters are total opposites but as their lives are explored it also acknowledges the value of an enemy, something to beat. I believe this is a commentary on human nature in that the best of us shines when we have something to beat or overcome. movie is very good made, but some scenes could be extended a little more",

            "content": "A great rivalry thoroughly dissected and cunningly brought to film. The first scenes were cleverly written and directed to introduce to us our two protagonists. Just a little over 5 minutes into the film and we already know what kind of people James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) and Nikki Lauda (Daniel Duhl) are. So much so that after James Hunt is making out and having shower sex with Nurse Gemma (Natalie Dormer), we don't expect to see her again. And Ron Howard does well to let it spontaneously pass and not fuss over any details because letting it pass like that further builds Hunt's character. More importantly, however, is the build of the rivalry between Hunt and Lauda. Chris Hemsworth delivers by far his best performance in perfectly depicting Hunt's arrogance, cockiness and charisma. Daniel Bruhl also does a fascinating job in portraying Nikki Lauda. While the two characters may be on opposite ends of the spectrum, their rivalry pushes them to evolve and be anywhere on the spectrum if it means winning. While their fundamentals and core foundations do not change, everything else does. As these changes unfold the rivalry becomes stronger and stronger and the races ever more intense. The cinematography is notable and was indeed complementary to this film's immersion especially on the race track. The races were shot splendidly and conveyed the tension, ferocity, and thrill of the races. The brief shots from the driver's helmets were brilliant and gave the audience a feeling of subjectivity. I've seen a couple of movies that featured races and such, but never did any give me such an adrenaline rush. This, I think, is the result of amazing camera-work, powerful performances and of course masterful directing.",

            "content": "Rush is a biographical sports film focussing on the 1976 Formula 1 Season and James Hunt & Nikki Lauda in particular. Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) is a hot headed, buoyant, playboy British driver, while Lauda (Daniel Br\u00fchl) is a calm, intellectual, meticulous Austrian. The two initially cross paths in the formative years of their driving careers, in Formula 3. A minor incident during the London race of the 1970 Formula 3 season depicts the beginning of the fierce rivalry that was going to culminate in the coming years. Having gained experience in the lower tier of the motor sport, both the drivers wish to be in a Formula 1 car and on the top step of the podium. But this isn't an easy task and will require getting rid of multiple speed breakers along the way. Both the drivers overcome their individual challenges and start their journey in F1. The 1976 season starts and the two are pegged to be the only major title contenders. The film then showcases the build-up to the famous rivalry, their personal lives and the big story that was to become on the race track, all during the 1976 F1 season.\nBiographies often take their set of artistic liberties to keep the story interesting, but the real story of Rush gives the impression of an exciting & interesting story by itself. So, the screenplay does not deviate much from the reality and as always Peter Morgan's writing is as raw as possible. Ron Howard has surely put laudatory efforts in giving an amazing output. The films cinematography also needs to be appreciated keeping in mind it is not a simple task to portray speedy cars and make it look entertaining at the same time. With Hans Zimmer's music the soundtrack gives a certain level of profundity to the story. Hemsworth and Br\u00fchl too, give some amazing on-screen moments portraying the real life characters.\nContinuing on the music it is most certainly amazing but maintains a level of tempo & atmosphere across the whole film. Varying it during scenes depicting different emotions could have made the movie more enjoyable. Sticking to the reality the film shows almost all main parts, but chooses to keep away from a few sub-stories. They could have slightly stretched out the film to include those too.\nNonetheless its positives heavily outweigh the negatives. It surely deserves all the nominations it has received. If you are a sports lover or are into biographies it's a must-watch, if not still do give it a shot it will still be worth your time.\nActing- 9\nCasting- 9.5\nCinematography- 9\nDialogue- 7.5\nDirecting- 9\nEditing & Effects- 7\nSound & Music- 9\nStory- 9\nStorytelling- 9\nRating- 9",

The movie itself wasn't awful but it reminded me of a formula one adaptation of the fast and furious. Insert cheesy quote here, followed by a gear change here and finally a cut shot to the engine.

This was a year in which not everyone in fact was obsessed with the release of the Sex Pistols' Anarchy in the UK.

Now, I have never really been into F1, so I thought \"Okay, this film isn't going to be that good.\" But by god I was wrong!!The part which got me in the film was when Niki was in the fire. I knew he would live as my dad had already told me so (As before I had not seen the trailers) but it was the fact that Niki just kept shouting 'Get me out!' as the people struggled to get him out. It was just so terrifyingly awesome! And then when later they said he was stuck in 800 degrees plus for a whole minute I was just like oh my god! And the thing which really made me shiver was that this actually happened to the real Niki Lauda!I also loved the part when a reporter asked Niki does he think his wife will still love him with his burnt face and James just beat the living hell out of him for asking that! That made me so happy as even though they are rivals, they still care.Overall, the film was a massive success with great actors and a brilliant sound track. It is something I recommend you watch.",

The cast of mainly new talent was well chosen. They are reported to me based on real people, which makes this picture even more genuine and keeps the excitement and energy of this film going until the end. The technical side of this also has to be mentioned, as it has made the project even more intense. Seldom does one get inside a speeding car and really feel the pressure of the movements, virtually pulling one around in your own movie seat.

            "content": "This fact based drama centres on the rivalry between Formula One drivers James Hunt and Niki Lauda during the 1976 Formula One motor-racing season. In a modern era of boring, faceless sports stars it's hard to believe that in the mid 1970's, most sports had at least one maverick personality. Amongst others, Football had George Best, Snooker had Alex Higgins, Motor cycling had Barry Sheen and John McEnroe was emerging in tennis. Along with Hunt they were The Peoples' Champions of their day, not just for their talent but the thrill of watching an individual whose brilliance was as likely to surface as his ability to self destruct has always been irresistible to the public. Any volatile talent requires a nemesis. In the case of James Hunt it was Niki Lauda. Rational, calculating and the epitome of professionalism, Lauda was an earlier prototype for the modern day athlete. His commitment and focus was a far cry from the flamboyant personality of his rival.The two main actors are superb in the roles. Not only do the actors look like the drivers they are representing, the portrayals are believably acted. The season was so dramatic and controversial that the script needed little deviation from the truth. In fact the only small criticism of the film is the odd scene thrown in for dramatic impact that actually didn't historically occur. It's hard to believe that the director Ron Howard was acting in a cheesy American 50's nostalgia show when these two driving legends were sparring for the World Drivers Title back in 1976. This was a time before Formula One became F1. Happy Days!",

This movie is a \"motion\" example of this true fact. Very often a movie got so rightly made which leaves a lasting impression on a viewer, but this is something else, it gives you goosebumps & inspires you throughout. Based on true rivalry of James Hunt & Niki Lauda, both the champions of Formula 1 in late 70's, the movie deals with not only the glam part of this sport, but also gives a really deep insight. It shows us how blessed a someone can be who has a good rival, who can indeed become each other's inspiration. Having very different ideologies, both James Hunt & Niki Lauda compete each other right from the beginning of their careers in Formula 3 till the end in Formula 1. Chris Hemsworth playing James Hunt is all true to his character, what a racer thought-out to be; bold, risk-taker, casanova, full of life. But, the real surprise is from his methodical, brilliant opponent, Austrian driver Niki Lauda played by Daniel Bruhl, who not only justifies Lauda's depth but also fulfills a promising act. The story follows their distinctly different personal styles on and off the track, their loves and the astonishing 1976 season in which both drivers were willing to risk everything to become world champion. It's a matter of fact, that only a handful of movies can achieve a perfect mastery of art from all this departments; cinematography, acting, background scores, editing, screenplay directing all just bestowed perfectly. Tightly directed by Ron Howard, perfectly written & crisply edited, Rush is an exhilarating ride. Ron Howard who is master in taking different genres through-out his career, deliver his second best after 'A Beautiful Mind', the term which suits him. Hans Zimmer's back scores engages us as always. A notable mention is for the director of photography, Anthony Dod Mantle, who shot all the racing sequences with a thrilling frame, the film has a beautifully crafted close-ups & keen details. Kudos to the digital intermediate colorist even, who gave us a real feel of the 70's & formula racing. The movie just not falls into a another sports film category because it has much more to deal with. It deals with the philosophy on life of both the competitors, the formula sport pros and cons & the undying spirit. The more I speak about this movie, makes me watch it again. I, hardly remember the number of times I watched (or can say experienced) this since last year. Always will be regretful of missing it on the silver screen. Nevertheless, it's perfect, full of spirit & is all filled with gems.",

The film places a huge emphasis on the drivers and their lives with very little of the actual driving itself (in-fact many of the races are just a quick drive by with the result written over it) and it does overplay this a bit too much for my liking.However the film as a whole is quite gripping and even if you know the story well, there is enough to keep you on the edge of your seat. It goes to great lengths to show just how dangerous the sport was back then and how the drivers diced with death each and every time they got behind the wheel.

I always thought it was \"just another racing movie,\" and didn't really have much to it. But I was surprisingly wrong, and I'm very glad.Since this is a racing movie though, I thought the action and the cinematography put into it was great. The different angles that were used to get certain shots were perfect, and it seemed to put you right in the car with them. On top of that, both Hemsworth and Bruhl put on great performances. Bruhl is the typical know-it-all who is full of money and schemes, and Hemsworth is the pretty boy who pulls all the chicks and just happens to be good at what he does. When these two clash, the rivalry is perfect.My favorite part of the movie is how it is setup. Let me explain what I mean. Who is the protagonist? Who is the antagonist? They both had reasons to be either one, but there was still never a clear answer. It's different. It's genius. It's brilliant.8/10",

On the track, it was fast and gripping with all the excitement of a good sports movie. Additionally, a little research after the movie shows that it got most things pretty accurate. Of course there is a little bit of Hollywood dramatization thrown in there, particularly with the two racers' rivalrous relationship. Niki Lauda himself was consulted a lot on the film and spent a good deal of time with actor Daniel Bruhl in preparation. They also used several of the original race cars in the film itself.Overall this was a really entertaining sports movie that most people will probably like and race fans will love.",

            "review_title": "Outstanding and an equal to Grand Prix",
            "content": "During my teens and early adulthood I followed the Gran Prix Formula One racing scene as the best race car drivers in the world raced on that circuit. I was a Jim Clark fan and I thought he was the best driver during his time. A Formula 1 champion, Clark was also an Indy 500 winner and his death was significant in that the world had lost another great driver of a time much different than today.In the movie RUSH, set in 1976, Clark had been dead from a crash for over seven years, a stretch of time that I could tell you who won which race, where the races in Formula 1 were staged, and who had the best and fastest cars. As mentioned in Ron Howard's RUSH (2013), at the beginning race of the 1976 season, of the 25 drivers to start that first race, two would be killed by the end of season. That was normal for F 1. Driving a F 1 car was as dangerous a job you could have, ranking up there with being an astronaut. Like riding on a bomb waiting to exploded as referred to in the movie, it took a special man to guide the bomb down the track, turn after turn, all in accordance with a precise skill of hand, eye, and foot coordination. Jim Clark was just one of the great drivers not to live to an old age, and like the others that raced in Formula 1, the thought of death was always present, like being a soldier in a war that was asked to lead the charge. John Frankenheimer directed Grand Prix (MGM 1966) and it was, at the time, the most exciting movie I had ever viewed. Attending a screening here in OKC, the wide screen production was an event of historical significance worldwide. In a future viewing forty-five years later from that first look, Grand Prix presents itself as a fully encapsulated microcosmic look of the time and period of 1965 Formula 1 racing spectacle and pageantry. With appearances of many of the F 1 drivers of the era, along with real race footage interwoven with make believe shots, Grand Prix holds the test of time, providing a film still fresh and beautiful as the day it opened in the theaters almost a half a century ago. Not as personal a movie as RUSH, the epic Grand Prix is still the greatest film on auto racing ever made, and also the most visually handsome of any. It puts you in the seat of an F 1 car and never relents in the spine tingling exhilaration of power of the experience mixing with the terror of a sudden catastrophe. RUSH, on the other had, gets into the soul of two men in their pursuit of greatness in F 1 and their drive to better the other. The better acted movie, RUSH gives its' two protagonists enough differences to try to make you pick one over the other, yet allowing both to have good and not go good attributes in the way they live their lives. Ron Howard is as fine a director as Frankenheimer, but RUSH lacks in the racing scenes where Grand Prix excels. Real footage always, well usually, bests make believe, and in this comparison, RUSH comes in second place. One significant difference that gives RUSH a positive advantage over Grand Prix is the finality of the accident. Not that the accidents shown in RUSH are better shot or more exciting, the gory frames that you are required to view are horrific in nature, realistic to the point of nausea. A driver's body, minus his head, sitting in a wrecked F 1 race car; a driver burning in race car while trying to free himself; and another driver being loaded into a meat wagon with injuries that you really don't want to look at. I will give Ron Howard credit that he didn't prolong the savagery, cutting away in enough time to allow the viewer get away from such nastiness, but leaving a lot to ponder in the future. I liked RUSH very much. A movie I will see again in a couple of years, to enjoy the acting skills of the various \"faces\" of the beautiful people, including Chris Hemsworth as James Hunt, Daniel Bruhl as Niki Lauda, Olivia Wilde as Suzy Miller and Alexandra Maria Lara as Marlene Lauda. Director Howard tries to get us into the head of the Hunt and Lauda, how they tick, how they as race car drivers, take the sport as individuals who were on different time clocks. Fascinating work by Howard and outstanding performances by Hemsworth and Bruhl. As for Garner and the rest of the cast of Grand Prix, routine and workmanlike performances, yet putting those actors into real race cars and having them in truth, drive the F 1 race tracks, you cannot take away from their bravery. The race car genre in movies is littered with some good, some not so good, and some really bad. In my book, there is noting worse than a bad race car movie. Both Grand Prix and RUSH are outstanding and very good, respectfully. Two movies on the same track ten years apart, but in reality, not one second apart in taking the checked flag.",

As other reviews here attest, this works as a character study of two real life figures, and by the end of the film you feel you know both of them well.

            "content": "'Rush' tells the story of the dramatic and at times tumultuous rivalry between Formula One motor racing drivers James Hunt and Niki Lauda during the 1970s, culminating in the remarkable 1976 season.Motor racing films are notoriously difficult to gain mainstream attention and success, yet 'Rush' achieves this better than most, finding an excellent blend between the on-track action and the personal drama between both protagonists.Told primarily from Lauda's perspective, the film encapsulates the nature of an elite sporting duel pitting the playboy, arrogant and cocksure Hunt against the cold and calculating Lauda. Both are chalk and cheese yet the relationship on screen demonstrates the symbiotic link between them. The narrative surrounding both drivers' journey to their 1976 face-off is cleverly juxtaposed: Hunt and Lauda are diametrically opposed characters yet both possess stupendously large egos that make neither particularly likable.The film's centrepiece is Lauda's horrific accident at the Nurburgring in the 1976 German Grand Prix, which he barely survives, and his subsequent battle to return to compete for the Championship he is defending. The recreation of the real-life accident - and other racing scenes in the movie - is supremely done with the colours, speed and sound of the cars beautifully realised by Director Ron Howard. The track action is expertly contrasted with the grim hospital scenes where a recuperating Lauda has the last rites read, his lungs pumped and his burned skin repeatedly bandaged. The culmination of the film is the final race of the 1976 season with both drivers risking everything in the torrential rain of Japan. For anyone not knowing the story, the denouement has the potential to be both surprising and a little underwhelming albeit completely in keeping with the logical progression of both characters.'Rush' is a powerful and entertaining recreation of a true story that defined Formula One for years and, in many ways, defied fiction, such was its stupendous journey and finale. Inevitable comparisons can be made with the magnificent 'Senna' documentary film and just like it, 'Rush' provides a story that will appeal to motor racing enthusiasts and the uninitiated in equal measures.",

This movie was one of the most popular racing movies that people can't stop watching this awesomeness.Rush is a movie that everyone loves. I love F1 movies like Le mans, Driven, Grand prix, and much more. So, the ending was great that Niki Lauda and James Hunt were still rivals and they ended the movie so great. And when I first saw this I couldn't stop watching this beautiful movie and as an extra bonus this was based on a true story. So, this movie deserves a 100/100 because this is the most popular movie ever. I believe they worked so hard on it. They should get a lot of money because this movie took forever to work on it.",

            "content": "An intelligent grab advantages from enemies rather than fool's profitable from friends.This movie made me realized that sometimes enemies knows us more than our friends or even better known than we know ourselves and sometimes the person who does not required us to deceased is them because it would be dispirited if one day our enemies who we have raced for entire life they are departed, therefore having good enemies consequently having friends and this is an essence of this movie \"Rush\".\"Rush\" is the movie that included comedy, drama, 70's and especially for anyone who interested in rivalry. This movie is based on the true story between two greatest racers James Hunt (Christ Hemsworth from The Avengers and Thor) and Niki Lauda (Daniel Bruhl). Two of them are first seen in competition in 1970 at a Formula 3 race at Crystal Palace. It was not a very impressing start between them, and increasingly more and more until the two are raised up to Formula 1. They completed throughout in racing and living, pushing them to the breaking point, both physically and mentally.\"James\" is a real British bad boy racer who is always thirsty for victory in racing, and dares to take a bet with his life because he considered this is the charm of this sport. While he was living out off the race enjoy partying and women. Although married, but he still preferred to lived like play boy. His abilities and handsome face make him become star in the field especially for girls.Contrary to \"Niki\" he is an Austrian driver with talent of tuning cars. Niki focused on planning in advanced and discipline as vital. He is not the person who would like to bet his life on the race and perceive as stupid idiot to do that. Because of his characteristics, so he not a big fan of most people likes James but he doesn't care. Niki preferred to lives in the way of peace with his wife more than going out in society.In love angle is superbly catered by Olivia Wilde (Hunt's first wife Suzy) and the gorgeous Alexandra Maria Lara - the bane of fame \u2013 as the future Marlene Lauda. Both give quality performances.Two of them are very different, so it is not surprising that they are incompatible. But that pressure automatically becomes impetus for two of them especially in 1976 Grand Prix Competition race of round 10th that is the main incidence of the story (and it was the year that Formula 1 fans hailed that most enjoyable) craving to his overcome opponent make James begin to race back on top form again, similarly with Niki who had the accident and has made him to nearly halt his career but while being treated for his facial injuries and almost losing all of his right ear, he is still on the first placed. James is getting closer more and more to the first place. This fact motivates him to return to racing again just only 42 days later in The Grand Prix Competition race of round 13th at Monza, Italy. At that round he end the race with ranked 4th and completed The Grand Prix tournament as the secondary world championship with points behind his main opponent \"James Hunt\" just only one single point. But the following year, Lauda was successful again by winning The Grand Prix and got his second world championship. This is an impulse that may not push as much as family or friends.This movie \"Rush\" makes me realized that in competitions, whether in any sports, the important things is not only winning \u2013 losing or to be a champion but it is to have worthy competitor because opponent constituted the main factor for us to improve ourselves continuously. Provided that none competitors, we might gloat stop improving ourselves which may impact negatively us for differentiation such as a former major company in business association that have been insolvent because of improvidence. This movie directed by Ron Howard, producer and director. He has directed numerous movies and becomes famous from a movie \"A beautiful mind\" (Biography and Drama film) in 2001 and Apollo 13 in 1995, which earned Howard the Academy Award for Best Director. In addition to the drama made out well, distribute actors' role appropriately, also well done in the racing scenes, given thrill emotions and risks behind steering wheel as well. When combined with the script and the performances of the main characters, especially Daniel extremely outstanding as Niki, while Chris exceedingly cool till has emanated the gods Thor images. The attention in details is excellent. Even though the tracks are not by the facts for understandable reason. The cars, helmets, the sponsors and even the sequences alignment of the Formula 1 cars are all authentic. This movie made spectators feels like it's happening in the 70's.Even you are not the big fan of Formula 1 but if you takes time to watch this movie just 123 minutes, it will be imprinted your memory forever. However, if anyone interested in Formula 1, 70's, cars, great movie, or just want to follow Ron Howard's film, then Rush is the best options for you.",

We watched a recent documentary about the relationship between Lauda and Hunt that was much more interesting and I believe (having met them both personally) closer to the truth. It would have better with more original footage and covered the relationship with the team more at an engineering level. Having said that the intensity and 110% commitment from F1 drivers cam across very well and the dismissal of the risk was shown well. The scenes of Lauda's recovery were quite shocking as I am sure they really were. Still I give it 7 out of 10.",

For the most part, the film is proficiently acted and directed; an effective, generically crafted sports drama. My impression, however, is that there is surely some integral material that just didn't make the final cut (for whatever reasons). The most striking thought I had at the conclusion of this film is that it is almost entirely devoid of any character development. These characters are there, they're racing fools, and that's apparently enough motivation for all of the story's players. The story never really penetrates any real emotional depth. And that's okay, I don't want to complain because the movie is not the one I wanted to see nor is it the one I would have made.

After many movies like \"Driven\" and the movie about Michel Vaillant I had lost faith, I never expected a Hollywood movie or from any other place to be about motorsports and to be decent and this one is... but it fails in many places.The biggest sin from this film is that it highlights James Hunt too much, while he was not too far from the average driver then when it comes to off-track methods. Meanwhile, it absolutely under- appreciates how much Niki Lauda did for F1 racing. Lauda was one of the first F1 drivers you could call an athlete. He did a lot of work beyond being a driver, he stayed fit and always pushed his team to build better machines, he actually changed the sport. Meanwhile, Hunt was just another driver with a liking for alcohol, drugs and women but just above average both with his vices and with his driving.Another thing that really upsets me about the film is how the racing scenes are done. In this era of CGI-augmented action scenes I was expecting a lot more than just some stylized craziness that almost reminded me of the Speed Racer movie. I am more than sure the production could have built replica cars, use some proper drivers painted in green and use CGI to make everything look closer to real life. It saddens me to see the best racing scenes from the 60s and 70s have not be topped.Overall a film with good intentions, some very bad decisions when it comes to style while highlighting the wrong guy. I hope Ron Howard gives the genre another go soon, maybe with some grand prix motorcycling racers (Agostini vs Hailwood, Roberts vs Sheene, Australia vs USA, etc).",

This had to be a fabulous basis for a film because of the real life twists and turns which actually occurred leading up to the final showdown in the last race of the season in Japan. I advise anyone to catch that documentary if they can as it is pretty thrilling and gives lots of vox pop from those who were there. Back to the film though, it's very good and the action sequences are pretty phenomenal, everything to keep any petrol head, 14 year old boy or even his giddy girlfriend on the edge of the seat. Daniel Bruhl is a great Nikki Lauda, all serious and autistic. Alexandra Maria Lara is uncanny as his graceful and dignified wife. The only weakness in the film is the casting of Chris Hemsworth. He manages to look the part but never really captures the essence of Hunt who was far more complex than given credit in the film. He also can't manage Hunts witticisms and if you YouTube James Hunt, you will find that the real James's delivery is much funnier and more droll. Advice to Hemsworth, stick to the beefcake roles. Go see the movie at the cinema as the race scenes are better there",

Its too tough to maintain sanity wen we are at the top of our game.... but he did the right thing...because he had a dependency....................Also the efficiency of the Formula one racing at rainy track could have been improved drastically if : a) EJECTOR SEATS should be installed in those F1 vehicles, as we do in fighter aircrafts...... accidental burns could be reduced to almost 90- 95% (as long as driver is conscious)b) F1 cars should have a proper hood. They don't add those, maybe the reason might be to achieve the optimal speed and making the vehicle more aerodynamically stable. In that case, they could have added something like \"HELMET VISOR WIPERS\" .... this should give a sufficient vision to the drivers and enable them to utilize their potential to the fullestBravo Director !!",

Bruhl was especially impressive since he and Niki Lauda look similar. Even thought I knew about the whole story of Nikki Lauda's crash and how he managed to return in such a short period of time and who eventually won the championship that year I couldn't help not being drawn in to the film.Supporting cast were also excellent and the locations in the film were beautiful.

Filled with amazing visuals, spicy story lines and superb castings, Rush has well and truly solidified it's position in the entertainment world.

This film has instances where you are gripping the edge of your seat while the leads are racing in a physical and metaphorical battle with each others personalities. This is also a film that has two amazing performances from superhero Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Bruhl. Both give convincing and memorable performances that makes the film much more interesting than other actors could do. I have to say that Bruhl gave the best performance of the film because you relate to his push to be the best and his bluntness to all his instructions to his team.The other performances from Olivia Wilde, Julian Rhind-Tutt and Natalie Dormer are all short but memorable. Overall I can not recommend this film enough. If you get the chance see this film.",

It's a dramatic true- story-telling emotional piece of art.The cast is really wisely chosen. Chris Hemsworth, who I already liked in the Thor- and Avengers-Movies did a great job just like the wifes of the both stars.

As James Hunt progresses through the formula driving leagues, his rival Nikki Lauder bought his way into Ferrari. There are multiple arguments between Hunt and Lauder, as the season goes on there is a fight for the title between our two main characters. The turning point is when they are on a race day and the rain is pouring down, Lauder suggests to call of the race, Hunt comes in and notices that if they call of the race Lauder will win the championship. They go ahead with the race and Lauder has a crash, causing severe burns. While Lauder is out Hunt wins most races. In the end it is Hunt who wins the championship. I like the twist in the true story that it is not always a happy ending. Lauder is still alive to this day, but Hunt sadly passed away at the age of 45 due to a heart attack. So if you fancy watching a fast action film, I would definitely recommend this film and I rate this film an amazing 8/10.",

The film covers their early lives and forays into motor sport but its primary focus is the 1976 Formula 1 season when Lauda is the defending champion and Hunt, his closest challenger to the crown. What follows leaves both of them scarred forever. Lauda wins most of the Grand Prix(s) in the first half of the season leaving him in a seemingly unbeatable position in the table. Then came the Nurnburgring Grand Prix in West Germany. There were concerns about the safety of the track but the race still went on which resulted in Lauda's vehicle catching fire after sustaining a rear suspension failure. Lauda sustains severe burns and is rushed to the hospital, fighting for his life. James Hunt meanwhile manages to cover ground on the now recovering Lauda, much to the latter's frustration. Lauda returns to the circuit after just 6 weeks out but his efforts go in vain as Hunt is crowned champion.Niki Lauda is played to near perfection by the diminutive but charismatic Daniel Bruhl. There is an astounding similarity in their resemblances and actions which Lauda himself had admitted while giving the go ahead to the movie. Chris Hemsworth does an amazing job of playing the cheeky James Hunt as well.This complete package will absolutely blow your mind!",

It definitely feels like a Hollywood blockbuster sort of movie, I'll just say that. James Hunt seems like an annoyingly prideful person with a super inflated ego who thinks way too highly of himself. While Niki Lauda seems kind of arrogant and haughty. I'm only 15 minutes in and I can already tell that the biggest problem with this movie is that the main characters are unlikable. \n\nI guess I find it pointless and silly that the whole story is about two guys who hate each other and their rivalry that continues to persist through the years. To me it's like, meh whatever lol. For a movie that's grounded in reality and acts as a biopic, it feels pretty unrealistic sometimes. They over-glamorize certain things which makes it look phony or ridiculous. \n\nFinally some great genuine humor when Niki and the pretty girl get stuck in the countryside of Italy and they're trying to get a lift and a car stops only to show its two Italian guys fanboying over Niki instead of paying attention to the pretty girl. It sucks to see that it wasn't until Niki had a bad accident that he became more human and humbled. But I guess we each have to go through our own problems, trials and tribulations in order to become a better version of ourselves. That was really admirable of Niki to go back and race in a Grand Prix only just gotten out of the hospital. I like how James sort of became protective over Niki - bashing that one rude reporters face in after his stupid question to Niki. You can tell James feels guilty and really bad for not supporting Niki's suggestion that rainy day. What I don't understand is why the frick didn't they postpone the race? Those conditions were extremely dangerous and hazardous to drive in, yet they still went on with it. I guess the head honchos of the Grand Prix in Japan didn't care at all about the drivers safety, unbelievable. \n\nI think the most interesting aspect of the movie was how complex the relationship between Niki and James was. The rivalry started out legitimate, then it turned into a media sensation, but then at the end it was all just for show. In the end, they had a respect for one another and kind of looked out for one another. I thought that was pretty beautiful. Niki learned to be more human and friendly, while James learned to be more humble and less of a show off. It actually turned out to be quite a beautiful story of how a rivalry can actually become a meaningful experience where two people can learn and benefit from one another. Niki was smart, he took precautions and lived a slower life while James was more live fast die young, and die pretty young he did at age 45 from a heart attack. An interesting and complex relationship between two people that hated each other but ended up being something prosperous for one another. \n\nOverall I thought it was a good movie, even though I almost gave up during the first half. Luckily, the second half picked up and it got much better, with the story becoming more gripping and exciting. I think what I loved most of all was seeing all the changes in the relationship between Niki and James and how each one learned from the other and benefitted in some way. They pushed each other to become better. The movie does suffer from a plethora of cliches, but I understand that it's based on a true story so its whatever. The movie also serves as really good commentary on how we present ourselves to the world vs. how we really feel inside. In the end, even though it was a good story, I don't think I'll be watching it again. I do recommend it though.",

The parallels run rampant, with both films involving racecar driving, two male protagonists, and plenty of high-octane competition scenes. The relationship between Bruhl and Hemsworth, unlike Bale and Damon, manifests as a rivalry rather than a working relationship. The way in which the two develop their relationship satisfies the viewer, yet feels contrived. In the moment, one feels the thrills and the painstaking analysis in the contrast of the two men's approaches, but this contrast reeks of oversimplification and lack of nuance. Bruhl performs marvelously and Hemsworth decently, despite being outshone. Alexandra Maria Lara probably chews the most scenes after these two, despite Olivia Wilde also being around, but both of the relationships around these two felt slightly underdeveloped and unfocused. It was nice to see a familiar face in Stephen Mangan, although he had little to do. Natalie Dormer's involvement irked me, as she was sexualised from the first moment and then discarded. I understand that this reflected the life of Hemsworth in all of its profligacy, but I feel she possesses more talent than that role offered. All in all, I find FvF preferable in the niche category of racecar films.",

On and off the track these rivals clash yet while maintaining the upmost respect for one another and the sport of racing.

The set up of shots during all the races were impeccable leaving you feeling like you're in the race yourself, bravo to the cinematographer. With Hans Zimmer helming the score we hear the tone set beautifully. The deep introspects of each respected driver was also very well done with no wasted moments. Daniel Bruhl played his role with magic portraying the real drive and obsession it takes to be champion. Chris Hemsworth is also quite impressive also, portraying the hotheaded, overcompensating playboy quite naturally.   \nAll in all the extreme attention to detail makes for a completely perfect film.",

This dynamic makes for a highly entertaining interchange between Hemsworth and Bruhl who give individually great performances.  'Rush' didn't need to be a 2 and a half hour pseudo-epic unlike the aforementioned film I brought up at the beginning.  Clocking in at 2 hours, it was paced better, far more engaging, and had characters that I actually cared about.  Not many racing movies have crash sequences that were this potent for me.  Whenever one of the main characters crashed, I myself feared for their lives and safety.  In the end, while it can't escape some of it's genre's conventions throughout the movie and more so the finale, 'Rush' manages to be an example of a genre movie that doesn't have to be average thanks to its tropes.  It takes these tropes and executes them in a unique way thanks to a strong script and evident care from all involved.",

Unlike the former, Rush focuses much less on the odyssey of crafting the perfect machine and instead focuses on the drive behind the drivers, specifically the brutal rivalry between Niki Lauda and James Hunt. Daniel Buhl and Chris Hemsworth are both perfect in their roles as the two tenacious men. There interplay is what gives the film much of its electric energy. At first, their relationship seemed to boil down to cliched trash talk, but it soon develops into something much more compelling. The film explores the way that both men need to be at each others heels (or tires) in order to thrive. This connection sways between hatred and admiration throughout the course of the narrative and doesn't quickly fall into the predictable track of hidden friendship. Ron Howard controls all of these dramatic elements with a strong and assured hand. Anthony Dod Mantle's frenetic style, that is present in all of his works with Danny Boyle, is very advantageous to the wild action of the speedway. However, I find the dynamic lighting and dark color palate to be less favorable, as it makes everything look like one of Zack Snyder's graphic novel adaptions. It takes the film out of reality when what it should be doing is portraying the dangerous reality in theses true events. Despite this, the racing sequences are quite good and I would have liked for them to get more screen time. Hans Zimmer's score is as mesmerizing as usual. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013Overall: Even with sublime work an all technical levels, Rush manages to get it's greatest win with a true story of man .vs. man .vs. fate that will should surely get you heart racing. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013Highlight: There are more than a few unexpected turns and bumps along the narrative that could have been agonizingly straight-forward.",

The character work from Daniel Br\u00fchl and Chris Hemsworth is great, and that\u2019s what gets you invested in the story. Niki Lauda (the man that Daniel Br\u00fchl plays) proves to be the most fascinating person in the film, because he has such a uniquely abrasive personality, and yet shows that there are some emotions underlying that rough exterior. I was definitely interested in where his journey would end up. The fact that this was all based on real events made it that much more powerful, knowing that he had overcome so much in his life to be a success. James Hunt (the man that Chris Hemsworth plays) is much less fascinating. He is simply a jerk that seems to care about no one. That\u2019s where Rush lost me. The one lame \u201csave the cat\u201d moment that they give Hunt is not nearly enough to make me like him. The end didn\u2019t click all that well, because I couldn\u2019t buy that one conversation and a single good deed could turn their rivalry into a friendship. I was afraid he was going to remain the protagonist for the entire film, and his tedious relationships would become an important plot point. Thankfully, later on the movie focused in on Lauda much more, and his intriguing marriage. I enjoyed aspects of Rush more than I expected, particularly the acting, but it never could get over the hump to be a movie I loved. Frankly, I think an ESPN documentary on the subject would be a bit more effective.",

Chris Hemsworth (hot off his first Avengers film) and Daniel Bruhl (of Inglorious Basterd acclaim) are tremendously likeable in their on screen rivalry, with Bruhl's edging a victory as a spitting image of the famed Niki Lauda. Combine these performances with the stunning vision of Ron Howard and you can feel the tension with every hairpin turn as you try to decide who to cheer for. An adrenaline packed lap around the track, Rush is one of the best things to come out about an italian racecar driver that doesn't have a banana trailing from his car.",

            "content": "SCOTT: (Dr. Scott Allison, Professor of Psychology, University of Richmond) Greg, I m fascinated that they would make a movie about Rush Limbaugh.\n\nGREG: (Greg Smith, Founder of Agile Writers of Richmond, VA) It s not a movie about the Right, it s about going in circles to the Left!\n\nSCOTT: Bahaha, good one, Greg. Rush is the story of the rivalry during the 1970s between two Formula 1 drivers, James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) and Niki Lauda (Daniel Br hl). The movie opens with the two of them bumping cars during a 1970 Formula 3 race in England. Hunt wins the race but Lauda is outraged by Hunt s disregard for safety. Lauda then borrows a large sum of money that enables him to make it to the big time of Formula 1.  Hunt also joins a Formula 1 team and the two men resume their rivalry on the big stage.\n\nGREG: Hunt is a playboy. He is out for a good time. He wants to have fun. And the only thing he wants more than to have fun is to win. Lauda is meticulous, methodical, and rigorous. The only thing he wants is to win. These two men have the same goals in mind, but they have two different ways to get it. And it is these differences that make up the conflict in this movie.\n\nSCOTT: Greg, Rush is an impressive movie with an impeccable cast and outstanding direction from Ron Howard.  I can t imagine two better actors for the roles of Hunt and Lauda. These two men remind me of fire and ice, two contrasting styles reminiscent of Kirk and Spock in Star Trek. The resulting tension between Hunt and Lauda, both on and off the track, is pure sizzle and spark.  It s rare to see such a powerful rivalry between two sports celebrities portrayed so well on film.\n\nGREG: Scott, we saw this last week in Prisoners. Two men with the same goal but with opposite ways of approaching it. Lauda is hands-on all the way. Off the track, he works day and night preparing his car. He uses the latest materials, trims every ounce to make his car lighter and faster. On the track, he observes every rule and plays up to but not over the margins of safety. Hunt, on the other hand, is very hands off. He expects his team to work the details of his car and the business of running the race. When the race is over, he s off drinking and carousing leaving Lauda to go home to his dutiful wife. During the race, Hunt crosses the line from safe to reckless - doing whatever it takes to pass the next racer and win the race.\n\nSCOTT: You note the resemblance to last week s movie Prisoners, but I see some important differences.  In Prisoners, the two heroes share the same goal of catching an abductor, but in Rush there is a clear and intense competition between two heroes whose goals are in conflict. Plus, in Rush we see our two hero-celebrities over time develop a grudging respect for each other. In fact, I d say that this growing mutual admiration is an important element of their character transformations during their hero journeys. The pivotal moment in Hunt s development occurs when he punches a reporter who disrespects Lauda during a press conference. Prior to this moment we see only hatred from Hunt toward Lauda, but Lauda s recovery has forever changed Hunt s opinion of Lauda. And of course the key transformational moment for Lauda takes place in the hospital when he shows remarkable resilience in the face of debilitating injury. Watching these two men change and grow in many ways -- as drivers, as husbands, as businessmen, and as rivals -- is a sheer joy to watch.\n\nGREG: What Scott is referring to is a story element that is in all the trailers, but occurs late in the film. Lauda, against his better judgement, enters into a race and has a terrible accident where he is burned all over his body and face. Lauda undergoes painful surgeries to recover soon enough to get back into the race season and contend with Hunt for the cup. What I walk away with from this movie is how much these men come to admire each other and still maintain their own styles. Lauda is ever analyzing and refining his craft. Hunt is constantly looking to have fun while he can. But each learns that the other s way of approaching the race has its merits. Another buddy-hero story I m reminded of is Bill Gates and Steve Jobs who had different ways of approaching the computer industry (Gates in favor of open systems and Jobs favoring closed systems). In the end there is a grudging admiration of the other.\n\nSCOTT: I like that Gates-Jobs analogy a lot, Greg, and perhaps the recent film Jobs would have been a more effective movie if it had focused more on that rivalry with the same effectiveness as Rush. Ron Howard deserves great credit for telling a great dual-hero story that anyone can appreciate, even people like me who have no interest in auto racing. The key is to create compelling, multi-dimensional characters whom we care about and who undergo significant transformation. This was done to near perfection in Rush.\n\nGREG: Rush is why I go to the movies. I fell right into the lives of these two men. I felt the power of racing and the will to win. I came to admire what each man offered and could see myself in their places. When I look back on Rush and wonder what could have been done better, I can t think of a single thing. The film lasted 123 minutes and I wanted more when the story was done. And this is nothing less than what you d expect from a Ron Howard film. Every detail of the story was attended to: from the 70 s look and feel, to the speeding cars, to the realistic crashes. I was hooked from the beginning. For easily one of the best films we ve seen this year, I give Rush 5 out of 5 Reels. And for telling a two-handed story with precision and style, I give Rush 5 out of 5 Heroes. Movie:  Heroes:\n\nSCOTT: I thoroughly enjoyed Rush and am happy to award it 4 Reels out of 5 and 4 Heroes out of 5. The reason I am hesitant to give the full 5 Reels and 5 Heroes is based on my belief that seeking to become the best car racer in the world is much more a quest for personal glory than it is a heroic quest. Last week I gave Prisoners two 5 ratings because the heroic goal was to save lives. We see no such virtuous goal in Rush. Still, I agree, Greg, that Rush is one of the best films of the year. The two main characters are celebrities, not heroes, but it s still a riveting and impeccably-told story. The performances were exemplary all-around and I anticipate an Oscar nomination for Best Director for Ron Howard. Movie: Heroes:",

            "content": "A well crafted character story that may be Ron Howard's best film to date.\n\nTwo-time Academy Award (R) winner Ron Howard (A Beautiful Mind, Frost/Nixon) teams once again with two-time Academy Award (R)-nominated writer Peter Morgan (Frost/Nixon, The Queen) on Rush, a spectacular big-screen re-creation of the merciless and legendary 1970s Formula 1 rivalry between gifted English playboy James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth of The Avengers, Thor) and his disciplined Austrian opponent, Niki Lauda (Daniel Br\u00fchl of Inglourious Basterds, The Bourne Ultimatum). \n\nI'll be honest, this was the first Ron Howard film I had ever seen in my young life. It left an amazing impression on me, to the point where I praised Ron Howard and his ability to drive character development. Then, I watched some of his other films and I wondered, was this really his only huge highlight? Whether it is or not, it has nothing to do with the fact that \"Rush\" is an amazing film that does nothing but good. \n\nThe thing that I love about this film is its character study. This is based on the true story between drivers James Hunt and Niki Lauda, who had the biggest rivalry in Formula 1 racing at the time. It's amazing how Ron Howard told this story, as there were no real protagonists or antagonists. You have two polar opposite people, who act differently and view things differently, but they have the same goal in mind. You see their upbringings and downfalls and in the end, you can see that they're both just people with dreams. They each have their flaws for sure, but it's easy to cheer for both of them and want them to succeed. \n\nNone of this could've been accomplished without our two main actors. Both Hemsworth and Bruhl put up some of their best performances to date. They each, respectively, bring out the personality and drive of their real life portrayals. I felt like I really got to know who these people were and what they did in their life. That's due to their ability to play their roles and bring that emotional drive with them. \n\nI feel like when directors and / or producers look to tell the story of someone's biography or a true event, this would be a great example of that. Like I've said multiple times, both Ron Howard and the cast know how to tell a story about characters. The story is filled with interesting character conflict and it's done so well that you don't necessarily see either side as the villain (because neither side is the villain). It's really hard to accomplish that in a film and if you automatically side with Hemsworth because he's more recognizable, you're just being stubborn. This is such a well made film and I have to give it credit for that.\n\nIn the end, I truly thought this movie was amazing. This is how you should tell a story and how you should execute it. I really don't have any gripes with this film and in fact, I though it was near perfect.",

The part where Lauda returns to the track after his injury and finishes in fourth gave me genuine chills for the entire scene. I can't say how much I respect that about people.

I was pleasantly surprised by the amount of depth and emotional story telling this film possess. From its brilliant script that infuses humor, drama, and a story about a fascinating rivalry to its impeccable and detailed oriented direction, this film succeeds on every level.\r Ron Howard\u2019s direction is extremely noteworthy as I felt like a part of the journey and involved with the characters as I cheered them on. In the beginning, I was rooting for James, but as the movie progresses and things unravel, I was cheering for Niki. However, as the movie moves forward, I couldn\u2019t choose one over the other. This is the type of engagement that I love in movies, it keeps the audience involved and contently thinking about every situation and the characters as a whole.\r This film is well edited and shot as well. I couldn\u2019t find a useless or uninteresting moment in this film. Everything flowed very well and the film moved at a brisk pace. It felt as every shot or sequence is catered to moving and developing the characters and their story forward. The racing sequences are well shot and make you feel a part of the race. My heart rushed when characters successfully made narrow life endangering turns. It is a really good film to look at as the scenery and environment crafted feels inviting and absorbing.\r The cast in this film is superb. Chris Hemsworth gives his finest performance to date as a carefree playboy. Even though his character James Hunt doesn\u2019t appear serious, he struggles with his inner demons trying to be taken a bit more seriously. Daniel Bruhl also gives and equally impressive, if not better, performance as Niki Lauda an arrogant self-absorbent racer. It\u2019s interesting to see his character go from caring only about himself and racing to something more important. The greatest aspect of the characters are their interactions. I really enjoy how they can\u2019t stand each other, but can\u2019t be successful without each other either. While they hate one another, they find a mutual respect for the other. It\u2019s quite endearing to see how they have each others back off the tracks.\r Overall, \u201cRush\u201d is an amazing movie and totally worth your time. It\u2019s a movie that has everything, from drama to humor to love. The greatest aspect of the film is its truly brilliant and masterful score by Hans Zimmer. His score gives the right amount of emotional punch along with improving everything we see and giving the film a greater amount of importance. I give this film an extremely high 4.5/5, a well oiled film that has no wasted parts.",

Still a great rivalry, great story, I am actually changing my rating from an 8 to a 9 as I write this and think about the movie, definitely worth a watch whether you are an F1 fan or not.

Rush is probably one of the best films I\u2019ve seen this year, maybe even in my life. Rush is definitely one of my favorite films. I love the direction, the sound, the cinematography, acting and most importantly the story. It was incredible.\r The acting in this film is captivating. Daniel Br\u00fchl is incredible, he hits the perfect mark at playing Nicki Lauda. Br\u00fchl commands the screen whenever he is on it, his screen presence is incredible. To be honest I think that the performance delivered by Br\u00fchl in Rush is going to get him a nomination for an Academy Award for sure. Hemsworth delivers probably the best performance of his career, Hemsworth delivers a mesmerising performance as the ladies\u2019 man and talented driver James Hunt, and Hemsworth\u2019s charismatic performance gives the film that extra kick which pushes it into top gear.\r Another feature of the film which I love is the cinematography, I love the up close in action shots of the races. I love the use of the position of the camera in the actual position it was in when the crash happened. I loved the beautiful shots from inside the engine, the phantom camera footage of the inside of the engine working, I also loved the use of the footage of fuel being lit inside the engine.\r Ron Howard is one of my favorite directors, I love the way he can bring those fun little jokes and looks from the characters. I love the attention to detail and the way he makes even people like me who dislike Formula 1, sit on the edge of their seat during the races.\r I loved absolutely everything about the film Rush and here is to hoping that it picks up as many awards as possible and gets the recognition a film of this calibre deserves.",

The first hour of the film concentrates on their rivalry, most of all their differences, leading up to to 1976 when the last race would determine who was the champ.\r As an example of the difference between the two men we meet Suzy Miller (Olivia Wilde) who Hunt proposes marriage after knowing for her for a minute and two years later she leaves him and marries Richard Burton while Lauda meets Marlene (Alexandra Maria Lara) and his marriage proposal to her seems more of well thought out decision to become part of his all work and no play. Marlene\u2019s steadfast belief in Lauda changes the latter\u2019s life and leads to the horrific and hero building second half of the movie.\r Director Ron Howard, with the help of director of photography Anthony Dod Mantle and the editors Dan Hanley and Mike Hill, takes you into the center of the cars, and the races, to the point you almost feel you know what the drivers feel behind the wheel whether it be driving in bright sunshine or beating rain hitting your helmet. As Marlene is shown being given and plugging in ear plugs it might not hurt for you to bring a pair to the theatre. In addition to the deafening sound of the racing cars there is additional, unnecessary, noise added by the music of Hans Zimmer on the soundtrack.\r Peter Morgan, who wrote the screenplay, shows you the difference between Hunt and Lauda and will have you rooting for one and then the other but he fails in not giving a payoff to that rivalry for the audience to cheer and though there are other characters on screen he doesn\u2019t really give them any depth but they bring more to the screen than written. Alexandra Maria Lara gives off more looks than words but her looks are meaningful while Olivia Wilde is a portrait of  a 1970s jet setter. Members of the race teams add realism to the film and Pierfrancesco Favino, as real race car driver Clay Regazzoni,  who competed with Hunt and Lauda, provides humor and heft when each is needed.  Chris Hemsworth shines as James Hunt and Daniel Bruhl as Nick Lauda matches him as an opposite who seems to carry the world on his shoulders. The two actors carry the movie on their shoulders and do an excellent job.\r Don\u2019t forget to bring earplugs and some of you get ready to take your eyes from the screen during the crash and hospital scenes! Keep in mind it is a movie!",

Hunt and Bruhl were both formula 1 drivers during the 70\u2032s and the movie tells us what happened during the years they both raced against each other.\r Chris Hemsworth may never get the Thor- stamp off him (and that isn\u2019t that bad since those movies make tonnes of money) but he is genuinly great in this film and the best part is that he isn\u2019t Thor. Chris Hemsworth portrayes James Hunt brilliantly. Hunt is a reckless playboy who is willing to risk his life in a car. Not only does Chris look the part, he also acts just like you would imagine Hunt acting. Daniel Bruhl as Niki Lauda is the polar opposite of Chris as Hunt. He is the rich, good boy who goes to bed early and who doesn\u2019t party all night. However Lauda and Hunt are not only nice guys and playboys respectably. They are much more than that: Lauda is kinda douchy and not actually the nice guy you would have in a typical movie. Hunt is also troubled and you can, much thanks to Chris\u2019s performance, see the scared side of the character. I can only say that the characters and the actors are the best part of the movie.\r Ron Howard is a very underrated director. He is a two time Academy Award winning director and yet he\u2019s never really mentioned in the top. He is however directing this film incredibly well. The editing is also fantastic, Daniel P. Hanley and Mike Hill are really sharp, working with quick cuts, my favorite technique. There was a certain sequence in the movie where the race wasn\u2019t shown but the result were presented through text on the screen. That directing and editing trick caught me of guard and I admire the wat it was handled.\r \u201cRush\u201d isn\u2019t really about racing. It focuses on the characters more than the cars and that\u2019s how I want my sport movies. Similar to \u201cWarrior\u201d (a review for wich can be found on this very site) I don\u2019t care for the sport in it, I care about the overall story. That being said, the sound of the motors and the way the characters (I seem to constantly come back to the characters) behave towards the sport are great and they kinda made me an ounce interested.\r I contend that John Williams is the greatest composer ever but I also believe that the best soundtrack for a movie is the one for \u201cInception\u201d, \u201cInceptions\u201d score is composed by Hans Zimmer. He also composed \u201cRush\u201d. Zimmer crafts a score with might similar to a motor and  with the emotion and passion of the driver. It\u2019s a beautiful soundtrack.\r A surprisingly good thing about the film is the product placement. It gave a form of credibility to the 70\u2032s racing.\r The only real complaint I have about the film is how the relationship between Niki Lauda and James Hunt progresses. While the development is great I didn\u2019t really buy into the way they went from non-respect to respect. I saw how they tried to introduce the growing friednship but it didn\u2019t translate that well ont the screen.\r Overall, \u201cRush\u201d is an intense, thrilling ride (pun intended) with the right focus and no real big flaws. It\u2019s good to see more from Chris Hemsworth and even better that his range as an actor increases. The movie is far from predictable (but if you know about the real life events you obviously know how it\u2019ll end), something that is hard to pull of in a sports movie. Even if you don\u2019t like racing, I think you\u2019ll love \u201cRush\u201d.",

From the choice soundtrack to Hunts flamboyant wardrobe the style effortlessly evokes the 1970\u2019s while resisting the temptation for nostalgia.The films greatest strength is the ambiguous nature with which it treats the central characters. Both Hunt and Lauda are presented as flawed, driven men, though completely different from one another in their approaches to the sport. It is never made clear who we are to root for and as the season has its ups and downs audience allegiances will turn almost from race to race.Hemsworth brings the same affable arrogance to Hunt as he did to his most famous creation but is also given an opportunity to add layers to the man and as the film progresses it becomes more and more clear that the cocksure attitude and flippant disregard for life frequently displayed by Hunt is only skin deep.Br\u00fchl\u2019s passionate Lauda drives the film with a sheer minded focus and determination that can at times be both admirable and incomprehensible.Through strong performances, dynamic direction and a sharp and evenly weighted script, Rush transcends its Formula One backdrop to focus on the nature of rivalry, sportsmanship and risk. Like all great rivalry films (see The Prestige, Warrior) it will split your allegiances, make you sympathize with and at times detest its characters and entertain regardless of your interest in the subject matter.",

His films are unabashedly focused on making the audience create a sense of empathy with his core hero, without contemplating any darker side the character(s) may have. \"Rush\", written by Peter Morgan, suffers from this problem  the rivalry between James Hunt and Niki Lauda could easily be the one that Tom Cruise and Val Kilmer personified onscreen in Tony Scott's \"Top Gun\" in 1986, with the difference that this time around, the so called hero, actually is presented as an egotistical man, without much depth or sense of empathy (or dignity for that matter). The film fails in creating these characters as something palpable or even relatable  they are nothing more than archetypes, namely the playboy vs. the conservative man, whereas the women in their lives, are given nothing more to do, other than stay in the background, look preoccupied, and have brief scenes of walking into frame (and quickly exiting). The film is successful in presenting the dynamic of the sport and the sense of excitement that always prevailed in it  the fantastic cinematographer Anthony Dod Mantle gives the film a look and treatment that are superb. Daniel Bruhl also manages to create an engaging performance, though it soon becomes a performance that runs always on a single view of the character. Though shot and impeccably recreated for the time it depicts, the film ultimately feels hollow and devoid of the emotion and excitement that always propelled these men and the fans to the circuits.

It's not because they respect what we do, driving round and round in circles.In a voiceover during Rush, we hear the voice of Formula 1 race car champion James Hunt (played by Chris Hemsworth): \u201cI have a theory why women like racing drivers. It's not because they respect what we do, driving round and round in circles. Mostly they think that's pathetic, and they're probably right. It's our closeness to death.\u201d That quote is not only a telling description of the personality of the character of James Hunt, as depicted in the film, but it also describes the absurd philosophy behind the \u201crush\u201d of race car driving, and probably any other sport that involves mortal danger. It is the thrill that attracts a certain kind of personality to this dangerous sport, and sadly it may also be the thrill that attracts thousands of spectators.\r The morbid appeal of a struggle to the death goes back to ancient sacrificial rites and the gladiatorial games of ancient Rome. There is something fascinating about seeing an athlete who stands before the crowds knowing that he must look death in the face and that he may very well lose the battle. It is the misguided sense of valor, courage, and destiny normally reserved for soldiers and knights, who at least are willing to sacrifice themselves for a noble cause\u2014they are ready to die for country, king, faith, and family. Military courage is the stuff of heroes and protectors, but race car driving? Not really.\r The 20% mortality rate mentioned in the film may have improved since the 1970's. Apparently safety measures have been stepped up so that race circuits are much safer than they were 10-20 years ago; the Formula 1 design has also been improved for safety, although the open cockpit of the car still presents a danger to the driver, while proposals to cover the cockpit are controversial. Thirty-two Formula 1 drivers have died during a World Championship Grand Prix, the last one being Brazilian driver Ayrton Senna who died in 1994 at the San Marino Grand Prix. The count goes up to 50 if you include drivers who were killed during lesser events (the last death in 2002), and that figure does not include marshals and other bystanders who have been killed on the track.\r The film tries to delve beneath the obvious reasons that race car drivers are attracted to the sport, which would be an obsession with automobile mechanics and design as well as an obsession with speed. The story revolves around two historic Formula 1 titans\u2014British driver James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) and Austrian driver Niki Lauda (Daniel Bruhl). Hunt is a dashing hedonist who is addicted to cars, women, cigarettes, and alcohol; Lauda is by contrast a stoic, who is quiet, dedicated, and believes that true success lies in the strictest form of discipline. If Hunt is a playboy, Lauda is a monk (although Lauda says he was not as strict as depicted in the film.) They are both attracted to the sport but come armed with completely opposing philosophies. For Hunt, the racetrack is a forum for attention, celebrity and the sensual experience of life; it is his temple for living in the moment and seizing the day. For Lauda, the racetrack is a different kind of temple, one that demands an almost religious reverence and meditation, and where he connects to the deepest part of his soul. The two men are both rivals and friends, and the film doesn't mention that in real life they were once roommates.\r Ron Howard's film sets out not just to dramatize a significant race year in the lives of both drivers, but to show how the two differing philosophies affected them both on and off the track. Lauda suffered devastating burn injuries to his face and lungs in a Grand Prix accident of 1976, which caused him to be disfigured for life. He went into a coma and almost died after that race, but then he mustered up the intense will and discipline for which he was known, and he climbed back into his Formula 1 Ferrari just six weeks after the accident, which was nothing short of a miracle. James Hunt achieved his dream of becoming a Grand Prix champion that same year, and a few years later left the sport to become a commentator. Hunt, a heavy drinker and smoker, died of a heart attack at the age of 45.\r In another voiceover, this time by the character of Niki Lauda, who in real life won three Grand Prix championships and is now 64 and retired, we hear these words as he speaks of the race that changed him forever: \u201cThe other thing I'm remembered for is what happened on August 1, 1976, when I was chasing him [Hunt] like an a**hole.\u201d And that line, perhaps better than anything else, aptly describes the philosophical absurdism of car racing.",

I may be ignorant to things they may have missed, but what they showed was very satisfying and felt like it covered a good bit of information. However, I cannot say the same for the stuff before they get into 1976. The foundations of the rivalry and both drivers' personal lives before 1976 were shown, but poorly put together at best as things seemed to be \"rush\"ed through and it ultimately left me feeling very unsatisfied. For the first bit of the film, things seemed to happen with no background to them and it almost felt like the film was just skipping from one unrelated scene to another.

The way it pumped blood through my head gave me a rush. But quite a few movies manage to do that, and it was solely not for this that I liked the movie. I loved its art direction. It got me believing that I really was looking through a window into the 70s and witness this rivalry replayed.\r There are quite a few movies out there vying for our attention. They have thrilling car races or chases, and the intention is only that_ to amaze us with the mind-boggling stunts. But Rush endeavoured to be much more than a film about racing cars. It wanted to make us experience how these drivers live, why they choose this profession, how they feel during the time they are behind the wheel, and how much victory means to them. In that task Rush has succeeded beyond my expectations. It set out to do something I had not even expected of it. So it sets itself apart and should be taken more seriously.\r Rush is narrated by Niki Lauda (Daniel Br\u00fchl) at key moments of his career. His rivalry with James is spun out of context by the frenzied media. Surely they don't see eye to eye but when such levels of adrenaline are pumping through your veins and you risk everything to gain victory, even the slightest setback makes you envy and loathe your opponent to the extreme.\r Both the main characters start off as rookies. Their first encounter and tussle may be fictionalised. Both of them are stupendously talented. But they must make their mark in order to gain attention from the big names in the game. Drivers finish the race but the ones making them the heroes in the public eye are the ones with the cars. And they would have to vie for names such as Ferrari and McLaren to even begin to have some kind of a chance to be among those who finish first.\r I found the acting sufficient for the believability of the characters. James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) came across as the universal bad boy with a heart of gold. He certainly has the charisma to pull it off. Lauda was much more complex. He is clearly the type who aim high in life and are willing to do everything to achieve their goals. So Br\u00fchl had his work cut out for him but he surprised and rose to the occasion. There are their other sides which are gradually revealed and make them more human and thus more worthy of admiration. It was nice to see Olivia Wilde given a role in a movie that was not a box office bomb or a disaster with the critics.\r We are shown glimpses of races around the world intertwined with scenes from the private lives of these two men. The racing scenes were short and well captured. The character development was well done and certainly painted distinct personalities. They joke and verbally spar in their own ways, calling each other names to incite angry responses. No one's the bad guy. They shuffle as the more sympathetic character throughout the movie. I'm glad they didn't resort to add more conflict and contrived fictional gimmicks to offset each other to add drama, which would have ruined it for me. I was constantly waiting for this to happen, for it to slip up and reveal mediocrity, even expecting it, for it is a film about cars, but I was pleased to be proven wrong.\r You can have a thrilling movie about car racing or you could have a movie about the lives of drivers with sparse action, but Rush combined both perfectly. Everything was in the right proportions. It had the story, the entertainment value, the mood-changing quality and the effects. The races were brilliantly done. The accidents when they happened were rightly worrying and realistic and not exaggerated. The cars themselves were pure beauties. And I found myself agreeing with the line of dialogue that men love cars more than they love women.\r I dare say that Rush has succeeded in supplanting all car racing movies I had previously watched and become my favourite from the genre. But the reason I loved it is it made me think about the importance of human life and why it must not be risked for thrill seeking and for the entertainment of others who do not have the guts to perform such kinds of feats.",

As I know of him, he never failed to transform biographical stories into a movie. In fact, many of his movies are my favourites. This time he picked up a true story of two rivalry formula 1 drivers from the 70s. This biographical sports drama was nothing short in all the aspects compared to his earlier movies. So his legacy continues with a series of masterpieces in his filmography. I am always fond of his works because the mix of sentiments in his movies is powerfully appealing just like I wanted. The emotion tool was very wisely utilized in this movie as well.\r The races from the movie were shot awesomely with the old automobile models and sets around. It was a perfect direction utilizing this inspiring true story with two great actors. It won't only tells about races but also the inexplicable friendship between them, which is hard to predict as we are not they. As per my observation I did not detect any flaws, especially races were exceptionally shot, totally to-notch. From the fast pace story narration due to the fine editing to background score and visual effects, we must recognize the A1 quality of the production house.\r This movie portrays about the 1976 Formula 1 season where two new comer drivers from Europe, James Hunt and Niki Lauda are considered the top rivalries to grab the world championship title. So their's stunning entry from lower class race to the big event, the clash between them were exhibited very well. Two equally great drivers with different mantras in their life as well implement in the race track was just mind blowing. The story was told from the perspective of both of them where narration frequently switches.\r Initially I was not favour to give it a shot. The reason behind it was the Chris Hemsworth, I am not a big fan of his performance. Most of his movies are commercially feel good kind ones so I was a bit hesitated to put my faith in this. And a couple of Ron Howard's last movies as well not like I expected but was just good. This movie completely reformed these two guys and redefined their's capability once again. Regretting for not saw it earlier, but feels good that I did not miss it after all. A highly recommended movie, which was one of the best sports movie from 2013 along with '42'.\r 9.5/10",

Like any well oiled machine, Howard is an expert of giving audiences a fundamentally linearLoud, proud, and relentless in its portrayal of sport rivals, Ron Howard\u2019s Rush is another entry into his formulaic and conventional directing resume. Like any well oiled machine, Howard is an expert of giving audiences a fundamentally linear narrative with striking and beautiful aesthetic choices, even if the narrative follows the  rivalry between two Formula One drivers whose careers and competition is anything but straight-cut.\r Rush isn\u2019t the best film of the year by far, and in terms of narrative the film suffers from clich\u00e9d plot-points, predictable sport film tropes and by-the-book autobiographical rules, but one of the highlights of Rush is the effortlessness of telling the story of two incredible men\u2019s lives, without making one or the other the lead protagonist or antagonist. Rush is the true story of two passionate and talented drivers whose race to becoming the Formula One World Champion is something quite unbelievable.\r The film begins in the middle of its narrative, at the beginning of the 1976 German Grand Prix in N\u00fcrburgring, mere moments before Niki Lauda (Daniel Br\u00fchl) experiences what is suspected to be a rear suspension failure that hospitalized him for a month and a half. We then flashback to 1970 at a Formula Three race in the Crystal Palace circuit in England where the rivalry between Lauda and James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) begins. Destined to be rivals since their initial meeting, the film follows the trails and tribulations of Lauda and Hunt\u2019s fight to the Formula One circuit. Lauda, a mechanical genius who uses his skills on cars to earn his spot beside Clay Regazzoni (Pierfrancesco Favino) and the Scuderia Ferrari racing team, shows skill as a engineer but suffers socially, proving to be somewhat inept when it comes to interacting with people. While Hunt, an unapologetic,  globetrotting playboy, seems to have no problems interacting with his fans (maybe a little too often). Where Hunt lacks for meticulous calculations and mechanical understanding, things Lauda posses, Hunt makes up for in raw talent, ambition and \u201cballs\u201d.\r The film chronicles not only an intense rivalry set in the dangerous world of Formula One Racing, but the film also depicts a rivalry of wits between two men, who suffer and sacrifice so much for respect in a world inhabited by high-adrelanline, death-defying racers.\r Rush is definitely a return to form for Howard, who, after the problematic and chaotic The Dilemma, had a lot to prove aesthetically and narratively. Aesthetically, Howard had his wheels spinning uncontrollably with inspiration. From the film\u2019s 1970\u2032s grainy look, to its very artistic slow-motion racing scenes (which acts as a nice irony to the sport), to the choice of camera angles when covering the pivotal scenes of the race, usually shooting at a very low angle, Howard does use the film to solidify his place as a stylistic filmmaker again, as he did previously with Cinderella Man, Apollo 13 and A Beautiful Mind.\r Howard surrounded himself with the best this time around, and made no mistakes. With a modest $38 Million budget for a Hollywood film, Howard was able to create an high-octane Formula One film, grounded as a character piece. Written by Peter Morgan (The Queen), shot by Anthony Dod Mantle (Slumdog Millionaire), Scored by Hans Zimmer (The Dark Knight trilogy), and produced by film-extraordinaire and longtime collaborator Brian Grazer, Rush is assembled just like any other team in the Formula One  meticulously and strategically.\r It also did not hurt that Howard was able to get Hemsworth out of Nordic armour and deliver his finest performance to date. The real star of the film is Br\u00fchl. Underrated and overlooked since his career-defining role in Tarantino\u2019s Inglorious Bastards, Br\u00fchl inhabits his rat-like character and shows the intolerable side of a man obsessed with perfection, discontent with happiness, and who shows no emotional response to the fast pace world which exists around him. Br\u00fchl\u2019s transformation into Lauda is one that will hopefully be acknowledged come award season.\r Rush is a good film. More of a solid entry into the autobiographical sport genre, much like 42 earlier this year, the film lacks an intensity most great sport films have, which is the intensity of the sport itself. Some of the greatest sport movies ever made use the sport to elevate character progression, intense emotion or moments that audiences cheer for. There was never a rousing moment of triumph, pleasure or extreme emotion with our characters that took place on the racetrack. Unfortunately for the film, some of the best scenes happen on the streets of Italy, in the hospital, or in restaurants and furnace rooms where the characters grow and evolve; the racetrack is just a forum for winning.",

It\u2019s a true story about the rivalry between formula 1 racers; James Hunt and Niki Lauda. Hunt, well played by Chris Hemsworth, is the  English playboy with a true talent for racing; and Lauda played by Daniel Bruhl is the arrogant, yet disciplined Austrian racer, with a knack for tactics. Bruhl does fantastic work in a co-lead performance, by perfectly capturing the physicality of the real life Lauda along with adding a weight of emotion to his character. Peter Morgan deserves some credit for penning these dynamic characters; and guiding the script through a few of its familiar rhythms was Ron Howard. Mr. Howard may not be an auteur but he knows how to make a good movie; and \u2018Rush\u2019 was a damn good one. He manages to elevate the film above the trappings that are typical of movies within this genre; and made it a relatively unpredictable ride, with a pair of fleshed-out characters. Speaking of ride, Anthony Dod Mantle\u2019s cinematography and the terrific sound mix placed us right in the heat of those intense car races, with fine detail. I was also particularly impressed with Daniel P.

I\u2019m afraid you cant help to compare rush to frost/Nixon which also directed by Howard and Written by Morgan, which is also based on a rivalry relationship, I suppose both films are very similar; but it is fair to say they both have different sorts of drama and a totally different emotional feeling.\rWe meet Mr hunt in the hospital we can immediately tell how dominating, flirtatious and a tiny bit excessive he is after being beat up by a angry husband, and within moments he is shagging a nurse. Hunts charades is a man who will take risks to get what he wants.\rWe meet lauda who is a man who knows what he wants and what he needs, we can tell is technically minded around the car unlike the ride or die playboy hunt, niki is very adamant and is a very blunt man, he does not take risks but will if driven to by his rivals.\rAs far as we are concerned this was rons big come back after his four recent film failure\u2019s including the  comedy starring Vince Vaughn the dilemma, this film has most definitely reassured us that Howard has still got it, not only directing the actors perfectly but also the technical aspects such as camera movement and the choosing of lenses this is of course  with the help of Oscar winner Anthony Dod Mantle (slum dog millionaire) cinematographer, after doing space shuttles it would be easy to assume that cars are no problem. I fell that the some scenes should have been cut and not over done such as the scene where the journalist is beat up.\r This film is not a unmissable film but is a beautiful story and is made to entertain this film is for everyone a man or women.

The rivalry between these two is what drives this film, supported by the great adrenaline inducing race sequences. The film however, crashes when it comes to dialogue. Throughout the film you're exposed to childish bickering between the characters, both from the leads as well as the minor roles and quickly you get the sensation of being caught up in a quarrel between schoolboys. The petty arguments and remarks cause the viewer to lose some interest in the film and develop a distaste for its two leads. As a consequence, the decision which driver to support becomes troublesome, restricting your engagement in the story.

What I loved was the characters and their stories. The peronsification of two different approaches to life using F1 drivers was genius and it resonated stongly with me. I think Howard remains subjective and doesn't allow his personal opinions to influence the film. Like all great art  the message and appeal are completely left to the individual. Im far too naive to comment on cinematography or editing so Ill just say the movie kicked ass and I watched it twice. As a 38 yr old man with a 9 yr old son, the film led me to question my own values and philosphies about being a man. Well done Mr. Howard......Im now a bandwagon F1 fan.",

Daniel Br\u00fchl, in my opinion, stole the show completely, and was very believable as the Austrian Niki Lauda. Australian Hemsworth as the British James Hunt may seem confusing, but Hemsworth was believable, though somewhat unlikable as the handsome ladies' man. The CGI during Lauda's fiery crash wasn't well-done, but the rain soaking the track and sliding off the sleek and well-made 1970s F1 cars was very impressive. Both actors are very believable as their characters, the writing is phenomenal, the CGI is decent, the direction is well-done, and the overall look of the film is just beautiful, and makes for a very recommendable film even for those that don't follow Formula 1 that much.",

Rush is a somewhat fanciful account of the build up to, and events of, the 1976 F1 Championship. A year in F1 that became legendary the second it came to a conclusion, and was a tale of two men... Niki Lauda and James Hunt, played by Daniel Bruhl and Chris Hemsworth respectively.\r The narrative focusses on the fact that the two men are dynamic opposites, Hunt the flamboyant playboy who famously refers to sex as the breakfast of champions, and Lauda the deep thinking and analytically minded racer who is also naturally fast behind the wheel.\r The problem with the film is that, like a real F1 season, there are highs and lows and it does get predictable. The highs being the truly awesome recreations of the best parts of the on track action and the scenes which tell the audience the motivations of the two drivers. The lows being pretty much everything else, with several scenes really dragging on and not moving the story forward in any way.\r Part of the 'high' are the performances on the 'Lauda side' of the narrative. Daniel Bruhl is probably the only person who could 'be' Niki Lauda in a film, but he's matched by his on-screen girlfriend then wife Marlene, played by Alexandra Maria Lara, who is as beautiful as she's talented.\r Conversely, it's hard not to like Chris Hemsworth (as an actor), but his performance is very one-note and muted. Similarly his girlfriend then wife Suzy (played by Olivia Wilde) is unable to convince as the one woman Hunt could want to walk down the aisle with.\r Ultimately it's a decent enough film, the action scenes more than make up for the somewhat stilted dialogue and slower parts, but at 122 minutes it's probably about 20 minutes too long.",
