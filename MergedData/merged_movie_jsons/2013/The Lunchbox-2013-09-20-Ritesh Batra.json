            "content": "An old saying repeated in Ritesh Batra's charming The Lunchbox is that sometimes the wrong train will bring you to the right station. In this case, however, the train turns out to be a dabba (lunchbox), wrongly delivered by a dabbawala to a middle-aged government claims adjuster on the brink of retirement. It works out well even though, in reality, with about 5,000 dabbawalas in the city of Mumbai who deliver more than 130,000 lunch boxes each day, they rarely make a mistake. Written by Stefan Tomke in the mode of You Got Mail, Ila (Nimrat Kaur), a young housewife dutifully prepares a lunch for her emotionally distant husband every day and has it sent to him via the courier.On the advice of her upstairs Auntie, Mrs. Deshpande (Bharati Achreka), Ila tries to have her husband notice her by putting more spice in the food. When it is wrongly delivered to Saajan (Irrfan Khan, Life of Pi), however, a series of unintended consequences unfold. What begins with a short note from Sajaan to Ila that \"the food was salty today\" develops into a series of exchanges passed back and forth in the lunchbox everyday in which the two open up to each other about their lives, memories, and their hopes and dreams for the future. A subplot involving Aslam Shaikh (Nawazuddin Siddiqui), an aggressively upbeat successor to Sajaan, adds a touch of humor to the proceedings but also serves to draw a contrast between himself and the grumpy Saajan.Both Aslam and Sajaan become more endearing, however, as the film progresses. While the ending may thwart expectations if you are used to having all the pieces neatly fit together, The Lunchbox mixes food and romance in a very appealing combination, removing any doubt that Ila and Sajaan have moved to a new level. Impeccably acted and beautifully realized, the film provides an honest appreciation of what it is like to live in Mumbai without exploiting its poverty for Western audiences. Though the wrong train may indeed bring you to the right station, ultimately there is no wrong train and no right station. As The Lunchbox demonstrates, there is just the train and the journey, and it's all perfect.",

            "content": "\"The Lunchbox\" is one of these films that are so great that it's almost impossible to put into words why they are that good. You just have to experience them. I'll give it a try though. The film centers around a lonely widower who, thanks to coincidence, has two strangers enter and enrich his life that may or may not have an impact on him in the future. The factor of coincidence is a very crucial one here as these happenings depict perfectly how one random thing happening can change your life forever. Often you can't even force it, you just have to hope for it to happen. The lunchbox simply could have gotten addressed correctly or the new employee could have tried his luck at another company and nothing from the action we were so lucky to see would have happened.But back to the film: It's Ritesh Batra's first directorial effort for a full feature after a few short films, which makes the final result even more impressive. I was shocked to hear that India decided to submit another movie as the entry to the Foreign Language category at next year's Academy Awards. I haven't seen that one (yet) though, so no further elaboration on it, except I'd be quite surprised if I end up liking their choice as much as \"The Lunchbox\". Indian cinema is one of not too many areas that I'm not too familiar with. I've seen \"Slumdog Millionaire\" of course and \"Gandhi\", but that's pretty much all I can say. Anyway, if the level of \"The Lunchbox\" is the one several Indian films deliver these days, I can't wait to get more into the matter. I especially liked Irrfan Khan (with \"Life of Pi\" and Slumdog Millionaire\" recently under his belt probably the biggest star from his country right now internationally) as a lonesome widower who did so much with so little and should easily be a contender for Best Actor of the Year at the next Oscars, but obviously he won't be. In Khan's shadow, Nimrat Kaur, who's surprisingly new to the film industry, and Nawazuddin Siddiqui as a likable pain in the neck shine as well.The other great strength of the movie besides its lead actor is the writing. The film is packed from start to finish with dialog that so fits the tone and situation and a large number of symbolisms that will impossibly leave you cold. At least that's what I can tell for me and most of the audience sitting in my viewing. You don't have to have lost your wife as well to feel the lead character's bitterness and despair early on in the film, to feel his loneliness in one of the most populated cities on Earth. But the film is far from being emotional torture porn. It's sometimes genuinely funny, namely in those parts where both lead characters communicate with their most important person (the colleague, the upstairs neighbor) and even if these obviously have a great deal of problems as well, including loneliness or taking care of a very sick partner for 15 years, these interactions result in very entertaining situations. The scene with the chili in the basket was hilarious and brought some great comic relief that moment.And that was only one of many smart scenes that perfectly display the characters' emotions or state of minds. You can also mention the children in the yard and how they interact with Khan's character, the ventilator metaphor (with the people below them and their similarities, coma patient and office worker) which may very well be the greatest symbolism I've seen in theaters all year. Another great scene is the moment in which his new colleague invite Khan's character and he rejects the invitation for the same evening as he's so deep down in his shell he needs preparation time for such a seemingly normal event. Very authentic display and that is exactly the way it is. Then there's the scene where he asks him to be his best man, scenes in which he watches the old shows his wife loved or a scene in which he makes a joke and you can see the impact of loneliness on his ability to make jokes or the empty lunchbox after the unsuccessful meeting, the aging without realizing... And there's many more scenes I didn't mention that made the movie the most wonderful experience for me. \"The Lunchbox\" is one of the saddest films of the year and, at the same time, one of the best, probably my number 2 of 2013 at this point.I'm not sure if there's a movie where I would say that if you liked this, you'll have a great time watching \"The Lunchbox\" as well. The closest I can think of is \"Lost in Translation\", which has some parallels, even if, compared to the Coppola movie, all the interaction here happens merely in written form. The ending is pretty good too. It was not entirely happy the way I hoped it would be, no big emotional bang like for \"Lost in Translation\", but still it was in a way uplifting and maybe more realistic and puts a smile on your lips. And you can speculate nicely how things will go from there.So to sum it all up, I really really loved \"The Lunchbox\". I was always curious about the next note the two would exchange and it probably could have run for at least another hour to meet the extreme length of many Indian films these days and I wouldn't have been bored a bit. It doesn't have spectacular music or dancing as you may know it from a few Indian films these days, but it does have many sequences with very tasty food. Is there something I criticize about this film? Actually there is: the fact that I missed watching it at the premiere with the cast and director around. Ten of ten.addition 4th May 2020: Rest in peace, Irrfan Khan :-(",

            "content": "In Mumbai (formerly 'Bombay'), India, there is a very complex network of 5000 Dabbawallahs. Their job is to arrive at the homes of Indian workers to get homemade lunches from the wives and transport them all over the city so that the men can have hot, home-cooked meals every day. Then, after lunch, they collect all the empty lunch pails and deliver them to the wives. Despite this being a logistical nightmare, the meals get delivered to the right person all the time with very, very few mistakes\u2014carried by hand and on bicycles and scooters by mostly illiterate men! With the movie Dabba, a mistake amazingly happens and a wife's meal arrives for a total stranger instead of her husband. At first, the man doesn't realize he's eating another man's lunch\u2014he just thinks the restaurant that delivers his lunch box has suddenly improved! However, once the wife realizes her mistake, she sends the next meal along with a note explaining the mix-up\u2014and soon the pair begin exchanging letters. At first, they are quite simple and formal. Later, they become much more complicated, as by now the wife has realized that her husband has been cheating\u2014and this total stranger becomes her confidante. All during this long exchange of letters, the woman CONTINUES sending lunches to this stranger and they forge an odd friendship! There's far more to the film than this\u2014see it yourself and you'll see what I mean.Dabba is the sort of film Hollywood could never make. Part of it is, of course, because there is no comparable lunch system in the States. Part of it, too, is that the film does NOT have a perfect happy ending and it doesn't follow a typical formula. There is a lot of sadness and longing and the film leaves you with this, as it's not afraid to leave the audience slightly dissatisfied. Now I am NOT complaining\u2014but Hollywood films seem to have an implicit understanding that everything must be resolved perfectly before a movie can end. Not so with Dabba. This might upset some viewers, but it shouldn't\u2014it's still a very good movie. Plus, a 'Hollywoodized' ending would have been far less realistic. And, as far as realism goes, this Indian film is not typical of a Bollywood flick either. While it was directed and written by an Indian, Ritesh Batra, and stars Indian actors (Irrfan Khan and Nimrat Kaur), it is also a French/German co-production. As such, it lacks the usual song and dance numbers you find in most Indian films and is only a little over an hour and a half (most Indian films are considerably longer\u2014often twice as long or longer). Instead following convention, the film is all about realism. It makes for a nice change of pace even if the ending will be vaguely unsatisfying to many viewers. Worth seeing as long as you don't demand formula. And, worth seeing as long as you don't mind reading subtitles. A film that is truly unique and the acting is really lovely.",

            "content": "\"The Lunchbox\" is the most honest love story to come out of Bollywood in ages. It is a delightful story of love blossoming slowly, one letter a day, between two most unlikely but equally despondent characters you could ever match make.Debutant Director, Ritesh Batra, who is also done the script writing, has crafted an exquisite gem of a movie. Batra impresses because he does not set out to impress. He conveys eloquently the state of the mind of each character because he is economical with emotions and does not exaggerate. Batra makes a memorable movie with multiple layers because he is honest with himself and his craft. Ritesh Batra is simply magnificent.The performances by the 3 leading actors, Irrfan Khan, Nawazuddin Siddiqui and Nimrat Kaur are disarmingly natural, poignant and memorable. Pitted against the two stalwarts (comparatively speaking), Khan and Siddiqui, newcomer Nimrat Kaur more than holds her own. I am at a loss of words to describe her performance. Her character is nuanced, neglected, grieving and most complex yet Kaur's is the most memorable performance in the movie. Her role would be talked about for a long time to come. While ironically, the whole serendipity bit of the film kicks off with a delivery mistake made by Bombay's Dabbawalas, world famous for their Six Sigma (99.999666% ) accuracy, Batra's movie reassures that even if the odds of finding true love in life is Six Sigma stacked against you, it is worth waiting for and taking your chances. \"The Lunchbox\" is the most sumptuous and appetizing fare Bollywood has offered in ages.

            "content": "The Lunchbox(Movie -2013) Review - The movie \"The Last Samurai\" ended with a quote something like \"We all seek some small measure of peace, and few of us ever find\". After many years \"The Lunchbox\", a movie from a completely different background and culture echoed the same thought to my ears, really it is never too late to start your life again. You can expect the movie will be a gem as you have the two best character-artists of this decade \u2013 Irrfan Khan and Nawazuddin Siddiqui playing the lead roles. However I didn't expect Nimrat Kaur will also give such an awesome performance as I never followed her before except \"Cadbuy Dairy Milk-Silk adds\", and I apologize for my ignorance sincerely! Nimrat was equally great. This movie can be an excellent demonstration of what extraordinary performance really means in any acting-learning institute of any part of the world, trust me on this!!!The start of the story - A frustrated housewife prepares an excellent lunch for her husband with great care. But unfortunately (or fortunately!), it reaches to an equally lonely person on the verge of retirement - Saajan Fernandes (Irrfan Khan) whose wife died long back. This simple cross connection by Mumbai Dubbawalas in the age of digital era starts a beautiful and interesting romantic relationship however ending of which has been kept open-ended for our own imagination. At the same time we can see an excellent equation and emotional turmoil building up between Saajan /Irrfann, the serious and lonely parting boss and Shaikh/Nawazuddin, his future replacement, who is funny and enthusiastic and quiet opposite to his boss.In some cases Nawazuddin has overshadowed Irfann too! The direction was superb, specially the depiction of the supply chain of the Mumbai Dabbawalas through the city is just extraordinary.Hats-off Ritesh Batra for his unbelievable first time direction.Disclaimer: This movie is 4.5/5 from me, 0.5 is deducted only for its little slow pace , otherwise it in an extraordinary story about very ordinary lives. To me, this movie deserves all the critical appreciations it has received both in India and Outside. Avoid only if you really hate slow paced realistic depiction about everyday common lives of Tom,Dick and Harry and expect only superheroes doing superhuman activities; otherwise this is a \"MUST WATCH\"!",

He is assigned to train his replacement Shaikh (Nawazuddin Siddiqui), who is a needy orphan. One day, Fernandes mistakenly receives the lunchbox prepared by the housewife Ila (Nimrat Kaur) to her estranged husband Rajeev (Nakul Vaid) and Fernandes believes that the restaurant where he buys his food improved the meal. On the next day, he receives a note from Ila inside the lunchbox and they begin to correspond to each other. Ila suspects that her husband is having a love affair and everyday Fernandes and Ila become anxious to read the note from the other. One day, Ila invites Fernandes to meet her in a restaurant. What will be their reactions in the encounter?\"The Lunchbox\" is a lesson of how to make a great movie with low-budget. The story is very simple, but the screenplay holds the attention of the viewer to the last scene. The direction and the performances are top- notch. There are very few locations and scenarios. The open end is excellent, giving the chance to the viewer to guess what might be the fate of Ila and Fernandes. I believe they will travel together with her daughter to Bhutan. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): \"The Lunchbox\"",

            "content": "From different contexts two characters cite the same adage: \"Sometimes the wrong train gets you to the right station.\" The duplication confirms the implication of the saying: A larger harmony may overlay the apparent chaos and insularity of our lives.The food delivery error finds the right recipient: not the neglectful, unfaithful husband Rajeev (for whom it's intended) but the genuinely appreciative and needy widower Saajan. In the days of cellphones and email the two strangers' connection by paper notes smuggled in the food-tins speaks of older traditions and values. Even if all the paper files and manual accounting in Saajan's claims department are curiously archaic. Since losing his wife Saajan is tight, silent, unexpressive. His colleagues warn his trainee Shaikh that he won't get anything out of Saajan. He's removed from his colleagues and alienated from his neighbors. Ila is almost equally isolated, despite being married, with a delightful daughter and a cheery adviser in the upstairs \"Auntie.\" Ila can't get any affection or notice from Rajeev and finds another's perfume on his shirts. Because we don't see Auntie she doesn't register as an actual relief from Ila's isolation. So the stranger's notes appreciating her cooking and sharing his observations and feelings \u2014 and attending to hers \u2014 are enough to excite Ila, even to give her hope that she may find an alternative more fulfilling relationship. At both ends of the meal's transmission the two fantasize a relationship. This meal provides multiple nourishment. It's enough to prompt Saajan to forgo early retirement and Ila to leave her husband. A key motif is the faint register of an individual in a mass. This is most clear in the montage that follows Ila's food-cans through the daily delivery, one bundle barely discerned amid the mass. Her fertile green case stands out in the drab crowd. So, too, the noisy teeming crowd \u2014 in First-Class, yet \u2014 on Saajan's commute to/from work. In the last photo at Sheikh's wedding his sole representative Saajan is almost framed out as the camera shifts to include the bride's extending family. But the film stays open-ended. If we prefer the pre-couple's romantic hopes we can infer that Saajan, back from his retirement spot and traveling with the food-deliverers, will get to Ila before her daughter returns from school and the three will depart together. But if our experience rather tends toward the tragic expectation, they won't meet. Her alienation deepened by her mother's relief at her lately disgusting husband's death, and by learning Saajan has moved away, Ila may well commit suicide. The shot of her removing her jewellery replays her visualization of the news story of the mother who jumped with her child to death. As Ila thinks the letter she may or may not send Saajan (p.s., How?) her morbid emotions might drive her off before her daughter returns from school. Hence her wistful look as the girl left. This ending would recall the near-misses that fatally thwart the romance of Romeo and Juliet. The comic subplot of Shaikh and his beloved, who ran away from home to be with him, could support either reading. These lovers' perseverance ends in family acceptance and success. So it could parallel the romantic union of Ila and Saaja. Equally, though, it could be cited as a dramatic counterpoint to the older lovers' tragedy.If we're not given one certain ending the director is suggesting that the ending doesn't matter. Whether or not the lovers meet and settle in together, both have grown from the experience. Warmed by the idea of having a girlfriend, Saajan has opened out to Shaikh and to his neighbours' children. He is already living a happier life, his emotions reawakened. And whether or not Saajan gets to her in time, Ila has worked up the courage to escape her stifling marriage. Whether it's romance or death, the wrong train could still find the right station \u2014 if only by leaving the wrong one. For more see www.yacowar.blogspot.com.",

There's a simple line in this sumptuous film that captures its essence beautifully: \"Sometimes even the wrong train can take you to the right destination.\" It's a line that might help interpret the film's open ending, but one that also nicely sums up its unique premise.I'm going with ten ratings for The Lunchbox. The greatest love stories are the ones that make you root for the protagonists to come together, despite their destinies. This film illustrates how love transforms the unlikeliest of people; it breaks down Saajan's walls and gives Ila the courage to fly. Treat yourself to The Lunchbox \u2013 it'll leave you with a craving to seek your own little happiness. Best film I've seen in a long time.

A little love story with some little events and pain... but at the end there is a new beginning. The story is about a lonely old widower and a young neglected house wife. They connected through a lunch box and some letters, and share some emotional thought and experience of there daily life with each other. They are totally stranger to each other, but love has found out it's own way to enter. There is a basic question about \"Love\"... 'Is it possible to fall in love between two strangers'? \"The Lunchbox\" defines it brilliantly... 'Love has no definition and it never follows any rules. So there is a possibility to fall in love with somebody whom we never meet. People loves to fall in 'Love' again and again, it may be someone we know or don't know or whom we already loved with'. Irfan Khan, Nimrat Kaur and Nawazuddin Siddiqui are acted very well through out the movie. Direction of Ritesh Batra is just too much perfect.

We see them opening more to each other and starting to feel more hope and happiness in their lives.It doesn't have a happy ending. Or maybe it does to some point, just not a typical happy ending which we know from mainstream movies. The main characters never meet. When then time comes for it Saajan Fernandez feels too old for the woman who wrote to him (this actually doesn't seem correct as the actors are not that far apart in age, but the reality is not what he was feeling). And when she tries to come to his work to meet him he has already left. Yet there is still some happiness in it since she leaves her husband and goes to the place where she expects to be happy. And he remains in the neighborhood and seems to have found a new outlook for life which is shown in him connecting better to the children there. Who knows, maybe one day a wrong train will take the two again to a right station and they meet. And if not we know they influenced each other lives in a very positive way.Great acting. And there are many scenes that show it to us.

He is now trebly alienated: a stranger to God, to nature, and to the gigantic social apparatus that supplies his material wants. In a society that requires of man only that he perform competently his own particular social function, man becomes identified with this function, and the rest of his being is allowed to subsist as best it can - usually to be dropped below the surface of consciousness and forgotten.\" - William Barrett Ritesh Batra writes and directs \"The Lunchbox\". The film stars Irrfan Khan as Saajan Fernandes, a lonely accountant who works in urban India. Saajan receives a daily meal prepared by the \"dabbawalas\", a network of men and women who transport home-cooked meals to city workers. Saajan's meals are prepared by Ila (Nimrat Kaur), a young woman trapped in a loveless marriage.On its most superficial level, \"The Lunchbox\" works well as a romantic crowd-pleaser. Saajan and Ila, who never physically meet, use their lunch-boxes to ferry secretly written letters between themselves. As both Saajan and Ila are lonely, depressed and locked in thankless routines, each unfurled letter brings with it excitement, entertainment and the promise of romance. Along the lines of a romantic drama, Batra's film is engrossing, subtle and largely devoid of clich\u00e9s.On another level, \"The Lunchbox\" works as a kind of anthropological study of urban India. This is a world in which every character is trapped in their own private lunch-boxes, the film's homes, streets, trains, buses and offices all tightly packed and colourfully impersonal. Ila and Saajan's jobs are themselves alienating, their customers invisible and the fruits of their daily toils seemingly evaporating before their eyes. To the duo, something as concrete as human touch seems distant and alien.Whilst Batra captures well the beauty of India, its places, communities, cuisines and people, he also taps into something darker. The last vestiges of traditional gender roles remain, men and women wrestle with existential questions, and urban life is portrayed as something sad and vaguely oppressive, hints of suicide, malaise and poverty fluttering faintly along the film's outer margins. Unsurprisingly, our heroes dream of the kingdom of Bhutan, where Gross National Happiness indices hold precedence (allegedly) over Gross Domestic Product.8.5/10 \u2013 See \"Syndromes and a Century\" and \"The Giant Mechanical Man\".",

It leads to an exchange of messages between the two as they talk about their lives.Saajan a withdrawn widower starts to look forward not only to the meals but the messages. It brings colour to his life which is noticed by Shaikh who is meant to take over his job.For Ila whose father is dying of cancer. She considers whether to develop her relationship with Saajan and arranges to meet up with him.Director Ritesh Batra has delivered a gentle charming non Bollywood film. It is about characters in various stages of life who see a hint of finding happiness gain.It reminded somewhat of the film 84 Charing Cross Road that featured Anthony Hopkins and Anne Bancroft corresponding to each other over the years.I did think Irrfan Khan was rather young to be playing Saajan. He was only in his mid 40s when this film was made, which meant that any romance between Saajan and Ila would had been more believable.",

Some of the most admired art-house films of the last forty years or so have food at their centre both in a literal sense and as a metaphor but few, if any, are as mouth-wateringly tasteful as Ritesh Batra's \"The Lunchbox\", a gorgeous romantic comedy-drama that will have you salivating from its opening moments. This one hails from India, a country not only famous for its cuisine but for its cinema which is now finally getting the recognition it deserves here in the West.A love story but not in the ususal sense, (it reminded me a little of Sofia Coppola's \"Lost in Translation\"), it's about the relationship, (platonic, unconsummated), that develops between a lonely middle-aged man on the cusp of retirement, (a superb performance from the late Irrfan Khan), and a younger, unhappily married woman, (beautifully played by Nimrat Kaur), when, by accident, a lunchbox is delivered to the wrong address. (Props like this are often at the centre of romantic misunderstandings). This couple never meet but correspond with each other on a daily basis and, in their own way, fall in love.The humour is gentle, the drama is virtually imperceptible; this is a film that could easily have come from Ozu or De Sica. It's a satire that not only uses food as a metaphor for feelings, romantic or otherwise, but also pokes gentle fun at India's pen-pushing office environment, (and there's a totally terrific scene-stealing performance from Nawazuddin Siddiqui as Khan's potential replacement), and even manages to get a dig in at the country's over-crowded railway system. I loved every frame of this movie which is about as perfect as motion-pictures can get.",

It really is superb writing throughout the whole film.The casting is inspirational. Irrfan Khan plays the lead to perfection, as does Nimrat Kaur. At times it is hard to take your eyes of them as their expressions are saying more than the words.A worthy mention also has to go to Nawazuddin Siddiqui who plays his part brilliantly and provides a beautiful counter balance to Irrfan Khan portrayal of Saajan Fernandes.And lets not forget Bharati Achrekar who plays Auntie. She doesn't appear on screen once and yet without her the film would just not be the same. The dialogues between Ila and Auntie, and the passing of ingredients between the two, are the kind of lovely touch that makes this not just a good film, but a great film.Ritesh Batra, the writer and director of the film deserves all the praise that has been heaped on him. It is well deserved as films of this quality are rare.This is definitely one film that it is worth going out of your way to watch.",

These lunches are literally homemade, produced principally by the wives of these working men, though various restaurants participate in the deliveries as well. One day, the lunch that Ila (Nimrat Kaur) has intended for her husband is mistakenly delivered to someone she's never met, a widower named Saajan Fernandes (Irrfan Khan), a man soon to be retired from his job as a government clerk after 35 years, who lives a life of solitude and loneliness with nothing but memories of his late wife for companionship. Out of this simple situation, Ritesh Batra, writer and director of \"The Lunchbox,\" has fashioned an endearing and observant tale of two total strangers who forge the unlikeliest of long-distance relationships. Through the notes that they pass back and forth to one another along with the lunches, Ila and Saajan open up their hearts in ways that Ila finds herself unable to do with her husband and Saajan has been unable to do since the passing of his wife. For though married with a child, Ila is clearly as lonely and unfulfilled in her life as Fernandes is in his.Protected by the cloak of anonymity, Ila and Saajan carry on an old- fashioned pen-pal romance in an era in which the rest of us have moved onto chat rooms and instant messages. Then, of course, comes the inevitable moment\u0085should they meet in person, potentially deepening their relationship - or possibly ruining forever the very rare and special thing they already have?

Telling the story of an accidental virtual encounter through the delivery of food, The Lunchbox is one of the kindest films one can imagine, with the deepest understanding of the human soul, of human relationships, and of humanity in general. The Lunchbox gives us a fascinating glimpse into the delicious beauty of the Indian cuisine, and the way the virtual relationship is etched out along the way is brilliant. Aside from its deep, poetic tone, the film's sense of everyday realism never takes away from its entertainment value as it remains a consistently intriguing and involving film with hardly a dull moment. The credit must go to writer and director Ritesh Batra, who makes his first directorial effort with this film, and does it with heart, soul and profundity, with amazing results. Few movies have this engaging quality about them.The acting is natural and appealing by one and all. Nimrat Kaur gets a dream role. She is a natural, earthy and solemn beauty, and she matches it with an equally natural, authentic performance, infusing her part with a tender energy of expectancy. Irrfan is at his subdued best, giving a typically real and impressive performance, and so is the wonderful Nawazuddin Siddiqui, who gives his role and the film a great touch of innocent charm. In addition to the brilliant writing and acting, the film boasts of exceptional production values; everything, from the cinematography to the brilliant background score, gives the film its heartwarming energy and makes it a visual treat and a great cinematic experience. The Lunchbox is a stupendous film which celebrates the Indian culture and offers viewers all around the world an exciting glance into its wonderful diversity. A must watch and already a classic.",

Again all of these things are very much there without they saying it explicitly so. Very rarely you come across a movie that moves at a comfortable pace, not trying to either rush or stagnate itself at any point. The TG for this movie is definitely not people across all age groups as the producers claim, but it's specially for those who are happy or contented without searching for that something extra in their everyday lives. It doesn't talk about any extra ordinary accomplishments of individuals, nor does it talk about destiny, life or happiness. It just talks about very simple human behavior, when it comes to falling in love.

'The Lunchbox' is based on such a story surrounding the dabbawalas of Mumbai. One mistake that brews a terrific relationship between two strangers, so delicately portrayed through the exchange of letters. There are only three actors in this film and each has delivered a stellar performance. None of them have many dialogues, but their expressions and motions depict their character in such an excellent manner, you wished there were even fewer lines! Irrfan proves with every new film that he in fact is the best 'Khan' of Bollywood and Nawazuddin can just not disappoint. He's used his GoW success to break into films such as this one and done justice to each role. Nimrat Kaur's simplicity throughout the film looks so effortless and yet so unbelievable for the Bollywood of today, which is ever so increasingly synonymous of excessive glamour and fashion. Cinematography is average, but again, this isn't a 'visual' movie, it's more of a story. Direction looks great as Ritesh has been able to get the best out of his cast. Well, you'd have to try real hard to have Irrfan and Nawaz amidst your cast and yet churn a flop, but the director does deserve some credit. In my opinion, this is the second best film of the year after Madras Cafe. I haven't seen Bhaag Milkha Bhaag though, so that might change things for me. Either way, this is in no way a bore or a drag as the film keeps you hooked onto the amazing story line and individual performances. Enjoy!",

            "content": "Rarely an Indian film without its trademark dancing-and-singing routines, director/writer Ritesh Batra's feature debut marvellously utilises the exotic \"dabbawalas\" system of Mumbai, which is an intricate lunch delivery service to people at work from their their homes or restaurants and is remarkable for its accuracy, but Batra fictionalises a little mix- up of the system and links two strangers into an epistolary communication, and from there, their penfriend-ship will further sublimate into something more genuine and profound.Saajan Fernandes (Khan) is a middled-aged widower on the brink of early retirement as a senior accountant, he is withdrawn, cynical and tries to dodge the responsibility to train his new replacement Sheikh (Siddiqui). One day his colourless life is revitalised by a mis- delivered lunch-box which he vastly enjoys. The lunch-box is made by Ila (Kaur), a housewife who attempts to win the her husband's heart through her cuisine. When Ila realises the delivery blunder, instead of righting the mistake, she starts to leave a note to this stranger in the lunch-box and Saajan writes back too, steadily, they exchange their own stories and life philosophy, which becomes the enzyme of a blossoming romance since both find a conduit and a confidant to change their disappointing status quo. Like YOU'VE GOT MAIL (1998, 7/10), THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER (1940), the two protagonists are destined to meet sine they are not like Helene Hanff and Frank P. Doel in 84 CHARING CROSS ROAD (1987) who are divided by the Atlantic ocean and deferred by a difficult economy situation. It is quite easy for them to meet when all the romantic buildup reaches its threshold, Ila finds out her husband is cheating on her whereas Saajan gets close with the orphan Sheikh, takes him as his prot\u00e9g\u00e9, and is ready to turn a new chapter of his life. But Batra refuses to hold out such an easy pass for their significant first meeting, for the sake of narrative twist, he wields the \"sudden\" epiphany of age difference as the obstacle to morally righteously curb the passion from Saajan's side. And from then on, the film descends into a limbo of indecision, through Saajan's capricious determinations, it actually reflects Batra's insecurity of how to consummate the story in an unconventional way, as his first feature, his endeavour fails to achieve that goal with the over-contrived open ending.Performances are uniformly pleasant to watch, Khan's goggled eyes alone can patently exhume his deepest inner feelings to an affecting effect. Kaur, also downplays the default setting of an under-appreciated wife and evinces her steely resolution of a woman doesn't yield to an unhealthy marriage. Siddiqui's Sheikh. comes around often as comic relief with an inherent optimistic spirit, registers a well-developed balance of humour and earnestness.The film's retro flair in rediscovering the magic power of authentic writings is naturalistic-ally endearing to endorse, and \"sometimes the wrong train takes you to the right station\", is the motto conspicuously referred three times along the whole movie, THE LUNCHBOX is a rarity among the usual Bollywood products, its message can reach unanimously to every soul who is inspired to find its rightful purpose, and its art-house appeal can lure those who are disinterested in Indian cinema (like myself) into its poetic embodiment of an unusual encounter.",

            "content": "When you go into a movie, one of whose somewhat reliable review claimed it to be the best movie to have come out of India in the last 10 years, you are bound to have certain expectations and in retrospect a mind ready for a brutal disappointment at the end and yet there comes a time when something does not just live up to the expectations, but far exceeds them in almost every way. Lunchbox works at so many levels that it might get unpleasant at times for a casual viewer due to the roller-coaster screenplay where a seemingly comical exchange of dialogues suddenly takes a drop-dead serious turn and you have still not stopped laughing. But all throughout the movie everything appearing comical is in a way dark humor surrounding the landscape of the plot.The movie explores loneliness in a way radically different from what we are used to in Indian cinema. I was so much reminded of Wong Kar Wai's In Mood for Love throughout the movie. Although the movie doesn't work on the same plot, but the essence has a lot in common. A lonely retiree who has reached the brink of his active adult life with no one to count on in his fading days and a young housewife caught in the bustle of fast life in the 21st century where an early child seems to have created a huge void in the household. The movie sets off with a very gloomy undertone in the rain drenched by-lanes of Mumbai. Ritesh Batra brings out the melancholy and solitude in the life of these two people through the Mumbai dabbawalla network and it's so natural and so simplistic that it works out very well.He has not built the movie into a conventional love story, but like I said, it reminded me so much of 'In the Mood for Love'. And the screenplay and narrative leaves a lot at the viewer's prerogative. The relationship between Irfan Khan and Nimrat Kaur is somewhat like what Bill Murray and Scarlet Johansson had in 'Lost in Translation'. There are so many open ended threads in the story and there is no attempt made at justifying or unnecessarily elaborating them. It redifines love in a way we don't see in Hindi cinema usually and then lets the viewers take their own pick how they want to leave with the story.The editing is very crisp and very tight. Honestly, the movie as a whole was a huge surprise and the experience just gets better.The performances makeup and locations are perfectly suited for the story. The movie brings out Mumbai on the screen in a way that perfectly suits it. Apparently heirless Irfan Khan's huge lonely house in high bustle of Bandra, or the young couple's small budget flat where although you can shout out and talk to the neighbour above, yet strange loneliness thrives and drives a housewife to discuss her family problems with a complete stranger though lunch boxes. The longing for good old past on part of both loners is very well showcased. The movie works very well. Performance wise Irfan Khan is brilliant like always. An exceptional follow-up to Pan Singh Tomar. He plays out a 60 year old so well, that Naseeruddin Shan might've already called up his agent to drop a couple hundred thousands off his asking price. Nimrat Kaur does full justice to her role as the lonely housewife. Nawazzundin Sidiqui plays out a role different from what we have now got used to off late. But it's the story and the way that it has been executed that makes it all the more brilliant.It's good to know that there are people like Ritesh Batra who are doing some remarkable work in the otherwise mediocre Hindi cinema of today. What was even more surprising was to find Karan Johar as one of the producers. This one act of his has suddenly improved his stature in my books. It was disappointing to know that this movie was turned down in favor of 'The Good Road' as official Indian entry for Oscars. Definitely a stupid decision, as I do not see any reason why Lunchbox wouldn't have gone one to win the award.A must watch for anyone who has given up on Hindi cinema.",

            "content": "Among the slew of modern movies churned out over the past few years, The Lunchbox comes off as surprisingly delighting without any of the bells and whistles the aforementioned movies had. Its a simple tale of an old- school romance between an Indian housewife and an accountant way into his 50/60s that touches on the more simple things in life.The elementary events unravels in modern day Mumbai, sequined with constant nostalgia from its initial scene and adorned with a pinch of comedy in almost every frame topped off with a whole lot of emotions from start to end, The Lunchbox is a breath of fresh air. Things get interesting when a dabba (tiffinbox) from a housewife, Ila, gets misdelivered to a grouchy accountant close to his retirement, Saajan Fernandez. From there on romance slowly blooms between the disregarded housewife and the widower, exchanged through letters in the dabba.Debutant director and writer, Ritesh Batra weaves the story around two people connected by written letters and exchanged through tiffin boxes, instead of chat windows, text messages and emails that dominates the world now. It almost feels impossible but yet it somehow works. The subtle nuances of the characters played impeccably by Irfan Khan and Nimrat Kaur was felt throughout. Be it the grief and grumpiness of a widower, Saajan or of the heart broken and disturbed Ila when she finds out that her husband was losing interest in her, or the ample amount of comedy that comes from the ever-amazing Nawazuddin Siddiqui, The Lunchbox packs quite a punch when it comes to performances. And that even goes for the voice of Bharati Achrekar, the aunty upstairs who helps Ila out asking her in cooking delicious dabbas for her husband.The story is well crafted and with utmost detail that makes it entertaining so much. What adds another layer to the narrative is that it doesn't just revolve around the titular characters, rather it branches around their own rarely seen friends and family. I found the scene where Ila's mom goes delusional after her father's passing, particularly touching. The ending does come abrupt and leaves you in a perpetual state of 'what ifs' and 'what could's'. You are let to decide on your own about the outcome of this beautiful drama so don't be surprised.Despite the gray shades looming all over the scampering city of Mumbai, the cinematography looked amazing. And music, if not something to write home about, got along well with the visuals. The sound, but, on the other hand was just mind blowing. I don't always notice the sound design in movies but this was one of the times where I had to take note of the intricately detailed sounds and as the dialogues and scenes overlapped it just couldn't be ignored.The Lunchbox is that rare gem among the big budget blockbusters and cheap cash cows that populates Bollywood these days. More than its refreshing take on romance dramas, it pushes you down the nostalgic spiral. I was able to connect immensely with the characters, the letters, the VHS/VCR combo and most of all, the mouth watering dabbas!In an endnote I'd like to tell you all \"Don't go for the movie with an empty stomach, you will regret it!\"",

Ila is an Indian wife and mother trying desperately to regain her husband's affection by going to great lengths to prepare his daily lunch, which is delivered to his office. However, Ila soon realizes that the lunch is going to someone entirely different: Saajan, an office worker who is about to retire and be replaced by a young overeager newbie (Shaikh). Saajan loves his lunches, and begins corresponding with Ila via notes left in the lunchbox. Meanwhile, Saajan's initial loathing for Shaikh develops into tolerance and eventually friendship. Like all great movies, this one excels in its story, its characters, and the prowess of the actors who portray them. We are so drawn to Ila, her anxiety to capture her husband's attentions, and her inner torment as she suspects his infidelity. Saajan is very off-putting at first, but as we learn more about his past, we see him more sympathetically. Their exchange of notes is so full of deep insight and philosophical reflection on the human condition. Shaikh as well turns out to be both more and less than what we had initially expected. Watching Irfan Khan play Saajan was a treat. The camera stays on him for minutes on end as he opens the lunchbox, unpacks its contents, sniffs each dish, samples from this and that, all at a very leisurely pace. And he is able to convey his appreciation for the food without exaggeration, without overacting, but with subtle signs of growing interest which are so true to life. You can just smell the curries as he tentatively takes a whiff of this and that dish. He definitely deserves an award for this role. Also the way he grows out of his initial antipathy towards Shaikh is just marvelous.As a side benefit, this movie gives an excellent view into the lives of middle-class Indian families: where they live, what they eat, how they get to and from work. The film is brooding, melancholy, although it also has an uplifting and optimistic strain woven through its fabric. It does require patience from the viewer, but that patience is amply rewarded. Truly one of the most memorable films I have ever seen, and well worth seeking out.",

At the same time, the self-isolated insurance worker (Irrfan Kahn in a lovely, understated performance) starts to reluctantly form a friendship with an ambitious, poor young man who has been hired to replace him when he retires. There have been films using the gimmick of two leads having a non face to face relationship before (e.g. 'You've Got Mail'), but this is both quirkier and more low key. The focus is less on romance, and more on these two lonely souls simply getting to know each other, and to tell their stories to someone in a world where no one seems to care. Nimrat Kaur does a terrific job as the lonesome housewife, as does Nawazuddin Siddlqui as the orphaned worker slowly taken under the wing of his older counterpart. This isn't a film that will make you laugh out loud, or reduce you to tears. But under the excellent direction of first timer Ritesh Batra, this Indian \"indie\" film will touch your heart and make you smile as you slowly get to know these sad, sometimes foolish, often wise, and always very human characters.",

            "content": "From the very first moments it is clear that this is one of those near-perfect films that are an absolute joy to watch. Of course, with a film celebrating the wonders of Indian cuisine, it's hard to go wrong. But this is much more than a film about food. It's about hope, disappointments, fear, and kindness. In other words: about life. Essentially, this film shows two people getting fond of each other, but at the same time realizing that it's impossible to get really attached. The brilliant thing about the script is that the man and the woman never really meet each other. They correspond through short letters, hidden in the lunchbox containing the food the woman prepares for her husband, who never gets it because it is delivered to the wrong person. The start of the film is wonderful. We see the woman, Ila, preparing the food, the lunchbox getting transported through the crowded city by one of the many deliverymen, and the lunch being eaten by the office worker. There is hardly any dialogue, only beautiful cinematography. A very nice scene is the one where the camera follows the delivery boy, putting a lunchbox on every desk, and stops moving at the moment Ila's lunch is being delivered. It only becomes clear that something is not right when Ila's husband arrives home, and turns out to be a completely different person from the one who has eaten the lunch. The story unfolds through the letters, in which Ila and office worker Saajan tell each other their daily thoughts, events and emotions. At the same time, there are several side stories emphasizing the emotional development of the lead characters. Apart from the script and the cinematography, the acting is the third great feature of this film. Irrfan Khan, already known by Western audiences from his parts in Slumdog Millionaire and Life of Pi, is very good as the bitter office worker who slowly opens his heart and acknowledges his own feelings. But Nimrat Kaur is just as good as the 'desperate housewife' Ila. They both excel in subtle looks and gestures. And of course there is Mumbai as the third lead character. The crowded trains, the Ambassador-taxis, the children playing cricket in the street, the sudden rain showers - it's all there. This film makes you wonder why so few Indian movies make it to the Western screens. As a matter of fact, we get to see more British films set in India (Slumdog Millionaire, Trishna, The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel) than the real Indian thing. When Chinese cinema has no problem reaching Western audiences, shouldn't Indian cinema be able to do the same? It also made me wonder why this film wasn't nominated for the foreign language Oscar. Apparently, India sent another entry, which caused a fuss in the country's film community. I think 'The Lunchbox' would have made a perfect entry: it combines an authentic Indian setting with a universal emotional message that could have convinced any jury.",

            "review_title": "Charming but dour Indian take on anonymous correspondents a la 'Shop around the Corner'",
            "content": "Saajan Fernandes is a civil service accountant in Mumbai, India, with one month to go on his job before he retires. He subscribes to the \"dabbawalas\" system, where he has his food delivered to his desk from outside of work. Saajan's food comes from a restaurant but due to a mix-up, he receives lunches prepared by another man's wife, Ila. When Ila receives the lunch containers back, they're licked clean and she assumes her husband liked what she made for him. After speaking with her husband, it becomes apparent that he never received the food she had prepared. She decides to keep preparing meals for the stranger, who seems to be enjoying them.The next note from Saajan suggests that that food is a tad bit salty. Not insulted, Ila decides to adapt her concoctions to his specifications, and seeks culinary advice from her neighbor one flight above, by shouting to her through an open window (we never see the neighbor, Auntie, who apparently is an older confidante).'The Lunchbox' takes its cue from the old 1940 Lubitsch classic, 'The Shop around the Corner', where two anonymous correspondents form a relationship. The relationship between Saajan and Ila is at the heart of the narrative but it plays out strictly through the off screen narration of the principals.The dramatic tension arises over whether Saajan can free himself of his depression, as he is a widower, who was devastated by the death of his wife. Ila also faces a crisis when she discovers that her husband has been cheating on her and must decide whether she wants to leave him.A sub-plot involving Shaikh, the 'orphan' scheduled to take over Saajan's job is perhaps the most charming aspect of the film. At first, Saajan virtually ignores Shaikh and keeps postponing training sessions for the newly hired employee. Shaikh ends up having to forge ahead on his own and incurs the wrath of the boss when it's obvious he has no clue how to do the job. The boss fires Shaikh but Saajan takes the blame and saves his job. Eventually the two become friends, and the friendless Shaikh asks Saajan to be the best man at his wedding. 'The Lunchbox' denouement is designed to be bittersweet but hopeful. Saajan and Ila finally agree to meet; but when Saajan gets cold feet when he shows up at the restaurant where Ila has been waiting for him, she decides not to send him anymore meals. After Ila's father dies, she looks for Saajan but he has already decided to move to another city. Then she decides to move to outside the country to Bhutan, and leave her husband. Saajan changes his mind about moving and on a hopeful note, decides to look for Ila.Ultimately, the burgeoning romance between Saajan and Ila is not enough for us to completely fall in love with this narrative. One big problem is Saajan's personality. He's such a one note dour character that it's hard to like him for most of the film. Yes I understand he finally comes out of his shell but is this depressing guy really someone you're willing to go along with for the ride for so long? Similarly, Ila is also a bit of a one note, downbeat character too. Her crumbling marriage seems a little too pat and the relationship between her and her husband, seems woefully underdeveloped.In reality, I hardly think Saajan and Ila are a good couple. Perhaps Saajan's instinct that she was too young for him was a good one. Nonetheless, he's off (in Hollywood fashion) to seek out the newly separated Ila, and win her heart for good.As a first time director, Ritesh Batra is to be commended. He has a flair for directing his actors and getting most out of his cinematographers. Special mention should go to the composer of some very nice, highly atmospheric music. 'The Lunchbox' was the subject of great controversy in India after the Film Federation of India failed to nominate it for the Academy Awards. Some members felt the premise was flawed since the Dubbawalas could never make such a mistake as delivering the wrong lunch. I would have denied it on the grounds that the simplicity of the screenplay, with its dour principals and sentimental ending, would have precluded it from earning an Oscar nomination.",

            "content": "The Lunch Box is a very simple story woven together with emotionally powerful and memorable scenes. Set in the hustle-bustle city of Mumbai,the story begins with a 'lucky' mistake which first brings the 2protagonists together and unfolds around the blossoming friendship between this unlikely couple. Sajan Fernandes, an Accountant, is approaching the 'Golden' years of his life and is looking forward to retirement and a quiet life in Nasik. A widower, a loner, he is shown to be most comfortable in the company of his work- desk and files. Ila is a dutiful housewife whose life centers around her family and household chores. Always awaiting an approving nod, an understanding smile from her husband, which is not forthcoming; she is trying hard to salvage a marriage which is slowly losing steam. A one- in-a-million mistake by the dabbawallahs, lands the dabba, lovingly prepared by Ilafor her husband; on Sajan's desk one fateful afternoon. This sparks asteady stream of letters between the two. Soon their deepest desires, darkest secrets, biggest fears are being ferried to the other, in the form of letters traveling in the confines of the dabba. Director Ritesh Batra's storytelling tugs at your heartstrings. The editing is crispand shuttles between the lives of Fernandes and Ila very smoothly. The plot unfolds at an even pace throughout, allowing you to empathize with the protagonists and soak-in their emotions. The biggest strength of this movie is its performances. Irrfan Khan's effortless portrayal of Fernandes, adds another feather to his cap. Nimrat Kaur plays Ila to perfection. Nawazuddin Sidddiqui gives a memorable performance as Shaikh, Fernandez's office assistance. The scenes involving him, give the movie some light moments. Bharati Achrekar, as the kind-hearted Mrs. Deshpande, the tenant in the flat above Ila's and Lilette Dubey as Ila's mother complement the main cast with strong performances. This movie is an ode to the Dabbawallahs, who brave the rains, the crowd of the Maximum city and to their undying spirit. A special mention of the green dabba which travels on bicycles, local trains, escalators and on the person of the dabbawallah as it journeys to and fro, carrying the story ahead. In the backdrop of it all is the city itself which is a prominent and indispensable character of this love-story. This movie is a near-perfect. The emotions evoked by this movie, the dialogues, the scenes are bound to remain in memory long after you have left the cinema hall. Excellent 4/5",

            "content": "Indian cinema, courtesy of Bollywood, is generally associated with massive production values and glitz and glamour, so it's telling that the country's most critically revered film of 2013 was one so unassumingly intimate and small. Director Ritesh Batra (making an impressive feature debut)'s The Lunchbox is a thoroughly charming affair \u2013 too melancholy to live up to its marketing as a comedy, but brimming with heart and humanity, and a story that is both geographically precise and truthful yet broadly accessible to all.It stands to reason that Batra initially conceived of the film as a documentary following the exploits of Mumbai's Dabbawalas, or lunchbox delivery service, as the film pulses with a fundamentally genuine spirit in all aspects. The unshowy verisimilitude permeates both the intricacies of the on-location shoot, captured in all its bustle of movement and colour (the Dabbawalas undertaking their immaculately choreographed workplace deliveries and amiably singing between deliveries are clearly unstaged), and the emotional beats of the story alike. Batra allows a quiet, gentle voice-over romance ('epistolary' is your word of the day) to bloom, unhurried, like flower petals slowly extending towards the sun, without shoehorning in any mawkish sentiment or plot contrivances. This is not Hollywood, however, and easy gratification is as elusive as snappy dialogue. Batra is more interested in allowing his characters to breathe, musing on the oppressive, subtle weight and sadness of unexpected aging, and how small, genuine gestures can cumulatively bring people together or drive them apart. He utilizes clever graphic matches to establish parallelism, sometimes cheekily, but it's his only hint of artifice in a film that otherwise feels welcomely old-fashioned yet fresh, honest, and fun.As an effective two-hander, the film's dual leads do phenomenal work in substantiating the relaxed yet emotionally rich feel throughout. Irrfan Khan is a master of saying volumes with only the slightest arch of an eyebrow or downward curve of his mouth, and, despite looking far too young to embody a retiring widower at only 46 (a poignant commentary in itself\u0085), his gently commanding presence infuses his initial cantankerous exterior with both radiant sadness and impish gleams of hope. Nimrat Kaur is equally fantastic, wearing melancholy but decisive action around her like a shawl. Although we're given more time with Khan, it's Kaur that steers the film, tenaciously prodding her fraying life into shape, and it's captivating to see an actor convey so many dancing, conflicting thoughts and motivations without any evident performance tics, making her performance the essence of credible, and sprinkled with dashes of the driest wit. Nawazuddin Sidiqui also lends great support as Khan's chirpy coworker and eventual successor. Despite bringing many of the film's laughs, Sidiqui is careful to build himself enough of a character, and tragic backstory of his own, to never feel like a comedic relief plot device; conversely, he rounds out the clumsy trifecta of broken people stubbornly trying to bludgeon his life into taking shape. Elegantly elegiac and perfectly heartwarming, The Lunchbox is that rare film festival darling that feels wholly fresh and unassuming, without a whiff of cloying falsehood whatsoever. Despite the film's central metaphor of 'even the wrong train will sometimes lead to the right station', Batra's film proves that sometimes appearances aren't deceiving \u2013 a film marketed as intimate, wholesome, and delightfully cute can be just that, no strings attached. Now: who's hungry? -8/10",

I'm not even sure how I came across this film, but I'm glad I did. It's a film about hope, love, and mourning. It perfectly balances deep drama with sweet romance.Irrfan Khan gives a magnificent performance, as does Nimrat Kaur. Kaur plays a stay at home mother who cooks the lunch for her husband, only it never reaches him. Instead the lunchbox finds its way to Khan's desk and they end up connecting after Khan is thrilled with how delicious the meal is. It was interesting to see two people connecting over handwritten notes with the digital and social media age we live in now. The two of them share their life stories and have chemistry unlike any other couple that never has actually met.What I loved about this film was it's not the typical predictable love story. It takes a few turns but in all it gives us lessons for life. Think about it, the main three characters Saajan, Ila, and Shaikh all believe in different things and have different viewpoints on religions. But yet they all give each other a chance. Especially in todays age that's an important lesson to learn. This was an incredible movie that I cant recommend more to people.+Khan's performance +Unique love story +Important lessons+Unpredictable +Gives us hope 9.2/10",

            "content": "The Lunchbox (2013) tells the story of a housewife who is an excellent cook and tries to win her husband's heart by following the route via his stomach. But the indifferent husband is making her soul die gradually but definitely through his apathy - apathy towards herself, her whole existence and everything done by her for him. Life has become quite dull and hopeless for her. The only reason for her to live is her little daughter plus her aged mother looking after her ailing father.This housewife living in Mumbai is Ila (Simrat Kaur) who everyday prepares the lunchbox for her husband and send to him through the tiffin delivery service carried out by the famous Dabbawaalas of Mumbai. She keeps on trying newer recipes for her husband's lunch by seeking the advice of an elderly lady in her neighbourhood whom she calls 'aunty'. And one day the aunty's recipe works but the outcome does not affect Ila's husband - Rajeev (Nakul Vaid) whom the tiffin was originally sent to. Due to a rare error made by the Dabbawaala, the lunchbox reaches a stranger named as Saajan Fernandes (Irrfan) working in a government owned insurance company. He is an elderly widower and willing for early retirement from his job to shift to Nasik.Now the lunch which was never eaten completely by Rajeev, is liked so much by Saajan that he licks the lunchbox empty. And when the lunchbox emptied this way, reaches back to Ila in the evening, it's a pleasant surprise for her. However the pleasantness of surprise gets diluted when she comes to know that it's not her husband who had eaten that lunch but someone else. However even this indirectly conveyed appreciation of her cooking brings some cheers to her heart. She sends a 'Thank You' note in the lunchbox the next day hoping that the lunchbox will reach the same person again.And yes, it reaches Saajan only again. And again. And again. Her note and the subsequent such notes start fetching Saajan's replies too. She writes in Hindi but Saajan replies in English. However the language of sentiments is unique and is not dependent on the medium. Hence a bridge is built through these letters between the hearts of the twosome. Like Ila, Saajan is also completely lonely and his loneliness has adversely affected his personality. But now the lunchbox has become something like a postman for both these lonely and suffocated souls to open up and pour own heart out because now each of them has found a listener in the form of the other.Letters keep on coming and going. Now they wait for the lunchbox - Saajan in the day time and Ila in the evening - just to get the letter of the other one and know what he / she has said from his / her side and when there is a mutual liking between the communicating persons, there's never any dearth of the topics. The result ? Elementary Sir ! The result is love. The love which knows no bounds of age, looks, class, marital position, family etc. etc. etc.They have fallen in love - from Ila's side without even seeing Saajan but the apprehensions are also there. It requires a lot of courage to take risks to move from what we are in to what we long for which is absent at least in Saajan. Well, then should we conclude that the love story has ended ? No ! Whether the lovers get united or not, the love story continues. because love does not cease to exist.It's not a movie about the lunch or its quality or its consumption and subsequent appreciation for the lunch-maker. It's about opening up of two persons to each other through letters through which the characters of this movie who come to know of each other and then move from liking each other to loving other. But ! But what would have happened had the lunchbox sent by the lady been wrongly delivered to some female instead of a male ? Then this love story would have not come into existence even if that lunch-consuming stranger lady had been appreciative of the food and understanding and empathetic by nature. Why ? Because a love story has to be between a male and a female only. Even when the concerned male and the female never come face-to-face or even see each other's photograph or even hear each other's voice, the feeling that the interacting person belongs to opposite sex itself is able to stir the heart of the individual. Opposite charges attract each other and like charges repel each other. It is true in the case of human-beings too. Especially we, the Indians, tend to foster an unexpressed desire in our hearts to interact with a person of opposite sex and allow our hidden romantic feelings to exhibit themselves because our social set-up does not allow us even today to go ahead in a love-affair and male-female interaction without a marital bond between them is still looked upon with contempt by the society. Hence any opportunity to taste that forbidden fruit is grabbed with enthusiasm. Hence even without any sexual orientation of the (real or deemed) relationship, a feeling of getting involved with a person of opposite sex is found soothing for the heart. The same appears to have happened to Saajan Fernandes and Ila also. The lunchbox originally contained food for the appetite of the body but once it became the medium of communication between the individuals at the two ends of its daily journey, it started carrying the stuff to satiate the appetite of soul of the twosome.An outstanding movie it is !",

Nearing the age of retirement, Fernandes is asked to teach his upcoming replacement Shaikh the ropes of the business. Spending most of the day at home, Ila finds the spark in her marriage to have gone. Coming up with ways to get it back on track,lla decides to make dabbawalas for her husband. Unknown to lla,the delivery company send lla's meal to Fernandes,whose delight with the meal opens a new box in both their lives.View on the film:Cooking up his feature debut,co-writer/(with Vasan Bala) director Ritesh Batra & cinematographer Michael Simmonds (who was also the cinematographer on Project Nim) cut the Indian cinema extravagances for an intimate,low-key indie atmosphere. Spending 6 months rehearsing the movie and keeping to a trim 29 day production,Batra and Simmonds give the title a documentary appearance, with the office lights of Fernandes workplace and the simmering gold lights of lla's kitchen displaying their humble roots. Connecting Fernandes and lla with narration,Batra brilliantly balances \"show and tell\" via the voice-overs reading the letters covering the progression of the plot,whilst the lingering shots on the faces of lla and Fernandes captures the emotive changes taking place. Opening up the box,the screenplay by Batra and Bala avoids traditional Bollywood \"masala\" (Melodrama) to instead intelligently focus on the routines that subtly change in lla and Fernandes lives,from the resentment Fernandes has for his replacement turning into mutual respect,to lla leaving the house,and getting on a new train track in life. Building up to lla and Fernandes first encounter,the writers bravely hold back the tears for an unexpected twist which brings the exchanging letters between Fernandes and lla down to a realist level.Spending weeks living with \"lla's\" disinterested husband (played by a terrific Nakul Vaid) in order to build up the relationship in a method acting style, Nimrat Kaur gives a marvellous performance as lla.Opening to the outside world lla's letters to Fernandes,Kaur gradually builds lla's independent strength to look with new eyes at the outside world. Introducing Fernandes by showing him firmly stick to a daily routine, Irrfan Khan displays an incredible subtle touch in expressing Fernandes anticipation of finding a new lla letter in his lunchbox.",

The premise is a tad contrived and clocking it at near two hours long, the movie occasionally feels repetitive. Generally speaking though, this is a refreshingly different sort of romantic comedy with two protagonists who only gradually fall in love with each other's words after several friendly written exchanges. For a modern film, the fact that they communicate through letters (not phones or social media) also provides a welcome quaintness. The dialogue is quite thought-provoking too; \"sometimes the wrong train will get to the right station\" states the accountant's young colleague at one point. There is also an excellent bit in which the colleague's unexpected arrival at lunch coincides with a romantic music underscore abruptly ending. The entire sound design is remarkable though with accentuated office and canteen noises, plus both leads are superb. How much one is likely to get out the unexpected ending is debatable, but at least the film avoids falling into clich\u00e9.",

            "review_title": "Gentle Analysis of Love and Loneliness in Contemporary Mumbai",
            "content": "THE LUNCHBOX has emerged as top-grossing foreign film at the US, and deservedly so. Set in contemporary Mumbai, it is a gentle tale of a burgeoning relationship between about-to-retire office worker Saajan Fernandes (Irfan Khan) and homeworker Ila (Nimrat Kaur), who are brought into epistolary contact with one another due to an honest mistake: every day Ila makes lunch for her husband Rajeev (Nakul Vaid), but those responsible for delivering it inadvertently deliver it to Saajan's office instead. Hence Saajan comes to love Ila's cooking, instead of the cauliflower ordered daily from a commercial firm. Ritesh Batra's film is about loneliness, as experienced by Saajan as he commutes daily to a pen-pushing job in an office, and Ila as she stays at home trying in vain to please her spouse. Batra's camera contains numerous close- ups of the two protagonists as they conduct their daily lives, each trying to make the best of a stultifying routine. Eventually they find a way out through letters written to one another, and sent in the lunch-box: Ila writes letters in the full lunch-box, Saajan replies and puts then notes in the empty lunch-box. However this film eschews easy solutions - although the two arrange to meet in a local caf\u00e9, Saajan finds that he lacks the courage to fulfill that meeting, as he becomes conscious of the age-gap between himself and Ila, and his own feelings of mortality. The film ends much as it begins. The film explores an interesting paradox: while Mumbai's streets teem with people, cars and human life, its citizens are prisoners of their own lives. We seldom see Ila except in inferior shots, as she cooks food or sorts through her washing; Saajan is photographed either sitting in his dingy apartment, or in an office full of workers in which no one actually speaks. He establishes a good working relationship with fellow-worker Shaikh (Nawazuddin Siddiqui), but we always feel that Saajan is keeping himself in check, either unable (or unwilling) to commit himself to a lasting friendship. Director Batra explores other paradoxes: the film contains images of perpetual movement - Saajan travels daily on the train to work, Ila takes a taxi to find Saajan's office - but the protagonists' lives are dominated by stasis. Perhaps that's one of the characteristics of all metropolitan lives. Batra's screenplay contains a fair amount of humor, arising principally from the contrast between the eager-to-please Shaikh and the inhibited Saajan (just watch him looking guiltily around at his fellow-diners as he enjoys another one of Ila's delicious meals), that helps to render THE LUNCHBOX a memorable experience.",

I really got into the story and characters in the first 15 minutes, and thought it was a beautiful love story. It was not quite a \"romance\" film for me, but simply love between two lonely adults. I thought it was sweet and enduring and makes us question who and how we become attached to others. The beautiful Nimrat Kaur was amazing in this film and I hope to see more of her in the near future.Side note: I really do not care for Indian food (I've only had it once and it was not a good experience). However, I was fascinated by the cooking and love that went into each recipe and I found myself desiring to taste all the wonderful creations that she was making. I suppose I shall give it another try!",

            "content": "You are often compelled to watch a film because of the buzz it manages to create. In recent times, very few films got spoken off in such glowing terms as 'The Lunch Box.' A lot of the press it received was owing to the fact that it wan't chosen as the official Indian entry for the Oscars. Newspaper pages were filled with the team of 'The Lunch Box' and its many admirers sympathizing how a brilliant film was overlooked and denied its due as the best representative film from India.OMG. The drag of a movie about a developing romantic relationship between a bored housewife (Namrata Kaur in a superb performance) and an elderly Govt. servant (Irrfan Khan) due for retirement has hardly anything to recommend about. Improbable situations of lunch box landing up day after day in an incorrect destination and genesis of an epistolary relationship in its wake seem highly unrealistic. The Ritesh Batra directed film has similarity with the Mrinal Sen directed Bengali film 'ANTAREEN' starring Anjan Dutta and Dimple Kapadia, also about a similar relationship that evolves between two complete strangers. The mellowing of the crusty middle aged Irrfan owing to the relationship with a much younger woman also echoes in some respect to another Mrinal Sen film (Bhuvan Shome).Apart from shots that provide a glimpse of Mumbai life (like market groceries sent up in tightly roped buckets between floors of an Apartment), the film has hardly anything to write home about. The performers act creditably. Nawazuddin Siddiqui does a cameo as a colleague of Irrfan.",

            "content": "I confess that I had never heard of the 'dabbawallas' of Mumbai until I read reviews of the 2013 Indian film \"The Lunchbox\" and it was some time before I managed to rent the movie - a work with a mix of Hindi and English dialogue - which is the first to be both written and directed by Ritesh Batra who was born and raised in the city. Apparently the 'dabbawalla' system is famous in business schools for having been accorded a Sigma Six rating which means that less than one mistake is made in every six million deliveries.Yet Batra has constructed his story around the idea that that, in the case of one office worker, Saajan (played by Irrfan Khan) who is a widower planning to take early retirement, for a successive of weeks he wrongly receives the delicious food cooked by young housewife and mother Ila (played by former model Nimrat Kaur). This leads to an exchange of increasingly lengthy and intimate notes delivered daily with the 'tiffin' (container) that, in the age of instant e-mail, evokes an altogether different age and style.Do Saajan and Ila ever come together and, if so, what happens? The answers are not obvious in this bittersweet romantic comedy that is a delight to watch for its originality, vibrancy and warmth. Both characters are certainly changed by the encounter but, as someone else in the film explains, \"Sometimes even the wrong train can take you to the right destination\".",

'The Luchbox' features wonderful performances from all involved. Striking Nimrat Kaur, daughter of an Indian army officer (who was abducted and killed by Kashmiri Sepratists when she was 12) gives a performance laced with a deep sense of lonely soul searching as an estranged wife and mother. Highly regarded Indian Actor Irran Khan (can't forget his portrayal of the grown up 'Pi') gives equal measure to his detached, yet enigmatic character. Award nominated documentary cinematographer Michal Simmonds manages to combine well designed conventional shots with hand held camera that thankfully does not leave you feeling seasick. German born composer Max Richer adds atmosphere weaving an unobtrusive score. The performers and director seem to work together as if all the scenes are just falling into place without effort or planning. An uncommon feat in this age of computer designed, socially aware (of its self) movie making. Even the main story unfolds via a series of notes scratched out by hand. Don't watch it if looking for action, do watch if looking for introspective entertainment. A movie that tells its story of life's everyday complications without stooping to now common vulgarities.

Lunchbox is a definite watch for few emotions that are rarely touched upon in Indian films.Before I review the movie, I have liked 3 Indian movies this year. LOOTERA. BHAAG MILKHA BHAAG and SHIP OF THESEUS. If Lootera was a fable romance story, Bhaag Milkha Bhaag lifted my spirits and the SHIP OF THESEUS did jolt my consciousness and make me ask many questions. But Lunchbox dug deeper in few emotional aspects. It asked me if I crave for love, long for someone, do I have a heart that empathizes with the aspects of companion and how long will I go .Longing is an universal feeling and that's well portrayed depicted and put in this film. Yet, I too was longing for more after the film. Wish that the film was more in length. In just about 1 hour, its hard to induce a feeling so deep and that's what I believe was the only drawback. The performances were simply superb and even sublime. Nawazuddin Siddiqui was the charmer and the bright spot who brought smiles. Nimrat Kaur was a married yet lonely wife and a caring mother. Irrfan Khan was the perfect gentleman and a serious type who craves for companionship and when he finds, he gives it away with his own prejudices. These three actors are just too good but again in 1 hour they are very short lived and I was craving even for their acting and more of their emotions.The sound editing was at time overlapping but otherwise it gave a realistic feel. The art direction, cinematography were well complemented. The screenplay excelled at places and threw a few surprises too like the coffee shop scene. A few scenes were repetitive which besotted with a sense of deja vu. It indeed worked for the film as it made me feel living a mundane life of the character. The dialogs are witty and smart.If I ever a crib, then it's about the story, well its made of few letters and they do not reveal more emotions. That's one thing I again wanted to see more. Overall it left me disappointed in aspects of time and emotions as they were very short lived. Else, it would have been a wonderful film. Having said that, on the face of it, I like the movie though not loved it. Maybe the interval break which was uncalled for in such a short movie, spoiled the joy. I need to see this without a break so will get a DVD of this.A 4/5 for this and by no means it can be missed. But you watch and decide please. This is one of the most simplistic films you may have seen.Also, I felt hungry after watching this, I just loved the kofta made in this.",

            "content": "This is an era where everything happens fast and social interactions are insidiously influenced by electronic gadgets and social media; an era in which we've grown accustomed to see films for their sheer entertainment value and instant gratifications...films where characters fall in love over lunch and everything is neatly tied up with a bow at the end of the film. I do like and have liked many of them, but it's exactly the reason why we should take a break to savor the slowly-cooked, highly satisfactory course that is \"The Lunchbox\".This is a film where everything happens slowly, coolly and naturally: Sajaan, a sulky, guarded, lonely office worker in Mumbay receives a lunchbox with a homemade meal made by someone's wife (Ila) by mistake, which prompts a genuine and spontaneous exchange between them, which is carried out...by letter.The exchange leads to both of them opening their hearts to each other, to make confessions and express their dreams. Slowly but surely a relationship of sorts develops as Sajaan's walls begin to crumble and Ila is able to glimpse a way out of an unhappy marriage.There are poignant moments filled with silence and contemplation, as well as others of subtle humor as we accompany our protagonists in reading each other's letters and finding out more about the other. Additionally, Ila's dialogs with an aunt we never meet, and Sajaan's evolving relationships with a new co-worker further contribute to both the contemplation and the humor. Like I said, things happen slowly and naturally, but not too slowly so as to say nothing. These people's lives are not rushed and neither is their exchange, but the director does a wonderful job not overdoing it...That's the beauty of this film: the pace is just right...every scene has a reason, every dialog makes sense, nothing is thrown in as a formulaic resource and we are left with an ending that will leave the viewer savoring the film long after the credits roll. I should say that this is not a film to get entertained. It's poignantly funny, but it's mostly a film of contemplation, superbly scripted and acted and that also allows us once again to get a glimpse of a different aspect of Indian culture (and food).",

She desperately hopes that this new recipe will finally arouse some kind of reaction from her neglectful husband. She prepares a special lunchbox to be delivered to him at work, but, it is mistakenly delivered to another office worker, Saajan, a lonely man on the verge of retirement. Curious about the lack of reaction from her husband, Ila puts a little note in the following day's lunchbox, in the hopes of getting to the bottom of the mystery. This begins a series of lunchbox notes between Saajan and Ila, and the mere comfort of communicating with a stranger anonymously soon evolves into an unexpected friendship. Gradually, their notes become little confessions about their loneliness, memories, regrets, fears, and even small joys. They each discover a new sense of self and find an anchor to hold on to in the big city of Mumbai that so often crushes hopes and dreams.

Eventually she tells him her husband has a mistress: she has smelt perfume in her husband's shirts. Naturally, she is downhearted and she starts planning to leave for Bhutan, where one Mumbai rupee is worth five Bhutanese. The accountant agrees to go with her, and they plan to meet. Sadly, that morning, he goes into his grandfather's bathroom and is struck with age, plus someone offers him a seat on the metro, which he tries unsuccessfully to deny. It all combines to cause him to stand her up, although he does secretly attend the restaurant to study her. He notes that she is young and lovely.

Caught up in the dull monotony of our daily routines, we forget how a single flicker of love is enough to lend such light, life and meaning to our everyday existence that everything seems illuminated. As the male protagonist mentions once in the film,\"You forget things when you have no one to tell them to.\"Yes we need to remind ourselves and 'The Lunchbox' does precisely that. It wakes us up to the beauty and music of our everyday life.It's a heartwarming film with a lovely plot. A lunchbox (dabba) being mistakenly delivered leads to an unexpected relationship between a neglected housewife,Ila and a lonely widower about to retire, Saajan as they start exchanging notes with each other through the daily lunchbox.It's refreshing to watch two old souls, strangers to each other, connecting through scribblings in the distracted age of facebook, twitter, instant messaging etc. As their bond develops, they open up their hearts to each other. They pour out all their hopes, dreams, sorrows and even memories of the loved ones they've lost on to sheets of paper. What was that quote? Ah yes! At the touch of love, everyone becomes a poet. The film bears witness to that. lt makes for some truly evocative cinema. 'The Lunchbox' tastes like a sumptuous dish made of love, longing, nostalgia and loneliness.Writer-Director Ritesh Batra must be applauded for infusing soul into his work by imbuing it with so many rich details. Set in Mumbai, the film offers a poetic portrayal of the heart of the city as it captures the detailed journey of a lunchbox from the home-kitchen to the office desk. We get to see the city with it's millions spilling out of locals, people shining shoes, painting street art , sitting behind their office desks , cramped up in their middle-class apartments and so on. Essentially, ordinary folks going about their lives while trying to survive in a bustling city.Irrfan Khan is amazing as the widower(Saajan) who's withdrawn into a shell while bearing the emptiness of life. From the furrowed brow and reserve of a lonely soul to the smiling eyes of a man who finds his heart opening up to life around him(when he falls in love), he's got all the nuances of his character right. He's wonderfully supported in his performance by Nawazuddin Siddiqui who plays a character who's almost the opposite of Saajan- a cheerful talkative man called Shaikh who will replace him at the office once he retires. As an orphan who's made it on his own he 's eager to find a father figure to look up to. It's a joy to see the dynamic between the elder Saajan and Shaikh evolve as Saajan slowly warms up to the endearing Shaikh who believes in making the most of every opportunity.Nimrat Kaur makes an impressive debut as Ila, a real housewife whose lonely life has been reduced to a series of chores. She plays a caring mother trapped in a loveless marriage. Her sad lost eyes seem to be searching for reasons to carry on living. She makes a desperate attempt to infuse life into a failed marriage by whipping up a delicious meal for her cold husband only to find that it was delivered to someone else.Today, when the technology has become so advance that has made communication so easy that people use \"Whatsapp\" even to call a friend who is sitting in the room next to their room, The lunchbox relies on the age old formula of communication through letters, and it does it so effectively that you don't complaint why the two main characters don't exchange phone numbers or why they don't use any other media to communicate.No words are enough to praise the writer-director Ritesh Batra, in his maiden direction venture, Ritesh has shown a great amount of maturity in his work. Mumbai is shot and described so beautifully that made the city a character in the film, every detail is captured beautifully. Though some will find the ending a bit abrupt, but that's how it is, realistic and different, there couldn't be a better end for the script.The lunchbox is one such rare film that makes u feel proud of Indian cinema. One should see and appreciate such brilliant piece of work to encourage filmmakers to give us more films like this , else we would be tortured with more Dabanggs and Bodyguards. As a line in the film goes,\"Sometimes even the wrong train can take you to the right destination\", 'The Lunchbox' truly manages to showcase the hope/promise of the unexpected and the unpredictable. It captures that touch of magic that only the unknown lends to our lives. Don't miss this one!",

            "content": "When tasting someone else's food for the first time, there is always a bit of a risk\u2013whether the food will be satisfactory or not. Will it quench that craving of delight and hunger? Will it sit in your stomach well? The same can be said for film, especially when dealing with a debut director who only has small, difficult to find short-films that are usually discovered by accident or through scouring the web for elongated periods of time. Thankfully, The Lunchbox is a pleasantly packed surprise of a film.It's been a long time since I have anticipated a small independent film that looks to be a happy- go-lucky telling of real people dealing with very real everyday issues. For the most part, so many independent foreign films today are embedded in the world of deep tragedy, pain, and suffering. The Lunchbox is a refreshing and unique gem of a movie filmed on location in Mumbai, India. Although the trailer of the film promises a feel-good premise with the chance of a realistic happy ending, the film instead opts for ambiguity and a chance for hope, another very strong yet common characteristic of independent foreign films.The main incantation of The Lunchbox is that, \"sometimes the wrong train, will get you to the right station\", with a few unexpected stops along the way. Although the film did not fully exceed my expectations and offer a truly unique, foreign experience, the film is still an essential viewing for people with a hard to please foreign appetite.The Lunchbox is a complete sensory film experience. From the moment Saajan Fernandes (the irreplaceable Irrfan Khan) receives his new green lunch surprise full of culinary wonder, he revels in its delicious smell, almost eating his food with his nose. The green lunchbox of wonder that Sajaan receives comes from the magical hands of Ila (the wondrously beautiful Nimrat Kaur). Ila, whose new life as a content housewife, finds very simple pleasure in her everyday duties as a wife and mother; such as the entertaining stories of her unseen Auntie who lives atop her, the longing of her husband's love and affection and the confidence knowing that she prepares a lunch for her husband that is both tasty and nutritious. Unfortunately for her, Ila's husband Rajeev (Nakul Vaid) spends more time at work, in front of his cellphone, and attending to the needs of his profession, never really giving Ila and their daughter any attention.When we first meet Saajan, he is a closed off, lonely man intent on being left alone. Pushing papers and working almost unseen by his employees and the world around him for the last thirty-five years, his world is nudged ever so slightly when he is tasked by his boss to train a new employee, Shaikh (Nawazuddin Siddiqui) who will be taking his spot as he nears retirement. At first, Saajan avoids Shaikh, making a run for it as soon as his shift ends, and diverting the young, enthusiastic Shaikh to mindless duties. As time passes, the wrongly delivered lunches continuously make their way to Saajan, he allows happiness and change to enter his life, allowing him to warm up to Shaikh, as they connect and bond over sharing the miraculous lunch which leads to a healthy friendship for the two co-workers.The film teaches that everyday all over the world people are connected in ways we cannot begin to imagine until we get to know them. First time feature film director Ritesh Batra may not be as discreet with his foreshadowing of people's kindred spirits, but nonetheless, his efforts are met with an open-minded happiness and joy that such a filmmaker exists. Set in the hustling- bustling centre of one of the most populated cities in the world, this small film focuses on the chance relationship between a man and a woman who are both searching for new meaning in their constantly disappointing lives.Both main characters offer us a very sensible look into the lives of men and women in India; the life of a working man in an office; and the life of a domesticated, elegantly unappreciated and beautiful housewife. As the two individuals continue to send letters to one another using the lunchbox as their own personal express-mail system, sharing their inners thoughts, secrets, and discontents with life, they begin a special bond that allows them to enact many of the unwanted desires that allows each of them to better one another's lives. Both Saajan and Ila lead lonely lives, bound to each of their own desks (one an actual desk, the other a kitchen counter top), they use one another bravery and resilience to accept a mundane life for a chance at happiness, which is all you can ask from any piece of art.The Lunchbox is a tiny little film that asks, 'what do we live for?'. Do we live to attend to and please others, packed into an existence that can be easily replaced by a catering service or another employee? Or are we meant for something greater? I may have expected more of the film halfway through the back-and-forth of Ila's and Saajan's letters, but I am reminded of the small beauties of a hearty film such as this one. This is a film that reminds each and every one of us that no matter how small or overpopulated the world may be, there is always time to learn about the different worlds and experiences of people so far away in distance, but close in emotions. \"We forget things if we have no one to tell them to\", as The Lunchbox proclaims, and these are ingredients in a film that work just fine with me.",

            "review_title": "Sweet Indian \"Lunchox\" sets off a Spicy Oscar Controversy",
            "content": "The Lunchbox poster.jpg \"The Lunchbox\" is a sweet new Indian Love Story that has set off a hot controversy over the Indian Oscar entry for 2014 when the director Ritesh Batra publicly questioned the integrity of the Indian Film Federation for selecting a picture with far less likely prospects, \"The Good Road\" as this years official Indian Oscar submission. Despite widespread press and industry condemnation of the Selection committee choice Batra was compelled to make a public apology which he did, but only with great reservation.The Lunchbox, set in Mumbai, revolves around a mistaken delivery by the Dabbawalas (lunchbox service) of Mumbai, which leads to a relationship between Saajan, (Irrfan Khan) a lonely widower close to retirement, and Ila, an unhappy housewife (sublime Nimrat Kaur) as they start exchanging intimate messages inside the daily lunchbox delivery cans. Ritesh's \"lunchbox\" is far more subtle and generally far superior to its distant 1998 American cousin, \"You've got mail\" with Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan) The basic situation: A man who has been grieving since the death of his wife and a woman who is trying to rekindle her philandering husband's love with her gourmet culinary skills by having fantastic lunches sent to his office. Her plan might have worked if the famous lunch delivery men of Bombay known as 'dabbawalas' had not for once in a blue moon flubbed the dub by mistakenly delivering the daily delicacies to the wrong person, at a the wrong company desk. The mistaken lunch delivery becomes the vehicle for an accidental \"pen-pal\" love affair of increasingly touching proportions. This is definitely off-Bollywod fare with no songs and dances, and would have been classified as \"Parallel Cinema\" twenty year ago. Today it rather typifies a new direction toward serious cinema that is slowly gathering steam in Tinseltown, Mumbai.The film had all kinds of European financial backing, but Irrfan Khan and Nawaz Siddiqui -- in a typical juicy supporting role --are both Bollywood character actor stalwarts, and one of the producers is Anurag Kashyap of \"Gangs of Wasseypur\", so this is definitely a Bollywood product -- absent song and dance numbers notwithstanding. The sublimely beautiful actress Nimrat Kaur, is an amazing new revelation, and will probably be cast in some typical musical Bollywood blockbuster soon, even if she is almost too ethereal to do that kind of stuff and nonsense. I was enthralled by her and am now curious to see what some typically kool Bollywood director may do with her next. In Bollywood you just never know ...Lunchbox starts off very slow -- is almost boring for the first half hour, but picks up steam once sly impish Nawazuddin Siddiqui comes onto the scene and then winds up becoming a romantic cliffhanger -- (will the virtual lovers ever get together, or not!) -- one of the most unusual movies to come out of Bombay in recent years.Irrfan Kan who was the brutal sadistic policeman in \"Slumdog Millionaire\", has gradually moved up from offbeat by-player bits to serious leading man roles in a tastily gathering middle-age. In \"Lunchbox\" he has the dignity and other qualities of an Indic edition of Hollywood golden-age leading man Ronald Coleman! \"The Lunchbox\" is the debut feature of 34 year old director Ritesh Batra whose earlier short films have won numerous awards. Lunchbox premiered at Cannes 2013 and gathered more attention at such prestige festivals as Telluride and Toronto. It was generally considered a shoo-in for Oscar consideration but the unexpected federation choice of a much more obscure film from Gujarat Province has been roundly condemned by many leading Bollywood personalities, among them celebrity directors Karan Johar and Anurag Kashyap.India has never won a Best Foreign Language Film Award in Hollywood and Lunchbox was easily the best candidate to finally bring home the bacon. This is undoubtedly a big disappointment for relatively young director Batra, but it will very likely serve as the stepping stone to even bigger if not necessarily better things. Lunchbox will be a hard act to beat. Caught up with in Paris of all places, around Xmas 2013.",

            "content": "Greetings again from the darkness. What a terrific first feature film from writer/director Ritesh Batra. Don't mistake this for the typical Bollywood release in the U.S. There are no song and dance numbers here. Instead it's a very intimate portrait of how two people awaken to their own situations by connecting with each other through notes in a lunchbox.Lunchbox takes on a life of it's own when referring to the dabbawallahs - the infamous lunch delivery men in Mumbai. The opening credits provide us a ride-along with the key lunchbox as it takes multiple forms of transportation prior to arriving at its destination. Only this time, a rare mistake occurs. The lunchbox from Ila lands on the busy desk of Saajan, rather than her husband. See, Ila is trying to re-capture the attention of her distracted husband. Instead, she finds a soul mate via note exchange and tasty dishes.While Ila is a desperate and frustrated housewife, Raajan is a melancholy widower who is headed to retirement in hopes that it helps him forget all that he now tries to cover up through his cigarette habit and retreat from society. The real magic here stems from the slow process of self-realization that occurs for the two characters. There is humor and emotion aplenty, yet both performances of Irrfan Khan (Saajan) and Nimrat Kaur (Ila) are remarkably understated and believable and touching. We immediately care for both.Nawazuddin Siddiqui offers support as the very interesting and entertaining Shaikh ... a character that could easily support his own film. We also see Lillete Dubey as Ila's mother. Ms. Dubey was terrific in Monsoon Wedding (2001). Equally impressive is the viewpoint of Mumbai. The overcrowded streets, trains and buses leave us understanding how difficult daily life is for these folks.Not since Lost in Translation has a platonic relationship been so effectively told on screen. This story and these characters remind us just how important human connection is ... letting someone share your dreams is a rewarding step.",

            "content": "Bollywood has long been known to have its own standard template for fluffy love stories, following the boy-meets-girl-and-love-happens routine.But once in a while, it surprises us and strikes a chord in our heart with unusual tales of the unlikeliest of bonds between random people, who come together by a sudden quirk of fate. Helmed by d\u00e9butant film-maker Ritesh Batra, The Lunchbox tells one story of two strangers who fall in love without ever having met each other which starts with a misplaced dabba delivery.In the age of hi-tech gadgets and social networking with WhatsApp ruling the roost, Batra narrates this poignant tale where the protagonists develop a platonic relationship through routinely exchanged letters tucked in a lunchbox.I don't know whether this is a novel idea but the aroma emanating from its sensitive and persuasive narrative transcends all linguistic and ethnic confines with its universal appeal to become a true Oscar contender.Shot in the bustling metropolis of the maximum city, the film traces the journey of a middle-class housewife,Ila(Nimrat Kaur) trying to add spice to her married life through her culinary skills, but all in vein.On the other side of the fence, is Saajan Fernandez(Irrfan Khan)a soon-to- retire accountant and widower ,a grouch avoided by all with no zest in life.One day,Dabbawala goofs up..a lunchbox prepared by Ila for her hubby reaches Saajan instead who devours it and returns the box empty.Disgusted by his discourteous demeanor, Ila sends a sarcasm note the next day to which he responds!Gradually, the two start writing daily , share their jokes and apprehensions..and finally a desire to meet.The delicacy of the Lunchbox lies in its simplicity and utterly- believable diversity.Irrfan's workplace is a government office stuffed with musty files while Nimrat's is a middle-class household where neighbours share ingredients across floors by lowering baskets over the balconies!Batra makes simple things in life look so poetic.Without any tangible interaction, there is a strong sensuality between the two characters which overshadows the inner turmoil and loneliness ravaging their hearts.Adding quirkiness to the snail-paced plot is Aslam Shaikh(Nawazuddin Siddiqui),Saajan's assistant who signifies the optimistic spirit of Mumbai.Shaikh's pesky antics and quoting her non- existent mom's anecdotes in every single conversation are real master- strokes.Batra gives a dash of inventiveness with the voice of Aunty(Bharti Achrekar) who is only heard but never seen.The Lunchbox is performances galore.Irrfan Khan leads all the way with his committed act and gives the much-required emotional impetus to Fernandez's moribund existence.Watch him catching himself in a street- painter's drawing or blushing while reading Nimrat's letters,you would be doubly sure that only an actor of his calibre could pull off this part with such deftness.Playing a man at late 50's and displaying those array of emotions is no mean feat!Nimrat,who melted our hearts with the Cadbury's Silk ad matches up to the towering actors - Irrfan,Siddiqui with her classy histrionics.The warmth with which she liberates Ila from a turbulent time and mundane routine is noteworthy. Lillete Dubey impresses in a two-scene cameo as Ila's ill-fated mom.One of the film's trump card is its unconventional climax which was left to the audience's interpretation.Now there would be an inevitable disappointment if we don't find a tray of desserts after a sumptuous meal.However, its a story which is deeply insightful and thought- provoking,narrated with so much of compassion.Treat yourself with The Lunchbox, I am sure you will relish it !A special note of thanks to Karan Johar and the band-wagon of co- producers who came aboard to distribute the film after its critical acclaim at the various International film festivals.",

            "content": "Ritesh Batra's debut 'The Lunchbox' is a delightful film set in Mumbai, India. Saajan (Irrfan Khan) is a grieving widower who is counting down the days before his retirement as a government pen-pusher. His favourite time of day is when he receives his lunchtime lunchbox, courtesy of the legendary Dabbawala service which delivers millions of lunch boxes every day.One day, the food delivered is far superior to the food he normally receives. It turns out that this delicious lunchbox was made by a bored housewife called Ila (Nimrat Kaur), who is trying to win back her disinterested husband. When they both realise whats happened, they strike up an unlikely relationship through letters. Initially venting the frustrations in their lives, the letters become increasingly personal and they decide to meet.Batra explores this friendship through these letters, unearthing the insecurities in both characters, especially Saajans alienation from life since his wife's death. They both use these letters to expose their failings, and perhaps to demystify them too. The letters help to engage and disengage themselves from each other, allowing them to make life- changing decisions which they may not have been able to do otherwise.Saajan also unravels a fondness for the person who will eventually take over his job, Shaikh (Nawazuddin Siddiqui). His pained demeanour hides for the most part his sadness, with Shaikh and Ila aiding his rehabilitation back to some sort of normality. Some great performances are led by Irrfan Khan, giving yet another excellent character study. 'The Lunchbox' is a delicate, charming drama showing the positive effects food can have on people, and how anyone of any age has something to offer others in those moments of loneliness. In these fast-paced times, these simplest of pleasures still provide the most nourishment.",

            "review_title": "A film of surprising depth as well as gratifying.",
            "content": "When viewing the trailer to this movie, it did look slightly on the tacky and sentimental side. With these low expectations in mind, I was pleasantly surprised by the level of depth this film had with such a simple idea that could have easily have drowned in a sea of mawkish sludge.The film follows two believable characters. One is Sajaan Fernandes (Irrfan Khan), a man who leads a busy but lonely life. He is heading into his twilight years and is considering retirement from a position in claims department which he has held for 35 years. The other character is Ila (Nimrat Kaur), a housewife trying to get her husbands attention through his stomach. She tries to make an elaborate lunch box for him to be delivered to his work, but it mistakenly gets delivered to Fernandes.The interesting thing about this film to those unfamiliar with Mumbai and the meticulous lunch box delivery system is that it takes us through the lunch box's journey from Ila's house, to bicycle, to a range of transportation through the crowded city of Mumbai including rickshaws and trains, to the office where Fernandes works. It is a functional and well organised system well known for not making a mistake. An exception is made when two similar looking lunch box's are mixed up and Fernandes is the lucky guy who receives Ila's lunch box. When the deliveries keep ending up going to the same person, they both start to realise that it is a mistake and they both start to communicate using notes concealed in the lunch box. Ila tells of her efforts to try and please her husband with her food and how lonely her life is. We do see her on her own most of the time in the kitchen. She shouts upstairs to her off screen neighbour for general advice and lets her in on the lunch box mix up and the letters she is receiving. When her husband comes home from work he basically ignores her and is straight on the phone. It is revealed that he is cheating on her, which she reveals to Fernandes. Fernandes tells Ila of his loneliness and fear of old age as he faces retirement. We see him trying to get on with his job, but he keeps being interrupted by the tenacious and cheerfully intrusive Shaikh (Nawazuddin Siddiqui), who is to be Fernandes' replacement. At first Shaikh comes across as annoying, but when Fernandes learns that he has had a hard life for a man his age due to being an orphan, he starts to help Shaikh with his training. A sweet relationship develops between the two as they become friends.Both main characters are portrayed separately through the duration of the film as the much anticipated meet up never happens. Instead the audience is left with the possibility that they will some day, which was a good way to end it. Through each note, both characters start to open up more about their personal lives and their feelings towards each other grow. The Director and writer Ritesh Batra does well to keep the audience interested as much of the film is the notes acting as a narration. We are shown images of a feeling both characters share which is loneliness and they both have similar fears. Ila faces the prospect of being in a loveless marriage and possibly, like her mother, may have to take care of her husband while he is sick. Something which her mother reveals very honestly as something which repulsed her. There is an unseen suicide during the film which causes a lot of traffic in Mumbai. Ila writes morbidly in her note what may have been going through her mind and how much courage it takes to throw yourself off a tall building. It hints at the hopelessness and unhappiness that some people endure in this relentless city and a possible fleeting thought of what Ila may or may not be considering. Fernandes is afraid of dying alone as he seems to have no family or friends, which is why he takes pity on Shaikh when he asks Fernandes to be a witness at his wedding as he has no family. Through his notes, there are subtle revelations at the state of Mumbai and Indian society with it's increasing overcrowding and relentlessly busy lives which people live. We see him go to and from work on a very busy train which he can never find a seat. The overcrowding somehow makes Fernandes seem more lonely. The notes seem to be the only thing which makes him smile and keeps him going.This is not a film normally go and see, but I am glad I have watched it as it has turned out to be one of the surprise movies so far this year. It is a largely heart-warming film which mixes in equal measures a rather bleak outlook which many people have to bear, but has rather positive outlook through human connection, ironically through concealed notes. It will also leave you hungry and with the want of going to the nearest Indian takeaway when leaving the cinema.See my Film Review Blog- www.projectionistreview.wordpress.com",

There is the widower and soon to be retired Sajaan, Ila the wife in a loveless marriage and Shaikh the parentless trainee that will replace Sajaan.One day Sajaan gets the lunchbox intended for Ila's husband. She discovers this because all the food is eaten. The day after she includes a message, and that is the start of Ila's and Sajaan's correspondence that is the main story in the movie.The movie moves in a slow steps, one step with each letter. It is a good story, with ups and downs as in all lives. It is a reflective story, about life, the meaning in it, age and in a subtle way love. It is nice to see how each character develops slowly, each one taking more and more control of their own lives. It is easy to sympathize with the characters and feel for them, and in a way you are sad to see them go when the movie ends.All in all, it is a nice movie. There are no major events, effects or traumas in the movie that increases the pace or engaged me a little extra. But it was never dull either. It had it's own peculiar, sometimes a little quirky, humor that made me smile. I am glad I have seen it, but it will probably be on one of my top lists.",

            "content": "'The Lunchbox' is a wondrous film. I thought of five different ways I could make the opening of this review more appealing but then that would be ironical given that the film thrives on its gift of fluid simplicity. The story revolves around two characters brought together by a fortuitous mistake, that of the hallowed dabbawala delivering the wrong lunch box. An ageing widower is accidentally fed a sumptuous meal cooked by a young wife angling for her husband's affections through the proverbial gastronomic route. The dabba returns to the wife in the evening and so does the apathy of the aloof husband, oblivious of the slipup. The elements which prompt her to cook with the same vigour the following day, yet not flag the previous day's mistake with the messenger conspires further when an unsure correspondence is struck between the two - He, true to his staid economy of words and she, to her clamant need to confide. The platter changes with time as anonymity breeds confidence between two unsuspecting strangers. They gravitate towards each other, bound by the cords of empathy and their own private miseries. What is most tantalizingly beautiful is how the mirthless Fernandez rediscovers his zest for life in these letters yet cannot bring himself to tear down his prison of laconic brevity. He basks in the glory of having bought a painting of a city landscape which has him in it, or so he thinks. He plays the reformed 'selfish giant' with kids, tries to quit smoking, proclaims unabashedly of having a 'girlfriend' to a young couple and then in an moment of inspiration proposes a refuge from their miserable lives \u2013 a promise to build anew. But, just when he is about to launch into his flight of resurrection does he stumble upon the paralyzing reality of mortality and its attendant anxieties. He finds his chains too comfortingly familiar for him to wish away in return for an unknown territory and its uncertainties. Doubt gets the better of him. The story ends amidst the same mosaic of urban chaos as it started in and with it we come to a grudging acceptance of the limitations of our ordinary lives - Lives which would have been rendered joyless if not for a few sparks of brilliance lending the quiet satisfaction of having lived a full life, a good life.",

            "content": "Like 2 negatives multiplied make a positive, can sanguinity emerge when two melancholic lives intersect? Can a misdelivered dabba connect people better than the 24x7 online messaging systems? Is Bollywood actually coming off age where parallel and real cinema is merging with commercial? You are certainly going to find all these answers in affirmative in d\u00e9butant director Ritesh Batra's 'The Lunch Box'. This movie is more of a journey through the hearts and lives of its central characters wherein you literally feel their emotions and experience the anxiety of the unknown next. Without delving much into the details of the storyline, let me share my views on various facets of the movie:\u0095 Plot: 'The Lunch Box' is like a blanket made of wool of solitude of the 2 central characters and a little dash of heart-filled humor by Nawazuddin's character, woven manually on a frame called Mumbai. Batra takes you through 2 major lifelines of the city of dreams \u2013 local trains and dabbawalas. However, life of the movie is the platonic relationship that develops between Saajan and Ila over the reels and how this new feeling sprinkles drops of water over their dry and dreary routines, melts the snow of somberness Saajan dons initially, rejuvenating the soft-man in him and in parallel gives hope and confidence to Ila to break- free from mental and societal shackles. Nostalgia is in the air intermittently and takes the audience too, down their memory lanes through old songs and serials.\u0095 Cast: There could have been no better and apt a star-cast than this! Watching adept Irrfan and latest sensation Nawazuddin in the same frame rekindles the Naseer-Om effect. Irrfan looked every bit of an old man nearing superannuation, exuding the required poise, irritability, lost-looks, slow reflexes, walk and talk, et al! Nawazuddin is endearing with his irritating yet lively presence and adds tadka of entertainment to the plain lunch. However, the revelation of the film is theater- actress Nimrat Kaur. Man! She reminds you of the realism brought on screen earlier by adroit Shabana and Tabu. To know her caliber, compare her glam avatar in the Silk ad aired these days with the diametrically opposite Ila where she plays a lonely, insecure, simple (no-makeup) housewife. She has literally lived the character on-screen. Bharati Achrekar is lovable even without being physically present.\u0095 Cinematography: The realism created by believable locations is another high-point of the movie, whether it is the typical government office or congested flats and societies or the life in locals. Full marks to Michael Simmonds (the man behind camera for 'Paranormal Activity 2') for his lens-work.\u0095 Music: Except for the Tukaram prayer (hardly an obstruction) recited by Dabbawalas, 'The Lunch Box' is a song-less movie. Full marks for the same.\u0095 Climax: Movie ends a bit unconventionally which does not go well with the expectations of a section of audience. It's a bit open-ended and leaves a lot to the imagination of viewers. However, we are slowly getting used to such endings in B-town movies now, which aren't necessarily the 'They lived happily ever after' types.To conclude, this lunch-box is a completely fulfilling homemade feast with mesmerizing aroma of class performances and poignant story. Kudos to the joint producers - UTV, Dharma (of Karan Johar), Sikhya (of Anurag Kashyap), DAR and NFDC, for shelling money for such a creation. Ye lunch to definitely restaurant (theater) me khana banta hai boss!",

An ardent movie watcher can watch the movie with fervor, which may not be there for everyone but this movie shows something which everyone will cherish. The characters in the movie is quite firmly built and even those whose voice is present can be related to. I don't want to give any specifics of the movie as it generally kills the motive of movie watching, but I will state this that the movie takes you to a life of an ordinary man in his 40s which takes some out of ordinary turns and lands him into realizing the meaning of age. Dabbawalas are also kind of an important entity in the movie. Also, many of us was unable to get an appropriate ending in the movie, which was just left to the viewers to think about. But in my opinion, the timing of the Dabbawalas are clearly shown with respect to the timing of the school which is evident that the ending is happy.All in all the acting of all the characters are extremely good and goes a long way to elevate the movie to a different level.",

It is sweet but very slow and hardly you will be able to smile. I enjoyed the movie anyhow but big disappointment is it's climax. It is just like been poured some kerosene oil after the good lunch. I am confused that did I miss something or am I stupid enough to not understand some very intellectual stuff, whatever but I was unable to understand and bear it. I believe that cinema and television have some basic difference between them. Cinema is larger and big in reverse of television. This movie is typical television stuff.

            "content": "Lot of expectations you have when people (read: India's critically acclaimed directors/producers) are dejected for a movie not being selected as the official Indian entry for the Oscars. So much for the hype, I went to watch this movie even when I had very few monies in my pocket. And I was... not disappointed.Mr. Fernandez, an old grieving man since death of his wife is about to retire from his job. A housewife, Ila is lonely and feeling worthless due to utter negligence of her husband. She hopes to win her husband's love by cooking the best food she can. And the famous Mumbai's Dabbawallas acting as an accidental messenger between the two. The Dabbawallas commit a rare error and the 'dabba' that Ila cooked for her husband after umpteen consultations from the wise old aunty living upstairs lands on the desk of Mr Fernandez. Fernandez eats up everything and thus begins the journey of the conversations. Strangers exchange letters discussing their everyday troubles, regrets, dreams and hopes via the dabbas. Finally, both have someone they can talk to.Though the plot is quite unconventional, lovable and interesting, I think it's not fully developed. It's a good idea not to show everything, and leave a lot for the viewers to understand. The feeling and connection between the protagonists is a bit difficult to feel, and it's left simmering beneath the surface. Talking about the central idea of the movie 'Can you love someone whom you have never met?' is shown to be true in a convincing manner. On multiple levels, the strangers have the strong urge to meet each other, they wait eagerly to read the next letter and even plan on running away together. The relationship between the two has the charm and innocence as that of first love. If this is not love then I don't know what is. The conversations between the two reveal a lot about how love is much more about internal intimate connect and doesn't care about the external coverings at all. For the viewers there is a bit of disconnect in evoking the same feelings (as that of protagnists) that the strangers should meet for once at least, that's bit subjective too.Irrfan khan is one of the most gifted actors, and he has again shown his immense talent without talking much. The new comer Nimrat kaur is the star of the movie for me, the brilliant and naturalistic manner in which she has portrayed the character gives a clear feeling how a common Indian housewife feels. The side character played by Nawazzudin has done a tremendous job, fitting really well in the canvas of the movie, acting as a hardworking average guy with big dreams. Lillete dubey does a cameo and does it very well.Lunchbox is one of the best movies of this year and there is no doubt about it. It's heartwarming to see Indian mainstream film makers coming up with brave concepts and talented actors are pulling them off. This is the direction I would like Indian cinema to go in, and we as viewers have only two words to say... 'Good Luck'.",

            "content": "A small but interesting film about simple people in India today, simple is a way of speaking since the main character is dealing with public finances. But that is not really important. There is no ostentatious Hindu religion. There is no Muslim religion. We are obviously living among Hindu people and on the train to and from Mumbai, now and then there is a group of children reciting mantras in order to get a coin or two: in other words they are begging. We may also have a set of adult males doing the same, reciting mantras, we assume all along the trip. But that's little. This absence of Hinduism enables the film to be totally silent on the worst problem of India today, the Dalits. This silence on this social problem is surprising, or maybe not so surprising after all. Let's push that modern form of slavery under the table or under the carpet and it does not exist.The film is just a story about a man who is going to retire. He is aging. Due to a mistake in the lunchbox delivery system he gets the lunchbox from a woman who is trying to re-conquer her husband by cooking special lunches for him. An epistolary relation starts via the lunchbox: message to and message fro. Till a meeting becomes possible. But it is then the aging man discovers he has no right to entertain some illusion about that younger woman, nor nurture illusions in her about a rejuvenating love affair which is nothing but a compensation for her inability to have a relation with her own husband. And he has no right to flatter his ego with the idea that he might still be young, to the point of maybe not retiring after all.So everything goes right in the end, and he retires and his successor can take over. This successor is a total mystery since he is an absolute orphan but he is not a Dalit, and cannot be one since after some time his girlfriend who eloped with him gets the benediction of her rich father and they get married. Such a man who educated himself and who got experience in other countries before coming back to India is fascinating in a way because we can see everyday in our cities these Hindus from Sri Lanka (Tamils) or from India (Hindis or Tamils) selling fruit at the entrance of underground stations. To expatriate themselves, at least for a while seems to be part of the life experience of a certain proportion of Hindis and Tamils for very different reasons at times, since the Tamils of Sri Lanka mostly went to Europe or Australia and Canada to run away from the civil war of the terrorist Tamil Tigers, though they were then the preys of these Tigers who blackmailed them with their relatives in Sri Lanka to force them to pay the \"revolutionary tax.\" The film does not really say how and why that young man expatriated himself.That's the most surprising aspect of the film. It remains very vague on details and explanations. And in the end it is a very sad film about aging accepted by the main character but that leads him to a life of total idleness he turns into some kind of voyeurism from his terrace into the home of what appears to be a Christian family. Nostalgia for real life, with a family and an activity.India has to cope with this problem fast otherwise the country will do the same as the population: it will age in idleness and the inability to be productive and creative.

The main flaw here is a short film being made into full length feature which has drastically effected its narration. The story may be new in Bollywood but then the slow narration has taken a front seat here. There are a few good things here though...\"Nawazuddin Siddique\" is the main asset of the movie and his presence here is a treat. Irrfan Khan and Nimrat Kaur are good in their parts but as mentioned above the movie is too slow. The story here is also too plain and its seriously a documentary turned movie so you cant really expect much.Verdict: This movie is neither art nor is it entertainment lies in the between and is a totally \"Average\" movie 5/10",

            "content": "'New Indian cinema' contains a broad spectrum of various genres, directors and other classifications of films. It is in essence the collection of all those who oppose the dominant film code of Bollywood in alternating ways (Verma, 2011). One of the most interesting films is Ritesh Batra's The Lunchbox (2013), as it feels more like a European art house film set in Mumbai than a traditional Indian film.To accurately denote how The Lunchbox differs from the dominant Bollywood code a clear definition of the latter is needed. Ganti has postulated that the English-speaking world created the term 'Bollywood' in the '70s, when the biggest Indian productions generated international interest for the first time. The coagulation of 'Bombay' and 'Hollywood' was a reference to the influence of Bombay film productions on the Indian cinema culture as they are shown nationally and internationally. A more recent interpretation of the term refers to the Bombay cinema as the only non-Hollywood film industry that is globally dominant and present. However, the actual use of the term indicates a specific film style instead of a particular film industry; there are 'Bollywood' films that are not made in Bombay (2004). The primary aspect of the archetypical 'Bollywood' production is the melodrama, both in content -the masala mix of many genres, and aesthetically -in the staging, colour use and acting (Mishra, 2002; Mooij, 2006). An important point in the comparison to North-American film history is the continued dominance of the 'Bollywood aesthetic'. Whereas Hollywood experienced a crisis in the '60s, which led to a change in film style due to the rise of new Hollywood and the end of the production code, major 'Bollywood' productions have largely remained unchanged in their aesthetic since the advent of widescreen in the '50s. Lutgendorf has noted that this cinematic aesthetic was already present in the foundation of 'Bollywood', namely the pre-modern Indian storytellers that \"were already fond of flashbacks, lyrical interludes, surreal landscapes, and vast and crowded Cinemascopic tableaux; their language was visually intense, almost hallucinatory: screenplays awaiting the screen.\" (2006, p. 250)The most important aspect of the 'Bollywood aesthetic' for this essay is the rejection of the realistic portrayal that is dominant in Western film culture. This preference for the constructed, the supernatural was, as mentioned above, present in oral tradition long before the advent of cinema. To break with this aesthetic is thusly moving away from not only the dominant film style but also Indian storytelling in general. This is why The Lunchbox appears to the spectator as a non-Indian film, because it conveys a story in a way that mirrors the Western narrative film tradition through its realism. Firstly, Batra utilises no non-diegetic music or song and no voice-over. His film contains two songs in a repeated scene, he shows the lunchbox carriers singing on the train both times. This results in an accurate representation of Mumbai with diegetic music. The Lunchbox only hints at the 'Bollywood' dance scene when two characters are discussing an old hit song that originated from a 'Bollywood' film. In summary, the film acknowledges the dominant film style, but rejects the constructed nature of independent or integrated dance scenes in its goal for realism.Furthermore, Batra employs a -in contrast to the vibrant style of 'Bollywood', dull colour pallet, giving Mumbai/Bombay a gritty and bleak outlook, akin to the character of a modernised urban environment. The Lunchbox has many dark scenes, in contrast to many 'Bollywood' productions that are always well lit. This darker aesthetic is also translated into the content, as the film deals with topics such as loneliness, infidelity, addiction and estrangement. Batra wants to portray the whole picture of Indian society, not just the good and beautiful parts as is done in most of the 'Bollywood' productions. Above all he wants to explore the social conditions through individual characters, in other words not a general realistic aesthetic but a specific form created by Michelangelo Antonioni, i.e. introspective realism. The adaptation of this style is further exemplified in the many shots where the protagonist is the only object in focus, symbolising their estrangement, a schemata Antonioni perfected in Il Deserto Rosso (1964) (Cook, 2004). In addition, The Lunchbox displays many scenes in the style of the slow cinema where the film time and the real time are equal. The most striking examples are the scenes that present the protagonist consuming the daily lunchboxes, all in long takes. Cook notes in his book from 2004 that this stylistic technique also originated from the work of Michelangelo Antonioni, who introduced it in L'Avventura (1960).Conversely, the only filmic aspect Batra retains from the 'Bollywood' aesthetic is the cinematic aspect ratio of 2.35:1 (the standardised CinemaScope format). This indicates that he still envisioned The Lunchbox to be shown in theatres and cinemas rather than on television. Batra does not eschew the economical aspect of the Indian film tradition; he does not aim for the same audiences as 'Bollywood', but still strives to reach niche crowds in smaller venues and multiplexes. Overall, Batra has rejected the dominant 'Bollywood' tradition not out of a reactionary action. He wanted to realistically portray the social problems that arise in a modernised urban environment. The 'Bollywood' aesthetic, with its melodramatic staging, masala story structure, colourful pallet and energetic dance sequences, is not suited to convey stories about estrangement and isolation. The Lunchbox adapts from Michelangelo Antonioni, a filmmaker that also dealt with the topic of modernisation and how it impacted those who experienced it. Subsequently, given the motivation behind Batra's appropriation of Western film tradition, it is unfair to devalue his film as a languid way to appease international audiences, as was the case in Sarina Masukor's review of the film (2015). The Lunchbox handles its external film language for the purpose of reflecting on and criticising the Indian society and culture that has undergone modernisation, a fact that major 'Bollywood' productions often neglect in their narrative structure.Cook, D.

It is an adult film that gives you enough to chew on but doesn't give you instant gratification or happily ever after, yet it leaves you with hope that the two of them will find happiness, may be!

Ritesh Batra, the director, was unknown to me until this movie. What a way to start his career. Everything is just so perfect about this movie. The director succeeds in capturing true human emotions. The director also succeeded in capturing the hard life in Mumbai in just 2 hours. The movie portrays neglected housewives who live vulnerable lives in the never-stopping-city. How hard life is for the ever caring mothers who are not given attention by their husbands. The director's choice of picking songs is applaudable. Sajan movie's song easily mixes up with boys singing song in train. WOW.Coming to the performances, Nimrat Kaur as Ila is the cornerstone of the film. Nirmat Kaur, the unknown actress makes her mark quite powerfully. Irrfan khan, you are a living legend man, WOW. Nawazuddin Siddiqui (kaise he sir?) hahahaha...speechless about his performance. Not to forget terrific Bharati Achrekar, who was heard but never seen. Well, coming to the end, the film shows you the hardship and pain of life: it sketches the loneliness of Mumbai.

            "content": "'Dabba', or it's English title 'The Lunchbox', is the debut feature film of Ritesh Batra. Following the lives of Saajan (Irrfan Khan, Life of Pi), an office worker on the brink of retirement, and Ila (Nimrat Kaur, Luv Shuv Tey Chicken Khurana), a housewife trying to rekindle the romance between her passionless husband. Upon making him a special lunch, her meal is sent to Saajan instead, where an unlikely friendship blossoms.Batra has done a wonderful job at capturing the lifestyle of modern Indian culture - claustrophobic trains, busy streets and rustic buildings are among the many backdrops this movie has to offer. Colourful without being overwhelming, DOP Michael Simmons has crafted a very beautiful film. Batra has also pulled out some exceptional, low-key performances from Khan and Kaur. The movie is paced pretty well, though the 100 minutes did feel like a bit over 2 hours.Now, the main issue with the film - this movie is billed as a romance, the tag-line is \"Can you fall in love with someone you have never met?\" and at no stage did I feel the romance between the two leads were believable at all. The two exchanging notes through titular lunchbox, and are talking about everyday, mundane activities for most of the film, so when the romantic aspect was introduced, I was very surprised. The actual premise of the film is not original at all, (which isn't necessarily a bad thing), however, in this case I felt that the way the plot was introduced and progressed felt really contrived. The film is very much a character study, but Khan definitely gets way more focus than need be in the film, leaving Kaur's character of the lonely lover rather one-note and two-dimensional. The child actors are also rather wooden, but they aren't on screen for a large amount of time, so the movie isn't too grating to watch when they're around. The ending, while bittersweet, is rather unsatisfying, leading the audience to think that Batra himself wasn't sure how to end the picture.Overall, it's still an enjoyable, well-made flick, but a rather overrated one at that. 6/10.",

A delightful movie exploring the careful and precise systematic work of the Dabbawalas of Mumbai who work relentlessly to deliver tiffins from various places, across a number of transports, to their destined employees. When among these deliveries, two similar looking tiffin bags get switched and reach unintended employees, a bond is struck between a middle-class neglected housewife, Ila, and an about-to-retire lonely and routine-obsessed widower, Saajan. In this age of multimedia, they write letters to each other and unburden themselves to each other.Irrfan Khan (as always) and Simrat Kaur's natural and nuanced performances make the characters so real and relateable; we empathize with their pain and woes. Nawazuddin Siddiqui as the supporting character, Shaikh, is incredible; his dialogues and impeccable comic timing give the movie its few scenes of humour. His character has a lot to offer.Debutant Director/ Screenwriter Ritesh Batra certainly has a lot of talent and charm. Looking forward to his future works. I especially love this one scene where both the lead protagonists are in a cafe, not sitting with each other, and Saajan (Irrfan) explains in a letter why he didn't show up for the Lunch Date. The wordings, the acting and the music, everything combines to give the scene its soul.The characters and situations together form thought-provoking stories of love. I wouldn't call it your average bollywood romance; it's much more than that.

            "content": "A good film. A very very good film. Heart-warming and sad, this is a film that touches the soul. Both the characters, of Mr. Fernandes and Ila are so very real and palpable. The city of Mumbai, like always, is the central character in the film - the backdrop against which millions of such small human events occur. The acting of Irfan Khan, Nimrat Kaur and Nawazuddin Siddiqui is beyond words. It is nothing short of excellent. The subdued, government like stance of Sajan Fernandes, with the hopefulness of Ila and the irritating bugging of Shaikh (who can't be Shaikh-en off - sorry couldn't resist the PJ) is brilliantly portrayed by the three actors. In a somewhat 1984-ish setting with an overbearing and overcrowded city, Irfan is just another cog in the wheel until he is brought to self- awareness or rather awoken from his somnolence by the catalytic food of Fate.The very ephemeral nature of the whole event, brought about by sheer chance and coincidence, is touching and it just exemplifies how lonely we all are in the great rat race of life. Mr. Fernandes is a husk of a man, driven rigid and gnarled by running the self-same rails of his colorless monotonous life. Similarly, Ila, the housewife, is a woman whose heart longs for human contact and affection, but does not get it. And what brings them closer is food. Food and eating is always associated with physical nourishment, but at a communal level, also with mental harmony. I mean, we all feel happy after a good meal. That is what good cuisine is all about - remember Anton Ego's reaction when he tasted the ratatouille in Ratatouille? It touches the soul and maybe, in some cases, awaken some long lost happy memory. Which it does in Mr. Fernandes. By connecting with Ila, over food, he is able to remember himself and what he was. In one of the most important lines in the film, he tells her, through his note, that one tends to forget things if one does have anyone to share it with. This is how, the communal harmony, of food being the lodestone of any culture is beautifully put forward. The remembrance of things past, of rediscovery through Ila's cooking is excellently brought forward by Mr. Fernandes. Like Mr. Fernandes, Ila, too is an anchor-less soul wondering how she can re-connect with her husband or with her life. The motif of food vs. memory is once again brought about when Ila's father dies. Her mother says, in a very very touching scene, that she is hungry. All those years of taking care of a severely ill man made her forget what she was and what she needed. With his death, the memory (with hunger pangs) awakens in the present.For me, the film made me recall Sofia Coppola's excellent Lost in Translation. Which, in a way, has a similar premise, although different. Like Lost in Translation, this film too is about human emotions and human contact. The ending is, indubitably, sad, but it is something that we always knew. Some things, however sweet, will not happen, because, in some way, the society will hinder it. In a way, the \"communal harmony\" will be disrupted. Thus, what we are left with, is something unique, something special, something that lingers in your memory for a long time. It did. For me. Did it for you?",

I am sure all the characters will remain with you for a long time.The story is simple and realistic. Though the world famous 'Dabbawalas' are famous for their accuracy still somehow the lead characters' lives get involved with each other. Maybe Batra wants to give a message to everyone that even when the odds of finding love is almost against you you should take your chances. Screenplay is just enough to glue the audience to their seats even if for a moment we ignore the stellar performances and Batra's direction.Cinematography is good but not certainly the best. Again this film is not meant to be visually stunning. I really liked the editing. Especially the portions when both Saajan and Ila were somehow listening to the same songs at a time. (again chances of something like that happening is almost none). The end is really something. Batra has given the full autonomy to the audience for imagining how things might have panned out after that.

As not being to India and not familiar with the transport and ways of living except what I hear from relatives and friend and watching various documentaries on television, was amazing to see how effective the 'dabbawallah' system operates in Mumbai, of course as this movie showed of an exception where the 'dabba' goes to the wrong person and how the story revolves in this circumstances. Well acted by Irrfan Khan specially after his brilliant award winning role in Paan Singh Tomar. The movie highlights the loneliness, the neighbours, train rides in Mumbai and of course the workplace. This movies once again proves to make a fine well-liked movies, one does not need to go out of India for locations, no need of big stars, violent actions and lots of music. Cannot wait to see more movies from Ritesh Batra and hope its sooner than later. Truly one of the finest movies that has ever come out of India!",

It's far better than that, however. The \"dabba\" food system in Mumbai is a spider-spread delivery system of home food made by wives for their husbands. It even appeared in an academic publication as a non-failing system. And yet, it failed... A grumpy widower, an accountant in a crowded room of a company, receives the delicious food of a young married woman, whose husband hardly notices her. She has a daughter and an aunt living in a floor above her. (The aunt appears in the movie only through her voice. ) The widower becomes somewhat friendly with his future substitute at the company, a great character. But both protagonists are lonely. The error becomes clear right away, but nobody wants to fix it. The two exchange written notes, and influence each other in unexpected ways. Lovely and recommended.",

            "content": "'THE LUNCHBOX': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five) Indian romance flick about the relationship that develops between a retiring accountant and a married young mother, when the accountant keeps getting lunches that were originally intended for the young woman's husband. The two communicate to one another through notes in the lunchbox. It stars Irrfan Khan and Nimrat Kaur as it's two leads and costars Nawazuddin Siddiqui, Denzil Smith and Lillete Dubey. It was written and directed by first time feature filmmaker Ritesh Batra. I found the movie to be sweet and touching at times but nothing too memorable.Khan plays Saajan Fernandez, an accountant who's been lonely and depressed since his wife died (years earlier). He's about to retire, in a month, and is supposed to train his young replacement, Shaikh (Siddiqui). Saajan is annoyed by the eager young man and does not intend to teach him anything, until he learns he grew up a struggling orphan. An odd friendship develops between the two and another relationship develops between Saajan and a young mother, Ila (Kaur), that he only knows through letters. A lunch Ila made for her husband (Nakul Vaid) was delivered to Saajan by mistake (through an error made by Mumbai's famous lunchbox delivery system). She had put a lot of passion into the cooking of it, in hopes of reviving their struggling marriage. Saajan and Ila continue to communicate through letters, they deliver back and forth in the lunchbox, and tell each other about their problems.As far as simple romance flicks go this is a pretty good one. There's not a lot to it but the concept is pretty good (about the two leads communicating through letters in a lunchbox). There's a decent amount of good character development and the main characters are all likable. Batra seems to be a capable new filmmaker and the performances are all good, especially Khan (who is always outstanding). I enjoyed the movie a lot while I was watching it, and think it was well made, but it's not one I'll take much away from. It's memorable, because of the unique (but simple) premise, but not a great film by any measure.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: youtu.be/TybVNWfCjYM",

Really, really not like that at all, and is rather surprising in its simplicity. It's very elegantly told, very effective in how nuanced it is in its storytelling. That's certainly a surprise and it serves as a nice contrast to films of the kind who would've made it a really Hollywood-ized romance. The poster for this certainly makes it look that way, and that's where this thought process started (I should have learned my lesson long ago, so why I felt for it here is beyond me). I certainly recommend this. Not entirely perfect or a masterpiece, but definitely sort of quietly great.",

            "content": "Spite of the massive rave reviews it garnered in various International film festivals, my experience with the movie was different than what I had expected.... Ritesh Batra touches a very soft topic & transforms it into a sensitive romantic drama.Speaking of the plot, it is very freshly written imbibing social values, current affairs & life as a whole into it. Food is in the limelight and as we all know how Indians & people world of the world are fond of spices & dices, it works for the movie; indeed it moves the plot a step further. The screenplay is average for the writing especially the blunt transitions and irregularly paced scenes. The plot does go off bounds a time or two but lapses back right. Originality flutters throughout the movie and as we get on the verge of comparing it with 2011's The Intouchables' conclusive part, it gathers moss.A couple of hollow plot points I didn't understand (which may also be ill-considered) compels me to rate it a humble 7.9 out of 10.Irrfan Khan is absolutely in character & so are Nawazuddin Siddiqui & Nimrat Kaur. It would be demeaning to say which one was better of the former two. Supporting cast (or voice of cast I should say) is good, dialogs being humorous & inventive, music nostalgic, good cinematography & character baking, the epistolary theme just captures all the attention of the movie-goer & that itself should be considered as a go-ahead! The theme & ideologies will stay with you for some time, that is assured.BOTTOM LINE: Recommended! Like I said, I was expecting a breakthrough kinda flick & The Lunchbox ended up like being just a star. It is surely a work of marvel, but lauding it up the line is just too naive of us. And after watching The Good Road, I do not believe in FFI's decision of sending it for the Oscars. Lunchbox would've had a better chance.Also, the climax is not the staple everyone would like & enjoy. It begets thought.Can be watched with a typical Indian family?

            "content": "If local trains are one inseparable lifeline for Mumbai, lunch box delivery men are unquestionably the other. Delivering food for love/love for food in lunch box to more than 2 lac people working in their respective fields of interest everyday\u0085that too by a comparatively smaller number of a few thousands dedicated lunch box delivery men on their toes, impermeable of bad weather, terrible traffic issues, unfortunate terrorist attacks and uncalled natural disasters! No wonder, surveys indicate that the chances of failure in this 130-year old mechanism fall to once in a 6 million deliveries.Ritesh Batra's 'already riding high on appreciations allover' slice-of- life, middle-age romantic drama THE LUNCHBOX finds its foundation on that very one mistake, an endearing one that turns into an overwhelming, appetite-full, high-on-emotions love-story between two lone souls lost in the overcrowded city of dreams, Mumbai.Ila, a housewife and a mother of a 7-year old girl, seeks help in making new delicious recipes for her husband's lunch box either from master chef Sanjeev Kapoor on radio/TV or from the neighboring aunt who lives on the second floor with her husband in coma. Interestingly, we hear only voice of her crashing to our ears. Besides that, Ila's other pastimes limit in washing dirty linens, waiting for her husband to come home and watching him finishing his dinner in some way attending panel discussion on TV news. Loneliness is subtle but the pain is quite visible.Saajan Fernandez is a face that you see everywhere around yourself. He could be an account manager in your local bank. He could a wrinkled postmaster with all names & addresses on his fingertips. He might not be updated with technology and gadgets our new generation uses but he is there behind his desk for like more than 35 years. This particular face we see on screen is on the edge & age of retirement. He is a widower too. Here again, the loneliness is subtle but the pain & emptiness in his eyes is clearly visible to make you uncomfortable within.So, when one day the lunch box for Ila's husband reaches mistakenly on the desk of Mr. Fernandez, the old-fashioned yet very amusing-very charming practice of letter-writing takes place to share their individual emotions. They write about the lip-smacking dishes Ila cooks, they write about their personal life experiences and they also share their fears about how life could take a turn on them.Meanwhile, there is frustratingly funny Sheik who is about to take place of Saajan after his withdrawal. Lively as anything! He is an orphan but still likes to start his saying with 'my mother used to say\u0085' as he thinks it would give it more 'vajan'. THE LUNCHBOX creates an aromatic ambiance for two separate worlds of Ila & Saajan. With pile of files on desks, old ceiling fans & bleak faces, Saajan vanishes in a typical government office. Ila's world is restricted to the kitchen platform and window attached with to make regular conversations with aunt. In others, there are crowded local trains crawling on tracks and an artist on the pavement who paints same painting everyday.Film's biggest strength is the writing. Every sequence conveys and leaves some or the other emotion with you. Be it Ila's imagination to a suicide story or Saajan's reluctant behavior towards his new colleague! With low-light, grainy visuals to show the realism within the on- location shoots, cinematography is apt & a top class. Sound designing is also something to look out for. You can actually smell the ambiance through those sound bits. Ritesh Batra scores high in creating a simple love-story with a perfect mix of emotions and cinematic brilliance. A story has been told the way it should be. No extra 'masala', no unnecessary 'tadka'!On the performance side, Irrfan as Saajan Fernandez delivers as much as you could expect from him. He speaks in silence. He throws silence while speaking. Nimrat Kaur in her acting debut surprises you the most. She can be very emotive at one and equally amusing at the other. She makes you feel for the character and in the most simple and impressive way. Her unsophisticated & refined but raw portrayal of Ila will leave you speechless. & then comes, Nawazuddin as Aslam! Smiles come easy & entertainment is handy when he's there in the frame.Overall, THE LUNCHBOX is bittersweet but a rich-in-taste culinary experience like no other. Perfectly cooked-nicely served! Make reservations for weekend in advance! Book a table now! It's a 7-course meal for cinema-lovers with good appetite for quality cinema!Special Note: Dear Bollywood! Bless me with one LOOTERA, one SHIP OF THESEUS, one LUNCHBOX every year and I'll forgive you for all your sins of producing 'HOUSEFULLs' 'GRAND MASTIs' & 'ZANJEERs'!",

            "content": "This movie creates a touching new twist on a story that might have come across as corny, but doesn't. Mr. Saajan (Irrfan Khan), a retiring accountant, is grieving over the death of his wife and Lla (Nimrat Kaur), a young mother, desires more attention from her husband. Lla sends her husband a special lunchbox and, by accident, the lunchbox is delivered to Mr. Saajan instead. Realizing the meal was misdirected, Lla writes a letter, places it inside the next day's lunchbox and what unfolds are sincere and beautiful messages that changes their lives. The plot's not unique, but the writers produce an atmosphere in this script that sets it apart. Shot in Mumbai City, India, we roam through the streets and are allowed to observe the people, their traditions, their homes and their work establishments. The dialog is in English much of the time but at times in Hindu with English subtitles, which immerses you further into the culture. Irrfan and Nimrat's characters have their own stories that are spectacular to watch and, once these characters start writing to each other, we see a whole new side to both.My favorite character is Mr. Saajan. Khan creates this man who reaches out to someone who he does not even know. His role is heartbreaking to see and you feel the emotions he is experiencing. For anyone who has lost a loved one, you can really identify with his emptiness. My favorite scene is when Mr. Saajan is watching a show that his wife had taped. He remembers watching her and watching the show that made her laugh. You see his face change as he understands the joy she got from the comedy. We see how, a moment that brought joy in the past can still bring joy now, only in a different way.The message in this story is, \"Sometimes the wrong train can bring you to the right station.\" Lla is unsure what to do when she realizes the lunchbox is going to a perfect stranger. Mr. Saajan is not sure what to do when the notes start to touch his heart. So they both feel they are on the wrong train.I give this 5 out of 5 stars and recommend this to age 11 to 18. There is use of cigarettes and subject matter that is not appropriate for younger audiences. Check it out to see what I'm talking about. Reviewed by Keefer B, KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.

            "content": "Saw this DVD 7/26/15. Rather than repeat a synopsis, some random thoughts after a first viewing (and there will be more): 1. The setup is a little like \"Pillow Talk\" (1959). The movie starts out with the makings of a \"cute meet.\" But it becomes clear early on that Ila is not Doris Day, and Fernandes is not going to be anything like Rock Hudson.2. There is considerable suspense: Will Fernandes ever smile? And will Ila meet him? 3. Suspense grows as we await the thawing of Fernandes' heart. But anticipation of a meeting between dabba correspondents gradually gives way to something deeper, as \"Lunchbox\" comes into its own not as love story or romantic comedy, but as a parable of adult life, which only begins once a person has lived long enough and through enough to ask, \"Is this all there is?\" Bhutan beckons. It seems to be all these two people have left. Bhutan, with its measure of Gross Domestic Happiness, borders Lenny's \"fat of the land\" in \"Of Mice and Men\" (e.g.,1939), or Candide's El Dorado. There have been \"lonely crowd\" movies before, but Mumbai's populace is quite a crowd, and Ila and Fernandes such a lonely pair. 4. The cinematic apparatus (shot duration and selection, cutting, lighting) works effectively but does not intrude. I only minded the occasional single-note piano cue signaling moments of character introspection. Unnecessary, but I guess that's show business. 5. I saw Irrfan Khan in \"Life of Pi\" (2012). I could see he was a superior actor but found that the character scripted for him did not let him show what he could do and be on screen. Fernandes, at once someone unforgettable, someone we all have known somewhere sometime, and also someone we fear to become, is a demonstration of his skill. This is my first film with Nimrat Kaur in the cast. Her performance reminded me of Madhabi Mukherjee's title character in \"Charulata\" (1964) or the same actress as Arati in \"Mahanagar\" (1963). She makes a perfect lunchbox correspondent for Khan's Fernandes. Nawazuddin Siddiqui as Shaikh works well with Khan. He sold more than just Shaikh. He gave reality to Fernandes through the relationship between the two characters, demonstrating that acting is interacting. 6. Aside from \"Pillow Talk\", the movie brought to mind movies such as \"Nelly & Monsieur Arnaud\" (1995), \"The Crowd\" (1928), and \"Chungking Express\" (1994) as well as obvious intersections marked by Satyajit Ray's \"Mahanagar\", \"Charulata\", and \"Nayak, the Hero\" (1966). Also to be found on the same page is \"Chachaji, My Poor Relation: A Memoir by Ved Mehta\"(1978). Many others.7. In a world of on demand movie viewing, whether online, DVD, cable, or whatever, every viewer is a motion picture academy of one. I keep my own list of best pictures. \"Dabba\" is on it.",

At first we can't understand who would not want to get closer to this lovely woman. Soon we realize that life is, at best, impossible to understand. It must be lived, not studied. Ila can't see what is happening in front of her face. Maybe she doesn't want to see it. Her husband is young, appears to be fond of her and their memories. Still, he can't gather enough courage to tell her the truth. His actions do, but she just won't heed them. His manners are so cold that we wonder what it is that she needs to see. With the help of her \"auntie\", she struggles to find the lost magic, until she finds she has captured someone else's heart.Mr. Fernandes lives a very simple and bitter life. He has lost his wife, and she must have a wonderful creature because he is still mourning, dripping with sadness and hate. He won't let others near. He can't stand to have anything remotely close to affection nearby. One day, his young successor starts worming his way into Fernandes' life and combined with the accidental delivery of a lunch box, Fernandes slowly springs back to life, nurturing a dream, hoping for new love.Things don't quite work out the way we expect it, but it doesn't bother us because the film handles matters delicately, realistically. Fernandes learns what the best possible resolution might be. He has, after all, lived a long life and knows where he stands. Ila must have married young, and it takes a traumatic event to make her understand what is happening. She also learns she must take matters into her own hands, and the choices are difficult. For a while, we think she will end up badly because she might not have much of a choice, especially when you keep hoping for you dream to come true.In the end, we find ourselves back in a train station, the setting of so many romantic scenes. There's some type of hope in the horizon because we hope for a terrific ending. Whatever avenue Ila might follow, she is not a loser. She will win because she wants to get rid of her self-imposed chains before it's too late. Whether or not she gets the big prize, it is to be debated for those in the audience. It is all a matter of preference, of whatever it is we yearn for. What matters is that we feed our soul, that we don't quit, that we don't live an existence void of whatever it is that keeps us going.",

I could write much more but that would take away from the brilliance of his performance.Shaikh played by Nawaz, the orphan who has made it in life on his own, who is to replace the soon to be retired Fernandes in his office, and who will move you to tears with his smiles and his eyes. His outlook at life, his loyalty for Fernandes will move you. Nawaz was always a great actor. But with The Lunchbox he actually goes beyond just acting. There is this line he says, \"Meri maa kaha karti thi...\"... When it hits you, you will only say to yourself - AMAZING...!! and Ila... the woman who wants only to be recognized by her husband. No one else. Her entire life is her husband and her child. And how she has been driven by an unappreciative cheating husband into becoming a nobody, just another face in this city of millions... Her life forces her to ask the question, \"Does a woman, married with a child, unloved, deserve a second chance?\" Nimrat, if this is her first movie I don't know what she will do by her 10th...Somewhere Ila's mother comes in for a few minutes (Lillete Dubey, you surprise me each time...!) and says things that will shock you with their harsh truth. But said so simply that you will realize that this is how most relations end up eventually....There is Mrs Deshpande, who you will never see. But you will hear her words, saying so much so simply.There are the Dabbawalas of Mumbai, studied by Harvard, appreciated by the 'England Ka Raja' (Prince Charles would be mighty pleased...) who are probably the most complex and almost flawless delivery system in the world working without any modern technology. Their simple lives and routines will touch your soul if you have ever been to Mumbai and witnessed their magic...There is the City of Mumbai. With its teeming millions, its trains and buses and its autos, an island city bursting at the seams. With its bustling life, its office-goers and workers filled with daily routine, beautiful old bunglows, its roads at night that never sleep, its narrow streets filled with life, its veins with ambition. It is indeed the City of Mumbai that holds the movie together. If you have been to Mumbai, you will feel all these emotions and more...And there is Life itself and second chances. The Lunchbox is all about second chances.There are two kinds of people who will walk out of the theater. One who will yawn and say nice things movie about the movie without really grasping the true essence of this masterpiece. They will post a new status on whats app, face-book or twitter. But not really peek into the heart of the characters and feel...And then there are those few who believe that there is still more to life...Those who will want to believe that the Dabbawalas of Mumbai worked their magic once again...That life is indeed about second chances. And that the Art of Cinema has risen to levels like never before with this masterpiece.They will feel what I felt.",

            "review_title": "An expressive, well performed film, smartly made on a borrowed theme.",
            "content": "To begin with, this is not exactly a love story as widely publicized in its promos and posters. On the contrary it is a beautiful and expressive film on LONELINESS, experienced by various persons in their distinctive lives individually. And when a film dares to talk about those lonely moments of life so lovingly, then it is bound to touch every sensitive adult giving it a serious watch, since we all have felt that loneliness somewhere in our life, sooner or later. To give you a fair idea about all its interesting characters dealing with their own complexities of life alone\u0085\u0085.., THE LUNCHBOX is a story of a loving housewife, who is being regularly ignored by his busy husband, probably due to an affair with another lady. It's about a lonely widower who is about to retire after 35 years of a single job and gets excited as he accidentally gets in touch with an unknown housewife who is an excellent cook. It's about a grown-up orphan, who has an innocent smile and tries to learn every art of life alone with his own efforts. And it talks about an old lady who is fed up of feeding and looking after her ailing husband single handedly, every day and night from years.Now reading the above description it may sound like a depressing movie talking about all the gloomy days lived by its various characters on the screen as the sub-plots. But THE LUNCHBOX rises much above this negativity surrounding its entire proceedings and comes up as an extremely positive film with a single master stroke played by the director, of a voice without a face calling from the upper floor. And truly speaking, the whole film simply turns into an enjoyable tale, depicting the hard realities of life just because of this single insertion of Bharti Achrekar's voice and her passion for music cassettes playing the hit track of SAAJAN and more from the floor above. As expected, THE LUNCHBOX directed by the debutant Ritesh Batra, is a must watch for its powerful performances by Irrfan Khan, Nimrat Kaur and Nawazuddin. But surprisingly the order of these worth watching acts is not the same, routine one as before. To be honest with their art, THE LUNCHBOX is more a Nawazuddin and Nimrat Kaur film than a Irrfan one. No doubt Irrfan puts up a great show playing the lead role of an aging old man (especially in the scene talking about that odd smell in his bathroom). Yet the show stealer here remains Nawazuddin as the trainee, followed by Nimrat Kaur, superbly playing the lonely housewife caught in a dilemma. The supporting cast featuring Nakul Vaid, Lillette Dubey and more are just fine. And so is the background score and cinematography of the film providing the desired realistic feel of our daily life impressively.However despite the above praises, I would not be able to call it as an exceptional or near perfect film due to its few unfortunate shortcomings related to its length and the open climax. At around 109 minutes, THE LUNCHBOX goes beyond an acceptable length and becomes quite monotonous after the initial 20 minutes. Actually it can easily be called a short film of 60-70 minutes overstretched to an excessive length of 109 minutes resulting in some repetitive and forced in sequences (like the one of Nimrat's parents). Secondly after playing it real well in a path breaking mode throughout, suddenly the film ends in an indecisive, confusing or inconclusive manner which just breaks the great momentum built leaving a sour taste. Therefore, YES as the representative of the new age cinema wave, THE LUNCHBOX is a must watch film, depicting 'Loneliness' in a positive way, rarely tried in our Hindi Cinema in the recent decades. But at the same time, its also not a masterpiece or a great path breaking film as being promoted. Anyway Coming to its inspirational sources:1. Firstly the poster of the film with the vertically opposite photos of its two lead characters is highly inspired from one of the posters of LOOPER (2012). 2. Secondly the basic theme of the movie, wherein two strangers fall in love (without seeing each other), through their exchange of letters only, is not a novel or original one, since it has already been used more than once in English as well as Hindi movies stated below. (In English) THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER (1940), IN THE GOOD OLD SUMMERTIME (1949), YOU'VE GOT MAIL (1998) (Remake). (In Hindi) SIRF TUM (1999), NA TUM JANO NA HUM (2002), MITR MY FRIEND (2002) & also in MUJHSE FRAANDSHIP KAROGE (2011).Interestingly, what the writer & director of THE LUNCHBOX have done in their script is that they have beautifully mixed the borrowed theme of 'Exchange of Letters Between Strangers' with the Indian proverb 'A Way To The Man's Heart Is Through His Stomach', introducing the lunch box in their plot quite smartly. So here we have the letters not coming through any post office or e-mail portal but inside a lunch box wrongly delivered to a different person who is just passing through a changing phase of his lonely life. Summing it all, due to an inspired subject, long length and unclear ending, I would not be able to rate THE LUNCHBOX as higher as compared to the other reviewers. Still it undeniably remains a must watch movie for sure for its fabulous performances and for that one strong voice full of positivity from the above, which has no visible face like the Supreme Power.",

One of the negatives about the movie is that it plateaus after establishing it's theme.Though I enjoyed the climax, it could have been executed better and the film should have been 15 minutes shorter.Altogether, Ritesh Batra's first movie is a gem albeit a flawed one.",

Content with the mix-up the two exchange handwritten notes between the lunch delivery and the return of the containers.The first two-thirds of this film are superb. Director Ritesh Batra makes the most of Mumbai's lively streets and crowded transit as background to stage the deliveries back and forth. Here, the visuals tell their own little stories to enhance the main one.The film also makes subtle judgments on modern loneliness, isolation, overcrowding in cities, and the despair of living as expressed in tragedy that is exposed in a news story.While poignant and moving, \"The Lunchbox\" also makes use of comical relief as well: the young woman speaks through her kitchen window to her eccentric aunt who lives upstairs and is heard but not seen; the man has a very eager apprentice at work whose zeal and attempts at pleasantness can sometimes be annoying but in a funny way.The latter third of the film takes a slightly different direction from the main characters and the earlier premise. The outcome is okay but it doesn't live up to the earlier promise. Overall though, \"The Lunchbox\" is a charmer mainly for its warmth and humanity.",

            "content": "The Lunchbox: Review 4 stars\"You fall in love when you are not in love, not when it is around and you fail to acknowledge it.\"What do you do when the spark seems to have gone away from a relationship you are in? What do you do when you are face-to-face with ingratitude day in, day out; not even from the only person you expect? What do you do when some new, tempting but unethical, relation seems to be knocking your door? Do you give in to the temptation or do you shut door on it and return home? The movie answers these questions through Ritesh Batra's viewpoint.Well, I would have rather named it The Dabbawala's Mistake or rather The One in a Million Mistake. Why? Oh, didn't you know? The Mumbai Dabbawalas are given the prestigious six-sigma ranking for quality control, allowing them the luxury of just one mistake in a million. And that one mistake changes the lives of two people who, actually, haven't even seen each other. Well, there is a brief reference to Harvard as well ;)This is like Fabindia clothes, simple and sober but only the one who wears enjoys it and the one who appreciates knows the brand equity it commands. With some extraordinary, out-of-the-Universe scenes which you have to 'experience' to understand the depth (I loved one scene so much, I am still absorbing it), the movie is no doubt slow and steady, but surprises you with sprinkles of humor and childish pleasure as well. It is like the fragrance you feel in a temple. You have to enter in to feel it. And it can't be written in words. Or expressed. Just experienced. Shot in 'real' Mumbai, the movie showcases the hustle and bustle of this Mega Millennial city, the locals, the 'gardi' in the First Class to the 'groping' in the General, the BEST buses, the typical auto and even the notorious traffic jams. The journey of a Dabbawala. Bandra to Malad. The occasional suicides, including L What I liked specially is, the characters speak exactly the lingo a typical Mumbaikar speaks. Mind you, I am not saying other movies don't but what I mean is, other than most famous Bombaiyya words, this movie speaks Mumbai as typical Mumbaikars do.What is amazing is the movie has NO background score but still engages you throughout. I mean, you expect some music to play when the characters are silent. Right? No, not here. Here you simply swallow and digest the words they speak. And they create the ambiance. And weave the story around it. 35 years of discipline broken by an unruly trainee. 15 years of asceticism broken by a frustrated married lady. A husband flirting in office to the extent that he doesn't even 'touch' his wife who stands in front of him in her honeymoon clothes! The movie showcases lives of two people, interconnected by only one connection \u2013 loneliness. While one character, the housewife, is trying hard to get close to her husband's heart through his stomach, trying to get him finish the Lunch in the Box daily, the other character who has lived his life the same way, engrossed in himself and work since a decade and more (see the movie to know the math), has not even realized he has grown old. They communicate through a lunchbox daily wrongly delivered (inadvertently, of course) and build a relationship purely based on emotions shared and letters exchanged. The relationship climbs to such heights that they are about to take major decisions based on the common platform they are on. And they find 'love'. But do they, or don't? You need to watch the movie for this! Roles: It goes without saying that no matter what/when/where Irrfan Khan plays, he takes away the entire spotlight. Here too, you wouldn't recognize him when you see him first. He blends into the character that much. But no, not here. Nimrat Kaur, who plays the role of the typical, lonely, scared-of-asking-her-husband-anything housewife, shares the dais with him. And how can one forget Nawazuddin Siddiqui. Appearing a buffoon at first, fooling around, he creates his character depth through revelations throughout the story. One amazing role is played by Deshpande aunty, whom you would never see in the movie, but who is the 'sutradhaar' of the entire movie. Just like the Ship of Theseus, character brilliance is unparalleled in here.What's wrong with the essence: We all have problems and loneliness in our lives, at some stage or another. Do we start an extra-marital relation just because there is a little low in the love we share with our spouses? Or better still, will a mother of a ten year old girl start sharing her emotions and dissatisfaction with her husband to a completely unknown stranger, and that too via a letter in a lunchbox? Or does the father only have the right to? I believe neither. And is this how love happens? Sorry, I beg to differ.Love is one thing, complaining about your relationship and considering the other person to be your Agony Aunt is another thing.What's wrong with the script: Won't you recognize if your lunchbox is changed? Won't you feel uncomfortable if suddenly, instead of wife- cooked home food, you are given hotel cooked food? And that too for days in a row? At least I would. Would you start a relationship with some stranger, even without knowing gender, and tell your problems in the second conversation? The entire movie is based on this fallacy/hypothesis.My take: The portrayal of the story and acting is brilliant. Character development is as expected. The Himalayan emotional highs compensate for the plateau of slow motion at times. What I felt lacking was the slight illogical bend in the script itself. Unreal for a movie which has almost everything real. But good enough to order my own Lunchbox a.k.a. Dabba from Monday ;)",

            "content": "Written and directed by Ritesh Batra, this is his first full length Bollywood film. It stars seasoned actor Irrfan Khan along with notable co-stars Nawazuddin Siddiqui(Kahaani 2012) and Nimrat Kaur(One Night with the King 2006). All three actors play their respective parts in the film with finesse. The plot of the film deals with a mistaken delivery by the Dabbawalas (tiffin a.k.a lunchbox service) of Mumbai, which leads to a relationship between Saajan Fernandez, a claims adjuster, who is a widower and close to retirement, and Ila, an unhappy housewife whose husband is secretly having an affair. Because of her strained relationship with her husband lately, Illa decides to treat him with a special meal. The meal is delivered by the Dabbawalas(lunchbox service) who deliver it accidentally to claims adjuster Saajan FernandezFernandez opens his lunchbox an to his surprise, instead of the dry cauliflower and potato curry(Aloo Gobi) he had ordered he finds an altogether different and delicious menu. When Illa's husband arrives after work, Illa's asks him if he enjoyed the meal that she prepared for him. He said casually that the Aloo Gobi she had prepared for him was alright as usual. Illa immediately knew that the lunchbox went to the wrong person. She writes Fernandez a note about it in her next lunchbox. When Fernandez opens his lunchbox again, he finds the note and from then onwards a beautiful correspondence through the lunchbox begins.This film deals with many topics: a husbands betrayal, a lonely woman and one who is starving for her husband's affection and finally a lonely widower who is approaching impending retirement. Added to this is the man who is going to replace Fernandez upon retirement, and he has a story of his own. This film will appeal to older people more than the youngsters. It is because the youngsters are yet to experience the ups and downs of life and the older ones are reflecting on the mistakes in their past. Overall is is a beautiful film, one which will bring a tear to the eyes of those who are trapped in similar circumstances as the characters we see portrayed in this film.",

            "content": "The Lunchbox, is a wonderful new film which is a reworking of sorts of 1998's American romantic comedy, You've Got Mail, which starred Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan. In this version it takes place in India, and involves a food delivery service which drops off lunches to people in the various businesses around the area. After a meal that was meant to be delivered to her husband instead ends up on the desk of office worker Saajan, he takes one taste of the food delivered to him, thinking that this is just the usual restaurant chain that is supposed to be bringing him his meal, but instead he notices that the food is a lot better than usual and also inside the food tins used to store the lunch is a note to her husband Rajeev, from the cook of the meal and Rajeev's wife, Ila. What happens next is most interesting as Saajan doesn't just apologize and make Ila aware that the food is not going to her husband, but instead writes a note back to her in the same food container, telling her of his great love of her cooking. Ila then decides to continue to send food back and forth to Saajan and with it each day is a little letter that she has written and through the gift of her cooking as well as Saajan and Ila both being lonely people, they end up starting a pen pal relationship where they correspond to one another with letters and in Saajan's case, he also ends up getting a delicious meal out of it. The premise as I watched the film, immediately reminded me of You've Got Mail, which for an American romantic comedy is definitely among the better of them, but thankfully The Lunchbox takes it's own road with this story and definitely makes it something all of it's own instead of a direct remake, or a foreign language copy of You've Got Mail. There is plenty here to definitely please fans of romantic comedies and there is also enough here that will appeal to foreign film fans as well as those who are connoisseurs of Indian films. I myself have really become quite smitten with the East Indian culture within the past ten years or so, after being introduced to some wonderful restaurants in the downtown core of my city, as well as discovering great Indian films such as Sholay and the wonderful works by Satyajit Ray, such as Charulata, or The Big City among his very impressive work, which I think ranks right up there with some of the world's best filmmaking auteurs. As far as literature goes, you also can not beat a good Salman Rushdie novel either. As for The Lunchbox, this is a film that not only fascinates you with a dash of culture from another side of the world, but you also grow with these characters and while their lives may seem so very different from our own in some ways, you can not shake off the feeling and sense that so very much of what they go through and deal with on an everyday basis is the same as if you are in America, Canada, or any other part of the world, so no matter where you may be living and putting the cultural differences aside, you will definitely be able both to relate and have empathy for the characters on the screen in front of you. There is also so much wonderful humour and lighthearted moments to be had here as well. The humour at most times is quite quiet and small, but definitely more than once I was looking up at the screen with a big smile on my face and truly enjoying what I was watching and at times getting great amusement and joy out of the film. There is a certain element of warmth not only to these characters, but to the film itself, not just with it's wonderful yet subtle sense of humour, but there are moments in this film that I found had true beauty in them. A great example would be the mellowing out of Saajan towards a new fellow coworker and how he becomes in many ways a kinder and gentler person because of these wonderful meals and letters that he is receiving. This is a film of not only great character study, but it also has a great sense of humanity and an in depth look and feeling of true human emotions and spirit which really makes this film quite touching at times, but also reflective to those watching it and at times a film of great warmth, beauty and dare I say, love. The acting is wonderfully expressive even when it is at it's most subtle and the screenplay truly captures the human spirit, but also allows the viewer to have much fun with the film in the process. This is one of the best films of the last several years and definitely not one to be missed. A true modern day masterpiece.",

            "content": "I don't think I've watched a film in Hindi before. Not that it ever really matters what language a film is. A story is a story, good, bad, somewhere in between. This is good. Without reading the synopsis before hand, I'd imagine you could be confused as to what's going on at the start of this. Apparently in India, the practice of having your lunch delivered to you at work, from home each day is the done thing. We open on hundreds, maybe thousands of lunchboxes in bags being delivered by carriers all over the city. One such delivery goes to Saajan from Ila. Except it wasn't supposed to. Saajan is a pencil pusher, soon to retire. He's quiet, lives alone, a bit of a loner and generally grumpy. Ila is much younger, married to Rajeev who doesn't really seem all they interested in her. The lunchbox mix up keeps happening daily. This seems a little implausible, but then I've only just found out about this custom, so what do I know. At first Saajan thinks the service he pays for has simply improved, but Ila twigs right away when Rajeev makes no comment on the delicious lunch she's made. She's been trying to impress him you see, with the help of Auntie who lives upstairs. We never see Auntie, she's a disembodied voice through the window, but she's wonderful. Anyway, back to the lunchbox. Ila leaves a message explaining what happened, but Irrfan being Saajan doesn't really respond how you'd imagine, no thank you, nothing, just that \"today, it was salty\". Saajan doesn't like deviation from his routine. This is comically compounded by Shaikh, who is to be his replacement at work. Shaikh is young, enthusiastic and a pain in Saajan's side. His grumpiness may be explained by the loss of his wife and the lack of light in his life, but soon lunch becomes that light. A quick side bar, this food looks amazing! You can smell it on the screen, so don't watch this on an empty stomach. Saajan is a man of few words, but the food brings him out of his shell and the notes between the two begin to grow longer and more personal. We learn of Auntie upstairs, not a relation, just a nice neighbour with an ill husband, more importantly we learn that Ila feels neglected. They're both lonely, finding solace in their unusual friendship, with an honesty in their letters they can't share elsewhere in their lives. Shaikh and Auntie are the comic relief. Auntie her friend, Shaikh fast becoming his, albeit with some reluctance. The four together, although distant from one another create a wonderful palate of personalities, in a story much richer than it appears. They seem to cross over. Saajan wakes up to the world around him, embraces what life has given him. Ila though seems to slip, her situation becoming more desperate with the illness of her father, her mothers spiralling costs of care and the suspicion that her husband may be cheating. This leads to Saajan daydreaming. Ila toys with the idea of leaving and Saajan suggests leaving with her. It's a fleeting thought, but Saajan realises they're only fantasies. He's too old for Ila and feels the world has caught up with him somehow. It catches up with Ila's father too and such is the connection we feel to these people it's really impactful. There's a desperation in Ila, a powerlessness, magnified by the gender divide. Faced with this desperation she takes matters into her own hands, seizing control of the male dominated world and chases her dream.",

Every character has something meaningful to contribute, and the performances are probably the best I've seen in a long, long time.Maximum care has been taken in crafting every aspect of the movie-making process, and this could be used as the poster-child for film-making educational endeavors, IMHO.Irfan Khan, owns every scene he's in (recalls 'The Namesake' to mind, among others), and Nimrat Kaur matches him step-for-step, just like Tabu did with Amitabh in 'Cheeni Kum' (and this one cannily avoids the 3rd act mis-steps of that one). Siddiqui plays the perfect foil to Khan's character, and is also one of the key reasons this one is so enjoyable.

I knew it could be a fake story, but whatever... I am no longer an active member in that organization but I might change my mind and be able to face people telling these things in the proper way. I watched \"dabba\", and I know it is a \"tale\", a miracle story. It is beautiful, well made, well played. And people needs dreams.

The movie overall works great.performances; the performances from the lead are phenomenal especially Irrfan Khan and Nawazuddin Siddiqui. Khan is stellar in his portrayal. Bollywood will always miss the excellence of Irrfan Khan and his performances. I would say it's one of the greatest misses for the industry. Very few actors are as good as him.What did not work:\nminor plotholes; there were few flaws in the storytelling and setups, which were not horrendous in the narrative but were worth mentioning. Despite some flaws, the movie roars high.Final verdict: highly recommended",

The first thing we both mentioned was the quality of the acting: every spoken part was delivered expertly. Secondly, we both agreed on the sensitivity of the acting; I thought that it was beyond just \"good\" acting, it required a particularly symbiotic characterization meaning that the actors literally stepped into their roles. With many Hollywood movies you must devolve yourself from what the actors are doing because they always seem like they are acting. Maybe that is why Hollywood must use fake guns, fake blood and fake dialogue to carry their crazy films. Of course, Khan and Kaur had the largest roles in this film but as I noted earlier all the spoken roles were superb. The script was as superb as the acting requiring, through the director, many moments of profound subtlety. I can easily see why this film was nominated for many prestigious awards: it richly deserves the nominations as well as success at the box office.",

            "content": "I have never seen any other film which talks about loneliness from any country. The lunchbox is first such film, and surprisingly, it came out of Bollywood, an industry that doesn't experiment much.Ironically, it is set in the city of Mumbai, busiest city on this earth. Surrounded by about 3 crore people, our protagonist Saajan Fernandes feels emptiness in his life. This beautiful film by debutant Ritesh Batra is filled with such little ironies. The plot is little too simple - Illa packs a lunchbox for her husband but dabbawalas mix it with some other person, Illa writes a letter in Lunchbox the next day informing him about the mix up which starts a series of letters exchanged between them.The letters they send are not related to the storyline but are about trivial things. They share recipies, old tv shows etc. They don't write for a purpose, they just write. Illa, who was not happy with her marriage, plans running away with Saajan. From the start to end we start seeing minute changes in Saajan's behaviour. Irffan, who is known for pulling miracles on screen, puts a life into this lifeless character(Sajjan). As a boring office worker whose wife died long ago and has no one to talk, he doesn't have much dailogue, he rarely speaks, but Irffan is something who doesn't need dialogues to act.At other end, we have Nimrat kaur as Illa. I think all scenes written for her were less subtle. Like in the last minutes, his father died and her mother explains how a marriage without love is like and helps her to move on. There are many things which are 'usual' in the way she behaves unlike Saajan.There was a brilliant scene in which Saajan was doing beard for meeting Illa but while boarding train, a man offers him seat implying he is too old for all this. But rather than ending it there, director explained this for a few minutes to explain he is aged, as a result, this little scenes lost it's subtlely and charm.The director left the ending open to interpretation, and I am okay with it.The Lunchbox is an experiment never tried before in cinema, two thumps up for that.",

            "content": "It's hard to imagine anyone falling in love through handwritten notes and letters anymore - in this day and age, we trade text messages and chat on Facebook instead. It may be infinitely more practical, but it's also a lot less romantic. The Lunchbox, a charming hit on last year's festival circuit, will make you yearn for a simpler time, even as it hides some surprisingly sharp messages about the modern world within the gentle twists and turns of its apparently old-fashioned love story.Every day, dutiful housewife Ila (Nimrat Kaur) meticulously prepares a delicious lunchbox for her distant husband Rajeev (Nakul Vaid). But, due to a mix-up in Mumbai's famously efficient lunchbox delivery service, her bespoke meals are delivered instead to the desk of lonely office-worker Saajan (Irrfan Khan). Due to retire soon and forced to train his eternally chirpy successor Shaikh (Nawazuddin Siddiqui), the elder gentleman finds comfort in Ila's home-cooked food. Before long, Saajan and Ila strike up a correspondence via lunchbox: one that deepens into a friendship and, perhaps, something more.It's not often that Indian cinema goes for restraint and realism in its depiction of an unlikely romance. Typically, lovers express their feelings for each other in an exuberant explosion of song and dance. The Lunchbox sets itself apart in the quiet, understated way in which it forges the connection between Saajan and Ila. At first, the notes these two lonely souls trade are bemused, before they grow in depth and emotion. She confides in him her suspicions of her husband's affair and her desire to take her young daughter away from it all. He, in turn, finds someone who gives him a reason to feel alive again. The relationship that develops between them is sweet, tentative and unexpectedly rich.Beyond this unusual courtship, however, is a story that doesn't shy away from addressing some of the thorny, complicated issues in modern Indian society. There's a fierce desire to live hiding inside Ila that feels positively subversive within her station in life. She should be good, dutiful and quiet; not hopeful, angry and determined. The film also ponders the melancholy of growing old alone: Saajan's life seems a bleak one, his forced relationship with Shaikh awkward and almost cruelly unfair. But, as Saajan thaws towards his quirky successor, it becomes possible to see the heart and hope living within this man who grew older without realising it.Khan and Kaur are wonderful. He anchors the film with a sad soulfulness, one that makes his gradual shedding of his grouchy, curmudgeonly ways believable. His gentle joy at opening another folded letter, tucked beneath the folds of a chappati, is matched only by Kaur's own. She's a lovely actress, able to communicate a tossing ocean of inner life beneath a quiet, well-behaved demeanour. Siddiqui, too, is charming as plucky orphan Shaikh - it's not often that an actor can go from hated to tolerated to quite well-liked during a film, but he makes that transition easier for an audience.Occasionally, The Lunchbox meanders. The pace of the film never really gets above a gentle trot, and this might prove off-putting for some. But it's hard to begrudge the film its more languid scenes, when it's so amply made up with moments quirky (Ila's conversations with her never-seen upstairs neighbour) and heartbreaking (Ila waiting in vain to meet Saajan at a cafe). Tender, rich and surprisingly progressive, The Lunchbox is a welcome feast for the heart and soul.",

            "content": "The trailers were so appetizing! Who wouldn't have been hungry enough to watch one of the most awaited films around this time of the year? 'The Lunchbox' seems to have it all to be a good film: actors like Irrfan and Nawazuddin Siddiqui and the appeal of seeming like a well told story. The story of this film is a no-brainer. Someone's lunch box gets delivered to someone else and eventually sets off a love story, of two people who never met. Exchanging notes simply seems like technology that pre-dated stories of chat room friends eventually in love like 'You've got mail' which came at the turn of the century. But the simplicity in its storytelling makes it effective and worthwhile. Ila (Nimrat Kaur) is a housewife juggling tasks, like preparing her kid for school, cooking up lunch for her husband before the dabbawala arrives and chatting up with an old lady in the neighborhood who share stuff over a basket that is passed on between their homes. On the other hand is a widower Saajan Fernandez (Irrfan Khan), who works in an insurance company and is on the verge of retirement. After a good day at office, his only pastime is to smoke cigarettes in the balcony of his old Bandra home.Irrfan Khan is a phenomenally talented actor and he delivers yet another gem. However, despite all the make-up he looks too young to convincingly play a guy approaching sixty. Nawazuddin Siddiqui does a great job in a supporting role, delivering the witty lines with precision. Nimrat Kaur, who can be seen in the recent Dairy Milk Silk Commercial, seems like an apt choice for the role she played. There are elements of lazy writing that the writer-director Ritesh Batra has chosen when one of the lead characters is looking for an outlet to convey her thoughts to the audience. Ila then communicates with a neighborhood Aunty (Bharati Acherekar) who is never seen on screen. Both these ladies seem to discuss everything that happens with each other the whole day. After a while, when you hear Nimrat Kaur's character say 'aunty' for the umpteenth time, you would burst into laughter. Although the film, at times, seems slow-moving, one must give it a benefit of doubt because it wouldn't have been possible to display loneliness and to use quiet to portray disquiet in the characters' lives, each of whom has lost his soul running the hamster's wheel in Mumbai. Had its pace been any faster, the film would have lost all charm and would have been a soulless 45 minute film instead. Its essence is mostly that of a short story told on the big screen. It brings forth questions such as: Would you fall in love with someone you never met? And also breaking the barriers of age and how the society would look at it. Or rather, is love a mere form of escape from stark realities, such as that of a bored housewife and an aged widower who both have issues as to how life turned about to be for them? Verdict: If you are the kinds who likes movies made about common folk, tales of love and hope amidst the loneliness drowned by the din of the city that never sleeps, this movie is for you. Nonetheless, don't expect the film to be a perfect ten on the scoreboard either. 'The Lunchbox' is worth watching.",

Well, I could think of only one comparison i.e. it's like delicious home-made food on which this movie is based. Like home made food, it's all about the taste of the food which comes out when your mother or your wife or your sister cooks it with their unconditional love. It's not about flashy ambiance where food is served or expensive utensils in which food is served. So, The Lunchbox has lot of taste in small moments of love and sadness. The characters, locations, dialogs, atmosphere are all straight from the real life. The three lead actors Irrfan Khan, Nimrat Kaur and Nawazuddin Siddiqui in their superlative performances wear their characters like they wear their clothes. First half lights up with good blend of humor and emotions but like not all the time home-made food ends with sweet desert, so the movie also goes the unanticipated hard way and leave you to embrace its bitter sweet ending. All in all, Ritesh Batra's first cinematic dish is delicious but leaves you hungry at the end wanting for more.",

The apprehension in relationships gives people a way to search for a spur in life which can add a flavor to our unexciting and tedious lives. \"The Lunchbox\" ignites that spark with subtle humor and endearing characters living in the hectic metropolis \"Mumbai\".'The Lunchbox' is about of a middle aged widower Saajan Fernandez (Irrfan Khan) taking voluntary retirement after 35 years of government service and a jaded housewife Ila (Nimrat kaur). One fine day Fernandez fortuitously receives a lunch box made by Ila. Ila discovers that the lunch box has been delivered to a wrong address & she sends a letter to Fernandez in the lunch box. It initiates the most endearing relationship of exchanging correspondence between these two people, unfamiliar with each other's persona.Furthermore, you will sense that it is going to be an astounding journey with these congenial characters. A unique screenplay, the mood, the status quo, the middle class family observations and their daily struggle in \"Mumbai\", everything is portrayed with authenticity.The neighbor, we never see her (Bharti Achrekar) on screen, but we can feel her presence every time we hear her.The Lunchbox's strong point is its simplicity which is told with utmost sensitivity and emotional connotation. The actors do more than a wonderful job to bring the characters to life. Irrfan Khan carries his role with every required nuance; he makes us believe about the struggle of middle class widowers. Nimrat Kaur is exceptional in her debut & she holds the character's liveliness and susceptibility as an ordinary housewife. Nawazuddin Siddiqui does wonders here as a loquacious \"Mr. Shaikh\".Ritesh Batra fills the movie with essences of Mumbai and critically acclaimed \"Dabbawallas\", a globally renowned emblem of quality. Camera focuses only on required shades and represents the vulnerability and elusiveness impeccably; all the visuals communicate with the audiences. The music describes every aspect with a distinctive quality. \"The Lunchbox\" has all the ingredients for the Global audiences with the magnetism of great storytelling and a-grade technical characteristics.We can straightforwardly proclaim that \"The Lunchbox\" is best Indian film of the year.8.5/10",

            "review_title": "A MASTERCLASS DIRECTORIAL DEBUT ! A MUST WATCH !!",
            "content": "Love could well be blind, but, the makers of The Lunchbox convince us that, it sure has an appetite for tasty cuisine. Debutante director Ritesh Batra takes the age old adage \"the way to a man's heart is through his stomach\" and redefines it in a refreshing romantic recipe.The Lunch Box is the unconventional, albeit endearing love story that is sure to charm its way effortlessly into the heart of every cinephile. And as with the best of recipes, it depends on minimal, yet dependable, ingredients (read characters), to cook up a delightful dish.Irrfan plays Saajan Fernandes, a reticent widower on the verge of retirement after more than three decades of number crunching and pushing files. Nawazuddin Siddiqui plays Shaikh, the effervescent incumbent who is to be the understudy. Nimrat Kaur plays Ila, a young homemaker in a middle class household who is distraught to see her life being slowly shredded in the mororse mechanical existence in a loveless marriage. The magical, yet maddening metro of Mumbai, which - with its overcrowded public spaces filled with lonesome souls and a chaotic bustle tempered by the six sigma precision found in the traditional technology of the dabbawalas - embodies the many of its magnificent ironies, is the other major character in the story. It adds a dimension that provides Batra's story with context and a rich texture that permeates throughout without in any way being intrusive in the narrative.When, by a stroke of sheer serendipity (literally, one in a million at that), the lunchbox containing Ila's culinary delights aimed to rekindle the romance in her marriage with an indifferent husband, finds its way to the desk of Fernandes, it triggers a journey of these two lonely souls fuelled by gastric juices.They begin a communication through simple handwritten notes - him writing in English & she, in Hindi - exchanged through the lunchbox. Hitherto strangers, they confide in each other with such openness in their conversation through these notes and begin to forge a beautiful connection that brightens their individual worlds. What follows is a poetic and wholesome journey of these two souls as they open up to each other and traverse down a path of unconventional romance even as they rediscover long forgotten shades of themselves. Batra garnishes their romance with several small, yet remarkable characters - be it the unseen chatty aunty who stays on the apartment above Ila's who communicates only with her voice (an excellent Achrekar pricing even an unseen voice could be a very real character) and a basket lowered down to the floor below, her comatose husband represented by the old fan, a young girl who resides in the home across Fernandes' or even the old lady in the train who appears in a singular scene and steals a place in your heart with her toothless grin.The performances are top notch which make Batra's characters very real, endearing and close to the viewer's heart. The ever-dependable Irrfan performs with such nuance in a role that speaks very little and that too in measured responses which are free and far apart. Yet, he conveys volumes through his body language and expressions, be it the bored irritation on being accosted by an ebullient Shaikh, the contended smile on smelling the fare in the lunchbox, the surreptitious glances around before reading the note in the lunchbox, the tense anxiety - a mini thriller in itself - with which he awaits the lunchbox after hearing the news of a suicide earlier in the morning or even his attempts to fight the withdrawal from the habitual smoking or even nervously contemplating an upcoming meeting with Ila. This is a masterly performance by one of the best, albeit oft-ignored/under-utilised actors of Indian cinema which deserves all the plaudits and awards that are sure to come his way.But, it is newcomer Nimrat Kaur who is the find of this movie as she beautifully complements Irrfan with such an authentic performance as a lonesome housewife who is drawn into an unconventional romance. She is convincing in her portrayal of Ila as someone who enjoys her cooking and puts in a winning performance through her expressive eyes as in the scene when she is waiting in the restaurant. Nawazuddin Siddiqui deserves a special mention for another pitch perfect performance for, with any other lesser performer, his character could have gone over the top or become phony, so easily. It is to his credit that he brings an air if dignity to the cameo of a pesky trainee and he lights up the screen with his ebullience in every frame he appears.The Lunchbox exemplifies economical film-making at its very best and it could be seen in every aspect of the movie which is reminiscent of the master director Ramin Bahrani (Man Push Cart, Goodbye Solo, Chop Shop). The background score relies almost entirely on the sounds from the natural setting like the bustle of the city, sounds from the commute or the songs played on the cassette player from the apartment above. The cinematography too captures the banal visuals of everyday existence of a city as they would be seen through the eyes of any common man which accentuates the realistic edge of the narrative and make it so believable for the viewers who are engaged in the unfolding events and feel connected to the characters. The director and the cinematographer show a keen eye which captures several minor nuances of life in Mumbai and weave them seamlessly into the narrative.\"Sometimes even the wrong train can take you to the right destination\" is a line we hear more than once in the movie and it encapsulates the entire journey of the movie concisely. The debutante Ritesh Batra has arrived as a much awaited blossom in the garden of Indian cinema in its centenary year. If hundred years is what it takes to come upon such a perfect directorial debut, I would say the wait was still worth it. Ritesh has dared to debut with a rare and mature movie sans the staple Bollywood cliches, melodrama and song n dance numbers. It is profound, poignant filled with subtle humour that is sure to make the viewer chuckle (mostly of it coming from a brilliant Nawazuddin) and keeps a brisk pace. Now, that his initial offering has whetted the appetite of gourmand cinephiles, one hopes for many more delectable delights and meaningful cinematic journeys in the future.",

It's interesting to watch but you have to keep reminding yourself stop asking why Ila, never tries to fix the problem or bring it up directly with her husband. Any normal person, on finding their package is not being delivered, would have that problem fixed. Any normal person would also have brought it up with her husband (like how was the chicken today? There was no chicken, only lamb! What? You didn't get my lunchbox!)Basically the entire story is built on a false premise.I also agree with a few other reviewers, the contents and number of the letters was not enough to start a romance.I also don't know what the character's ages are supposed to be but the actress is 32 and the actor is 47. 15yrs apart. I have no idea if there is some cultural issues with that in Mumbai. There aren't in many other parts of Asia.Re-written without the flaws this could have been a much better movie.I'm still glad I watched it. I was super into it at the beginning. But, by the end much of the shine had worn off.",

I felt like a visit to the city of Mumbai through the realistic set-up and screenplay. The actors were all superb and the music gave the soul to the film. The dialogs were well written and those between Irfan and Nawaz were memorable with few comic scenes that are well timed.Having won over 19 awards it is sad that the movie wasn't chosen as India's official entry to the Oscars. One problem is this movie is not to everybody's taste because of its slow pace and there is no masala (no entertainment value). It also takes inspirations from Bengali movie Antareen (in a light sense).",

We are given the opportunity to understand and make sense of why some people have different personalities and do not behave naturally.

            "review_title": "A Bitter Sweet Romantic Comedy with Heartwarming Aftertaste",
            "content": "I like this bitter sweet romantic comedy very much. Life is full of surprises and opportunities which lies in the most unexpected places. You just have to embrace it with an open heart/mind. This movie is very subtle but its strong aftertaste makes you feel the warmth long after you leave the theater. It is like Confucius' \"originated from emotions but halted at politeness.\" Yet the whole thing is that the sentiment lingers even when the words end. I like the open ending which leave us lots of room for imagination, although it already shows us that two mundane lives have changed due to a beautiful mistake/miracle.The mistake happens once in six million cases within the dabbawala, or lunchbox courier service, in Mumbai (Bombay). In this city of 12 million, 5,000 lunchbox delivery men carry 200,000 lunchboxes with homemade meals to central Mumbai offices everyday. These meals are cooked by wives or grandmas or people who prepare for these lunches. The lunchboxes arrive punctually at each desk during lunch time, regardless of the weather, after traveling on bikes, train, carts and crates on delivery men's heads.The system has been in operation for over 100 years and is widely covered by the western media. It prides itself on it on-time delivery and close to zero defects. Even Harvard Business School wrote a case on it and Prince Charles paid a visit to the workers after adjusting his agenda when he was India because the dabbawalas do not have a flexible schedule. It is under this backdrop our bitter sweet romantic story begins: widowed Saajan Fernandes (Irrfan Khan) has been working for 35 years in the government's claims department and is approaching retirement. All he does in the evening is smoking at his balcony. Ila (Nimrat Kaur) is a young, beautiful but lonely housewife who hopes her homemade lunch would woo her husband back. Their connection starts when an unlikely mistake happens in the dabbawala system when Ila's lunchbox is wrongly sent to Saajan's desk. A short note of thank you marks a series of communication and sharing between two lonely people in this mega and alienated city. They begin to share their outlook of lives by slipping letters in the lunchbox, even though everyone is using email already. A certain kind of care, comfort and support develop as they pour their hearts to each other, even though they have not met each other and do not know how the other look like. Because of this exchange, both of them make some slight changes in their lives: they seem to have become more sensitive to their surroundings and people around them. Perhaps they need to be more observant, even to themselves, to be able to share. Finally comes the day when Ila suggests they meet and we witness their excitement. I will let you watch it for yourself to see what finally happens.Excellent character development and use of background music to reflect the characters' mood. But what I am most impressed is the bitter- sweetness portrayed by the characters and the whole plot. Even the animated and extrovert new employee Shaikh (Nawazuddin Siddiqui), who will take over Saajan's position, exhibits some sadness. But to counter his misfortune, Shaikh refuses to accept his fate and tries his best to lead a better life (such as getting a promotion and marriage). Perhaps his aspiration has inspired Saajan to be able more daring in his life. As Shaikh said, \"Sometimes you may take the wrong train but end up in the right station.\" Excellent performance of these three actors with minimal dialogue. Also great editing when we see their souls almost connect. The motto is that it is not necessary to get bitter about your life, just enjoy the ride and keep going, things will get better. There is a similar proverb in Chinese too which says: when the ship reaches the bridge, it will straight its head out. A similar saying in English goes: don't worry, be happy. Well, as long as we are alive, life is full of opportunities. Just enjoy it while we can. The sweet aftertaste of this film will linger for a long time and keep you moving. Go watch it. You will be pleased.",

A pity that it didn't go for the Oscars when it was a deserving one.The Lunch Box is such a layered film and reminded me of the lunch box in the movie. Like each container has a different dish, the story has different aspects. The story has an old world charm and romance, it has loneliness, it has struggle, it has despair, it has sadness and it has hope. Hats off to director and writer of this movie.Two strangers falling in love over notes they send through a lunch box in spite of differences between them. He is a widower on the verge of retirement while she is housewife in her 30s with a child. She is Hindu while he is Catholic. She writes in Hindi and he writes back to her in English. They are lonely in their lives however surrounded by talkative and enthusiastic people...she has a neighbour Aunty and he has a new assistant. Yet they connect and understand each other. Its a fine film from start to finish. There are no lavish sets, no melodramatic scenes, no song and dance...just pure acting and some awesome story telling. However, the ending did disappoint me a bit. The performances are the backbone of this classic. Irfaan left me speechless. Nimrat Kaur is stunning in her debut. Check out the scene where she comes to know her husband is cheating on her. Siddiqui is amazing and he and Irfaan share a brilliant chemistry. Archrekar is excellent as Nimrat's neighbour. And finally, the food in the film is so mouth watering that I started feeling hungry in spite of having lunch before entering the theatre.Just go watch it !!!",

They are fed up of their lives and have no reason to live. We can call them nihilists. Yet they realise how this world is not about money and fame, but happiness, which is the key to success.

            "review_title": "Celluloid Chekhov",
            "content": "'The Lunchbox' is set in Mumbai, though it has a naturalistic, European art-house sensibility (slow pace, cinematography) but one shot through with an Indian perspective (European producers are listed on the credits).It is a very different type of film from traditional Bollywood fare, just as American indie films are distinct in tone from mainstream Hollywood. It portrays scenes featuring the lives of ordinary people, like the delivery workers who transport meals around Mumbai & children playing on the street. Scenes tend to repeat themselves, but with subtle changes.It's a film about the emotional lives of two lonely people & the glimpse of another kind of life. The opening shot of trains passing by on parallel lines sets the tone for a tantalising story about whether these two lives will intersect: Ila, a young housewife & a widower, Saajan, about to retire from a life-time of conscientious service in an office.As someone perceptively pointed out about Mumbai's dabbawalas - famed for their flawless precision, the element of chance always exists for a new friendship & emotional connection to be made in the seething metropolis. And this is what happens when Saajan receives a meal prepared for Ila's husband.The food itself seems to be more of a metaphor, about Saajan's hunger (emotional need) & Ila's delicacy of feeling & subtlety which go unappreciated by a husband more keen to get ahead in 21st century India. Ila's husband takes her for granted, but Saajan appreciates the carefully prepared dishes, & so begins an exchange of notes & a deeper friendship, where they reveal more about themselves, show solicitous concern for each other & reveal their fantasies (Bhutan). The notes fill an emotional void in their lives. Ila's husband does not see the other side to her personality as shown in the scene (visual) where we see her dual reflections in the mirror. Instead, there's quiet comedy with the husband chiding her about always cooking cauliflower when she wants to talk to him, prompted by Saajan's advice, about having another child. A later revelation only reinforces the distance between them.The exchange of notes begins to comfort the harassed Ila & humanises the withdrawn, taciturn Saajan through the second plot of Saajan's relationship at work with his much younger successor, Aslam, a slightly comical figure. The notes soften Saajan's personality, such as his relationship with the children on the street.Gradually, Ila's exquisite food (Babette's Feast) becomes the means by which the older & younger man bond, leading to Aslam reciprocating, inviting Saajan to his family home. Aslam reinforces the film's main plot-line. He is sometimes liberal with the truth, (his working background, his 'wife', the scooter), though he lies for good intentions. Ila & Saajan live cautious lives yet Aslam's home-spun philosophy 'Wrong Train, Right Station' offers the tantalising glimpse of an alternative, putting personal fulfilment first before convention.The film reaches it denouement when the correspondents arrange to meet. A chance comment on the train ('Uncle', emphasising his age) sees Saajan lose his nerve. This part of the film was deftly & expertly handled by the director as a key revelation makes us see things anew, of how we can shy away from possibilities by our fears & doubts. It felt emotionally true to the register of the film, eschewing melodrama in sync with the film's restrained emotional tone.Ila is hurt, she chides him though we know he acted for the right reasons. And here, again, the film reveals its (poetic) intelligence because the couple have already bonded emotionally, revealing their inner-most being, perhaps already fallen in love with each other despite not meeting. Ila has connected with Saajan in a way she never could with her husband.The film's strength is how it keeps the correspondents apart, though the ending suggests this story is not yet over, that a shared fantasy might translate into reality. Like a good short story, the film has seen lives irrevocably changed by a chance event, the change is subtle but no less the powerful for that. Things remain unresolved but with the possibilities left open.",

What connects between them is a wrongly sent Lunchbox.From the beginning of the movie it was clear that a wrong turn of event is going to be the main motivation of the movie. And it proceeds further to a point where we find an unexpected romance being staged.Nawazuddin Siddiqui played the fun comic relief role of Shaikh in this movie. Fernandes played by Irfaan Khan seems to be a dull boring government employee who works in an office which seems to be from the age of black and white televisions. But as the story proceeds,his character starts to get back it's colour with the arrival of that unknown lunchbox and with the touch of Shaikh.On the other end of the story is housewife Ila,always trapped in her small apartment and suddenly she discovers this freedom by making an unexpected pen friendship. Also at the turning point of the story she came to know about the extra marital affair of her husband.From that point on she became more enthusiastic about the new character in her life and also chose to take some independent and drastic decisions to come out of her caged life.The story has a bitter-sweet ending because at the end a stage was created for both the male and female protagonist to finally meet each other.But the movie ends with an open ending never showing whether they actually met or not.",

The movie explores how a lunchbox can lead to the sprouting of love between entirely different people.The beauty of the film is that these characters, Saajan and Ila are so different. One is at retirement age and getting over the death of his wife at age 50. The other is a housewife that is fed up with the poor treatment she receives from her husband, who commits infidelity. They both are in search of empathy and they find that in one another in the most unexpected way possible. Through a lunchbox which is accidentally delivered to Saajan instead of Ila's husband by the local carrier deliverers.The writing is just so delightful. The allegory with the food and how it meets the romance. In fact the food stands in for relationships, it is a sign when they are sharing food that the character's bonded. This is particularly noticeable with Shaikh (Nawaziddin Siddique) and Saajan. Initially Saajan avoids and is annoyed by Shaikh but he slowly warms up to him and this is indicated by the two sharing food in the canteen. The two becoming even closer occurs when Saajan eats in Shaikh's home.The acting was just beautiful. Irrfan Khan lives and rejoices in the roles he plays, and he is no different in the role of Saajan. Nimrat Kaur stands out as Ila, she plays the angst of the characters quite well. There is a lot of confusion she has to be in and many choices she weighs when leaving and thinking about leaving her husband at multiple points in the film, and she portrays that so well and subtly. Then comes Nawazuddin Siddique's Shaikh, for me he was the most relatable character. There was a strong emotional connect with the character that is largely caused by his acting prowess.To sum it up this is not just a movie to pair with a nice cup of chai, but it is a nice cup of chai itself.",

            "content": "THE LUNCHBOX is a graceful, delicate film directed by Ritesh Batra about two lonely people who get to know each other the old-fashioned way \u2013 through delectable, beautifully prepared meals, and the passing of folded notes tucked away discreetly in a lunchbox. Mumbai with its mesmerizing lunch delivery system, reminded me of an assembly-line of various conveyances racing to different locations - scooter, bicycle, and foot, incredibly well-organized and always efficient \u2013 delivered on time and most importantly to the proper destination. Except in this case a mixup occurs. And that is the kernel of this tale of emotional transformation.Nimrat Kaur portrays Ila, an underestimated, disregarded housewife who believes that she can rekindle the magic of her relationship with hubby through the art of culinary skill. She is being coached and advised on food preparation and love relationships by a neighbor called Auntie who she communicates with by screaming out the window - a bit of a heavy-handed comic distraction, but also a narrative device to fill in historical and familial stories.We see the coldness of Ila's domestic situation when her husband comes home from work, barely noticing his wife and their young child. The only prospect of contact she has with him is the daily lunchbox meals that get delivered to his place of work. Ila's fantasy that the metal canisters of various dishes, carefully and tenderly prepared, can bridge a gulf of indifference is both poignant and heartrending.The amazingly expressive actor, Irrfan Khan plays Saajan Fernandes, a widowed bureaucrat in a busy office, weeks from retiring; a man who does his job well, keeps to himself, seemingly standoffish, rarely interacting with any colleagues at work. His solitude and desolation are evident when he comes home from work, smoking on the balcony wistfully watching another family across the way responding to his intense gaze by drawing the curtains to shield the view.Saajan is the recipient of the mis-delivered lunchbox, and as the film progresses, we witness his re-emergence into society and humanity, the initial reawakening through the savory reception of Ila's lovingly cooked meals. She quickly realizes that her husband did not receive her special \"gift\", but the anonymous person who licked up every last bit of her cuisine appreciated her artistry, so she continues to send out the lunchbox, but includes scraps of paper with bits and pieces of her life slowly opening up to a sympathetic and sensitive association - one that will subtly and softly burnish both their lives.Once Saajan opens the door to his inner secret self, even if ever so carefully, another character appears \u2013 a young man, charmingly portrayed by Nawazuddin Siddiqui as Shaikh, an ambitious apprentice in the office who is being trained by Saajan to be his future replacement. Their complicated relationship is both intensely heartrending, and eloquent in the way it conveys Sajaan's growing awareness of the inequity of class distinctions in India.THE LUNCHBOX is more than light comedy. It is a gentle tale of lives inadvertently bumping into each other and careening off in distinctive directions, influencing one another by encounters that are humble and often unassuming, but reverberate, echoing permanently.",

            "content": "This 2014 Indian film is a quirky romantic tale of two very lonely and desperate people attempting to find something to live for. A psychological study of loneliness and hope, \"The Lunchbox\" masterfully questions how much an individual is willing to risk to change his or her life.Saajan Fernandes is a fifty-something civil servant on the cusp of retirement and resentful about it. Ila, a beautiful young thirty-something mother, studies cooking from television shows and from her aunt, who lives in the apartment upstairs and coaches her to improve her culinary skills in order to please her husband: the old adage about a way to a man's heart is through his stomach. The problem: it is not her husband whose heart is charmed by her cooking. Ila lovingly prepares a lunchbox for her husband, to be delivered by the complex yet typical lunch delivery system for office workers. It is mistakenly delivered to Fernandes.This begins a series of lunchbox notes as Fernandes awakens from his sleepwalking existence, and Ila begins to feel affection for someone once again. But \"The Lunchbox\" also devastatingly reveals the melancholy of entrapment with no way out. It is a missive in itself: to love regardless--and perhaps, in spite,--of age.\"Sometimes the wrong train can take you to the right station\" claims Saajan\"s friend. The ending is not a neat tying up of loose ends, and may leave some viewers frustrated. Nonetheless, this is a surprising film of depth, warmth, and character. \"The Lunchbox\" deserves to be devoured, morsel by morsel, by a wide audience!

This film is a collage of frozen portrait shots of Irrfan Khan and Nimrat Kaur portraying their characters of Frenandez and Ila respectively as they meander in their thoughts and imaginations while the life and people around them carry on as usual.The direction of Ritesh Batra brings memories of the very best Indian directors who were able to portray human relations this immaculately and at the same time can make the audience part of the storytelling.The beauty of the film is its achievement to not drive the audience to form an opinion. It lets you travel through the stories weaved in the words by the letters written by Ila and Fernandez to each other. And this makes the characters extremely relatable like we all have known or are Ila and Fernandez sometime in our lives.Life is demanding and speeds away and at this pace of life, I must have missed watching this film when it came out back in 2013. Watching it now, the day after the demise of Irrfan Khan, I can only wonder what other immortal characters he could have portrayed if he had more time. Alas, The Lunchbox will remain one of his most iconic works.The film ends with the chorus of dubbawallas singing a song and long after the film ends, the tune stays with you, like how the film has become a part of you and will stay with you.",

Here in the UK we just had the first chance to view it at the Brighton Duke of York's cinema where they laid on a special \"dabbawallah\" lunch box for all of us to take in to the viewing. Nice touch! Although the food was of the dried variety rather than Ila's tasty sweetmeats it got us all into the mood. For those of us - and count me as one of them - who has never heard of the dabbawallah system of shipping in lunch-boxes from the four corners of Mumbai's suburbs this is an eye-popping revelation. Just how do they get it right 99.99% of the time. Of course it is that 0.01% mistake that is the premise for this film and the beginnings of a poignant love story between an older man, close to retirement, and a married woman who realises her husband has been cheating on her. Although we are viewing life in Mumbai the emotions involved are ones that are universal - feelings of worthlessness, loss of siblings and parents, betrayal and loss contrasted with human hope that things will change for the better if one is prepared to take the chance.

He lives alone in Bandra and as a widower, he has no near and dear ones. He always keeps himself into a shell of reluctance. He takes lunch from the DABBAWAALA SERVICE in Mumbai city who collect lunchboxes from several places in that province and delivers to the customers. One day Saajan receives a lunchbox with different cuisines and he himself feels satisfied with eating those for the first time. Interestingly, that box has been mistakenly delivered to Saajan. That box was for Ila (Nimrat Kaur), a small-town homemaker, who prepares lunch for her husband but mistakenly delivers to Saajan. She writes a SORRY NOTE and put it inside the lunchbox. This letter, however, starts an unusual friendship between Saajan and Ila. Meanwhile,as a part of succession planning, the organization appoints Shaikh (Nawazuddin Siddique) as a trainee to Saajan who will take over his position immediately after retirement. An introvert in nature, Saajan is not comfortable with Sheikh at the beginning but soon befriends with him. The unusual relationship with Ila, close association with Sheikh and his family open a new dimension and thinking of Saajan's life.This movie considers one of the best performance of late Irrfan Khan as Saajan Fernandes. Even without delivering dialogue, his body language and eye movement were beyond any definition. He establishes a new genre of actors in Indian movie and Nawazuddin Siddique, one of the successors in this genre delivers scintillating performance. The chemistry between Irrfan and Nawaz in the office room, metro, house were remarkable. It is unfortunate that Nimrat, being a good actor, does not appear much in the silver screen. Her acting was outstanding as well.The cinematography avoided too much exaggerating typical Bollywood style captures which earns clap of the true audiences. Ritesh Batra's first big film after doing three short films proves that he has a good talent of film writing and making like Satyajit Roy.The lunchbox won 3 awards as best film, best debut director and supporting actor (Nawaz) out of 6 nominations in the 59th Idea Filmfare Awards, 2014. The Lunchbox was nominated for the Best Film Not in the English Language category of the British Academy Film Awards 2015. The film was screened at International Critics' Week at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival, and later won the Critics Week Viewers Choice Award also known as Grand Rail d'Or.

It is very much like life - sweet, funny, poignant, and eternally hopeful.There's no story to speak of; indeed what kind of a story would one weave around two main characters as simple and plain as Sajan Fernandes, a widowed claims adjuster, and Ila, a lonely housewife with no life of her own. What The Lunchbox offers us instead is a glimpse into their monotonous lives, lives that become intertwined one day, and influence each other irrevocably.Sajan (played, no, lived by the incomparable Irfan Khan) is nearing retirement, and has an ultra-perky new hire Aslam (Nawazuddin Siddiqui) to train before he retires. Gruff, lonely and monosyllabic, he has plans of moving to Nasik once he retires. His lunch-box delivery service goofs up and he gets a lunch-box meant for Ila's (Nimrit Kaur) husband. This mix-up leads to an exchange of notes between him and Ila, a correspondence that gradually becomes tender and affectionate. Both are lonely, both are hoping for someone to share their thoughts, and both are looking for escape. A twist appears when they decide to meet, and of them is unable to take this final step. This leads to something that neither of them could have anticipated - not necessarily the happy ending we wish for them, but a chance at a happy ending, perhaps not for them together, but at least individually.If my review seems curiously flat, it is because one can review a movie, not real life. And this is what The Lunchbox gives us - a glimpse into the lives of people we encounter everyday, without really seeing them. The movie offers acting of the highest order, so effortless that nothing seems out of place, nothing seems staged. Irfan Khan, Nimrit Kaur and Nawazuddin Siddiqui don't just play their characters, they actually inhabit them and make them come to life. The fast-paced and impersonal life in Mumbai has been captured to perfection, including travel on the local trains and interactions with the neighbors. Some scenes remain with you long after the movie is over, such as the awkward seduction scene with Ila and her husband, or Aslam's wedding photo scene, and pretty much every scene with Irfan Khan in it! Right after I watched the movie, I was disappointed with the not-so-clear ending; surely a movie this amazing deserved an equally amazing ending too, right? But now I am convinced that there was no other way - the ending signifies hope, a new day, a new life, new possibilities for Ila and Sajan.",

So no Oscar for India.Never mind the fact that the three stars are wonderful, the setting makes clear the poignancy and quiet desperation of their lives, and the whole story is a quiet little gem that, gasp!!, demands patience, attention, and imagination. We certainly can't ask that of audiences, can we? Hence the complaints that good wives wouldn't act that way, it ends too abruptly, etc. That's called fiction, and that's called a cliffhanger. So we can each build our own story, whether happy ending or not, although we are offered hints:The eager apprentice gets married and gets the soul-crushing job he yearned for---or does he chuck it all and start his own restaurant?The Good Wife does indeed run off with her adorable daughter to the Big Rock Candy Mountain with a five to one exchange rate and maybe starts her own restaurant.the retired civil servant organizes the local kids into a youth cricket league and makes a fortune cultivating players for Major League Baseball (we know he doesn't retire to the village after seeing that it causes arthritis.)Or maybe he joins forces with the Indian Oscar Committee to give the lunch delivery system and Oscar nomination process the same dazzling efficiency we see on display in the Government Claims Department.So then, why is he among the people he is in the last scene, going where he is going?

            "content": "While it is a pretty familiar story we have encountered before, \"The Lunchbox\" is mixed with enough spices to give it a distinctive flavor to appreciate. Vividly bringing us into its local background, it comes to us as a heartfelt tale about two people who happen to be connected with each other in an unexpected way, and it is touching to see how their respective lives are changed through their mutual relationship which may not last long.The opening scene shows a young housewife named Ila(Nimrat Kaur) going through her mundane morning routine. Her husband has already left for work, and her young daughter is soon going to leave for school, and now she has to prepare the lunch for her husband. We see each component of the lunch being prepared and then put into a stainless steel lunchbox, which is then put into a green lunch bag ready to be collected by a delivery man.While reading several articles on the movie, I came to learn that lots of lunchboxes are delivered like that in Mumbai, and it was interesting for me to get some direct glimpses on how this delivery system works. A delivery man, \"dabbawala\", collects a bunch of lunch bags along with the one from Ila's house in her neighbourhood, and then he joins other dabbawalas at the train station, who also carry many lunch bags to be delivered. After they are sent to the downtown area by train, these lunch bags immediately go through another transaction process, and they all are delivered to their respective recipients around the lunchtime.Considering the average number of lunchboxes transacted everyday in Mumbai is more than 100,000, it is not surprising that Ila's lunchbox is delivered to a wrong person by mistake. Saajan Fernandes(Irrfan Khan), a middle-aged man who is about to retire from his company where he has worked for 35 years. He is confounded to see that the lunch he receives is quite different from the ones he ordered from his usual restaurant, but, after having tasting a little of it, he quickly eats it all with satisfaction.When the lunchbox is returned to her home, Ila is happy to see its empty state, but she soon realizes there was a mistake. Her husband Rajeev(Nakul Vaid), who received Saajan's lunchbox instead, does not talk much about it when he comes home in the evening, and Ila quickly infers from his brief remark that the lunchbox was sent to a wrong person. When she prepares another lunch, she puts a note for appreciation in the lunchbox, and that is the beginning of her relationship with Saajan. It is just a small exchange of notes at first, but then they begin to write long letters to each other, and they become closer to each other as the lunchbox goes back and forth between them everyday.This is surely a common romantic promise we have seen from other films(\"Charing Cross Road 84\"(1987) came into my mind as I was watching the movie), the director/writer Ritesh Batra makes his story work even though his two main characters are mostly separated from each other in the movie. While the interactions between them are confined within the written words read by the actors, we get to know more about them as they respectively go through their daily lives, and we come to slowly sense how their lives are affected by their relationship. Frustrated with her estranged relationship with her husband, Illa is grateful to know that someone is appreciating her cooking efforts, and Saajan becomes more aware of how lonely and barren his life has been since his dear wife's death. He has lived alone in his house for years, and he felt no problem with that, but now he feels something missing in his house as interacting with a nice woman he has not yet met in person.The movie eventually leads its main characters to a certain point expected right from the budding of their relationship. Ila learns that her husband does not love her anymore, and she and Saajan see the possibility of living together somewhere as talking more with each other, but both of them are not quite sure about whether that can be possible. They have certainly felt good as sharing thoughts and feelings through their letters, but will that feeling last long even after they meet each other for the first time?Batra's screenplay wisely sidesteps melodramatic clich\u00e9s during its last act, and it also provides us warm, humorous moments as handling its two likable main characters with respect and care. Nawazuddin Siddiqui, who plays a young employee who will replace Saajan after working with him for a while, is one of the major sources of humor in the movie; he initially looks like an ingratiating puppy trying too hard to get approval, but you cannot help but like this overly eager guy as getting to know a bit more about him and his life. I also enjoyed the conversation scenes between Ila and an old neighbour living upstairs; we never see that old lady while they talk through windows, but she becomes a sort of endearing presence as she gives Ila some help and advice for cooking.The success of the movie depends a lot on its two lead actors, and their separate performances work along well with each other despite the constant physical gap between them on the screen. Irrfan Khan, a veteran Indian actor I happened to notice for the first time in Mira Nair's \"The Namesake\"(2006), conveys a slow, gradual change inside his character through his quiet, soulful performance, and Nimrat Kaur, a young lovely Indian stage actress at the beginning of her film career, is also convincing as a woman opening her eyes to another potential in her life through the accidental friendship with a stranger.",

There is another character Mr.Khan (Nawazuddin Siddiqui) who is Mr Fernandes's designed replacement. Mr.Khan is an orphan which sustains on a few pieces of fruits on lunch and an unlimited supply of positive thinking which represents striving of lower class Indians scrambling toward the middle class.The romance between the two strangers starts with the exchange of letters, because of a little glitch in the \"dabbawala system\", which invokes a little ray of hope among the lonely persons. Both Ila and Mr.Fernandes are so desperate for genuine human interaction that they find themselves sharing their innermost sentiments and philosophical thinkings. Where Ila, in a try to find happiness, decides to move to Bhutan, while Mr.Fernandes tries to find happiness in the belongings of her long gone wife.Irrfan Khan has done a wonderful acting, doing more with moments of scilence than many actrs can manage with pags of dialog. The story is touching, incredible, and a urban tale of hope in the face of disappointment. Although it takes place in Mumbai, the film style is more Hollywood than bollywood. It is somewhat predictable but is presented in a fairly standard rom-com model.",

I've heard about dabbawalas from my brother in law who marvelled at the flawless networked delivery system , and was pleasantly surprised to get a peek into the process. Though the plot is based on mixed delivery, I feel inclined to excuse the screenwriter because the mix-up triggers an interesting storyline. We get to experience a refreshing letter exchange in the era of Watsapp messages. I didn't understand why 'Ila' wrote in Hindi and Irfan corresponded in English; did love his enunciation though. The movie moves at a slow pace, with emotions speaking more than dialogues. The insecurities of a disconsolate housewife and soulless widower are unfolded one by one throughout the movie. There is nothing cinematic like drastic transformation of character, and that makes the screenplay more effective. A good watch for a leisurely afternoon.",

Climax is unusual and some may find haywire. Lunchbox follows epistolary theme which seems to be rare in Indian panorama. I heard movie getting rave reviews from all critics & appreciating for its novelty so i decided to watch it, but the movie ended by being likable fare, in between goes illogical and makes ambiguous at certain. Irrfan as a recluse nerd done a good job & Nimrat kaur as a desperate wife also done a commendable work. Nawaziddin siddique delivered a light humor by interrupting & saying 'Good morning sir' and coming with two bananas etc etc. Other supporting characters done their part deftly including aunty-ji's voice. Music didn't play vital role but BGM was soothing. Cinematography by Michael didn't opted for any gimmick & he easily captured the crowd of Mumbai.

Where you no longer feel the barrier of the screen. You are no longer watching a film, but experiencing it, empathizing with every characters' emotions and getting to know them, little by little. There were moments where I was able to anticipate certain reactions from characters because I understand them now. I can sense what they're going through and why. It's a sign of well-developed characters, and a well-told story.\"The Lunchbox\" shines in the silent moments, when there are no dialogues, but just the subtle beauty of emotions. These are the moments that prove the director's clarity of vision and the actors' dedication. Apart from certain key-moments where the leads go through a change of heart-which is presented in quite unsubtle manner in an otherwise graceful film-there is hard to find any flaw.And you know what, I don't need to find a flaw.

And in that slow pace I found the simplicity of daily life and routine of a homemaker, the 'dabba-walah's, a government worker and a trainee. Life is not always exciting, it is mundane mostly. Not every time do we get interesting twists and turns, but when we do, life gets alive again. When Mr.Fernandes finds a letter in his tiffin, the words in it start making him take note of life once again- it gives him something to hold on to in the sheer mundanity. I liked the simplicity of the story, the plot. Mrs. Deshpande's character was a favorite. You can just hear her voice while she's conversing, you don't get to see her. This is the first time that I found a character so wholesome, but without involvement of the face and facial expressions. Every time Mr.Fernandes opened and smelled the tiffin eagerly, I wanted to taste the dishes too. Every time Illa prepared a new recipe with Mrs.Despande's help, I wanted to try it too.'The Lunchbox' won over me, slowly yet completely. Worth a watch.",

            "content": "\"We are what we want to be\" - while, we have our limitations, but we can still try and get close to what we want. Not to belabor with my own biases, I think lunchbox might be one of the best examples of telling a story about routine and monotonicity of life, and where simple accidents can lead to a path on pursuit of happiness. The movie is about three characters. Mr. Fernandes - a widower, one month from retirement, social pariah, loner grumpy elderly man, who have resigned to his fate. Ila - a lonely neglected housewife, whose world revolves around her daughter, her neighborhood aunt, and her attempts to appease her husband through her food. Shaikh - soon to-be replacement of Mr. Fernandes, full of life and dreams, wants to make big in life and for whom failure is not an option. Its not hard to find a bit of all these three characters in oneself and no matter how you perceive each character at the start, but by the end, you feel for everyone in the movie. Movie moves at a slow (but perfect) pace with its main characters going through their daily routines - traveling in trains, walking to their homes, making casual conversations, cooking food, eating food and offcourse we get a glimpse of near-perfect supply chain of mumbai dabbawaalas. Things change when after mistaken delivery, Fernandes and Ila start exchanging notes, and within those few scribbled words, they fall for each other and dream of finding solace with each other. While Irrfan has made peace with his current life, Ila is trying to fix her current situation with her jerk of a husband (yes, thats how he comes across), both of them realize that they can be happy by making that leap of faith, by breaking away and starting afresh. As both characters wait for that day's note and probably thats the best part of their day - Ila treats herself with tea while reading note and Irfaan unable to wait and taking off for early lunch. At the same time,Shaikh is trying real hard to build relationship with Irrfan, and is ultimately successful in breaking that wall in Irrfan (which he guards so ostensibly) and is able to expose his soft underside. While at first, you think that Shaikh is that crooked smarty pants, who just wants to make it through, but as the movie progresses, you know that he is the one who knows to dream, who is unabashedly honest about things in his life and few things in the past, and isn't shy for asking anything. His insistence on asking Irrfan to try his \"pasandas\" and his story about his mom - all this so perfectly blends on his personality and his motto of life. Needless to say there could not have been better cast. Irrfan, I believe is the best thing to have happened to Indian cinema in last 10 to 20 years. Nawazuddin is so natural that he doesn't have to try ever so hard to blend into his character. Nimrat was a revelation, is very beautiful and plays her part perfectly. My highest praises are for Ritesh Batra, who has done unbelievable job as a first time director and I hope to see much more from him in the future. Script was extremely tight, screenplay was awesome. Director never had to try too hard to make a point or move the story - it simply flows through like poetry. Very rarely you see so many contrasting emotions in the same story - silence, loneliness, innocence, glimmer of hope, dreams, ambition, pursuit of happiness, courage to change. My two favorite scenes - when Irfaan khan says that he has a girlfriend and when asked for her name, he takes his time, thinking if she really is his girlfriend, and then smiling through his eyes, says \"Ila\". Next favorite would be when Ila's daughter waves a real long goodbye to her mom, realizing that not everything is well in her mom's world. I don't care much if it wins a big award or not, but if you love movies, this is a must watch.",

I do not by any mean say that The Lunchbox lacks that but it definitely isn't worthy of an Oscar. The movie starts decently setting the right pace. However, as it progresses, the movie become very monotonous. It becomes very predictable in few parts as well. The movie disappoints in few ways and also fails to live up to the 'Oscar' hype.However, the acting from Irfan Khan, Nawazzuddin Shah are great. The cinematography is also excellent. There are few scenes which will make you like the movie in its own simple way. In terms of acting I personally feel that Irffan Khan have given better performances (for example in Paan Singh Tomar) and Nawazzuddin have definitely done better in Gangs of Wasseypur II. Hence, the movie is nothing great in terms of pure acting. When compared to previous Oscar nominations, The Lunchbox probably falls short but still manages to touch the hearts of audiences in its own simple way.Overall the movie is good.

            "content": "The movie is about how two lonely people connect over a chance exchange of letters when the lunch box gets delivered to the wrong guy.The idea is not trite, the movie could have been impactful had it been supported by a brilliant script. if a movie's central theme is exchange of letters you expect the letters to be crisp, stimulating and insightful. the movie fails in creating that magic of words.The movie works well in creating the characters but falters in developing a tight plot..the characters of Fernandes ( Irfan Khan) and Shaikh ( Nawazuddin Siddiqui) were well written and appear very real because of outstanding performances from Irfan and Nawazuddin; Nimrit Kaur also does full justice to her role, but what made the movie lackluster was a weak plot..why will a wife walk out of her marriage and home without even once confronting her husband; why will she move to some unknown random place ( in this case Bhutan) when she has a 5 year old daughter,will she not worry about her safety, health, education etc; the escape to Bhutan would have looked logical if Ila ( Nimrit Kaur) was doing it alone, and why will a kid so young be so quiet and docile and not once disturb her mother..and lastly how can a housewife be this deep in loneliness when she has a 5 year old and a maid servant less house to look after..The relationship between Ila and her mother also couldn't create any impact, it was loosely written and even more loosely enacted by Lillette Dubey-one of the most misfit performances in recent times. Lillette can perhaps act well only when she plays herself i.e. a high society women with an affecter manner of speech; as an ordinary middle class housewife her accent was totally unjustifiable. I however liked the exchanges between Ila and her neighbor(Aunty), they had an earthy realistic touch.The climax in some places appeared too simplistic and banal-when it makes Fernandes first realize his old age after he sees Ila and then his youth when he sees a man older than him, and how the exchange of letters makes him a better, happy person; and at other places too bizarre- why would Ila walk out without once confronting her cheating husband, especially when the move also involves her daughter.The loneliness couldn't live up to the absurd.",

I am absolutely clueless in understanding the choice of Janta and finding it very challenging to ascertain the common factor among the number producing movies. Nevertheless, the movie is grossing like any other commercial, star-studded extravaganza.

            "content": "The Lunch Box a refreshing change from the usual. It features a neglected housewife and a lonely widower both linked by the now world-famous Mumbai dabbawala network. This marginalized housewife, also a mother a of a little girl, is counseled by an old caring neighbor, herself looking after an invalid husband, to reach her husband thru his stomach, following the age-old maxim.This right remedy, by an error of the 'infallible' dabbabwala network, is delivered to the wrong person. A lonely widower, somewhat misunderstood in his working and living environments, benefits from this tummy-trick. Thereafter, forgetting about the wrongness of delivery, we see a series of exchanges between the housewife and widower, bringing them closer. This is breezily cinematized by scenes of dabba packing, delivery, and suburban train travel amidst Janoba songs by the home-returning dabbawalas.Such a plot about ordinary lives, filmed with good acting, smart shoots and editing becomes an attractive film festival product. So it has won several accolades in the Europe and US.Initially the widower shies away from showing up before the yearning housewife but in the end, presumably prompted by his good natured assistant, he is seen trying to reach her.The film is one-sided in that it focuses on the lonely widower and fails to probe the housewife's life. We are shown that her husband is curt, his stomach hurt (because of the cauliflower from the wrong lunch box), and he may be having an affair. But the film maker drops him after just two exchanges between the couple. Also there is no footage for the little girl, who seems condemned to a lonelier existence.The dabba note exchanges, far from creating any awareness, alienate the wife further. The last blow is delivered by her mother confessing, on the occasion of the father's demise due to cancer, that she was never happy in her married life! This settles the issue for the young wife who goes in search of the widower and not finding him, decides to go and settle in Bhutan, where we are told, the living is cheap!The film unwittingly proves the clich\u00e9 about the way to a male's heart thru his stomach; though it's the wrong stomach, it belongs to a 'right' heart. But the widower shows no interest in the woes of the woman. It's the grub, his own needs that matter. If only the actual husband is made to eat the horrible hotel food for such a long while, he too may mature as a ripe, lonely longing male.Yet I would any day watch a film like the Lunch Box than a Bollywood.",

            "content": "I went to watch this when I was in need of a break from thinking about my life, and boy did it not disappoint! I love a good, classic romantic comedy, and even enjoy Hollywood's versions at times, but I also appreciate when movies don't stoop to overt and clich\u00e9d ploys to affect our emotions, where you believe this really could have happened somewhere. This film was wonderfully original and masterfully done. From the previews where I saw images of the streets of India and the home of Ila, I was intrigued by this other world of which I know little and wanted to experience this other culture \"first-hand\" through this film.As the preview shows, the characters begin a letter correspondence, an outdated mode even in India and even more foreign to us here- but the feelings stirred up by written communication rather than face-to-face will be relatable to many viewers. (Among young viewers especially, who hasn't smiled when you read a text from an intriguing person, or wondered gleefully how to respond?) The feelings familiar to many of us are even more amplified in these characters because of the context of their communication: a) they've never met, so the potential to fantasize about the other as an ideal soulmate is even greater; b) neither is content in their life situations, and Ila especially is revealed to be living in a great reservoir of despair that deepens when new information is revealed. Thus the context in which they're communicating is a set-up for their correspondence to draw out deep, buried desires in them, which they both believed to be dormant, but which become manifest as they start telling each other the truth about themselves. Which is delicious for us viewers.The themes conveyed are universal. Hope vs. despair. The characters shouldn't be lonely-Ila has a family, Saajan is surrounded by people-yet they are, and seldom do they show who they really are to those around them. To show their loneliness we see the world through their eyes in poignant shots- Ila looking at her husband, always looking at the husband who's always looking at his phone or the TV or anything else but her. Saajan smoking on his front porch, looking through the window at a family who's laughing, compelled yet never involved. These shots repeat over and over to show us the people and situations that stand out for these characters.Most of the film shows Ila, Saajan, Saajan's work colleague, and Ila's daughter, but a few other characters are mentioned and appear. Each character and situation plays a unique and important role in advancing the plot, with none being a waste of time. I especially loved the role of Ila's aunt.Also the film is very humorous in a subtle way you have to look for. This is as far from Seth Rogen/crass Hollywood humor as you can get. This is a low-key film with many moments of levity as well as drama as you feel for the characters and want both to find what their looking for. Overall I completely adored this film. I escaped into it, laughed quite a bit, and also felt the despair of the characters. At the end I was refreshed; it ends on a satisfyingly hopeful note. Don't miss it.",

What happens to them or the relationship they build after that, is something else, but that we could see them meet each other was very important in the story. (IMHO) In one of the final scenes we see that Saajan is riding the train with the Dabbawalas, so it would be fair to assume that he will accompany the man who was delivering Ila's lunch to him, or follow him to Ila's house, so picture this, after that: The door bell rings. Ila opens the door. It's the Dabbawala returning the lunch box. Standing next to him is Saajan. They look at each other. We see them smile. THE END. And the rest is up to you.....That's all I'm asking. 20 seconds tops.",

What attracted me was the promotion and the very idea about a story revolving around the famous 'dabbawala' of Mumbai city. However the very pretense of the story is rather hard to believe that dabbawala made a mistake in delivery. Nevertheless, it is a fictional story and hence that is acceptable. What follows is deliciously delightful, heartwarming story. The plot is plausible. The Irrfan Khan, Nimrat Kaur and Nawazuddin Siddiqui performed absolutely brilliant. One has to be a Mumbaikar to understand the finer aspects of the story. End was indeed unexpected in a very pleasant way. The very fact that each is left to their own interpretation is something amazing. Simple, elegant and above all, capturing that aspect of Mumbai life that goes unspoken. The movie is full of it's own moments. Lighter and not so lighter moments. Fine little things and yet not too artistic for a simple viewer to miss. Seldom I would rate a film 10/10.

            "review_title": "Blossoming of a lovely relationship beautifully presented on screen... Could have been more impactful...",
            "content": "Unlike most Indian movies, this movie doesn't take forever to get into the story line (while a bit of context would have been helpful I think). The movies opens with Ila (the lead lady) very passionately and devotedly packing the lunch box for her husband. All credits to the director for showing this part so beautifully to bring out the thought, effort and care she puts in into packing the box, something that is a everyday routine. That sets the tone for her side of the story - she really takes that seriously however insignificant it may be.The biggest selling point of the movie is the smooth musical flow of the relationship between the two. It's not funny, it's not boring, it's not chirpy, it's not sad, it's not titillating, it's not frustrating but it is beautiful - elegantly romantic and beautiful. The movie very gently captures the emotions and the changes in them of both lead characters. No exaggeration, no drama and nothing over the board.cinematography and music do their bits very well. In fact music is just about sounds of the world around. Very down to earth and effective. All actors have done an outstanding job!!Coming to characterization. While characterization is a very big plus point in this movie - be it of the lead characters or of the aunty (never seen on screen) living above Ila's flat or Nawazuddin's character, I feel that the director could have spent about 10 mins at the start of the film to set the context by showing the life of Irfan Khan, his lifestyle, his usual lunch, his personality, etc. Similarly on Ila' side something about how much her husband values Ila's efforts in preparing lunch, etc. and thereby setting a stage to bring out the contrasts between Irfan and Ila's husband and how Ila feels about it. Similarly showing Irfan's life before the lunchbox switch would have brought out clearly the change in his attitude and personality although there are indications in the movie to that effect. Also feel keeping Irfan all that silent or even worse, least expressive by an form was probably not that good an idea. If this movie was about how the relationship blossoms between the two and what impact it has on both of them, then it would have helped to have some or all of the above to make those transformations clear. While there are indications of such transformations and one can SEE that happening, one is unable to feel that happening. So I wouldn't call those indications subtle which could be construed positively but rather weak!As regards the climax, while it seemed open ended (although I would tend towards they coming together), I think the climax was irrelevant here for the movie already had a quasi-climax when Irfan doesn't show up at the restaurant to meet Ila and leaves a note explaining his action. The 2nd innings was pretty much to show his changed nature and perspectives and how both missed each other when they go in search of each other. It hardly matters whether they really met each other or not. The movie was always about how the relationship transpires and what it meant and did to both of them. To me the climax said it all and was befitting.However for the reasons above, the impact the movie had on me (and on many others whom I spoke to) fell short of what it otherwise could have been. Nonetheless, a feel-good, no nonsense and a romantic watch. 7/10",

There is no arc, no significant peak in the film but the simple conversation between Ila and Fernandes is enough to keep you going. The climax can be exhilarating or underwhelming. There cannot be a more fitting end to the film. \"The Lunchbox\" is a thoroughly charming film, brought alive by some great writing.

            "content": "The Lunchbox is a quiet but involving story of the accidental way in which a lonely older widower and a young Indian housewife end up exchanging daily handwritten letters for a month.The letters are deep and heartfelt with snatches of humour and lightness but right from the first letter it is clear that both the lead characters are hungry for intimate connection. Ila (Nimrat Kaur), the young housewife, is coming to terms with the fact that her marriage might be doomed to lovelessness and Mr. Fernandes (Irrfan Khan), the older widower, is originally shown to be ye typical old grump uncle with a reputation of kicking cats under moving buses, which he only encourages.Slowly though, Ila's concern for him and her deliciously made lunches which are accidentally delivered to him daily instead of her husband, wake him up from his sluggishness with which he leads his life, and we see in him a glimmer of the zest for life that may have burned out with the death of his late wife. His first name, a very romantic one at that, Saajan, is how he is referred to a couple of times later on in the film, signalling a resurgence of his youthful nature and love of life.There is also an assistant to Mr. Saajan Fernandes played beautifully by Nawazuddin Siddiqui. His puppy dog character helps our hero out by offering him friendship in addition to the possibility of romance offered by Ila. Ila herself has an old auntiji neighbour who's love and dedication for her unresponsive, comatose husband keeps Ila's belief in the concept of love from dying.All the hype that you may have heard about this movie actually surprisingly does not let you down. Consider it is a sweet old fashioned courtship that may as well have played out on Tinder. Well maybe some stories are tinda love stories instead!",

She speaks to an Aunt you never see, There are subtitles, but only part of the time.. When other characters, not the main characters, are sometimes speaking you don't know what is said. It has a few heartwarming moments, a few laughs, but descends into an utterly depressing tale of one woman's grief over her husbands affair. The ending, is absolutely horrible after suffering through the rest of the movie. So what we seem to have here is a movie, with great intentions, a solid story line and a great cultural screen to be shot on, but it seems to fall short on the actual delivery of the potential. Had there been more interaction between the two main characters, or should say ANY interaction beyond a note, then this would have jumped for me to at least a 6 or 7 star review.",

            "content": "8/10 Ramachandra (i-24541)\n02 June 2020In all love stories, a boy and girl or a man and woman with totally conflicting backgrounds are considered. They both overcome many hurdles and come together or very rarely fall apart.Several love stories have been churned in the past with lovers belonging to different castes, communities, states, borders, mother tongues, physical disabilities, economic disparities etc. etc. Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet or Kalidasa's Abhijnana Sakunthalam motivated our film makers since the times immemorial. When we tend to believe that all love stories have been exhausted, the film Lunch Box must have come as a refreshing breeze in 2013. I wondered how I missed this film so far, but when I watched it recently, I thought of putting with great reverence, my appreciation as a flower in the garland of its reputation.Ila (Sanskrit meaning earth) is a married woman with a child. Her husband does not pay any attention to her. She feels her married life has become monotonous and boring.\nSaajan (Lover) is a widower and leads a sullen and lonely life. Both Ila and Saajan exchange letters through wrongly delivered lunch box by a Mumbai Dabbahwalla.How Ila and Saajan open up their hearts and come closer to each other to rid of their drabbing lives form the rest of the story.First let us consider Ila. She is helped by a couple of characters in the film to arrive at clarity of her mind. Mrs. Deshpande, the aunty in the upstairs portion tells her that a woman can reach out to her husband through his stomach. So she cooks delicious and good food for Rajeev her husband, but is unfortunately delivered to Saajan. Ila tries to bond with Rajeev by igniting his libido. The Director's imagination is at its peak in showing Ila without duppata and Rajeev's mind ignoring the real and hovering over the virtual.What a woman expects from her husband is his time and attention when he is at home. Her heart does not really aspire for material things. And it is not happening for Ila.Ila learns that Aunty's life is like her ceiling fan, which runs continuously without fuming and fretting. Her husband needs to look at the ceiling fan always running to be out of coma. Aunty also spends most of her time listening to audio tapes.There is another character Yashvi, Ila's daughter. It is sarcastically shown that the natural instinct of a girl child is to play with inanimate objects like dolls, which in latter years may help her to manage with the husband.Both the aunty and Ila's mother nail in Ila's mind that the life of a woman for generations is always confined to the four walls of a house serving the most undeserved.For Ila, married life appears to be mere exhibitionalism. The quintessence of a family is in its emotional satisfaction. Ila symbolizing the earth has touched her limits of forbearance. She gradually draws herself close to Saajan.There are two suicides in the film. One suicide teaches Ila that a woman has to overcome her short-comings courageously instead of becoming the victim of circumstances. Another one is her own brother, a failed personality.Ila visits her mother when her father died. She could notice the degree of disgust and oppression her mother has been putting up with her father and her great relief and freedom after his death. Ila feels how fragile any woman's life can be especially when her husband and her son are not there to support. Incidentally Rajeev is reluctant to have a son and Ila felt depraved.Coming to Saajan. If one does not kill the time, the time kills. Saajan spends his lonely evenings with an old transistor radio or repeatedly watching wornout video tapes. His mind is like his old bicycle moving little forward to embrace a sweet family life, like the one seen through his neighbour's window. In the next moment, it moves backwards to dwell in its emptiness.Ila and Saajan want to meet each other. Both of them are shown waving away insects (obstacles) in front of their faces meaning they arrived at a common vision. They choose a restaurant for their meeting. On the way, Saajan meets an old woman in the electric train staring at him. Saajan felt as if his age is suitable for her. At restaurant he sees Ila and backs out without meeting her as she is too young for him. He is autumn and she is spring.Some more letters are exchanged between them through lunch box. Saajan is yet to get the necessary impetus to make further moves for Ila .Shaikh is an office-subordinate of Saajan. He and his fiancee Mehrunnisa come from diagonally opposite backgrounds like in any love story. One is an orphan and the other is having a large family. Their live-in relationship is purely based on mutual trust, companionship and masti. Wedding is a coincidence. Saajan gets a clue from his friend Shaikh that though one travels ticketless in a train, one can buy a long term pass for comfortable journey. Even the wrong train can take a man to the right station. It means 'Means' is not important... only the 'End.'Ila takes a taxi to come to Saajan's office. The taxi experiences a little jerk freeing her mind from all possible hurdles. She finds Saajan has already left for Nasik his native town. But she comes to know from Shaikh that Saajan was waiting for her at his wedding. She confidently sells of her jewellery to jump-start her life in Bhutan where she wants to amplify her happiness five times.One can see the clarity and determination in Ila, when she instructs her school going daughter 'look for the water pool in the front, take diversion, do not look back and it is your journey' ....all by facial expressions without single dialogue.Saajan boards the Nasik train. A ripe old passenger is sitting in the opposite seat. He realises that old age makes a person destitute. Saajan gets down from the train in the mid- way and comes back home. He identifies himself with a cricket ball which is batted and bowled by every one. He holds the ball tight in his hands. Now he is determined for Ila. Next day he commutes with Dabbahwallas in search of Ila's home. His actions are endorsed by sounds of 'Hail Vittal...Hail Vittal' as blessings by God Vittal.One expects both Ila and Saajan are soulmates once lost but found themselves now. But the story suddenly becomes a conundrum. Any on-screen conclusion for Ila and Saajan will be out-right rejected by conservative Indian audience as it amounts to an infatuated affair between a married woman with a child and a widower, whom she never met. The film could be branded as a revolt against social norms and could have flopped.But the Director Riteshji deftly takes an intelligent recourse to an open-ended solution and leaves it for the audience to extrapolate. This is a master stroke.Several places, one can see the Ditrector's imaginative streaks. For example, when Saajan is rectifying the accounts prepared by Shaikh, a servant is shown mopping the floor.However, even in the best restaurants, there can be a fly in a bowl of soup. For example, we feel jerky when Saajan reveals the name of his girlfriend Ila to Sheikh. Such things happen in teenage love, where the boys take pride in announcing the names of their girlfriends. Saajan is a sophisticated and matured character. He should respect and protect the identity of Ila. He should not make it explicit until both of them come to a concrete decision. The inebriated conditions of Saajan do not justify his actions.At this stage, I started analysing how Lunch Box became a super-hit film? Is it because of neat script? Or creative direction? Or amazing histrionics of Nimratji and lrrfanji? Or awesome camera work? Truly all of them went in the right proportion in this well-crafted film. But more important than all of these is, one can find real-life characters in the film...the characters who are crushed between their dreams and dreary lives. For them the film is a silent thunder. Lunch Box remains therefore a classic in the annals of Indian Films-Jai HindMy review may kindly be treated as a tribute to the extraordinary brilliant actor Late Irrfan Khanji. May his soul rest in peace.",

The story was unique and interesting (more so for me as I'd recently been to India), touching, heart warming, sad and funny all at once. It's not complicated, and there are no great surprises, but it's a solid and stylish movie. In short, I loved it.Feel free to check out my lists and ratings to see if you have a similar taste in movies to me.

            "content": "I had originally intended to watch \"Elysium\" this weekend but as the tickets were sold out I had to settle for \"The Lunchbox\" and boy was I glad I watched this. This movie is centered on the interactions of two strangers (played by Irrfan Khan and Nimrat Kaur) whose lives are changed after finding each other through the unlikeliest circumstances.Irrfan Khan brilliantly plays the character of Saajan Fernandes \u2013 a regular government employee at the end of his career, anticipating retirement. Being a widower, Saajan is lonely and anxious regarding his future. He is uncertain about retirement and has the same concerns any elderly person would have at the end of their career. This character is developed amazingly by Irrfan Khan with his exceptional acting abilities. The beautiful Nimrat Kaur takes on the character of Ila. Ila is the average house wife of Mumbai in her early thirties. She tends to the cooking and cleaning of the house while taking care of her child. She is married to a busy man and often finds herself neglected, alone and seeking companionship. Nimrat Kaur plays her role with great skill, bringing Ila to life and captivating the imagination and emotions of the viewers with her very natural, real and relatable expressions.Nawazuddin Siddiqui portrays the third important character very well, adding to the light heartedness of this movie. The course of the lives of Saajan and Ila takes a very abrupt turn when they find each other through a serendipitous exchange of lunch boxes. This fortunate accident then develops in to a conversation between the two through letters describing the events of the days of each other's lives and eventually falling in love with each other without even having met in person. The movie has been directed magnificently by Ritesh Batra. The portrayal of the lives of the two people and the lunch box is done so well that within the first few minutes you will be find yourself relating to the characters and their circumstances. The soft dialogue, highly developed characters, situational comedy - fantastically brought out by the very natural expressions of the actors and screen play will make you laugh at the characters, smile with them, feel sorry for them and fall in love with them. Irrespective of whether you are into Indian cinema or not, you should go watch this movie. There are no clich\u00e9s in this movie and no item songs. However, it will certainly appeal to the young, and the old and the anxious person inside of you. 9/10 - Loved it!",

            "content": "Today, when the technology has become so advance that has made communication so easy that people use \"Whatsapp\" even to call a friend who is sitting in the room next to their room, The lunchbox relies on the age old formula of communication through letters, and it does it so effectively that you don't complaint why the two main characters don't exchange phone numbers or why they don't use any other media to communicate.The movie looked simple from the promos, I was surprised by the hype that it has created around it, it won few awards in the film festivals and was a strong contender for Oscars nomination, all these things compelled me to watch The Lunchbox, and I must say that I happened to witness one of the most satisfying and marvelous piece of cinema ever.Illa(Nirmat Kaur) is a neglected housewife who tries different recipes to catch her husband's attention and to get the love that has lost from her life, Illa takes the help from her aunty( Bharti achreker, heard but never seen) who lives in the flat just above hers, one fine day, as luck would have it , the dabawalas who are known for their flawless and super efficient deliveries, mistakenly deliver the Lunchbox made by Illa to the desk of an old man Saajan Fernandes( Irrfan) who is on the verge of retirement he eats the lunch and sends the lunchbox back. When Illa gets to know that the Lunchbox is eaten by someone else, she puts a note in the lunchbox the next day, Fernandes replies back and then starts the journey of exchanging letters, sharing thoughts and dreams.There is another character without whom the movie would not be as brilliant as it is, and that is Shaikh(Nawazuddin Siddiqui), a trainee who is there to take the position of Fernandes after his retirement, Whenever shaikh is on screen, you are bound to laugh, we have never seen Nawazuddin in a role which demands him to make people laugh ,and the actor does it with aplomb, not for a single moment u can say that this is the same actor who has done such an intense roles in the past.But the two main characters takes it all, Irrfan has always been considered as a great actor, but this time he has achieved new heights, This is the finest performance from any actor in a long time, irrfan compels you to believe that he is one of the finest actors we have in our country, notice him when he smokes, standing alone in his balcony, he doesn't speak a single word but his eyes says it all, Take a bow sir!!! you have made a new fan. Nirmat Kaur on the other hand is a revelation, it is really hard to believe that this is her first film, she doesn't get a single expression wrong, a rare actress who can actually act.No words are enough to praise the writer-director Ritesh batra, in his maiden direction venture, Ritesh has shown a great amount of maturity in his work. Mumbai is shot and described so beautifully that made the city a character in the film, every detail is captured beautifully. Though some will find the ending a bit abrupt, but that's how it is, realistic and different, there couldn't be a better end for the script.The lunchbox is one such rare film that makes u feel proud of Indian cinema. One should see and appreciate such brilliant piece of work to encourage film makers to give us more films like this , else we would be tortured with more Dabanggs and Bodyguards.Must Watch!",

Ritesh Batra, deserves all the accolades for bringing a wonderful heartwarming story to us. Its the simplest of story told in a way in which all stories deserve to be told. Irfan Khan in this movie shows us exactly why he is regarded as a splendid actor. He brings to life the character of Fernandez. His actions, mannerisms and the way of talking reminded me of a Christian clerk from my college days, as if he himself was on the screen. The old Government files, the 'there is no respect for talent in this country', kids playing cricket in the street, requesting the ball to be given back to them, doordarshan, this all perfectly represents our India from the 90s, which itself acts as another character in this movie. Nimrat Kaur as Ila is outstanding. She emotes a sense of vulnerability, love, expectation, hopelessness and hope altogether. But the movie is memorable not only because of its acting, but mainly because of its lovely little moments. For eg. when Fernandez takes an early lunch pointing out 'time ho gaya hai' to his colleague, or when we see his palpable worry as the autodriver tells him that an unknown lady committed suicide the previous night and his eventual relief as his lunchbox arrives with its familiar aroma. Or that scene in which he opens the letter and quickly glances around to see that Sheikh is not around. Or in one of the later scenes when he casually says 'I don't know' to when his boss asks him 'How does it smell of onion, garlic, tomatoes on all these files?'. However, its Nimrat as Ila who enacts some of the best scenes of the movie. For eg. her infectious happiness when she finds that the lunchbox is completely empty and she says 'chaat lia', or when she wears her honeymoon dress showing to her hubby that she still fits into it. This scene melts the heart as you can feel her want for giving and getting love. You almost feel her helplessness as her husband ignores her. In another scene, she finds out about her husband's affair just by smelling his shirt. The Lunchbox is a movie for all times. The only reason I am rating it 9/10 rather than 10/10 because it leaves you with question marks rather than with goosebumps. Nonetheless, this movie does please you, and makes you want to write a review about it!",

And this movie again proofs my words about love----\"In love you need not to say I LOVE YOU, even the air that touches youcan tell you that You are in love\". My suggestion to all those who are in love go to the theater and just do not watch it. Go feel it. Thanks",

There was a lot of scope for improvement and more characters with a little more life would have been nice.\nPeople are talking about how realistic the movie is, let me tell you the first non realistic thing. The fact that their lunchboxees get interchanged without any reason is what? realistc? damn no. Salmans' movies have more logic than this one above.",

            "content": "A friend of mine, out of the blue, pinged me. No hi, no hello. She said \"Eii! I am bored. Suggest me names of good recent Bollywood movies.\" or something on those lines. LOL! With a bit more love, of course I was a little puzzled. What should I suggest? Except Dedh Ishqiya, there was nothing that stood out in my mind. So, I decided to do a little digging through the review archives of the Times of India. And that digging brought me to this low budget but excellently reviewed tiny movie called The Lunchbox, starring Irrfan Khan. So, I decided to watch it. See what the hype was all about.A short synopsis: The 2 main protagonists are Irrfan Khan and Nimrat Kaur. Irrfan Khan plays a widower, whose wife's death has embittered him towards life. He has been with the same office, and, possibly, the same position for 25 years. And now he wants to retire. Nimrat Kaur plays a married woman, stuck in an unhappy marriage. She doesn't know why her husband has no interest in her. So, she decides to use the usual route: the way to a man's heart is through his stomach. She is an excellent cook and cooks these beautiful meals, but she receives no acknowledgement from her husband. It's only by chance that she realizes that her lunch boxes are being delivered to the wrong man, Irrfan Khan. So, she sends in a note, with the lunch, saying \"Thank you for polishing off the lunch meant for my husband. Today, I have made his favourite dish 'paneer'. Hope you enjoy it. Ila\". She received a note back saying \"Dear Ila, the lunch was salty\". So, as revenge, she sends the next lunch filled with green chillies. LOL! And this is how they start sharing their lives, through these notes, never meeting each other. She finds out that her husband is cheating on her and wishes to go away to Bhutan. Will Irrfan Khan go with her? That's for you to find out.Sometimes, the most simple roles are the most complex to play. He is an everyday man with everyday problems, she is an everyday woman with everyday problems. What is so special in them? Nothing. And that's what makes this movie and the performances really special.Irrfan Khan plays his character of Sajan Fernandes with aplomb. He has always been a talented actor, but I would like to believe that his power punches are packed in performances where he has to play the common man. Restrained, and everyday. Something that he did in Paan Singh Tomar. And now The Lunchbox. It was endearing to watch him play this part. You immediately connect with him, because he is us and everyone around us. It's the same with Nimrat Kaur. So beautiful in her portrayal of Ila. Middle class housewife, husband works late, cooks for the family, takes care of the daughter. And she shares a special relationship with her neighbour upstairs, an old woman taking care of her vegetable of a husband. She is the everyday Indian housewife, our mother, our aunts, our grandmothers, our sisters, even our maids... A fabulous performance was given by Nawaz Siddiqui, in the supporting role. He played the subordinate who was taking over Irrfan Khan's post. An orphan, he is in love with life, and appreciates everybody. I don't wish to say more...This movie just goes to show how normal our problems are, because a lot of people are facing the same issues. But just because they are normal, it doesn't mean that they are not to be dismissed. Don't blow them out of proportion, don't dismiss them. It's okay. It also celebrates the nature of bonds. A relationship created over everyday notes and letters with a person whom you have never seen (shout out to Florian), a closeness with your neighbour who understands your pain and is a part of your family as much as you are in his/hers without having to really see them, friendship with a subordinate who is soon going to take over your job (played by the equally brilliant Nawaz Siddiqui), a mother who is forced to borrow money from her daughter (played by the amazing Lillette Dubey). It also celebrates the little things in life, funny everyday incidents that give us joy, happy memories from the forgotten tapestry of life (faded at first, but renewed with vigour), an act of human kindness from a stranger etc.. Things that make us go on.I don't wish to reveal everything because it might get over-hyped for you. So, watch it and appreciate it the way I do.It is movies like these that keep my hopes alive in the otherwise gut churning regular Bollywood crap. It seems that the Renaissance Bollywood was going through a couple of years ago, where people were experimenting and coming out with more realistic movies, has died again. I blame this on Salman Khan's Dabangg. The Indian audience, of course, decided to regress and such movies barely see the light in India. We have to rely on the International audience to appreciate the art of Indian cinema.",

I give below some thoughts on areas where a little refinement would have been welcome:The end could have been a bit more defined. They could have shown the couple walking towards each other; and left the rest to our imagination.Secondly, the Director could have introduced a few more shots depicting the dull married life of Ila, in between the repeated episodes of the lunch box journeying from home to office and back. Thirdly, it is highly improbable that a husband who used to get regular tasty food made by his caring wife, does not notice anything amiss when he now starts getting drab food in someone else's container everyday. Some correction required here.The movie has just missed the selection as India's entry for the Oscars. I feel that even if it had been selected, it might not have clicked at the Oscars, because the movie essentially portrays the Mumbai ethos - the life and values of a typical middle class family in a Mumbai suburb, the 'Dabbawala' phenomenon, travails of commuting to workplace on Mumbai suburban railway, etc. Leave alone Western audiences, these subtle aspects would have been lost even on a non-Mumbai audience. The West, in any case, would have wondered why Ila had to continue suffering a dull life with an indifferent husband; women out there wouldn't have given a second thought on deserting such a husband and finding a new one! Having said all these, I still consider 'The Lunchbox' as an outstanding movie, in comparison to the usual formula-based blockbusters from Bollywood.\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"",

Suddenly I felt like watching \"The Lunchbox\". I sat to watch, as there was nothing else to do and I was not feeling sleepy as well. Hands down, it is the best film I have watched in this quarantine. What's that I liked in the film? What to say, is it those little moments, where she and he both are disturbed by mosquitoes, or where she writes in the letter that she found a new recipe, and then he says \"excellent\" and more of such brilliant flips. Nawazuddin, he was a great to watch. During shooting of his film Tarantino always watches his actors act and he jumps with joy seeing their acting. I felt a glimpse of how he might have felt everytime, seeing Nawazuddin's acting. And the other interesting thing that we never get to see the aunty living in the flat. And when I saw the Climax, I was dumbfounded, not really getting what happened. I couldn't move from my seat, then again I rewached the train scene shown earlier in the film, where all the tiffin boxes are carried back to their houses, and he is sitting in that train, going to meet her. I was bit relaxed, knowing that they finally are coming together. To check whether I was correct or not, I decided to watch it's ending explanation on youtube. I found the video where the director himself was talking about the ending, where he is says even he don't know what happens to them, but he told someone's interpretation of the climax. There were other videos of the ending explanation, but I decided not to watch. Knowing even the director himself doesn't want to know the ending, what will I do knowing it?",

It is the story of a suburban housewife, deeply alone. It is the story of meeting via eating. It is a love-story - and a love-letter to Mumbai, to trains that go dhak-dhak, to dabbawalas and rain, to love and life, sugar and spice, the despair and hope that mark every heart.movieSaajan Fernandes (Irrfan) is an accountant. His wife having died, the childless Saajan is a cold, prickly grouch avoided by all. One day, a lunchbox prepared by Ila (Nimrat) for her husband somehow reaches Saajan instead. He devours her delicacies, the empty box returned evidence of his enjoyment. Annoyed by the stranger's lack of thanks, Ila sends him another lunchbox with a sarcastic note - he responds. Suddenly, the two are writing daily, sharing jokes, fears, passions for keema and kadhi - then, a desire to meet.This movie is held together by delicate performances. Irrfan leads the way, underplayed, yet lasting, like a cardamom between your lips. With moments like Fernandes catching himself in a street painter's sketch, Irrfan shows an ordinary life with extraordinary deftness, resurrecting that childhood uncle, who, begged to return your ball, would snarl, \"Do I look like your servant?\"Irrfan is matched by Nimrat's Ila, soft as a sandesh, but with a mysterious, molten heart. Quiet moments, like Nimrat's expression when she smells the world on her husband's shirts, catch you. Ila's story, housewives living for husbands who switch off, is beautifully conveyed. The two are ably supported by chirpy, pesky Shaikh (Nawazuddin), Saajan's trainee, chopping vegetables on office files, melting the final barriers to Fernandes' frozen .",

            "content": "\"Jo Harvard wala aya tha, wo log yeh bombai mein tiffin dekha, bola koi tiffinwala galat nahi hua, aur aap bolte hai galat hua?\"This is what the dabbawala has to say to Ila. He has his reasons: the lunch delivery system in the city almost never fails. Yet that tiny percentage, that little space, is where Ila and Sajan find each other.Loneliness is silent but loud. We see it in Sajan standing in the trains, or when he stares longingly from his balcony at the dinner table next door. We see it in Ila's cleaning of the lunch bag to the tee - everything about it had to be perfect. We also see it in Deshpande aunty and Ila's mother - two women with ailing husbands to look after. There is an emptiness no one knows what to do with. And then, as if a conspiracy, food ends up at the wrong address. Like \"the wrong train\" leading to \"the right destination\", the protagonists have some hope to hold on to. Besides Ila and Sajan, food is what keeps Aunty busy, and food is also, interestingly, what Ila's mother wants after her confession that caring for her husband was more a burden than it was love.The letters tell Ila and Sajan that there's a way to be happy again. That it was okay to be excited about lunch before time, or to lie to your cooking partner, because the letters tapped into a space that was personal. Maybe it worked because it's easier to talk to a stranger about things you have no one to talk to.Even Shaikh, the chirpy new recruit, is a beautiful interlude. Maybe Sajan goes on to like him because he is a reflection of youth, of hope. Of love that he has for his dead wife, a time he would like to revisit. When he goes to his wedding, he's also his guardian. Sajan, guardian - they seem to rhyme.The film paints a realistic portrait of middle-class life. Can't say about Mumbai but the local trains, the drudgery of public transport, the livelihood are very relatable. Even as an epistolary film, a lot happens in pauses. What more can I say about Irrfan's eyes that did most of the acting for him? He has left a gaping hole no one can fill.So, do they meet? Does Sajan travel to Bhutan with Ila, where they hope to find peace? Do they end up together? We're left to make up our own answers. I believe they do go there, but maybe they aren't partners. Maybe both helped the other when help was needed, and that was it. Not every one is meant to stay forever; not every love is meant for us to grow a family with. Some people, some experiences, you hold them close to your heart for being the magic you needed.",

It's the gentleness in the dialogues of the movie that you can't let go unnoticed.

This tale of dabba delivery gone wrong hits all the right notes, and this tale simply awes you with the 3 characters and their superb acting, and this one simply rides on Ritesh Batra's fine direction, a simple yet powerful script, and Irrfan Khan's timeless portrayal of the character. Though the tagline says \"can you fall in love with a person you have never met\", I would say there is much more to this movie. Its about the thin and fine aspects of life which we really don't give much importance to, its about sharing those aspects with a person to fill up a life full of void and emptiness. Scenes where Ila writes to Saajan Fernandes about a woman's suicide with her kid, or scenes where Saajan Fernandes watches the TV shows over and over again which his wife used to watch and laugh at the same jokes every time. Or scenes where Saajan Fernandes watches a family having dinner from his balcony every single day. I must say his (Irrfan Khan) facial expressions does all the talking, fact that this character who's on the verge of his retirement, is lonely and talks so less. Ila played by Nimrat Kaur(the dairy milk silk girl) plays a character who is graceful, ,sensuous and yet so vulnerable . A delight to watch, amazing debut! And there's Shaikh played by Nawazuddin Siddiqui, and I love every single moment he comes on the screen, and so is the amazing portrayal of the character. You put Irrfan Khan & Nawazuddin Siddiqui in a single frame, and you just watch it with awe. You watch Nimrat Kaur conversating with \"aunty\" from her kitchen and reading all those letters, a smile comes to your face every single time (with that marathi accent in Hindi). Its a tale of sumptuous delicacies blended with human emotions with a tingle of smile on your face. Wrapping up the tale in just 100 odd minutes is a must watch, and a movie to put in to your bucket list for all those who haven't.",

            "content": "This movie for me is the definition of 'subtle'. From the start to finish the subtle remarks, the blend of innocence and maturity through fortuitous exchange of a lunch box, the betrayal faced by Ila and the insecurities of old age in Sajan and finally, the journey to finding themselves through one another was what I take with me as an audience. The part that is permanently etched in my memory is when she writes that Bhutan is a happy country and she will run away with her daughter to get away from her cheating husband. While, he replies that he'd like to go along with her and her innocent reply to which was, \"How can you come with us when I don't even know your name\" and the smile that blooms on Sajan's face is remarkable.There was not just one but many subtle messages throughout the movie. I am glad I caught it all; Ila smelling her husband's shirt to know that he is having an affair,from the shooing flies at the same instant while Sajan is eating Bananas and Ila is reading the letter in the kitchen, the expression of anger in more spicy food, to Sajan movie title track playing at their respective places, hearing about the lady who commits suicide with a daughter, to the dialogue \"Sometimes even the wrong train gets you to the right destination\" I absolutely loved the conclusion of the movie. My friend was agitated because to her it was incomplete, to her she wanted it to be a love story with a positive end where they run away and are happily ever after. But to me, the end was perfect. I don't look at it as incomplete but rather as an on going tale. It left me with this beautiful mysterious feeling which I regard as 'depth'. I believe that they had to come across one another to evolve into strong characters. Ila needed to take the step of running away to Bhutan and Sajan needed to get over his mundane old life style to begin experiences little little joys of life.I say the movie was wonderfully shot, the command of the language by the actors, the set and the pace with which the movie unfolded only captivated its audience deeper into the story.I loved the inclusion of humour through certain instances like, \"things aren't as bad as they seem\" - when Sajan was on the local train and thought the old lady was sexually invading him while it was only someone's briefcase. I couldn't stop laughing for so long! Three amazing actors: Irrfan Khan, Nawazuddin Siddiqui and Nimrat Kaur. The progression of Sajan from the start of the movie to the end was phenomenal. I felt as though I am witnessing a transformation happen in front of my eyes and I could see the attraction/romance take a toll on the character. The only other Indian actor who I believe could pull this off would be Nasirruddin Shah.The character of innocent yet trying to be clever Desi, making a living in a fast paced city was well portrayed by Nawazuddin Siddique but I do believe this role has similar tone to it like the one in Gangs of Wassaypur. I wonder with superficial requirements in Indian Cinema would anybody else take the courage to give him any other roles than playing the 'common man'.Nimrat Kaur played the house wife very close to reality; Low make-up to ordinary Indian dressing to the command on language and the body language like while she sat on the tool to sniff clothes to put them for washing and the mannerism with which she sat on the dinning table folding her legs on the chair and sipping tea in a small glass cup and also reading the letter.Though my favourite character was Mrs. Deshpande!! A woman whose voice added so much humour to the movie.I wouldn't change anything about this movie because I like it as it is. And as an audience such movies make me believe in that form of creativity that is not dark but deep.",
